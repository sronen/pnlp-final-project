emotional range salon works innocuous charm symphonies tremendous depth power grandeur works variations rococo theme employ poised classical form reminiscent century composers mozart composer whose work compositions little russian symphony opera vakula smith flirt musical practices akin five especially use folk song works last three symphonies employ personal musical idiom facilitated intense emotional expression compositional style melody american music critic journalist harold schonberg wrote tchaikovsky sweet inexhaustible supersensuous fund melody feature ensured music continued success audiences british musicologist david brown named italian cantilena possible influence tchaikovsky characteristic melodies noting themes expressively full tend unwind clear periodic structure disguised expansiveness individual phrase sequential extension may prolonged love theme romeo juliet best-known example kind melody brown mentions composer typical tchaikovsky complete range melodic styles wide compositions sometimes used western-style melodies sometimes original melodies written style russian folk sometimes used actual folk songs british musicologist john warrack wrote obsessive thirds russian folk-song permeate tchaikovsky must also time haunted interval falling fourth strongly invention early symphonies always prominently placed melodies acting emotional rather implying harmonic progression brown observed another practice derived russian folk song think terms foreground projection background outline one example tchaikovsky use center oboe melody slow movement first symphony starting point another theme another love theme dominates central portion symphonic poem francesca rimini turns back unfolding new pattern old shape unfortunately brown points tchaikovsky melodic gift could also become worst enemy two ways first due ethnic heritage like majority russian composers tchaikovsky possessed penchant melody however unlike western themes ones russian composers wrote tended even self-contained russian folk songs even written broad multi-phrase structures tchaikovsky tended brown says typical russian creativity functioned mindset stasis repetition rather one progress ongoing development dominated western creative thought technical level made modulating new key introduce contrasting second foreign concept exist russian difficult second way melody worked tchaikovsky one shared majority classical composers era romantic-age developments widening expressive timbral harmonic ranges music led new much significant place melody occupied haydn mozart beethoven however melodies composers wrote accommodate qualities regular symmetrical melodic shapes worked well sonata form warrack points complete independent melodies tchaikovsky friend former pupil sergei taneyev observed cannot easily combined used structural elements composer like tchaikovsky could taneyev says even modifying generate tension maintain interest generally satisfy listeners essentially repeat cooper maintins romantics never natural symphonists harmony harmony potential trap tchaikovsky according brown russian creativity revolved around inertia explains plays novels operas essentially sequence self-enclosed tableaux western harmony study motion propelling music larger scale giving shapemodulation shifting one key another driving principle harmony sonata form primary western large-scale musical structure since middle century modulation maintained harmonic interest extended time-scale provided clear contrast musical themes showed themes related principles part tchaikovsky studies saint petersburg conservatory put practice without sacrificing individuality brown states potentially great challenge factor may helped flair harmony astonished rudolph tchaikovsky music tutor time school jurisprudence flair added conservatory studies may aided tchaikovsky employing varied range harmony music western harmonic textural practices first two string quartets use whole tone scale center finale second symphony practice typically used five tchaikovsky often follows european practice harmonic progression according brown using circle fifths undergird love theme romeo juliet occasionally though falls back russian practice romeo oscillating times passages almost static harmony others fundamental bass movement solidly sometimes swiftly fifths development section romeo lets harmony rock two chords one held note common practice taken glinka opera ruslan lyudmila brown says became minor fingerprint russian harmony russian features include liberal use pedal points employment chromaticism decorative counterpoint abrasive counterfoil melody rhythm rhythmically tchaikovsky sometimes experiments unusual meters often uses firm regular meter practice serves well dance music times rhythms become pronounced enough become main expressive agent music also become means found typically russian folk music simulating movement progression large-scale symphonic synthetic propulsion brown phrases substitutes momentum would created strict sonata form interaction melodic motivic elements interaction generally take place russian music please see repetition structure tchaikovsky struggled sonata form principle organic growth interplay musical themes alien russian practice placed themes series self-contained sections interaction clear transition one section next without organic growth building large-scale evolving musical structure would daunting impossible sonata form take account heightened emotional statements many romantic-era composers inclined make since designed operate logical intellectual level emotive one according brown musicologists hans keller daniel zhitomirsky tchaikovsky found solution large-scale structure composing fourth symphony sidestepping thematic interaction keep sonata form outline zhitomirsky phrases containing two contrasting themes within outline focus centered periodic alternation juxtaposition instead offering brown calls rich well-ordered argument tchaikovsky integrates keller calls new violent contrasts musical themes keys harmonies placing blocks dissimilar tonal thematic material alongside one another block containing main theme zhitomirsky writes alternates one containing second theme former steadily enlivened reiteration result contrast two blocks consistently sharpened themes explains demarcated distinct contrast musical material fact theme usually constitutes independent structurally complete episode important part process keller states thematic harmonic contrasts allowed coincide mozart writes evidently preceded tchaikovsky tactic modulatory delay may helped give tchaikovsky impetus attempting although tchaikovsky develops form contrast unprecedented scale keller offers second theme first movement fourth symphony example process works sonata form writes first subject enters tonic second subject follows contrasting related key harmonically tension occurs music listener pulled away tonic tchaikovsky increases contrasts themes one hand keys ups ante introducing second theme key unrelated first theme delaying transition expected key first movement

works including dance preludes clearly show influence polish folk music harmonically melodically part art transforming folk music rather quoting exactly cases folk music unrecognisable without careful analysis example concerto orchestra developed techniques mature compositions stopped using folk material explicitly although influence remained subtle features end said could compose wished composed able change direction said simply interested folk also dissatisfied composing post-tonal composing first symphony felt cul-de-sac pitch organisation five songs muzyka introduced brand twelve-tone music marking departure explicit use folk music twelve-tone technique allowed build harmony melody specific intervals muzyka augmented fourths system also gave means write dense chords without resorting tone clusters enabled build towards dense chords often include twelve notes chromatic climactic moments twelve-note techniques thus completely different conception arnold schoenberg tone-row system although muzyka happen based tone row twelve-note intervallic technique genesis earlier works symphony paganini variations aleatory technique although muzyka internationally acclaimed new
