described musical composition search listener think feel way called fishing soul complete list composition chronological order found polish music center folk influence work including dance prelude clearly show influence polish folk music harmonically melodically part art transforming folk music rather quoting exactly case folk music unrecognisable without careful analysis example concerto orchestra developed technique mature composition stopped using folk material explicitly although influence remained subtle feature end said could compose wished composed able change direction said simply interested folk also dissatisfied composing post-tonal composing first symphony felt cul-de-sac pitch organisation five song muzyka introduced brand twelve-tone music marking departure explicit use folk music twelve-tone technique allowed build harmony melody specific interval muzyka augmented fourth system also gave mean write dense chord without resorting tone cluster enabled build towards dense chord often include twelve note chromatic climactic moment twelve-note technique thus completely different conception arnold schoenberg tone-row system although muzyka happen based tone row twelve-note intervallic technique genesis earlier work symphony paganini variation aleatory technique although muzyka internationally acclaimed new harmonic technique led something crisis still could
