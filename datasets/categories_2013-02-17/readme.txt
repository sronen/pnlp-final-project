File naming convention:
<lang>-<classification><fold>-<content>
e.g., en-31-topic-names means English topic names for the 3rd classification, in its 1st fold 

Strucutre:
topic-keys: each file is a list of top 100 words per identified topic
topic-names: each file maps topic numbers to topic names. The orig/ subfolder contains my on-the-fly classification - a little more detailed.
topic-prop: proportions of topics for each article, topics identified by number
topic-prop-names: proportions of topics for each article, topics identified by name

Notes:
1) en-21, topic 24, which combines Literature and Media (mostly animation) was ingnored.
2) en-20, topic 9, in which architecture is bundled with Science and not with Art, was ignored.
3) es-12, topics 23,29 and es-22 topic 27: classified as Personal despite some doubts (words like Cielo (=sky), colors, etc.). There were other occurences as well.
4) en-21 topic 22: ignored - balanced combination of business and technology.
5) en-30 topic 21: classified as "Warfare"; moslty about vehicles (aircraft, ships, cars) for what seems like military use.
