File naming convention:
<lang>-<classification><fold>-<content>
e.g., en-31-topic-names means English topic names for the 3rd classification, in its 1st fold 

Strucutre:
topic-keys: each file is a list of top 100 words per identified topic
topic-names: each file maps topic numbers to topic names. The orig/ subfolder contains my on-the-fly classification - a little more detailed.
topic-prop: proportions of topics for each article, topics identified by number
topic-prop-names: proportions of topics for each article, topics identified by name

Notes:
1) In en-21, topic 24, which combines Literature and Media (mostly animation) was ingnored.
2) In en-20, topic 9, which classified architecture with Science and not with Art, was ignored.
