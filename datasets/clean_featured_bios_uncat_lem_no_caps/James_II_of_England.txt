attempt restore heir made claim passed younger brother last legitimate descendant relative publicly acknowledged claim since death analysis somewhat revised since historian led cast cruel absolutist reign tyranny approached insanity scholar greatnephew balanced still characterized tyrant attempt religious tolerance fraud reign aberration course history wrote obviously political religious bigot although never devoid vein patriotic sentiment conversion church made emancipation fellowcatholics first instance recovery catholicism second governing object policy broke tradition casting honorable man true advocate freedom conscience enemy men small clique great fortune destroyed ancient monarchy observed concluded church sole authoritative voice earth thenceforward stood firm surrender single occasion contemplated least compromise word would modify impression made began reconsider motif granting religious toleration still taking note autocratic rule historian moved away school thought preached continuous march progress democracy contending history story human being individual well class mass cast men ideal well human weakness writing accepted claim absolutism argued main concern secure religious liberty civil equality absolutist method essentially mean end wrote new genuinely committed religious toleration also sought increase power crown added unlike government autocratic
