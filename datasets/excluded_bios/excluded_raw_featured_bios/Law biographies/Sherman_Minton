'''Sherman''' &quot;'''Shay'''&quot; '''Minton''' (October 20, 1890&amp;nbsp;– April 9, 1965) was a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] from [[Indiana]] and an [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Associate Justice]] of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]].

After attending college and law school, he served as a [[Captain (U.S. Army)|captain]] in [[World War I]], following which he launched a legal and political career. In 1930, after multiple failed election attempts, and serving as a regional leader in the [[American Legion]], he became a utility commissioner under the administration of [[Governor of Indiana|Indiana Governor]] [[Paul V. McNutt]]. Four years later, Minton was elected to the United States Senate. During the campaign, he defended [[New Deal]] legislation in a series of addresses in which he suggested it was not necessary to uphold the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] during the [[Great Depression]] crisis. Minton's campaign was denounced by his political opponents, and he received more widespread criticism for an address that became known as the &quot;You Cannot Eat the Constitution&quot; speech. As part of the [[New Deal Coalition]], the fiercely partisan Minton championed [[President of the United States|President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s unsuccessful [[court packing]] plans in the Senate and became one of his top Senate allies.

After Minton failed in his 1940 Senate re-election bid, Roosevelt appointed him as a judge to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit]]. After Roosevelt's death, President [[Harry S. Truman|Harry Truman]], who had developed a close friendship with Minton during their time together in the Senate, nominated him to the Supreme Court.  He was confirmed by the Senate on 4 Oct 1949, by a vote of 48 to 16, 15 Republicans and one Democrat ([[Harry Flood Byrd]] of Virginia) voting against him. He served on the Supreme Court for seven years. An advocate of [[judicial restraint]], Minton was a regular supporter of the majority opinions during his early years on the Court; he became a [[dissenting opinion|regular dissenter]] after President [[Dwight Eisenhower]]'s appointees altered the Bench's composition. In 1956, poor health forced Minton's retirement, after which he traveled and lectured until his death in 1965.

Historians note the unusual contrast between his role as a partisan liberal Senator and his role as a conservative jurist. They attribute his shift in position as a reaction to the relationship between the New Deal senators and the conservative 1930s Court, which ruled much of the New Deal legislation unconstitutional. When Minton became a Supreme Court Justice, the Senate had become more conservative and the Court more activist, causing him to support conservative minority positions. As a Justice, Minton frequently played the role of peace-maker and consensus builder during a period when the Court was riven with feuds. He generally ruled in favor of order over freedom as a result of his broad interpretation of governmental powers. These rulings and their limited impact lead some historians to have a negative opinion of his judicial record. Other historians point out Minton's strong commitment to his judicial principles as a valuable attribute. In 1962, the [[Sherman Minton Bridge]] in southern Indiana&lt;ref group=upper-alpha&gt;On September 9, 2011, the bridge was closed down by the [[List of Governors of Indiana|49th and current]] [[Governor of Indiana|Governor]] [[Mitch Daniels]] after construction crews found cracks in the main load bearing structural element. {{cite web|url=http://www.wdrb.com/story/15429799/sherman-minton-bridge-shut-down|title = Sherman Minton bridge shut down; crack found in bridge |date =September 9, 2011 |publisher=[[WDRB]]|location=[[Louisville, Kentucky]]|archiveurl= |archivedate=| deadurl=|accessdate=September 9, 2011}} {{cite web|url = http://www.courier-journal.com/article/20110909/NEWS01/309090090/Sherman-Minton-Bridge-closed-indefinitely-due-structural-cracks?odyssey=mod%7Cmostcom |title = Sherman Minton Bridge closed indefinitely due to structural cracks |date= September 9, 2011|publisher=''[[The Courier-Journal]]'' |location=Louisville, KY |archiveurl= |archivedate = |deadurl= |accessdate =September 11, 2011}} {{cite news |url=http://start.toshiba.com/news/read.php?rip_id=%3CD9PN1CQ03%40news.ap.org%3E&amp;ps=1011&amp;page=2|title=Traffic nightmare over closed Ohio River bridge |first1=Brett |last1=Barrouquere |first2=Janet |last2=Cappiello |publisher=[[Associated Press]] |date=September 12, 2011 |accessdate=September 12, 2011}} Five to seven cracks have been discovered welded areas in a load-bearing steel beam. &quot;The fissures were discovered in a type of steel frequently used in the 1950s and 1960s that is now known to be susceptible to cracking. ...&quot; Repairs are expected to cost $20 million dollars and take six months. {{cite news |url=http://www.courier-journal.com/article/20110930/EXTRAS18/309300057/Sherman-Minton-Bridge-repairs-take-six-months-cost-20M |title=Sherman Minton Bridge repairs to take six months, cost $20M |publisher=''The Courier-Journal'' |date=October 1, 2011 |accessdate=October 1, 2011}} {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Minton-Capehart Federal Building in [[Indianapolis]] were named in his honor.

==Early life==
===Family and background===
[[File:Boyhood home of Sherman Minton.jpg|alt=A white two-story house|thumb|right|Minton's birthplace and boyhood home]]
Sherman Minton was born on October 20, 1890, to John Evan and Emma Livers Minton in their [[Georgetown, Floyd County, Indiana|Georgetown]], [[Indiana]], home.&lt;ref&gt;Radcliff, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; He was the third of the family's five children and was nicknamed Shay because of his younger brother's inability to properly pronounce &quot;Sherman&quot;.&lt;ref name = c431&gt;Cushman, p. 431&lt;/ref&gt; Minton's paternal grandfather, Jonathan Minton, was killed during the [[American Civil War]] and his father grew up on his own. Minton's parents married in 1883.&lt;ref&gt;Gugin (1997), p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Radcliff, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

Minton received his basic education in a two-room schoolhouse in Georgetown, which he attended through eighth grade.&lt;ref&gt;Gugin (1997), p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Radcliff, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; He was exposed to politics from an early age; his father took him to several political rallies, including an 1895 speech by [[US Democrat|Democratic Party]] leader [[William Jennings Bryan]].&lt;ref&gt;Radcliff, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; His father was a day laborer for the [[Air Line Railroad|New Albany and St. Louis Air Line Railway]]. In 1898, he became disabled when he suffered [[heat stroke]] while working. His condition meant he could not work; the family became impoverished and had to subsist on the limited yield of their small farm.&lt;ref&gt;Gugin (1997), p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; Minton's mother developed breast cancer in 1899. A traveling doctor attempted to remove her tumors in April 1900, performing the operation with her laid on the family dinner table, but she died during the procedure. The death was an emotional blow to Minton; thereafter, he refused to attend church and spoke against God, whom he blamed for his mother's death.&lt;ref name = g40&gt;Gugin (1997), p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; Minton's father married Sarah Montague on December 3, 1901.&lt;ref&gt;Radcliff, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

As Minton grew older, he was frequently in trouble with the people in his neighborhood. In 1904, he was arrested for disregarding a town ordinance forbidding bicyclists to ride on the sidewalk. He was taken before a [[justice of the peace]] and fined three dollars, an incident he later credited with changing his outlook on life and sparking his desire to become a lawyer.&lt;ref&gt;Gugin (1997), p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; To accomplish that goal, and continue supporting his family, he traveled with his older brother Herbert to [[Fort Worth, Texas]], to take a job at the [[Swift and Company]] meat packing plant. His father and younger siblings soon joined him in Texas after the two brothers' income was able to cover their expenses. After saving enough money to help establish the family in a new home, Minton returned to Indiana to attend high school, leaving his family in Texas.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gugin (1997), p. 43&quot;&gt;Gugin (1997), p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
Minton started at Edwardsville High School in 1905, aged fourteen. The following year the school was consolidated with nearby [[New Albany High School (Indiana)|New Albany High School]]. There, he participated in the football, baseball, and track teams. He founded the school's first debate club, the Wranglers, which won several awards. He worked in a local arcade, and during summer vacations returned to Fort Worth to work at the Swift plant.&lt;ref&gt;Gugin (1997), p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; He was briefly expelled from school after committing a prank in February 1908. &lt;ref group=upper-alpha&gt;Minton was dating a girl who was participating in singing competition at the school. While her other competitors were singing Minton shouted &quot;Hurrah for our side&quot; from his seat. After doing so repeatedly a teacher discovered from whom the exclamation was coming and suspended him from the school. (see: Radcliff, p. 16)&lt;/ref&gt; The school was under the guidance of the innovative Superintendent [[Charles Allen Prosser]], who only let Minton return after he formally apologized before the entire school a week later.&lt;ref&gt;Radcliff, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; Minton began dating Gertrude Gurtz in his senior year, and the two remained in regular correspondence after he left for college.&lt;ref&gt;Gugin (1997), p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated high school at the top of his class in 1910.&lt;ref&gt;Gugin (1997), p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Radcliff, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

Minton was intent on attending college; during the summer of 1910, he took a job as a Swift Company salesman in the Fort Worth area to help pay his way. He returned to Indiana and enrolled at [[Indiana University]] in September 1911,&lt;ref&gt;Gugin (1997), p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; taking enough classes to complete his first three years of courses in two years. Despite the heavy workload, he joined the school's baseball and debate teams, and participated in the campus' Jackson Club, an organization for Democrats. His college years were formative and had significant influence on his future political career. He became friends with future [[Governor of Indiana]] [[Paul V. McNutt]], future presidential candidate [[Wendell L. Willkie]], and several other men who later became influential in the state.&lt;ref name=&quot;SCHistorical&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20100730095852/http://www.supremecourthistory.org/history/supremecourthistory_history_assoc_074minton.htm|publisher=Supreme Court Historical Society|title= Timeline of the Court, Sherman Minton|accessdate=April 26, 2010|comment=At the Internet Archives}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gugin (1997), p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref group=upper-alpha&gt; [[Wendell Wilkie]] was also in the debating club, and Minton and Wilkie debated each other on several occasions. (see: Radcliff, p. 20)&lt;/ref&gt; During his second year he ran out of money, but could not return to Texas to earn more because of his class schedule. He lodged in the [[Phi Delta Theta]] (ΦΔΘ) international [[Fraternities and sororities|fraternity]] house and subsisted mostly on wild berries, leftover bread from the cafeteria and free milk. He completed undergraduate school at the top of his class in 1913 and moved to Benjamin Harrison School of Law, a predecessor of the [[Indiana University Robert H. McKinney School of Law]].&lt;ref&gt;Gugin (1997), p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Radcliff, pp. 12–13&lt;/ref&gt;

Minton's placement at the top of his class entitled him to serve as librarian at the legal college. The position paid a fair salary and allowed him to live more comfortably for his last two years of school. He graduated from law school in 1915, again at the top of his class, and won a one-year scholarship to take post-graduate courses at [[Yale Law School|Yale]]. There, he focused on studying [[constitutional law]] and attended the regular lectures of former President of the United States and future [[Chief Justice of the United States]] [[William Howard Taft]]. Taft remarked that Minton's post-graduate thesis was among the best he had ever read.&lt;ref&gt;Gugin (1997), p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; Minton continued to improve his oratory skills and continued debating at Yale; he won the Wayland Club prize for extemporaneous public speaking, and helped organize the university’s legal aid society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=pXbYITw4ZesC&amp;pg=PA624&amp;lpg=PA624|author=Kleber, John|title=The encyclopedia of Louisville|year= 2000|location= Louisville|publisher=[[University Press of Kentucky]]|page =624|isbn=0-8131-2100-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He earned a post-graduate masters degree from Yale in 1916.&lt;ref name=&quot;SCHistorical&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Radcliff, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal career and WWI===
In May 1916, Minton returned to New Albany, where he opened a law practice and renewed his relationship with Gurtz.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gugin (1997), p. 53&quot;&gt;Gugin (1997), p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; He took several cases and gained experience working [[pro bono]] to assist the local county prosecutor. He joined the [[Chautauqua]] [[Lyceum|Lecture Circuit]], and traveled to several cities to give speeches. During one lecture circuit, he met William Jennings Bryan. The three-time Presidential candidate advised the young [[Hoosier]] about politics, inspiring him to consider a career in public life.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gugin (1997), p. 53&quot;/&gt;

In 1917, just after the United States declared war on Germany and entered World War I, Minton enlisted in the [[United States Army]]. He took an officers training course at [[Fort Benjamin Harrison]] in hope of earning a commission, but was not among the those chosen to become an officer. In August he was granted a brief leave of absence; he returned to New Albany, where he married Gurtz on August 11. &lt;ref group=upper-alpha&gt; Gertrude Gurtz (February 2, 1893&amp;nbsp;– June 4, 1982) was a native of [[Harrison County, Indiana|Harrison County]]. She graduated from [[Saint Mary-of-the-Woods College|St. Mary's of the Woods]] in 1911 and was working as a school teacher at the time of the marriage. (see: Radcliff, p. 25)&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to camp in September and requested to repeat his training course, still hoping to receive a commission; after finishing the training he was commissioned as a [[Captain (United States)#U.S. Army, U.S. Air Force, and U.S. Marine Corps|captain]].&lt;ref&gt;Radcliff, pp. 24–25&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Expeditionary Forces]], [[84th Division (United States)|Eighty-fourth Division]], to which Minton belonged, was dispatched to France in July 1918. Minton and his unit served on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] at [[Verdun, France|Verdun]], [[Soissons, France|Soissons]], and later protecting supply lines in Belgium. His unit was responsible for [[Reconnaissance|scouting]] roads to ensure safe transport of men and supplies to the front lines during most his time in the war, and he saw no combat.&lt;ref&gt;Radcliff, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

When President [[Woodrow Wilson]] came to [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris in 1919]], Minton was in charge of a security detail guarding the negotiation hall and was able to meet Wilson. When the war ended, Minton remained briefly with the Army of Occupation in Germany before being discharged in August 1919.&lt;ref name = g54&gt;Gugin (1997), p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; He chose to remain in Paris for several months to study [[Roman law]], [[international law]], [[Civil law (common law)|civil law]] and [[jurisprudence]] in the [[Pantheon-Assas Paris II University|Faculte de Droit]] at the [[Sorbonne]]. He returned home in March 1920. The first of Minton's three children, [[Sherman A. Minton|Sherman Jr.]], was born while he was away.&lt;ref&gt;Gugin. p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; Minton's second son, John, and daughter, Maryanne, were born in 1921 and 1926, respectively.

==Political career==

When Minton returned home he reopened his law practice and decided to enter politics. He ran for office in [[Indiana's 3rd congressional district]], but lost the Democratic primary, despite significant campaigning and his war record.&lt;ref&gt;Gugin (1997), p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; He lost to [[John Ewing (politician)|John Ewing]], 6,502 votes to 3,170, second place in a field of five candidates.&lt;ref&gt;Gugin (1997), p. 58&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Radcliff, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; After the loss, he briefly joined the Indiana law firm of Stonsenburg and Weathers, two politically active lawyers, before moving to [[Miami]], Florida, where he joined another firm, [[Shutts &amp; Bowen]]. In January 1928, he left the Miami practice and returned to Stonsenburg and Weathers. He attempted to secure the Democratic nomination to run for Congress in 1930, but was again defeated, this time by the former state party chairman [[Eugene B. Crowe]].&lt;ref&gt;Gugin (1997), pp. 59–61&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Radcliff, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1920 Sherman Minton Democratic Primary campaign poster.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A portrait of a young man in a military uniform. Above his head is written &quot;STAND BY THE SOLDIERS / They Stood By You&quot;. Below the portrait is &quot;Sherman Minton for CONGRESS. Subject to Democratic Primary Tuesday, May 4, 1920&quot;| 1920 primary campaign poster for Minton]]

The following year, Minton became a local commander of the [[American Legion]]. The group had a large and active membership in the state at the time, and he used his position to encourage support of Democratic Party agenda. Paul McNutt was the national commander, and the two men became political allies.&lt;ref&gt;Gugin (1997), p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Radcliff, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; When McNutt became governor in 1930, he offered Minton a position at the head of a new utility regulation commission. As commissioner, Minton successfully imposed regulations that reduced state telephone bills by a combined total of $525,000. The cuts received widespread media coverage, and Minton was credited in the reports with the success.&lt;ref&gt;Gugin (1997), p. 71&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Radcliff, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;

===Senate campaign===
Becoming popular among the party leadership during his two years as commissioner, Minton was encouraged by party leaders to run for the [[United States Senate]] in 1934. At the state Democratic Party Convention he ran against Earl Peters, a former chairman of the state party. With the support of McNutt, Minton won the nomination on the third ballot with 827 votes to Peters' 586.&lt;ref&gt;Gugin (1997), p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Radcliff, pp. 37–38&lt;/ref&gt;

Minton launched a statewide campaign in August 1934 and began delivering speeches in defense of the [[New Deal]]. He blamed [[United States Republican Party|Republicans]] for the conditions of the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]]. His opponent, incumbent Republican Senator [[Arthur Raymond Robinson|Arthur R. Robinson]], accused Minton of playing &quot;Santa Claus&quot; by trying to give everyone &quot;presents&quot;.&lt;ref name = g77/&gt; He also criticized Minton's support of the New Deal, which Robinson and Republicans called unconstitutional. Minton's initial campaign slogan was &quot;You can't offer a hungry man the Constitution&quot;, a slogan he unveiled in a debate with Robinson in [[Corydon, Indiana|Corydon]] on August 11.&lt;ref&gt;Radcliff, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; He continued using the slogan, and on September 11, Minton delivered his infamous &quot;You Cannot Eat the Constitution&quot; speech,&lt;ref name = g77&gt;Gugin (1997), p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref group=upper-alpha&gt; The speech was so named by newspapers who printed excerpts. In the speech Minton stated, &quot;You cannot walk up to a hungry man today and say, 'Here have a Constitution',&quot; and &quot;you can't expect a farmer to dig himself out his debts with a Constitution.&quot; He finished his speech with. &quot;let us keep our priorities realistic; in times like these the needs of the people take precedence over all else.&quot; (see: Radcliff, p. 40)&lt;/ref&gt; in which he concluded the urgent needs of the masses outweighed the need to uphold the constitution. The speech backfired wildly and papers and opponents across the state called Minton's remarks traitorous.&lt;ref&gt;Gugin (1997), p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; Minton stopped using the slogan and explained his position again using new terms, but his opponents continued to dog him over the issue. The Republicans also faulted popular governor McNutt and his reorganization of the government, and McNutt became more personally involved in the election. With the state party's more direct involvement, Minton won the election with fifty-two percent of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;Gugin (1997), p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lobby Investigation Committee===
{{see also|United States Senate Lobby Investigation Committee}}

[[File:Shermanminton.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A half-length portrait of a man wearing a suit with a smirk on his face and a slight purple hue about him|Senator Sherman Minton]]

Minton took his Senate seat in January 1935. As a freshman, he sat in the back row of the chamber next to fellow freshman Harry Truman, and the pair quickly became friends.&lt;ref&gt;Gugin (1997), p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; Minton was made a member of a special [[United States Senate Lobby Investigation Committee|Lobby Investigation Committee]] chaired by Senator [[Hugo Black]], that was set up to look into questionable lobbyist groups. According to professor of [[political science]] [[Linda C. Gugin]], a Minton biographer, in practice the committee's investigations were politically motivated and directed against groups that were challenging New Deal legislation.&lt;ref&gt;Gugin (1997), p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[William Randolph Hearst]], a prominent and wealthy media magnate, began using his newspapers to deride the committee's &quot;reckless attacks on freedom&quot;.&lt;ref name = g95/&gt; Minton led the effort to counter Hearst and delivered a speech criticizing his support of the Republican Party. In 1937, Senator Black was appointed to the Supreme Court and left the Senate, and Minton secured his post as chair of the committee. Minton immediately began a full scale investigation of the media conglomerate controlled by [[Frank E. Gannett]],&lt;ref name = g95&gt;Gugin (1997), p. 95&lt;/ref&gt; accusing him of publishing Republican Party propaganda. For several weeks, Minton delivered speeches against Gannett in the Senate, and Gannett responded in kind in his newspapers. Minton finally introduced legislation that would have made it &quot;illegal to publish information known to be false&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Gugin (1997), p. 96&lt;/ref&gt; Gannett, and a large number of allies in newspapers and on radio, immediately began to charge Minton and the Democratic Party with an assault on the freedom of the press. Minton's allies in Congress asked him to withdraw the bill because of its political repercussions, and he dropped the matter.&lt;ref&gt;Gugin (1997), p. 97&lt;/ref&gt;

Minton tried again to expose what he believed to be Republican control of the media. He led the committee to target a newspaper with national circulation, ''Rural Progress''. Minton accused the publishers of improperly accepting large sums of money from corporations and the editors of undue influence from this money. The owner of the paper, Maurive V. Renolds, was summoned before the committee for a hearing, where Minton demanded to know why he was accepting money from corporations.&lt;ref&gt;Gugin (1997), p. 100&lt;/ref&gt; When Renolds asked his manager, Dr. Glen Frank, to help him answer the questions, Minton and fellow Democratic senators began to shout Dr. Frank down. As he was saying that the money from the corporations was for advertising in the magazine, Minton beat his gavel and yelled, &quot;This committee doesn't intend to permit you to use this as a forum to air your Republican views.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Gugin (1997), p. 101&lt;/ref&gt;

Minton did not realize that Frank was also president of the [[University of Wisconsin]], and soon suffered retaliation for the way he had treated Frank. Frank went on [[NBC]] radio stations around the country and lambasted Minton for his rudeness. He made lengthy arguments accusing Minton of attempting to violate the [[Bill of Rights]]. Minton was outraged, but the arguments had an effect among voters in Indiana. In 1938, he sought funding to launch a massive nationwide investigation of media conglomerates for proof of Republican interference in the press. Democratic Senator [[Edward R. Burke]] led an effort to defeat the measure and privately accused Minton of damaging the Democrats' cause, which led Minton to leave the Lobby Investigation Committee.&lt;ref&gt;Gugin (1997), p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;

Minton was a fierce partisan during his time in the Senate, and regularly abused his opponents verbally. Democratic Senator [[Huey Long]] became one of Minton's favorite targets because of Long's often-threatened [[filibuster]]s. During one of the filibusters, Long threatened to join the Republican Party. After most senators had left the chamber, Minton remained for several hours to periodically taunt Long. After tiring of the taunts, Long launched a rebuttal from the podium, calling Minton a vicious politician whose positions would cost Minton re-election.&lt;ref&gt;Radcliff, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; The exchange was unusual for its tone and later made national news.&lt;ref&gt;Radcliff, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;

Minton was involved in many such exchanges, including a particularly fierce one with Republican Senator [[Lester J. Dickinson]] in March 1936. Dickinson delivered a speech in the Senate castigating President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] for carrying out what he termed illegal and unconstitutional acts. Minton responded with a range of accusations, some personal, against Dickinson and his &quot;political naivety&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Radcliff, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;

===Court packing===
{{See also|Judiciary Reorganization Bill of 1937}}

In 1936, the [[United States Supreme Court]] ruled the [[Agricultural Adjustment Act]] of 1933 unconstitutional. For the first time, Minton gave speeches criticizing the court for overriding the will of Congress. He accused the court of allowing itself to be influenced by political motives rather than the law.&lt;ref&gt;Gugin (1997), p. 103&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Radcliff, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the court ruling, Minton began drafting a bill which would allow the Supreme Court to declare a law unconstitutional only if seven out the nine justices supported the decision. In February 1937, before Minton introduced his bill, President Roosevelt introduced a plan of his own to deal with the Supreme Court. Roosevelt proposed adding more justices to the court and creating a mandatory retirement age; the changes would allow him to appoint an overwhelming majority to the court who be more sympathetic to his agenda, ensuring the safety of legislation passed by his party.&lt;ref&gt;Gugin (1997), p. 105&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Radcliff, pp. 53–55&lt;/ref&gt;

Minton was pleased with Roosevelt's bill and quickly became its leading supporter in the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Minton, Sherman|title=Reorganization of Federal Judiciary; speeches of Hon. Sherman Minton of Indiana in the Senate of the United States|date=July 8 &amp; 9, 1937|location= Washington, D.C.|publisher=Government Printing Office}}&lt;/ref&gt; The measure was placed in an [[omnibus bill]] that was designed to reform judicial salaries and districting, among many other measures. Republicans quickly discovered the court packing provision and targeted the bill. Democrats had overwhelming [[super-majority|super-majorities]] in Congress, and passage of the bill at first seemed assured.&lt;ref&gt;Gugin (1997), p. 106&lt;/ref&gt; Minton's support of the bill helped him earn the position of [[Senate majority whip]], allowing him to more effectively push for its passage.&lt;ref&gt;Gugin (1997), p. 107&lt;/ref&gt; Minton delivered six radio addresses on behalf of his party in support of the bill, but public opinion could not be swayed in the Democrats' favor.&lt;ref&gt;Gugin (1997), p. 109&lt;/ref&gt;

Minton received a death threat in the form of an envelope containing a shotgun shell and a message advising him to not vote for the [[court packing]] plan.&lt;ref&gt;Radcliff, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; Many Democrats, fearing their re-election prospects, joined with Republicans and defeated the bill. Minton was unhappy with the loss and it cost him considerable support among his voters, but as a result of his close connection with the bill and the leaders of his party, he gained more influence with the Democrats.&lt;ref&gt;Gugin (1997), p. 113&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Minton supported the Roosevelt administration and became a regular guest at the White House, Minton did oppose the president on some measures. He voted to override a presidential veto of a grant of $2.5&amp;nbsp;billion USD (${{Formatnum:{{Inflation|US|2.5|1936|2010}}}} billion in 2010 dollars) in bonus pay for World War I soldiers ([[Bonus Army]]).&lt;ref&gt;Gugin (1997), p. 114&lt;/ref&gt; He supported the [[Dyer Anti-Lynching Bill]], which Roosevelt feared would cost the party support in the southern states.&lt;ref&gt;Gugin (1997), p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; He also supported an extension of the [[Hatch Act of 1939]], a law that prevented federal employees from being forced to take part in state election campaigns, effectively lessening the influence of federal patronage.&lt;ref&gt;Gugin (1997), p 116&lt;/ref&gt;

As World War II neared, Minton took a cautious position on United States involvement. When the [[Soviet Union]] invaded [[Finland]], Minton voted against granting a loan to Finland to help finance its defense efforts.&lt;ref&gt;Gugin (1997), p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; He also opposed selling munitions and weapons to the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] or the [[Axis Power|Axis]] powers.&lt;ref&gt;Gugin (1997), p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; He advocated and supported expanding the American military and believed that American entry into the war was inevitable, but should be delayed as long as possible. He voted in favor of the [[Smith Act]], which made it a crime to advocate the overthrow of the government, a law specifically targeted at communists and fascists in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Gugin (1997), p. 121&lt;/ref&gt; In his final year in office, there was considerable speculation in the press that Minton would be named to higher office by Roosevelt, including cabinet positions and the Supreme Court, but the speculations did not prove true.&lt;ref&gt;Radcliff, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt;

===Re-election campaign===
Minton ran for re-election to his Senate seat in 1940. McNutt was challenging Roosevelt for the Presidential nomination, forcing Minton to choose between the administration and his allies in the state party. Minton sided with Roosevelt, which cost him McNutt's and the [[Indiana Democratic Party]] machine's support in his re-election bid.&lt;ref&gt;Gugin (1997), p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;

The Republican presidential candidate, [[Wendell Wilkie]], was also a native of Indiana, and Minton faced a difficult challenge to win re-election. He referred to Wilkie as a &quot;sycophant for the rich and famous&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Gugin (1997), p, 143&lt;/ref&gt; Wilkie never responded to Minton's taunts, leaving Minton's opponent in the Senate race, [[Raymond E. Willis]], to respond to Minton's charges. Willis had run for the Senate two years earlier but was defeated by Democrat [[Frederick Van Nuys]]. Willis faulted Minton on a range of topics but focused on the legislation Minton supported while in the Senate. Willis claimed that much of the legislation was unconstitutional and Minton's positions were detrimental to the nation. Minton responded by pointing out Willis's connections to wealthy corporations and accused him of not caring for the people.&lt;ref&gt;Gugin (1997), p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt; Minton's campaign focused on the achievements of the New Deal programs. He claimed farm income in Indiana had doubled since 1932, and highlighted the passage of the Old Age Pension laws. His support for conscription and military preparedness for the coming war proved unpopular with voters and cost him considerable support, but according to historian William Radcliff it was Wilkie's [[favorite son]] status, which led many Hoosiers to vote Republican, that proved to be the election's deciding factor.&lt;ref name = r109/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cushman, p. 432&lt;/ref&gt; Despite Minton's heavy campaigning, he lost the close election to Willis by 5,179 votes out of over 1.5&amp;nbsp;million cast.&lt;ref name = r109&gt;Radcliff, p. 109&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gugin (1997), p. 147&lt;/ref&gt;

Roosevelt won the [[United States presidential election, 1940|1940 presidential election]]. After Minton left office in March 1941, he was given a position in the Roosevelt administration as a reward for his loyalty during the court packing failure.&lt;ref&gt;Gugin (1997), p. 151&lt;/ref&gt; He served as one of the president's advisers and a liaison between the White House and Congress. The extent of his duties is not fully known; Linda Gugin has speculated that he may have managed Roosevelt's patronage system.&lt;ref name = g155&gt;Gugin (1997), p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; Minton was responsible for getting several officials appointed to high offices in the federal bureaucracy and numerous others appointed to lower ranking positions.&lt;ref name = g155/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Radcliff, p. 106&lt;/ref&gt; He also convinced Roosevelt to support the creation of a Senate defense committee chaired by Truman, a position that brought Truman into the national spotlight and helped him gain the vice presidency.&lt;ref name = c433&gt;Cushman, p. 433&lt;/ref&gt;

==Seventh Circuit==
===Appointment===
On May&amp;nbsp;7, 1941, Roosevelt announced Minton's nomination to the Chicago-based [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit|Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals]].&lt;ref&gt;Gugin (1997), p. 156&lt;/ref&gt; Minton was confirmed unanimously by the Senate on May&amp;nbsp;12. Minton resigned from his post in the administration, but even after he began working on the court, Minton remained active in Democratic politics behind the scenes and was in regular correspondence with Roosevelt to make patronage suggestions.&lt;ref name = g164&gt;Gugin (1997), p. 164&lt;/ref&gt;

Minton was sworn in on May&amp;nbsp;29, but the court was in recess at the time.&lt;ref name = g164/&gt; He took his seat when it returned to session on October&amp;nbsp;7.&lt;ref&gt;Gugin (1997), p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; The court had the highest court load of all the appellate courts in the nation at that time, averaging 40 cases per judge annually.&lt;ref&gt;Gugin (1997), p. 163&lt;/ref&gt; The men on the court were close friends, and Minton developed a particularly close friendship with Judge [[J. Earl Major]]; Major offered Minton financial assistance during his later illnesses. Major had been on the court for several years and held a judicial philosophy similar to Minton's. The two men regularly attended baseball games and were frequent guests in each other's homes.&lt;ref&gt;Gugin (1997), p. 161&lt;/ref&gt;

World War II broke out shortly after Minton joined the court, creating a flood of cases in which legal precedent provided little guidance, including challenges to wartime measures, [[selective service]] laws, price controls, rationing and civil liberties. In the majority of these cases, the court affirmed the decisions of the district courts, but in several the court was required to establish a precedent.&lt;ref name = r110&gt;Radcliff, p. 110&lt;/ref&gt; Minton stated on several occasions his personal preference to affirm the decisions of the lower courts. He believed that the court that heard the case and pronounced judgment was generally able to make a decision that was superior to appellate courts' decisions. He believed the appellate process should be reserved for the more serious cases and cases where the lower court had clearly made a mistake.&lt;ref&gt;Radcliff, p. 113&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jurisprudence===
Minton was described by William Radcliff as a &quot;faithful disciple of judicial restraint,&quot; an unexpected development when compared to his overtly partisan political career.&lt;ref&gt;Gugin (1997), p. 179&lt;/ref&gt; Radcliff attributed Minton's conservative position to the distaste he developed for the courts when they overturned legislation passed while he was in the Senate. The courts actions led him to strongly believe in the limited exercise of judicial power when evaluating the constitutionality of governmental conduct.&lt;ref name=&quot;Radcliff, p. 114&quot;&gt;Radcliff, p. 114&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the recently passed New Deal legislation was being tried in the courts for constitutionality and enforcement, putting Minton in the uncommon position of adjudicating cases depending on legislation he had helped write.&lt;ref&gt;Gugin (1997), p. 180&lt;/ref&gt;

During his time on the Seventh Circuit, Minton authored 253 of the court's opinions, including twelve dissenting opinions.&lt;ref name = r110/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gugin (1997), p. 182&quot;/&gt; Some of his opinions won praise; the editors of ''Tax Magazine'' commented favorably on Minton's opinions on tax law, calling them &quot;direct Hoosier logic&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Gugin (1997), p. 181&lt;/ref&gt; Other court reporting papers made similar comments, applauding the manner in which he turned complex issues to simple questions that could easily be understood.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gugin (1997), p. 182&quot;&gt;Gugin (1997), p. 182&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of ''Sunkist v. Sunkist'' and ''Quaker Oats Co. v. General Mills'', the court created a long standing precedent in their decision making it possible for different companies to use the same brand and product name as long as they produced dissimilar products.&lt;ref&gt;Gugin (1997), p. 190&lt;/ref&gt; In another case, the court set a short-lived precedent allowing companies to artificially raise prices in local markets if the purpose was to artificially lower prices in another market to remain competitive.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Standard Oil Company]] v. [[Federal Trade Commission]]'', 173 F.2d 210 (1949)&lt;/ref&gt; After Minton joined the U.S. Supreme Court, the decision was appealed to that body; Minton recused himself from the case, which the court decided to overturn.&lt;ref&gt;Radcliff, p. 118&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gugin (1997), p. 188&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Standard Oil Company v. Federal Trade Commission'', {{Ussc|340|231|1951}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another decision, Minton was in the majority that ruled under the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]] that the New York [[Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company]] was a monopoly, ordering the company to break up its grocery business.&lt;ref&gt;Gugin (1997), p. 186&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''United States v. New York Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Company'', 173 F.2d 79 (1949)&lt;/ref&gt; Minton was also in the majority in several cases filed to enforce decisions made by the [[National Labor Relations Board]], usually to end worker strikes.&lt;ref&gt;Gugin (1997), p. 183&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the case of ''[[United States v. Knauer]]'', the government was denying the wife of a [[United States citizen]] entry into the country because of her possible ties to Nazism. In a much criticized majority opinion which Minton co-authored with Judge Major, he stated that the &quot;alien did not have any legal right—[her] status was a political decision to be made by officials in government.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''United States v. Knauer'', 149 F.2d 522 (1945)&lt;/ref&gt; Many liberals condemned the court at the time of the decision.&lt;ref name = r115&gt;Radcliff, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; The case ruling was upheld by the Supreme Court in a 1946 appeal.&lt;ref name = r115/&gt; 

One of Minton's favorite cases was that of ''Modernistic Candies, Inc. v. Federal Trade Commission''.&lt;ref name = r111/&gt;&lt;ref name = modcan&gt;''Modernistic Candies, Inc. v. Federal Trade Commission'', 145 F.2d 454, 455 (1948)&lt;/ref&gt; The candy company produced a one-cent gumball dispenser in which almost all the gumballs were the same color. A few different-colored gumballs were included which, when dispensed, entitled the purchaser to a prize from the merchant who owned the machine. The FTC had an injunction put in place barring the company from producing the machines because they claimed it violated anti-gambling laws. Minton wrote the majority opinion and sided with the majority to keep the injunction in place, but dryly mocked the counsel for the defense and the gambling law, stating:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Counsel for the petitioner discussed at great length from a sociological point of view, of the age-old problem of the gambling instinct in the human being. According to his analysis, gambling pervades our entire economic system; thus insurance contracts are a gamble, stock and grain exchange transactions are gambles, and the farmer's dependence on weather is a gamble. Counsel's attempt to apply this analysis to the present case left us cold and unimpressed. He even reminded us that our great idol, Mr. Chief Justice John Marshall, in his day attended the horse races and wagered with his clergyman. In fact, they ran a book. As indicating how times have changed and how even our coarse nature has yielded to the protecting care of governmental policy, we confess we do not even know a bookmaker, clerical or otherwise, and our passes to the beautiful race tracks around Chicago lie in our desk unused.&lt;ref name = modcan/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Minton often lamented that he was required to &quot;pronounce the law as it was written, but on no occasion [c]ould he make the law.&quot;&lt;ref name = r111&gt;Radcliff, p. 111&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clemency board and failing health===
After Roosevelt's death and Truman's succession to the Presidency, Minton continued offering advice to the new administration on a range of topics, including patronage and political maneuvering. Truman appointed Minton as head of the [[United States Department of War|War Department]] Clemency Board, a panel of judges charged with overseeing reviews of decisions made by the [[courts-martial]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1499&amp;dat=19451228&amp;id=9kUaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=MCMEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4558,4602232|title=Courts of Appeal, Army Style|date=December 23, 1945|accessdate=April 26, 2010|publisher=[[Milwaukee Journal]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The panel met every two weeks which, along with his responsibilities on the circuit court, kept Minton very busy and afforded him little rest, leading to a deterioration in his health.&lt;ref&gt;Gugin (1997), p. 167&lt;/ref&gt; While yachting with President Truman on [[Memorial Day]] in 1945, Truman asked Minton to accept an appointment to the position of [[Solicitor General of the United States]]. Minton declined because of his health, but he told Truman he would be interested in a seat on the Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;Gugin (1997), p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1945, Minton suffered a heart attack while in Washington; he was hospitalized for three months at [[Walter Reed Hospital]].&lt;ref&gt;Gugin (1997), p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; After returning to work, he was forced to rest regularly due to gradually worsening [[anemia]], and he sought to lessen his workload. To further complicate his health, on August&amp;nbsp;5, 1949, Minton tripped over a stone in his yard and broke his leg. The injury forced him to walk with a cane for the remainder of his life.&lt;ref&gt;Radcliff, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt;

==Supreme Court==
===Nomination and confirmation===
At a September&amp;nbsp;15, 1949, news conference, Truman announced Minton's nomination to the Supreme Court, succeeding the deceased Justice [[Wiley Rutledge]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ariens&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.michaelariens.com/ConLaw/justices/minton.htm|author=Ariens, Michael|title= Sherman Minton biography|accessdate=April 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Minton had already privately accepted the nomination several days earlier after a telephone conversation with Truman.&lt;ref&gt;Gugin (1997), p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; Truman touted Minton's extensive law education and his years of experience on the circuit courts as the reason for his nomination.&lt;ref name = g15&gt;Gugin (1997), p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Harry S Truman, bw half-length photo portrait, facing front, 1945-crop.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Half length portrait of a man wearing suit and tie with his head turned to looking directly forward; He has a slight smile on his face, with a receding hairline and large round glasses|[[President of the United States|President]] [[Harry Truman]]]]

News of Minton's appointment received mixed reviews nationally.&lt;ref&gt;Radcliff, p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'' said that Truman had allowed personal and political friendship to influence his choice.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eisler, p. 76&quot;&gt;Eisler, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = g18&gt;Gugin (1997), p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New Republic]]'' said &quot;the President is again reverting to his deplorable habit of choosing men for high post because they happen to be his friends...&quot;. The ''[[Washington Post]]'' raised questions about Minton's ability to be confirmed by the Senate due to the power many of his foes held in the body.&lt;ref name = g109&gt;Gugin (1997), p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Indianapolis Star]]'' offered a more sympathetic opinion, pointing out Minton's qualifications and the pride Indiana could take in having a native on the Supreme Court. The article noted that he would be the most educated justice on the court, should he be confirmed.&lt;ref name = g109/&gt;

Indiana Senator [[William E. Jenner]] led opponents of Minton's nomination, including some of Minton's old foes, in an attempt to bring him before the body for hearings.&lt;ref&gt;Radcliff, p. 132&lt;/ref&gt; Minton wrote a letter to the Senate Judicial Committee answering several of their questions, but refused to submit himself to a hearing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/minute/Supreme_Court_Nominees_Refuse_To_Testify.htm|title= Senate History, October&amp;nbsp;1, 1949: Supreme Court Nominee Refuses to Testify|publisher=United States Senate|accessdate=April 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He mentioned his broken leg and hinted in his letter that it could be detrimental to his health to travel in his condition.&lt;ref name = g15/&gt; He also stated that, as a sitting judge and former member of the Senate, it would be improper for him submit to a hearing.&lt;ref name = c433/&gt; Although hearings had occurred irregularly in the past, it was not customary at that time to have a hearing on a nominee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Thorpe |first1=James A.  |title=The Appearance of Supreme Court Nominees Before the Senate Judiciary Committee|journal=[[Public Law (journal)|Journal of Public Law]] |volume=18 |year=1969 |pages=371–402}}&lt;/ref&gt; During an absence of Jenners, Minton's allies worked to have the hearing request dropped and the Judicial Committee sent the measure to the full Senate in a vote of 9 to 2.&lt;ref&gt;Gugin (1997), p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; Senator [[Homer Ferguson]] attempted to have the nomination returned to committee but the motion failed, 45–21. The long debate over Minton's appointment focused on his partisanship, support of the court packing plan during his time in the Senate, and poor health. His opponents launched numerous delaying tactics; the Senate session before the vote to confirm Minton lasted until midnight. His confirmation was approved 48-16 on October&amp;nbsp;3.&lt;ref&gt;Gugin (1997), p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2011}}, Minton remains the last member of Congress, sitting or former, to be appointed to the United States Supreme Court,&lt;ref&gt;Gugin (1997), p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; and he is the only native of Indiana to be appointed to the court.&lt;ref&gt;Radcliff, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref group=upper-alpha&gt; Chief Justice [[John G. Roberts]] is the only other Supreme Court Justice from Indiana, but was not born in the state. ({{cite web|url=http://www.nndb.com/people/746/000099449/|title=John G. Roberts, Jr.|publisher=NNDB|accessdate=March 3, 2011}})&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref group=upper-alpha&gt; See [[Demographics_of_the_Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States#Roman_Catholic_justices|Demographics of the Supreme Court of the United States]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judicial restraint===
Minton's central judicial philosophy was to ascertain and uphold the [[original intent]] of legislation.&lt;ref name = g261/&gt; He continued to take a broad view of governmental powers, demonstrated in his dissenting opinion in the case of''[[Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Co. v. Sawyer]]'', which ruled unconstitutional President Truman's wartime seizure of several steel mills to avert a workers' strike.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Co. v. Sawyer]]'', {{Ussc|343|579|1952}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of all the cases in which Minton was involved, he disagreed most with the Youngstown decision and &quot;went into a tirade&quot; during the conference where the decision was made.&lt;ref&gt;Gugin (1997), p. 210&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that there &quot;could be no vacant spot in power when the security of the nation is at stake.&quot;&lt;ref name = g212&gt;Gugin (1997), p. 212&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his strong protest, he could not influence the Court to permit the president to seize the plants without congressional approval.&lt;ref name = g212/&gt; Minton joined with Chief Justice [[Fred M. Vinson]] and Justice [[Stanley Forman Reed]] in the dissenting opinion that the President had the authority through the [[War Powers Clause|war powers clause]] of the constitution.&lt;ref&gt;Radcliff, p. 151&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:Warren Supreme Court.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Five men sitting in a row with four men standing behind them. All wear flowing back robes and a large black curtain is behind them|The Warren Court in 1953; Minton standing at back right]]

Minton abhorred racial [[Segregation in the United States|segregation]] and provided a solid vote to strike down the school segregation practices at issue in 1954's landmark case of ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]''; it was among the few decisions in which he sided against the government.&lt;ref name = g261&gt;Gugin (1997), p. 261&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'', {{Ussc|347|483|1954}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Radcliff, p. 159&lt;/ref&gt; According to William Radcliff, the majority opinion authored by Minton in the 1953 case ''[[List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 346|Barrows v. Jackson]]'' was his most skillfully written opinion.&lt;ref name = r155/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 346|Barrows v. Jackson]]'', {{Ussc|346|249|1953}}&lt;/ref&gt; He framed the complex question of the case as: &quot;Can a racially restrictive covenant be enforced at law by a suit for damages against a co-covenantor who allegedly broke the covenant?&quot; The Court decided the answer in the negative.&lt;ref name = r155&gt;Radcliff, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt;

In the area of [[Civil liberties in the United States|civil liberties]], Minton adhered to the doctrine of &quot;[[Palko v. Connecticut|fundamental fairness]]&quot;, a test established by the Supreme Court in 1937. In one decision, Minton stated that the right of [[Freedom of speech in the United States|free speech]] was not an absolute right, and could be regulated so as not to violate the rights of others.&lt;ref name=&quot;Radcliff, p. 114&quot;/&gt; In ''[[List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 339|United States v. Rabinowitz]]'', Minton wrote the Court's opinion upholding a lower court ruling which allowed police to search automobiles without a warrant, provided there was probable cause to justify the search.&lt;ref&gt;''[[List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 339|United States v. Rabinowitz]]'', {{Ussc|339|56|1950}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Minton voted to uphold anti-communist legislation during the period of the &quot;[[Second Red Scare|red scare]]&quot;, siding with the majority in 1951's ''[[Dennis v. United States]]'', which upheld the conviction of the leader of the [[Communist Party USA|U.S. Communist Party]].&lt;ref&gt;Gugin (1997), p. 223&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Dennis v. United States]]'', {{Ussc|341|494|1951}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the same period, the Court was split over the legality of governmental loyalty tests. Many agencies had programs in place to ensure members of the government were not communists. Minton's vote proved to be the deciding factor in cases regarding loyalty tests.&lt;ref&gt;Gugin (1997), p. 230&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of ''[[Bailey v. Richardson]]'', Minton's vote upheld the legality of the loyalty tests,&lt;ref group=upper-alpha&gt; In the case of ''[[Bailey v. Richardson]]'' the Court made a split decision resulting in the upholding of the lower Court's ruling by default. (see: Gugin (1997), p. 229)&lt;/ref&gt; while in the decision he authored in the case of ''[[List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 341|Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee v. McGrath]]'', he voted to uphold the plaintiff's position that he had been terminated illegally because of his support of fascist ideology.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Bailey v. Richardson]]'' {{Ussc|341|918|1951}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 341|Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee v. McGrath]]'', {{Ussc|341|123|1951}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gugin (1997), p. 229&lt;/ref&gt; Minton's position gradually shifted to allowing the loyalty tests to take place, and in ''[[List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 342|Adler v. Board of Ed. of City of New York]]'' he wrote the majority opinion allowing the tests and upholding New York's [[Feinberg Law]].&lt;ref&gt;Radcliff, p. 147&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 342|Adler v. Board of Ed. of City of New York]]'', {{Ussc|342|485|1952}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref group=upper-alpha&gt; In the decisions in ''[[List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 342|Adler v. Board of Ed. of City of New York]]'', Minton wrote, &quot;From time immemorial, one's reputation has been determined in part by the company he keeps. In the employment of officials and teachers of the school system, the state may very properly inquire into the company they keep, and we know of no rule, constitutional or otherwise, that prevents the state, when determining the fitness and loyalty of such persons, from considering the organizations and persons with whom they associate.&quot; (See: {{Ussc|341|123|1951}})&lt;/ref&gt; This proved to be the most important vote as it allowed the tests to be given with only minimal suspicion of a person's disloyalty to the government.&lt;ref&gt;Gugin (1997), p. 231&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of Minton's previous Congressional partisanship, many liberals believed he would support their positions when on the Court. Throughout his tenure, Minton regularly disappointed them, leading many to rail against him. A lawyer writing for the ''New Jersey Law Journal'' labeled Minton a &quot;spokesman against freedom&quot;, calling him &quot;a man of conspicuous judicial shortcomings, whose votes against civil liberties exceeded those of any other man on the Court, and who wrote comparatively few opinions of other kinds.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Eisler, p. 96&lt;/ref&gt; Linda Gugin pointed out that Minton was a disappointment to liberals because he consistently chose order over freedom. Gugin also concludes that Minton had the strongest commitment to judicial restraint and ideological neutrality of any justice, past or present.&lt;ref&gt;Gugin (2009), p. 791&lt;/ref&gt;

===Politics===
Although Minton was on the Supreme Court, he remained casually involved in Democratic internal politics. He wrote Truman several letters criticizing Justices [[Robert H. Jackson]] and Hugo Black, referring to Black as a demagogue. He also offered advice on dealing with Republican opposition in the Senate. In a 1954 letter, after Truman left office, he urged Truman to help focus public attention on the economy and away from communism, a threat he claimed the Republicans were exaggerating to avoid confronting their own problems.&lt;ref&gt;Gugin (1997), p. 257&lt;/ref&gt;

After Truman's withdrawal from the [[United States presidential election, 1952|1952 presidential campaign]], Minton made remarks indicating he had advised Truman to stay out of the contested New Hampshire primary election to begin with.&lt;ref&gt;Gugin (1997), p. 211&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1956, a reporter asked Minton about his preferred candidate in the upcoming presidential election. Minton answered, &quot;I have great confidence in [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]].&quot;&lt;ref name = f137&gt;Radcliff, p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; He also remarked that [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] was politically handicapped. Minton was lambasted in the media for his endorsement, which he attempted to retract a few days later after being advised to do so by other members of the Court.&lt;ref name = f137/&gt;

===Regular dissenter===
Truman's other appointees to the Court provided consistent conservative votes, and during Minton's first years on the Court it was returned to the conservatism of the William Howard Taft era.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eisler, p. 76&quot;/&gt; While on the Court, Minton transformed from a New Deal senator into an almost reactionary judge as an ally of Justice [[Felix Frankfurter]]. Empirical coding of votes shows that Minton was the most conservative justice on the Court during his first year, and remained in the conservative half of the court for the duration of his career.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eisler, 88&quot;&gt;Eisler, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;

Minton did not enjoy the limited influence of his judicial role in the later years of his term, when he was more frequently in the minority in voting on cases.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eisler, 88&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gugin (1997), p. 221&lt;/ref&gt; After the deaths of Chief Justice Fred M. Vinson and Justice Robert Jackson, Minton found himself with little support for many of his opinions, which led him to begin considering retirement.&lt;ref&gt;Gugin (1997), pp. 277-79&lt;/ref&gt; 

The shifting position of the Court led to personal animosity between members of its two wings. Despite his disappointment over the Court's positions on some issues, Minton remained popular among his colleagues on the Court as he didn't take sides in their personal disagreements; he proved a soothing presence during a period marked by bitter personal feuds between strong personalities such as [[William O. Douglas]] and Felix Frankfurter.&lt;ref&gt;Radcliff, p. 172&lt;/ref&gt; 

Minton informed Eisenhower of his intention to retire in a letter on September&amp;nbsp;7, 1956, in which he dryly stated his retirement was authorized by law. Eisenhower responded with a brief note wishing him a happy retirement.&lt;ref&gt;Radcliff, p. 173&lt;/ref&gt; Although he did not tell the president, Minton informed the members of the Court that his duties were too taxing on his health. His anemia had steadily worsened, slowing him physically and mentally.&lt;ref&gt;Radcliff, p. 174&lt;/ref&gt; Minton served as a Justice until October&amp;nbsp;15, 1956, retiring after 7&amp;nbsp;years and 3&amp;nbsp;days of service.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oyez&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oyez.org/justices/sherman_minton|title= Official Supreme Court media, Sherman Minton|publisher=[[Oyez.org]]|accessdate=April 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was succeeded by [[William J. Brennan, Jr.]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Gugin (1997), p. 282&quot;&gt;Gugin (1997), p. 282&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
===Retirement===
Announcing his departure, Minton remarked, &quot;There will be more interest in who will succeed me than in my passing. I'm an echo.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Oyez&quot;/&gt; Despite the health difficulties, Minton regretted his decision almost immediately.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eisler, 88&quot;/&gt; 

Minton returned to his New Albany home, where he took a much lighter workload. He gave occasional lectures at Indiana University and continued to give public speeches from time to time. For several years after retiring from the Supreme Court, Minton occasionally accepted assignments to serve temporarily on one of the lower federal courts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eisler, 88&quot;/&gt;  He received an honorary doctorate degree from the [[University of Louisville]].&lt;ref&gt;Gugin (1997), p. 288&lt;/ref&gt;  He took many trips around the United States, and two trips to Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Gugin (1997), p. 285&lt;/ref&gt; In England, he received an honorary doctorate from Oxford University in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;Radcliff, p. 183&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite his failing health, Minton remained active in the Democratic Party. He was most concerned with President Eisenhower, who he believed was incompetent. He remained in regular correspondence with Truman, and the two met on several occasions at Democratic Party functions.&lt;ref&gt;Gugin (1997), p. 290&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death and legacy===
In late March 1965, Minton was admitted to a hospital in New Albany, where it was found he was suffering [[internal bleeding]]. He died in his sleep early in the morning of April&amp;nbsp;9. Minton's wife was Catholic; his funeral was held at Holy Trinity Catholic Church and was attended by many dignitaries, including several sitting members of the Supreme Court, the governors of Indiana and [[Kentucky]], and several members of Congress. He was buried in the Holy Trinity Cemetery adjacent to the church. Minton himself was nominally Catholic and had shunned Christianity for most of his life; he only began to occasionally attend [[Mass (liturgy)|mass]] following his retirement.&lt;ref&gt;Gugin (1997), p. 304&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.supremecourthistory.org/04_library/subs_volumes/04_c20_e.html |author=Christensen, George A|year=1983|title=Here Lies the Supreme Court: Gravesites of the Justices|publisher=Yearbook [[Supreme Court Historical Society]] at [[Internet Archive]]|accessdate=April 26, 2010 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20050903032026/http://www.supremecourthistory.org/04_library/subs_volumes/04_c20_e.html |archivedate = September 3, 2005}}  See also, {{cite journal|url=http://www.supremecourthistory.org/04_library/subs_volumes/04_c20_e.html {{dead link|date=September 2011}} |last1=Christensen |first1=George A|title=Here Lies the Supreme Court: Gravesites of the Justices Revisited |publisher=Yearbook [[Supreme Court Historical Society]] |journal=Journal of Supreme Court History |volume=33 |number=1 |date=March 2008 |pages=17–41. |DOI=10.1111/j.1540-5818.2008.00177.x |accessdate=April 26, 2010}} {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; He left most of his personal papers and judicial records to the [[Truman Presidential Library]].&lt;ref&gt;Radcliff, p. 140&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trumanlibrary.org/hstpaper/mintons.htm|publisher=Harry S.

({{cite web|url=http://www.fjc.gov/servlet/nGetMan?jid=1658|title= Sherman Minton|accessdate=March 3, 2011}}) According to Sherman Minton, Jr., Minton's wife destroyed most of Minton's communications with Truman because she believed they were &quot;undignified and occasionally profane.&quot; (See: Stewart, Margaret M., p. 304)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bust of Sherman Minton in the Rotunda of the Indiana Statehouse.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A shining bronze bust of an expressionless man sitting on a pedestal.|Bust of Minton by [[Robert Merrell Gage]] on display at the rotunda of the [[Indiana Statehouse]]]]

Minton is the [[eponym]] of the [[Sherman Minton Bridge]], which carries [[Interstate 64]] across the [[Ohio River]], connecting western [[Louisville, Kentucky]] with [[New Albany, Indiana]]. Minton attended the dedication of the bridge at a 1962 ceremony. He is also the namesake of the annual Sherman Minton Moot Court Competition, held at the Indiana University Maurer School of Law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law.indiana.edu/students/competitions/mootcourt/index.shtml|title=Competition|publisher=[[Indiana University]]|accessdate=April 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also honored (with Indiana Senator [[Homer E. Capehart]]) — in the &quot;[[Brutalist architecture|Brutalist]]&quot; style designed by [[Woollen, Molzan and Partners]] and with architectural art by  [[Milton Glaser]] — in the centrally located Minton-Capehart Federal Building on [[Indiana World War Memorial Plaza]] in [[Indianapolis, Indiana|Indianapolis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;urban&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.urbantimesonline.com/2009/10/history-301-a-minority-opinion-%E2%80%93-i-%E2%99%A5-the-federal-building/ |title=History 301: A minority opinion – I ♥ the Federal Building |date=October 27, 2009 |first1=Connie |last1=Zeigler |publisher=Urban Times |accessdate=March 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A bronze [[Sherman Minton (Gage)|bust of Minton]] was created and put on display in the Indiana Statehouse.&lt;ref&gt;Gugin (1997), p. 287&lt;/ref&gt;

While some writers like Linda Gugin and legal historian William Radcliff have given high praise to Minton's logic in his written opinions, they point out that his positions had little long term impact.&lt;ref&gt;Gugin (1997), p. 307&lt;/ref&gt; Other legal historians, like Bernard Schwartz, have more negative opinion of Minton's judicial career. Schwartz wrote that Minton &quot;was below mediocrity as a Justice. His opinions, relatively few for his tenure, are less than third rate, characterized by their cavalier approach to complicated issues.&quot;&lt;ref name = s44&gt;Schwartz, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; Schwartz went on to say, &quot;he ranks near the bottom of any list of Justices.&quot;&lt;ref name = s44/&gt; Most of the precedents Minton helped establish were overturned by the Warren Court in the years immediately following his retirement. In total he wrote sixty-seven majority opinions along with several of the dissenting opinions.&lt;ref&gt;Gugin (1997), p. 280&lt;/ref&gt; Gugin authored a work in rebuttal to Schwartz's harsh critique, saying that Minton's rulings were &quot;predictable based on the principles of deference, precedent, and strict interpretation&quot;; she attributed his poor ranking to the bias of reviewers in favor of judicial activism.&lt;ref&gt;Gugin (2009), p. 764&lt;/ref&gt;

Minton's time on the court marked the end of a transitory period in the judiciary. Since Minton, justices have tended to serve increasingly longer terms on the court, which has had strong political science implications on the Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=948813|author=Crowe, Justin. Karpowitz Christopher|date= April 2006|title=Where Have You Gone, Sherman Minton? The Decline of the Short-Term Supreme Court Justice|publisher=Princeton Law and Public Affairs Working Paper No. 06-014|accessdate=April 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The growing concept of judicial non-partisanship became the norm in American politics after Minton—he was the last member of Congress of be appointed to the court.&lt;ref&gt;Gugin (1997), p. 308&lt;/ref&gt; Linda Gugin and Professor James St. Clair have noted that the federal courts have lost a valuable point of view by not having experienced legislators among their ranks.&lt;ref&gt;Gugin (1997), p. 311&lt;/ref&gt;

Minton played an important role behind the scenes of the Court as a peacemaker between its two opposing factions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gugin (1997), p. 282&quot;/&gt; These attempts to keep the peace led Justice Frankfurter to remark that while Minton would never be remembered as a great justice, he would be remembered as a great colleague by his fellow justices.&lt;ref&gt;Radcliff, p. 139&lt;/ref&gt;
