'''Edward Teller''' ({{lang-hu|Teller&amp;nbsp;Ede}}; January 15, 1908&amp;nbsp;– September 9, 2003) was a [[Hungarian American|Hungarian-American]] [[theoretical physics|theoretical]] [[physicist]], known colloquially as &quot;the father of the [[hydrogen bomb]]&quot;, even though he claimed he did not care for the title.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;I have always considered that description in poor taste.&quot; Teller, ''Memoirs'', p. 546.&lt;/ref&gt; Teller made numerous contributions to [[nuclear physics|nuclear]] and [[molecular physics]], [[spectroscopy]] (the [[Jahn–Teller effect|Jahn–Teller]] and [[Renner–Teller effect|Renner–Teller]] effects), and [[surface]] physics. His extension of Fermi's theory of [[beta decay]] (in the form of the so-called [[Gamow–Teller transitions]]) provided an important stepping stone in the applications of this theory. The Jahn–Teller effect and the [[BET theory]] have retained their original formulation and are still mainstays in physics and chemistry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goodchild 2005, p. 36&quot;&gt;Goodchild 2005, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; Teller also made contributions to [[Thomas–Fermi model|Thomas–Fermi theory]], the precursor of [[density functional theory]], a standard modern tool in the quantum mechanical treatment of complex molecules. In 1953, along with [[Nicholas Metropolis]] and [[Marshall Rosenbluth]], Teller co-authored a paper&lt;ref name=&quot;Metropolis, N. 1953&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt; which is a standard starting point for the applications of the [[Monte Carlo method]] to [[statistical mechanics]].

Teller emigrated to the [[United States]] in the 1930s, and was an early member of the [[Manhattan Project]] charged with developing the first atomic bombs. During this time he made a serious push to develop the first [[nuclear fusion|fusion]]-based weapons as well, but these were deferred until after [[World War II]]. After his controversial testimony in the [[security clearance]] hearing of his former [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos]] colleague [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]], Teller was ostracized by much of the scientific community. He continued to find support from the U.S. government and military research establishment, particularly for his advocacy for [[nuclear power|nuclear energy]] development, a strong nuclear arsenal, and a vigorous [[nuclear testing]] program. He was a co-founder of [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] (LLNL), and was both its director and associate director for many years.

In his later years he became especially known for his advocacy of controversial technological solutions to both military and civilian problems, including a plan to excavate an artificial harbor in Alaska using [[thermonuclear]] explosives. He was a vigorous advocate of [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]]'s [[Strategic Defense Initiative]]. Throughout his life, Teller was known both for his scientific ability and his difficult interpersonal relations and volatile personality, and is considered one of the inspirations for the character [[Dr. Strangelove]] in the 1964 movie of the same name.

==Early life and education==
Teller was born in [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]] (then [[Austria-Hungary]]) into a [[Jewish]] family in the year 1908. When he was very young, his grandfather told his mother not to be too unhappy that he was apparently an [[idiot]], because he hadn't spoken by the age of three. A doctor suggested he might be mentally retarded. Teller had no interest in speaking because his father spoke Hungarian and very poor German, and his mother spoke German and very poor Hungarian. As a result, he decided that they didn't know what they were talking about. He became instead very interested in numbers, and would calculate in his head large numbers, such as the number of seconds in a year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vnNwSwTfsU Video in which Teller recalls his earliest memories]. Youtube.com&lt;/ref&gt;

He left Hungary in 1926 (partly due to the ''[[numerus clausus]]'' rule under [[Miklós Horthy|Horthy]]'s regime). The [[Hungary between the World Wars|political climate and revolutions in Hungary]] during his youth instilled a lingering animosity for both [[Communism]] and [[Fascism]] in Teller.&lt;ref name=&quot;stix&quot;&gt;

 | accessdate=2007-11-25 | authorlink=Gary Stix}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he was a young student, his right foot was severed in a streetcar accident in [[Munich]], requiring him to wear a [[prosthetic]] foot and leaving him with a life-long limp. Teller graduated in [[chemical engineering]] at the [[University of Karlsruhe]] and received his Ph.D. in [[physics]] under [[Werner Heisenberg]] at the [[University of Leipzig]]. Teller's Ph.D. [[dissertation]] dealt with one of the first accurate [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] treatments of the [[hydrogen molecular ion]]. In 1930 he befriended Russian physicists [[George Gamow]] and [[Lev Landau]]. Teller's life-long friendship with a [[Czechs|Czech]] physicist, [[George Placzek]], was very important for Teller's scientific and philosophical development. It was Placzek who arranged a summer stay in [[Rome, Italy|Rome]] with [[Enrico Fermi]] for young Teller, thus orienting his scientific career in nuclear physics.&lt;ref&gt;Teller, ''Memoirs'', p. 80; see also {{cite web | publisher=Peoples Archive | title=Interview with Edward Teller, part 40. Going to Rome with Placzek to visit Fermi | url=http://www.peoplesarchive.com/search/?searchterms=Placzek&amp;storyId=4424 | accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Teller spent two years at the [[University of Göttingen]], and left in 1933 through the aid of the [[International Rescue Committee]]. He went briefly to England, and moved for a year to [[Copenhagen]], where he worked under [[Niels Bohr]]. In February 1934, he married Augusta Maria &quot;Mici&quot; (pronounced &quot;Mitzi&quot;) Harkanyi, the sister of a longtime friend.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

In 1935, thanks to George Gamow's incentive, Teller was invited to the United States to become a [[Professor]] of Physics at [[George Washington University]] (GWU), where he worked with Gamow until 1941. Prior to the discovery of [[Nuclear fission|fission]] in 1939, Teller was engaged as a theoretical physicist, working in the fields of quantum, [[molecular physics|molecular]], and [[nuclear physics]]. In 1941, after becoming a [[naturalized]] [[citizen]] of the United States, his interest turned to the use of nuclear energy, both [[Nuclear fusion|fusion]] and fission.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

[[Image:Edward Teller (boy).jpg|right|thumb|150px|Teller in his youth]]
At GWU, Teller predicted the [[Jahn–Teller effect]] (1937), which distorts molecules in certain situations; this affects the [[chemical reaction]]s of metals, and in particular the coloration of certain metallic dyes. Teller and [[Hermann Arthur Jahn]] analyzed it as a piece of purely mathematical physics. In collaboration with Brunauer and Emmet, Teller also made an important contribution to [[Surface science|surface physics and chemistry]]: the so-called [[BET theory|Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) isotherm]].{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

When [[World War II]] began, Teller wanted to contribute to the war effort. On the advice of the well-known [[Caltech]] [[aerodynamicist]] and fellow Hungarian [[émigré]] [[Theodore von Kármán]], Teller collaborated with his friend [[Hans Bethe]] in developing a theory of shock-wave propagation. In later years, their explanation of the behavior of the gas behind such a wave proved valuable to scientists who were studying [[missile]] re-entry.&lt;ref&gt;For Teller's academic career through 1941, see either Goodchild 2005, chapters 3 to 5, or Blumberg and Panos 1990, chapters 3 to 5; also ''ANB'' [http://www.anb.org/articles/13/13-00581.html George Gamow]. (The ANB has not been updated since Teller's death.) For his own account, see Teller, ''Memoirs'', chapters 6 to 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manhattan Project==
In 1942, Teller was invited to be part of [[Robert Oppenheimer]]'s summer planning seminar at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] for the origins of the [[Manhattan Project]], the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] effort to develop the first [[nuclear weapon]]s. A few weeks earlier, Teller had been meeting with his friend and colleague [[Enrico Fermi]] about the prospects of [[Nuclear warfare|atomic warfare]], and Fermi had nonchalantly suggested that perhaps a weapon based on [[nuclear fission]] could be used to set off an even larger [[nuclear fusion]] reaction. Even though he initially explained to Fermi why he thought the idea would not work, Teller was fascinated by the possibility and was quickly bored with the idea of &quot;just&quot; an atomic bomb (even though this was not yet anywhere near completion). At the Berkeley session, Teller diverted discussion from the fission weapon to the possibility of a fusion weapon—what he called the &quot;Super&quot; (an early version of what was later to be known as a hydrogen bomb).&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes 1995; Herken 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 6, 1941, the United States had begun development of the atomic bomb, under the supervision of [[Arthur Compton]], chairman of the [[University of Chicago]] physics department, who coordinated [[uranium]] research with [[Columbia University]], [[Princeton University]], University of Chicago, and [[University of California, Berkeley]]. Eventually Compton transferred the Columbia and Princeton scientists to the [[Metallurgical Laboratory]] at Chicago, and Enrico Fermi moved in at the end of April 1942 and the construction of [[Chicago Pile 1]] began. Teller was left behind at first, but then called to Chicago two months later. In early 1943, the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos laboratory]] was built to design an [[atomic bomb]] under the supervision of Oppenheimer in [[Los Alamos, New Mexico]]. Teller moved there in April 1943.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.logosjournal.com/issue_4.2/hughes.htm | accessdate=2007-10-31 | publisher=Logosonline | title=The Real Edward Teller? | author=Hughes, Colin | year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Edward Teller ID badge.png|thumb|150px|left|Teller's ID badge photo from [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos]]]]
Teller became part of the Theoretical Physics division at the then-secret [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos laboratory]] during the war, and continued to push his ideas for a fusion weapon even though it had been put on a low priority during the war (as the creation of a fission weapon was proving to be difficult enough by itself). Because of his interest in the H-bomb, and his frustration at having been passed over for director of the theoretical division (the job was instead given to [[Hans Bethe]]), Teller refused to engage in the calculations for the [[Nuclear weapon design#Implosion type weapon|implosion mechanism]] of the fission bomb. This caused tensions with other researchers, as additional scientists had to be employed to do that work—including [[Klaus Fuchs]], who was later revealed to be a [[espionage|Soviet spy]].&lt;ref&gt;Herken 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Apparently, Teller managed to also irk his neighbors by playing the piano late in the night.&lt;ref name=StanfordDeath/&gt; However, Teller made valuable contributions to bomb research, especially in the elucidation of the implosion mechanism.

In 1946, Teller participated in a conference in which the properties of thermonuclear fuels such as [[deuterium]] and the possible design of a hydrogen bomb were discussed. It was concluded that Teller's assessment of a hydrogen bomb had been too favourable, and that both the quantity of deuterium needed, as well as the radiation losses during [[deuterium burning]], would shed doubt on its workability. Addition of expensive [[tritium]] to the thermonuclear mixture would likely lower its ignition temperature, but even so, nobody knew at that time how much tritium would be needed, and whether even tritium addition would encourage heat propagation. At the end of the conference, in spite of opposition by some members such as [[Robert Serber]], Teller submitted an unduly optimistic report in which he said that a hydrogen bomb was feasible, and that further work should be encouraged on its development. Fuchs had also participated in this conference, and transmitted this information to Moscow. The model of Teller's &quot;classical Super&quot; was so uncertain that Oppenheimer would later say that he wished the Russians were building their own hydrogen bomb based on that design, so that it would almost certainly retard their progress on it.&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes 1995, p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1946, Teller left Los Alamos to return to the University of Chicago as a professor and close associate of Enrico Fermi and [[Maria Goeppert-Mayer|Maria Mayer]].&lt;ref name=LLNL/&gt;
He was now known as the father of the hydrogen bomb.

==Hydrogen bomb==
[[Image:Teller-Ulam device 3D.svg|right|thumb|The [[Teller-Ulam design]] kept the fission and fusion fuel physically separated from one another, and used radiation from the primary device &quot;reflected&quot; off the surrounding casing to compress the secondary.]]

Following the [[Soviet Union]]'s first test detonation of an [[atomic bomb]] in 1949, President [[Harry Truman|Truman]] announced a crash development program for a [[hydrogen bomb]]. Teller returned to Los Alamos in 1950 to work on the project. He insisted on involving more theorists, such as [[Klaus Fuchs]]; it was Fuchs who later claimed to invent compression by means of radiation implosion back in 1946.&lt;ref&gt;Goncharov 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; However many of Teller's prominent colleagues, like Bethe and Oppenheimer, were sure that the project of the H-bomb was technically infeasible and politically undesirable. None of the available designs were yet workable. However Soviet scientists who had worked on their own hydrogen bomb have claimed that they developed it independently.&lt;ref name=&quot;bas&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author=Khariton, Yuli | coauthors=Yuri Smirnov | title=The Khariton version | journal=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists | volume=49 | issue=4 | month=May | year=1993 | pages=20–31 | authorlink=Yuli Khariton}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goncharov 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1950, calculations by the Polish mathematician [[Stanisław Ulam]] and his collaborator Cornelius Everett, along with confirmations by Fermi, had shown that not only was Teller's earlier estimate of the quantity of [[tritium]] needed for the H-bomb a low one, but that even with higher amounts of tritium, the energy loss in the fusion process would be too great to enable the fusion reaction to propagate. However, in 1951, in the joint report by Ulam and Teller of March 1951, &quot;Hydrodynamic Lenses and Radiation Mirrors&quot;, an innovative idea emerged, and it was developed into the first workable design for a megaton-range H-bomb. The exact contribution provided respectively from Ulam and Teller to what became known as the [[Teller–Ulam design]] is not definitively known in the public domain, and the exact contributions of each and how the final idea was arrived upon has been a point of dispute in both public and classified discussions since the early 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes 1995, pp. 461–472.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gorelik 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with ''[[Scientific American]]'' from 1999, Teller told the reporter:

:''&quot;I contributed; Ulam did not. I'm sorry I had to answer it in this abrupt way. Ulam was rightly dissatisfied with an old approach. He came to me with a part of an idea which I already had worked out and difficulty getting people to listen to. He was willing to sign a paper. When it then came to defending that paper and really putting work into it, he refused. He said, &lt;nowiki&gt;'I don't believe in it.'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;stix&quot;/&gt;

The issue is controversial. Bethe considered Teller's contribution to the invention of the H-bomb a true innovation as early as 1952,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Bethe, Hans | title=Memorandum on the History of the Thermonuclear Program | year=1952 | publisher=Federation of American Scientists | accessdate=2007-12-15 | url=http://www.fas.org/nuke/guide/usa/nuclear/bethe-52.htm | authorlink=Hans Bethe}}&lt;/ref&gt; and referred to his work as a &quot;stroke of genius&quot; in 1954.&lt;ref name=&quot;testimony&quot;&gt;
{{cite web | author=Bethe, Hans | title=Testimony in the Matter of J. Robert Oppenheimer | year=1954 | publisher=Atomic Archive | accessdate=2006-11-10 | url=http://www.atomicarchive.com/Docs/Oppenheimer/OppyTrial2.shtml | authorlink=Hans Bethe}}&lt;/ref&gt; In both cases, however, Bethe emphasized Teller's role as a way of stressing that the development of the H-bomb could not have been hastened by additional support or funding, and Teller greatly disagreed with Bethe's assessment. Other scientists (antagonistic to Teller, such as [[J. Carson Mark]]) have claimed that Teller would have never gotten any closer without the assistance of Ulam and others.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal| doi=10.2968/059004013 | first=Bengt | last=Carlson | title=How Ulam set the stage | journal=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists | date=July/August 2003 | pages=46–51 | volume=59 | issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ulam himself claimed that Teller only produced a &quot;more generalized&quot; version of Ulam's original design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Adventures of a Mathematician|author=Ulam, Stanislaw|year=1976|publisher=Scribner |isbn= 0-684-14391-7 |page=220}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The breakthrough—the details of which are still classified—was apparently the separation of the fission and fusion components of the weapons, and to use the [[radiation]] produced by the fission bomb to first compress the fusion fuel before igniting it. Ulam's idea seems to have been to use mechanical shock from the primary to encourage fusion in the secondary, while Teller quickly realized that radiation from the primary would do the job much earlier and more efficiently. Some members of the laboratory (J. Carson Mark in particular) later expressed that the idea to use the radiation would have eventually occurred to anyone working on the physical processes involved, and that the obvious reason why Teller thought of radiation right away was because he was already working on the &quot;[[Operation Greenhouse|Greenhouse]]&quot; tests for the spring of 1951, in which the effect of the energy from a fission bomb on a mixture of deuterium and tritium was going to be investigated.&lt;ref name=&quot;rhodes&quot;&gt;Rhodes 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whatever the actual components of the so-called Teller–Ulam design and the respective contributions of those who worked on it, after it was proposed it was immediately seen by the scientists working on the project as the answer which had been so long sought. Those who previously had doubted whether a fission-fusion bomb would be feasible at all were converted into believing that it was only a matter of time before both the USA and the USSR had developed [[TNT equivalent|multi-megaton]] weapons. Even Oppenheimer, who was originally opposed to the project, called the idea &quot;technically sweet.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Oppenheimer: The Tragic Intellect | author=Thorpe, Charles | year=2006 | publisher=University of Chicago Press | isbn=0-226-79845-3 | page=106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Ivy Mike H Bomb.jpg|right|thumb|The 10.4 [[TNT equivalent|Mt]] &quot;[[Ivy Mike]]&quot; shot of 1952 appeared to vindicate Teller's long-time advocacy for the [[hydrogen bomb]].]]

Though he had helped to come up with the design and had been a long-time proponent of the concept, Teller was not chosen to head the development project (his reputation of a thorny personality likely played a role in this). In 1952 he left Los Alamos and joined the newly established [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory|Livermore]] branch of the [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory|University of California Radiation Laboratory]], which had been created largely through his urging. After the detonation of &quot;[[Ivy Mike]]&quot;, the first thermonuclear weapon to utilize the Teller–Ulam configuration, on November 1, 1952, Teller became known in the press as the &quot;father of the hydrogen bomb.&quot; Teller himself refrained from attending the test—he claimed not to feel welcome at the [[Pacific Proving Grounds]]—and instead saw its results on a [[seismograph]] in the basement of a hall in Berkeley.&lt;ref name=&quot;rhodes&quot;/&gt;

There was an opinion that by analyzing the fallout from this test, the Soviets (led in their H-bomb work by [[Andrei Sakharov]]) could have deciphered the new American design. However, this was later denied by the Soviet bomb researchers.&lt;ref&gt;Gorelik 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Because of official secrecy, little information about the bomb's development was released by the government, and press reports often attributed the entire weapon's design and development to Teller and his new Livermore Laboratory (when it was actually developed by Los Alamos).&lt;ref name=&quot;bas&quot;/&gt;

Many of Teller's colleagues were irritated that he seemed to enjoy taking full credit for something he had only a part in, and in response, with encouragement from Enrico Fermi, Teller authored an article titled &quot;The Work of Many People,&quot; which appeared in ''Science'' magazine in February 1955, emphasizing that he was not alone in the weapon's development. He would later write in his memoirs that he had told a &quot;white lie&quot; in the 1955 article in order to &quot;soothe ruffled feelings&quot;, and claimed full credit for the invention.&lt;ref&gt;Teller, ''Memoirs'', p. 407, fn. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal | first=Soshichi | last=Uchii | title=Review of Edward Teller's Memoirs | journal=PHS Newsletter | volume=52 | date=2003-07-22 | url=http://www.bun.kyoto-u.ac.jp/phisci/archives/newsletters/newslet_52.html |accessdate=2009-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Teller was known for getting engrossed in projects which were theoretically interesting but practically unfeasible (the classic &quot;Super&quot; was one such project.)&lt;ref name=StanfordDeath/&gt; About his work on the hydrogen bomb, Bethe said:

:''&quot;Nobody will blame Teller because the calculations of 1946 were wrong, especially because adequate computing machines were not available at Los Alamos. But he was blamed at Los Alamos for leading the laboratory, and indeed the whole country, into an adventurous programme on the basis of calculations, which he himself must have known to have been very incomplete.&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Comments on The History of the H-Bomb | journal=Los Alamos Science | year=1982 | first=Hans A. | last=Bethe | volume=3 | issue=3 | page=47 | url=http://www.fas.org/sgp/othergov/doe/lanl/pubs/00285791.pdf | format=PDF | accessdate=2007-11-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Manhattan Project, Teller also advocated the development of a bomb using [[uranium]] hydride, which many of his fellow theorists said would be unlikely to work. At Livermore, Teller continued work on the [[hydride]] bomb, and the result was a dud. Ulam once wrote to a colleague about an idea he had shared with Teller: &quot;Edward is full of enthusiasm about these possibilities; this is perhaps an indication they will not work.&quot; Fermi once said that Teller was the only [[monomania]]c he knew who had several [[mania]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Herken 2002: Fermi on p. 25, Ulam on p. 137&lt;/ref&gt;

Carey Sublette of Nuclear Weapon Archive argues that Ulam came up with the radiation implosion compression design of thermonuclear weapons, but that on the other hand Teller has gotten little credit for being the first to propose [[fusion boosting]] in 1945, which is essential for miniaturization and reliability and is used in all of today's nuclear weapons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whyfiles.org/186ed_teller/4.html 3.

==Oppenheimer controversy==
[[Image:Edward Teller (1958)-LLNL.jpg|thumb|right|Teller testified about [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]] in 1954.]]

Teller became controversial in 1954 when he testified against [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]], a former head of Los Alamos and an advisor to the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]], at Oppenheimer's [[Oppenheimer security hearing|security clearance hearing]]. Teller had clashed with Oppenheimer many times at Los Alamos over issues relating both to fission and fusion research, and during Oppenheimer's trial he was the only member of the scientific community to label Oppenheimer a security risk.&lt;ref name='Lennick'&gt;Lennick, Michael. &quot;[http://americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2005/3/2005_3_54.shtml A Final Interview with Edward Teller]&quot;, ''American Heritage'', June/July 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Asked at the hearing by AEC attorney Roger Robb whether he was planning &quot;to suggest that Dr. Oppenheimer is disloyal to the United States,&quot; Teller replied that:

:''I do not want to suggest anything of the kind. I know Oppenheimer as an intellectually most alert and a very complicated person, and I think it would be presumptuous and wrong on my part if I would try in any way to analyze his motives. But I have always assumed, and I now assume that he is loyal to the United States. I believe this, and I shall believe it until I see very conclusive proof to the opposite.''&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web | first=Edward | last=Teller | title=In the Matter of J. Robert Oppenheimer: Transcript of Hearing Before Personnel Security Board | publisher=United States Government Printing Office | work=pbs.org | date=April 28, 1954 | url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/bomb/filmmore/reference/primary/tellertestimony.html | accessdate=2007-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, he was immediately asked whether he believed that Oppenheimer was a &quot;security risk&quot;, to which he testified:

:''In a great number of cases I have seen Dr. Oppenheimer act—I understood that Dr. Oppenheimer acted—in a way which for me was exceedingly hard to understand. I thoroughly disagreed with him in numerous issues and his actions frankly appeared to me confused and complicated. To this extent I feel that I would like to see the vital interests of this country in hands which I understand better, and therefore trust more. In this very limited sense I would like to express a feeling that I would feel personally more secure if public matters would rest in other hands.''&lt;ref name=&quot;testimony&quot;/&gt;

Teller also testified that Oppenheimer's opinion about the thermonuclear program seemed to be based more on the scientific feasibility of the weapon than anything else. He additionally testified that Oppenheimer's direction of Los Alamos was &quot;a very outstanding achievement&quot; both as a scientist and an administrator, lauding his &quot;very quick mind&quot; and that he made &quot;just a most wonderful and excellent director.&quot;&lt;!-- If the source of this is &quot;testimony&quot;, please add named ref --&gt;

After this, however, he detailed ways in which he felt that Oppenheimer had hindered his efforts towards an active thermonuclear development program, and at length criticized Oppenheimer's decisions not to invest more work onto the question at different points in his career, saying:

:''If it is a question of wisdom and judgment, as demonstrated by actions since 1945, then I would say one would be wiser not to grant clearance.''&lt;ref name=&quot;testimony&quot;/&gt;

Oppenheimer's security clearance was revoked after the hearing, because of his many associations with the [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party]] and how he lied about some of those associations. Most of Teller's former colleagues disapproved of his testimony and he became ostracized by much of the scientific community.&lt;ref name='Lennick'/&gt; After the fact, Teller consistently denied that he was intending to damn Oppenheimer, and even claimed that he was attempting to exonerate him. Documentary evidence has suggested that this was likely not the case, however. Six days before the testimony, Teller met with an AEC liaison officer and suggested &quot;deepening the charges&quot; in his testimony.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite news | author=Shapin, Steven | title=Megaton Man | publisher=London Review of Books | date=2002-04-25 | url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v24/n08/shap01_.html | accessdate=2007-11-24 | authorlink=Steven Shapin}} Review of Edward Teller's ''Memoirs''.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that Teller's testimony against Oppenheimer was an attempt to remove Oppenheimer from power so that Teller could become the leader of the American nuclear scientist community.&lt;ref name=&quot;mcmillan&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title=The Ruin of J. Robert Oppenheimer and The Birth of the Arms Race | author=McMillan, Priscilla | year=2005 | isbn=0-670-03422-3 | publisher=Viking}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Teller always insisted that his testimony had not significantly harmed Oppenheimer. In 2002, Teller contended that Oppenheimer was &quot;not destroyed&quot; by the security hearing but &quot;no longer asked to assist in policy matters.&quot; He claimed his words were an overreaction, because he had only just learned of Oppenheimer’s failure to immediately report an approach by Haakon Chevalier, who had approached Oppenheimer to help the Russians. Teller said that, in hindsight, he would have responded differently.&lt;ref name='Lennick'/&gt;

==US Government work and political advocacy==
After the Oppenheimer controversy, Teller became ostracized by much of the scientific community, but was still quite welcome in the government and military science circles. Along with his traditional advocacy for nuclear energy development, a strong nuclear arsenal, and a vigorous nuclear testing program, he had helped to develop [[nuclear reactor]] safety standards as the chair of the [[Reactor Safeguard Committee]] of the AEC in the late 1940s,&lt;ref&gt;Teller, ''Memoirs'', ch. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; and later headed an effort at [[General Atomics]] which designed research reactors in which a [[nuclear meltdown]] would be impossible (the [[TRIGA]]).&lt;ref&gt;Teller, ''Memoirs'', pp. 423–424.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Edward Teller on television.jpg|thumb|right|During the 1960s, Teller argued vigorously against the proposed [[Partial Test Ban Treaty|nuclear test ban]], testifying before Congress as well as on television.]]
Teller promoted increased defense spending to counter the perceived Soviet missile threat. He was a signatory to the 1958 report by the military sub-panel of the Rockefeller Brothers funded [[Special Studies Project]], which called for a $3 billion annual increase in America's military budget.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

He was Director of the [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] (1958–1960), which he helped to found (along with [[Ernest O. Lawrence]]), and after that he continued as an Associate Director. He chaired the committee that founded the [[Space Sciences Laboratory]] at Berkeley. He also served concurrently as a Professor of Physics at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. He was a tireless advocate of a strong nuclear program and argued for continued testing and development—in fact, he stepped down from the directorship of Livermore so that he could better [[Lobbying|lobby]] against the proposed [[Partial Test Ban Treaty|test ban]].&lt;ref&gt;Herken, p. 330.&lt;/ref&gt; He testified against the test ban both before Congress as well as on television.

Teller established the Department of Applied Science at the [[University of California, Davis]] and [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory|LLNL]] in 1963, which holds the Edward Teller endowed professorship in his honor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | title=Hertz Foundation Makes US$1 Million Endowment in Honor of Edward Teller | date=1999-06-14 | accessdate=2007-11-24 | url=http://www.news.ucdavis.edu/search/news_detail.lasso?id=4550 | publisher=UC Davis News Service}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975 he retired from both the lab and Berkeley, and was named Director Emeritus of the Livermore Laboratory and appointed Senior Research Fellow at the [[Hoover Institution]].&lt;ref name=StanfordDeath&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.stanford.edu/news/2003/september24/tellerobit-924.html | work=Stanford Report | publisher=Stanford News Service | date=September 10, 2003 | title=Edward Teller, 'Father of the Hydrogen Bomb,' is dead at 95 | author=Shurkin, Joel N | accessdate=2007-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983, he spoke at ''The Thomas Jefferson School'', a conference of intellectuals discussing [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]] organized by economist Professor [[George Reisman]], where he received a standing ovation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.capitalism.net/TJS%20Mission%20Statement.htm The Jefferson School of Philosophy, Economics, and Psychology] (Address is P.O. Box)&lt;/ref&gt; After the fall of [[communism]] in Hungary in 1989, he made several visits to his country of origin, and paid careful attention to the political changes there.

==Operation Plowshare and Project Chariot==
[[Image:Project Chariot plans.jpg|right|thumb|One of the ''Chariot'' schemes involved chaining five thermonuclear devices to create the artificial harbor.]]

Teller was one of the strongest and best-known advocates for investigating [[Peaceful nuclear explosions|non-military uses]] of nuclear explosives, which the United States explored under [[Operation Plowshare]]. One of the most controversial projects he proposed was a plan to use a multi-megaton hydrogen bomb to dig a deep-water harbor more than a mile long and half a mile wide to use for shipment of resources from coal and oil fields through [[Point Hope, Alaska|Point Hope]], Alaska. The [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] accepted Teller's proposal in 1958 and it was designated [[Operation Chariot (1958)|Project Chariot]]. While the AEC was scouting out the Alaskan site, and having withdrawn the land from the public domain, Teller publicly advocated the economic benefits of the plan, but was unable to convince local government leaders that the plan was financially viable.&lt;ref&gt;O'Neill 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other scientists criticized the project as being potentially unsafe for the local wildlife and the [[Inupiat people|Inupiat]] people living near the designated area, who were not officially told of the plan until March 1960.&lt;ref&gt;O'Neill, ''Firecracker Boys'', pp, 97, 111; Broad, ''Teller's War'', p.48.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, it turned out that the harbor would be ice-bound for nine months out of the year. In the end, due to the financial infeasibility of the project and the concerns over radiation-related health issues, the project was cancelled in 1962.

A related experiment which also had Teller's endorsement was a plan to extract oil from the [[Athabasca Oil Sands|tar sands]] in northern [[Alberta]] with nuclear explosions. The plan actually received the endorsement of the Alberta government, but was rejected by the [[Government of Canada]] under [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[John Diefenbaker]], who was opposed to having any nuclear weapons in Canada, although Canada had nuclear weapons from 1963 to 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Frank | last=Loreto | title=Review of ''Nuclear Dynamite'' | publisher=CM Magazine | volume=8 | issue=17 | date=2002-04-26 | url=http://www.umanitoba.ca/outreach/cm/vol8/no17/nucleardynamite.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=John | last=Clearwater | title=Canadian Nuclear Weapons | publisher=Dundurn Press (Toronto) | year=1998 | url=http://www.user.dccnet.com/welcomewoods/Nuclear_Free_Georgia_Strait/clearwater.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nuclear technology and Israel==
For some twenty years, Teller advised Israel on nuclear matters in general, and on the building of a hydrogen bomb in particular.&lt;ref name=basement&gt;{{cite book | title=The Bomb in the Basement | author=Karpin, Michael  | isbn=0-7432-6595-5 | year=2005 | pages=289–293 | publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster Paperbacks | location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1952, Teller and Oppenheimer had a long meeting with [[David Ben-Gurion]] in Tel Aviv, telling him that the best way to accumulate plutonium was to burn natural uranium in a nuclear reactor. Starting in 1964, a connection between Teller and Israel was made by the physicist [[Yuval Neeman]], who had similar political views. Between 1964 and 1967, Teller visited Israel six times, lecturing at Tel Aviv University, and advising the chiefs of Israel's scientific-security circle as well as prime ministers and cabinet members. At each of his talks with members of the Israeli security establishment's highest levels he would make them swear that they would never be tempted into signing the [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty]]. In 1967 when the Israeli program was nearing completion, Teller informed Neeman that he was going to tell the [[CIA]] that Israel had built nuclear weapons and explain that it was justified by the background of the [[Six-Day War]]. After Neeman cleared it with Prime Minister [[Levi Eshkol]], Teller briefed the head of the CIA's Office of Science and Technology, Carl Duckett. It took a year for Teller to convince the CIA that Israel had obtained nuclear capability; the information then went through CIA Director [[Richard Helms]] and then to the US president. Teller also persuaded them to end the American attempts to inspect the [[Negev Nuclear Research Center]] in Dimona.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

==Three Mile Island==
Teller suffered a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] in 1979, which he blamed on [[Jane Fonda]]; after the [[Three Mile Island accident]], the actress outspokenly lobbied against [[nuclear reactor|nuclear power]] while promoting her latest movie, ''[[The China Syndrome]]'' (a movie depicting a nuclear accident which coincidentally was released only a little over a week before the actual incident.) In response, Teller acted quickly to lobby in favor of nuclear energy, testifying to its safety and reliability, and after such a flurry of activity suffered the attack. Teller authored a two-page spread in the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' which appeared on July 31, 1979, under the headline &quot;I was the only victim of Three-Mile Island&quot;, which opened with:

{{cquote|On May 7, a few weeks after the accident at Three-Mile Island, I was in Washington. I was there to refute some of that [[propaganda]] that [[Ralph Nader]], Jane Fonda and their kind are spewing to the news media in their attempt to frighten people away from nuclear power. I am 71 years old, and I was working 20 hours a day. The strain was too much. The next day, I suffered a heart attack. You might say that I was the only one whose health was affected by that reactor near Harrisburg. No, that would be wrong. It was not the reactor. It was Jane Fonda. Reactors are not dangerous.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;I was the only victim of Three-Mile Island,&quot; [advertisement] ''The Washington Post'', (July 31, 1979): 24–25.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The next day, ''[[The New York Times]]'' ran an editorial criticizing the ad, noting that it was sponsored by [[Dresser Industries]], the firm that had manufactured one of the defective valves that contributed to the Three Mile Island accident.&lt;ref name=&quot;broad&quot;&gt;Broad 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strategic Defense Initiative==
[[Image:Edward Teller and Ronald Reagan.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Teller became a major lobbying force of the [[Strategic Defense Initiative]] to President [[Ronald Reagan]] in the 1980s.]]

In the 1980s, Teller began a strong campaign for what was later called the [[Strategic Defense Initiative]] (SDI), derided by critics as &quot;Star Wars,&quot; the concept of using ground and satellite-based lasers, particle beams and missiles to destroy incoming Soviet [[ICBM]]s. Teller lobbied with government agencies—and got the approval of President [[Ronald Reagan]]—for a plan to develop a system using elaborate [[satellite]]s which used atomic weapons to fire [[X-ray]] lasers at incoming missiles— as part of a broader scientific research program into defenses against nuclear weapons. However, scandal erupted when Teller (and his associate [[Lowell Wood]]) were accused of deliberately overselling the program and perhaps had encouraged the dismissal of a laboratory director (Roy Woodruff) who had attempted to correct the error.&lt;ref name=&quot;broad&quot;/&gt; His claims led to a joke which circulated in the scientific community, that a new unit of unfounded optimism was designated as the teller; one teller was so large that most events had to be measured in nanotellers or picotellers. Many prominent scientists argued that the system was futile. Bethe, along with [[IBM]] physicist [[Richard Garwin]] and [[Cornell University]] colleague Kurt Gottfried, wrote an article in ''Scientific American'' which analyzed the system and concluded that any putative enemy could disable such a system by the use of suitable decoys. The project's funding was eventually scaled back.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

Many scientists opposed strategic defense on moral or political rather than purely technical grounds. They argued that, even if an effective system could be produced, it would undermine the system of [[Mutually Assured Destruction]] (MAD) that had prevented all-out war between the western democracies and the communist bloc. An effective defense, they contended, would make such a war &quot;winnable&quot; and therefore more likely.&lt;ref name=&quot;broad&quot;/&gt;

Despite (or perhaps because of) his hawkish reputation, Teller made a public point of noting that he regretted the use of the first atomic bombs on civilian cities during World War II. He further claimed that before the bombing of [[Hiroshima]] he had indeed lobbied Oppenheimer to use the weapons first in a &quot;demonstration&quot; which could be witnessed by the [[Japanese people|Japanese]] high-command and citizenry before using them to inflict thousands of deaths. The &quot;father of the hydrogen bomb&quot; would use this quasi-anti-nuclear stance (he would say that he believed nuclear weapons to be unfortunate, but that the [[arms race]] was unavoidable due to the intractable nature of Communism) to promote technologies such as SDI, arguing that they were needed to make sure that nuclear weapons could never be used again (''Better a shield than a sword'' was the title of one of his books on the subject).{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

However, there is contrary evidence. In the 1970s, a letter of Teller to [[Leó Szilárd]] emerged, dated July 2, 1945:

:''&quot;Our only hope is in getting the facts of our results before the people. This might help convince everybody the next war would be fatal. For this purpose, actual combat-use might even be the best thing.&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;Teller, Edward: Better a Shield than a Sword: Perspectives on Defense and Technology, The Free Press, New York, 1987 p. 57 ISBN 0-02-932461-0.&lt;/ref&gt;

The historian [[Barton Bernstein]] argued that it is an &quot;unconvincing claim&quot; by Teller that he was a &quot;covert dissenter&quot; to the use of the weapon.&lt;ref&gt;Essay Review-From the A-Bomb to Star Wars: Edward Teller's History. Better A Shield Than a Sword: Perspectives on Defense and Technology ''Technology and Culture'', Vol. 31, No. 4. (Oct., 1990), p. 848&lt;/ref&gt; In his 2001 ''Memoirs'', Teller claims that he did lobby Oppenheimer, but that Oppenheimer had convinced him that he should take no action and that the scientists should leave military questions in the hands of the military; Teller claims he was not aware that Oppenheimer and other scientists were being consulted as to the actual use of the weapon and implies that Oppenheimer was being hypocritical.&lt;ref&gt;Teller, ''Memoirs'', pp. 206–209.&lt;/ref&gt;

Teller's own comments on the role of lasers in SDI, as disclosed in live panel discussions, were published, and are available, in two laser conference proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;Wang, C. P.  (Ed.), ''Proceedings of the International Conference on Lasers '85'' (STS, McLean, Va, 1986).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Duarte, F. J.  (Ed.), ''Proceedings of the International Conference on Lasers '87'' (STS, McLean, Va, 1988).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
[[Image:Edward Teller (later years).jpg|thumb|right|250px|Edward Teller in his later years]]
[[Image:Edward Teller After Dark 3rd July 1987.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Appearing on television discussion ''[[After Dark (TV series)|After Dark]]'' in 1987]]
In his early career, Teller made contributions to [[nuclear physics|nuclear]] and [[molecular physics]], [[spectroscopy]] (the [[Jahn–Teller effect|Jahn–Teller]] and [[Renner–Teller effect|Renner–Teller]] effects), and [[surface physics]]. His extension of Fermi's theory of [[beta decay]] (in the form of the so-called [[Gamow–Teller transitions]]) provided an important stepping stone in the applications of this theory. The Jahn–Teller effect and the [[BET theory]] have retained their original formulation and are still mainstays in physics and chemistry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goodchild 2005, p. 36&quot;/&gt; Teller also made contributions to [[Thomas–Fermi model|Thomas–Fermi theory]], the precursor of [[density functional theory]], a standard modern tool in the quantum mechanical treatment of complex molecules. In 1953, along with [[Nicholas Metropolis]] and [[Marshall Rosenbluth]], Teller co-authored a paper&lt;ref name=&quot;Metropolis, N. 1953&quot;/&gt; which is a standard starting point for the applications of the [[Monte Carlo method]] to [[statistical mechanics]].

Teller's vigorous advocacy for strength through nuclear weapons, especially when so many of his wartime colleagues later expressed regret about the arms race, made him an easy target for the &quot;[[mad scientist]]&quot; stereotype. In 1991 he was awarded one of the first [[Ig Nobel Prize]]s for Peace in recognition of his &quot;lifelong efforts to change the meaning of peace as we know it&quot;. He was also rumored to be one of the inspirations for the character of [[Dr. Strangelove, or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb|Dr. Strangelove]] in [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s 1964 [[satire|satirical]] film of the same name&lt;ref name=StanfordDeath/&gt; (others speculated to be [[RAND Corporation|RAND]] theorist [[Herman Kahn]], rocket scientist [[Wernher von Braun]], and [[Secretary of Defense]] [[Robert McNamara]]). In the aforementioned ''Scientific American'' interview from 1999, he was reported as having bristled at the question: &quot;My name is not Strangelove. I don't know about Strangelove. I'm not interested in Strangelove. What else can I say?... Look. Say it three times more, and I throw you out of this office.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;stix&quot;/&gt;
Nobel Prize winning physicist [[Isidor I. Rabi]] once suggested that &quot;It would have been a better world without Teller.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;This quote has been primarily attributed to Rabi in many news sources (see, e.g., McKie, Robin, [http://books.guardian.co.uk/reviews/scienceandnature/0,6121,1207700,00.html Megaton megalomaniac], ''The Observer'', May 2, 2004), but it has also in a few reputable sources been attributed to Hans Bethe (i.e. in the [http://www.brotherhoodofthebomb.com/bhbmedia/notes_epilogue.doc notes to the Epilogue in Herken 2002], note 40).&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Teller's false claims that Stanislaw Ulam made no significant contribution to the development of the hydrogen bomb (despite Ulam's key insights of using compression and staging elements to generate the thermonuclear reaction) and his personal attacks on Oppenheimer caused even greater animosity within the general physics community towards Teller.&lt;ref name=&quot;mcmillan&quot;/&gt;

In 1986, he was awarded the [[United States Military Academy|United States Military Academy's]] [[Sylvanus Thayer Award]].&lt;ref name=MOF&gt;{{cite web|title=Presidential Medal of Freedom Recipient Dr. Edward Teller|publisher=Presidential Medal of Freedom}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]], and the [[American Nuclear Society]].&lt;ref name=LLNL&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.llnl.gov/llnl/history/edward_teller.html|title=About the lab:Edward Teller—A Life Dedicated to Science|publisher=Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory|date=January 7, 2004|accessdate=2007-11-28 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080418072655/http://www.llnl.gov/llnl/history/edward_teller.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the honors he received were the [[Albert Einstein Award]], the [[Enrico Fermi Award]], the [[:hu:Corvin-lánc|Corvin Chain]] and the [[National Medal of Science]].&lt;ref name=MOF/&gt; He was also named as part of the group of &quot;U.S. Scientists&quot; who were ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine's [[Time Magazine Person of the Year|People of the Year]] in 1960,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/subscriber/personoftheyear/archive/stories/1960.html|title=Time Person of the year, 1960: U.S. Scientists|publisher=''Time'' magazine|date=January 2, 1961|accessdate=2007-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an asteroid, [[5006 Teller]], is named after him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/ames/pdf/80021main_112700Astrogram.pdf |format=PDF|title=The Ames Astrogram: Teller visits Ames|page=6|publisher=NASA|date=November 27, 2000|accessdate=2007-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded with the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] by President [[George W.
