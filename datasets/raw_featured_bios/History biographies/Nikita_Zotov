Count '''Nikita Moiseevich Zotov'''&lt;ref name=&quot;Hughes423&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Hughes|1998|p=423}}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-ru|Никита Моисеевич Зотов}}) (1644&lt;ref name=&quot;Encyclopedic Dictionary Short&quot; /&gt;&amp;nbsp;– December 1717&lt;ref name=&quot;Hughes2004-120-121&quot; /&gt;) was a childhood tutor and life-long friend of Russian [[Tsar]] [[Peter the Great]]. Historians disagree on the quality of Zotov's tutoring. [[Robert K. Massie]], for example, praises his efforts, but [[Lindsey Hughes]] criticizes the education that he gave to the future Tsar.

Not much is known about Zotov's life aside from his connection to Peter. Zotov left Moscow for a diplomatic mission to [[Crimea]] in 1680 and returned to Moscow before 1683. He became part of the &quot;Jolly Company&quot;, a group of several dozen of Peter's friends that eventually became [[The All-Joking, All-Drunken Synod of Fools and Jesters]]. Zotov was mockingly appointed &quot;Prince-Pope&quot; of the Synod, and regularly led them in games and celebrations. He accompanied Peter on many important occasions, such as the [[Azov campaigns]] and the torture of the [[Streltsy]] after their [[Streltsy Uprising|uprising]]. Zotov held a number of state posts, including from 1701 a leading position in the Tsar's personal secretariat. Three years before his death, Zotov married a woman 50&amp;nbsp;years his junior. He died in December 1717 of unknown causes.

===Background===
[[Alexis of Russia|Alexis I]], [[Tsar#Russia|Tsar of Russia]], married twice in his lifetime, first to [[Maria Miloslavskaya]] and then to [[Natalia Naryshkina]] after Maria's death.&lt;ref name=&quot;Massie18-21&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Massie|1981|pp=18–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peter I was born to Natalia Naryshkina on 30 May 1672.&lt;ref name=&quot;Massie22&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Massie|1981|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the death of Tsar Alexis on 8 February 1676,&lt;ref name=&quot;Massie25&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Massie|1981|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peter's [[half-brother]] and [[Godparent|godfather]] [[Feodor III of Russia|Feodor]], the &quot;semi-invalid eldest surviving son of [[Maria Miloslavskaya]]&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Massie26&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Massie|1981|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; became the Tsar of Russia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Massie26&quot; /&gt; [[Ivan Miloslavsky]], Feodor's uncle, returned to Moscow from virtual exile as Governor of [[Astrakhan]] to become Chief Minister. His family had not been in power for some time as a result of Tsar Alexis' remarriage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Massie26&quot; /&gt; As a result, Ivan Miloslavsky hated the Naryshkin family, which included Peter, Natalia Naryshkina, and Natalia's foster father, [[Artamon Matveyev]]. When a new ruling family took over, the previous ruling family was usually banished to a ceremonial position somewhere far from Moscow. Instead, Ivan Miloslavsky tried to arrest the Naryshkins, but Feodor would only permit him to exile Artamon Matveyev. Feodor was fond of his half-brother Peter and Peter's mother, and both were allowed to remain in the [[Kremlin]] in private apartments.&lt;ref name=&quot;Massie26&quot; /&gt;

Most 17th-century [[Muscovites]] received little education, and there were low levels of literacy even among the nobility, education for whom typically consisted of a little reading, writing, and a small amount of history and geography. Religious scholars were usually the exception to this rule and were often also taught grammar, mathematics, and foreign languages. Two of Tsar Alexis' children—Feodor, and his sister [[Tsarevna Sophia Alekseyevna of Russia|Tsarevna Sophia]]—received a thorough education from the religious scholars of [[Kiev]], and could speak [[Latin]] and [[Polish language|Polish]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Massie26&quot; /&gt;

At the age of three, in 1674 or 1675, Peter received a [[Alphabet book|primer]] from Tsar Alexis to help him learn the alphabet;&lt;ref name=&quot;Massie27&quot; /&gt; two years later, Tsar Feodor suggested to Peter's mother that he begin his studies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Massie27&quot; /&gt; Estimates of the exact year when Peter's tutoring began range widely; numerous authors refer to a starting date as early as 1677,&lt;ref name=&quot;Massie27&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kamenskiĭ&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Kamenskiĭ|1987|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as late as 1683,&lt;ref name=&quot;Бердников&quot;&gt;Бердников 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hughes3&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Hughes|1998|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; though multiple references specifically identify 12 March 1677 as the beginning of Peter's tutoring.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boguslavsky487&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Boguslavsky|2004|p=487}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ламбин42-43&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Ламбин|1844|pp=42–43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nikita Zotov, a former church clerk,&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Nikiforov|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; or &quot;Duma secretary&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bushkovitch179&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Bushkovitch|2001|p=179}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the tax-collection department of the governmental bureaucracy,&lt;ref name=&quot;Massie27&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Massie|1981|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; was chosen to teach Peter to read and write.&lt;ref name=&quot;Massie27&quot; /&gt;

===Appointment and instruction===
[[File:Zotov and Peter I.jpg|thumb|right|Nikita Zotov and Peter I]]
Zotov was not a religious scholar, but he knew the [[Bible]] well—an important qualification for [[Natalia Naryshkina|Tsaritsa Natalia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Massie27&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Boguslavsky487&quot; /&gt; Although he did not expect it, he was well rewarded before he had even started his work, receiving from Feodor and the Tsaritsa, as well as [[Patriarch Joachim]], gifts including a set of apartments, two new sets of clothing, and 100 [[ruble]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Massie27&quot; /&gt; He was also raised to the rank of a [[Russian nobility|minor nobleman]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Massie27&quot; /&gt; Zotov was deeply humbled and overwhelmed by the Tsaritsa's request, and was enthralled at the prospect of teaching Peter.&lt;ref name=&quot;Massie27&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Boguslavsky487&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Boguslavsky|2004|pp=487–488}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zotov and Peter quickly became good friends, and Zotov remained close to Peter until the former's death.&lt;ref name=&quot;Massie27-28&quot; /&gt;

Peter's first lesson began the morning after Zotov was appointed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Massie27&quot; /&gt; After the books were sprinkled with [[holy water]], Zotov began his instruction; first in the alphabet, and then the Prayer Book. He taught the Bible, from which Peter learned long passages that he could still recite from memory forty years later.&lt;ref name=&quot;Massie27&quot; /&gt; Zotov also taught his student to sing, and in his later years Peter often spontaneously accompanied choirs at church services.&lt;ref name=&quot;Massie27&quot; /&gt; Although initially tasked only to teach reading and writing, Zotov found Peter to be intellectually curious, and interested in all that he could impart. Peter asked for lessons on Russian history, battles, and heroes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Massie27&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hosking77&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Hosking|1998|p=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Zotov's request, the Tsaritsa ordered engravings of &quot;foreign cities and palaces, sailing ships, weapons and historical events&quot; to be brought from the Ordnance Office.&lt;ref name=&quot;Massie27&quot; /&gt; Zotov placed them in the study room, along with a somewhat accurate [[globe]] for the time, to divert Peter when he became bored with his studies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Massie27&quot; /&gt; Other informal &quot;makeshift&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Massie72&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Massie|1981|p=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; tutors (foreign and domestic)&lt;ref name=&quot;Massie67-75&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Massie|1981|pp=67–75}}&lt;/ref&gt; and servants, were brought in for rowdy outdoor games with live ammunition. They were also to instruct Peter in other subjects such as royal and military history,&lt;ref name=&quot;Massie67-70&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Massie|1981|pp=67–70}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[blacksmithing]], carpentry, [[Woodworking joints|joinery]], printing,&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Massie70-71&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Massie|1981|pp=70–71}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, unusually for Russian nobility at the time, sailing and shipbuilding.&lt;ref name=&quot;Massie72-75&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Massie|1981|pp=72–75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impact===
[[File:Nikita Zotov.jpg|thumb|left|Nikita Zotov]]
Zotov became one of Peter's first friends, and the two remained close throughout Zotov's life. Twentieth-century historian [[Lindsey Hughes]] has criticized Zotov for giving Peter an education that did not teach what a future Tsar ought to know.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hughes3, 463&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Hughes|1998|pp=3, 463}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her contemporary, [[Robert K. Massie]], has argued that the education was the best possible one for a curious boy like Peter, because it was unlikely that he would ever become Tsar, as his half-brother, [[Ivan V of Russia|Ivan V]], was before him in the line of succession. According to Massie, although Zotov may have not taught Peter at the highest possible level, he delivered &quot;the best education for a mind like Peter's&quot;, as it &quot;stimulated [Peter's] curiosity&quot; and allowed him to become &quot;in large part, a self-taught man&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Massie27-28&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Massie|1981|pp=27–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zotov's closeness to the Tsar later became a source of worry to others in government, many of whom—including even the powerful [[Aleksandr Danilovich Menshikov|Menshikov]]—feared his influence.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hughes423&quot; /&gt;

In 1680, Zotov embarked on a three-year diplomatic mission to the [[Crimea]]; sources disagree on whether this was before or after he tutored Peter.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bain208&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Bain|1967|p=208}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Peter left the [[Kremlin]] to spend his childhood at [[Preobrazhenskoye District|Preobrazhenskoye]], two years after Zotov's departure, his memories of the tutors who had taught his siblings, Feodor and Sophia, were so negative that he cut himself off from traditional academic subjects for a time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Massie71&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Massie|1981|p=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later resumed his studies under [[Afanassyi Nesterov]] and Zotov after the latter's return from the Crimea.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wittram88&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Wittram|1964|p=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Peter sought to learn of nature and military matters rather than literature or theology,&lt;ref name=&quot;Massie71&quot; /&gt; he nevertheless learned a great deal of the latter from his tutors.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wittram88&quot; /&gt; Zotov (and later his sons)&lt;ref name=&quot;Brechka5&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Brechka|1982|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; later worked with Peter to translate books about [[fortification]] from a Western European language into Russian.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gitermann421&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Gitermann|1945|p=421}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peter did not learn, or forgot, a great deal about mathematics, a subject that he had to learn properly in his late teens for use in [[siege|siege warfare]] and [[fortification]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Williams251-252&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Williams|1907|pp=251–252}}&lt;/ref&gt; In later years, Peter regretted his lack of a fuller education, and sought to give his daughters [[Grand Duchess Anna Petrovna of Russia|Anne]] and [[Elizabeth of Russia|Elizabeth]] educations equivalent of any European princess.&lt;ref name=&quot;Massie71, 806-807&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Massie|1981|pp=71, 806–807}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Massie|2011|pp=29–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prince-Pope of Drunken Synod==
In 1692, Peter, who by then was Tsar of Russia,&lt;ref name=&quot;Massie108&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Massie|1981|p=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; organized himself and several dozen of his friends into [[The All-Joking, All-Drunken Synod of Fools and Jesters]], a &quot;[[synod]]&quot; that parodied religion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bushkovitch16&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Bushkovitch|1990|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he had a reputation for sobriety and fasting,&lt;ref name=&quot;Бердников&quot; /&gt; Zotov was appointed the &quot;Prince-Pope&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Massie120&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Massie|1981|p=120}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the Synod because of that very fact.&lt;ref name=&quot;Бердников&quot; /&gt; He was sometimes even referred to as Patriarch [[Dionysus|Bacchus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hughes2004-31&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Hughes|2004|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peter forced him to participate in the parties even when Zotov claimed sickness and exhaustion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Бердников&quot; /&gt;

However, Zotov soon grew to be a key participant in the mocking celebrations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Бердников&quot; /&gt; After first drinking to everyone's health, he &quot;blessed&quot; the group with the [[Sign of the Cross]], using two long Dutch pipes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Massie119-120&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Massie|1981|pp=119–120}}&lt;/ref&gt; On holidays, the games were played on the streets of Moscow, and at [[Christmas]], the Jolly Company rode around the city singing on [[sleigh]]s, with Zotov at their head, on a sleigh pulled by twelve bald men. Zotov wore a highly unusual costume—his outfit was adorned with playing cards; he wore a tin hat; and he sat upon a barrel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Massie120&quot; /&gt; During the first week of [[Lent]], a procession of &quot;penitents&quot; followed Zotov through the city on donkeys, oxen, and sleighs pulled by goats, pigs, and bears.&lt;ref name=&quot;Massie120&quot; /&gt;

In 1695 and 1696, Peter the Great mounted [[Azov campaigns|two campaigns against the Turkish garrison of Azov]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Massie136-148&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Massie|1981|pp=136–148}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the campaign in 1695 was ultimately unsuccessful, the 1696 one succeeded.&lt;ref name=&quot;Massie136-148&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;R&amp;S355&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Robson|Stedall|2009|p=355}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Russians surrounded the city with both men and ships and breached the wall, causing the [[Pasha]] of [[Azov]] to &quot;surrender under honorable conditions&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Massie146&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Massie|1981|p=146}}&lt;/ref&gt; The people of Moscow were amazed by the news of the surrender; not since the reign of Peter's father Alexis had a Russian army been victorious.&lt;ref name=&quot;Massie147&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Massie|1981|p=147}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peter delayed his return home to allow [[Andrew Vinius]], another member of the All-Joking Company,&lt;ref name=&quot;Massie113&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Massie|1981|p=113}}&lt;/ref&gt; time to set up a [[victory parade]] through the capital.&lt;ref name=&quot;Massie147&quot; /&gt; The army returned home on 10 October, but instead of a traditional Orthodox reception, the army marched through an [[arch]] seemingly supported by [[Hercules]] and [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Massie147-148&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Massie|1981|pp=147–148}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to the custom for a tsar, Peter did not ride at the head of the procession, but instead allowed it to be led by 18 horsemen leading carriages carrying Zotov and the war hero [[Fedor Golovin]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Massie148&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Massie|1981|p=148}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Grey91&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Grey|1960|p=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Troyat83&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Troyat|1987|p=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hughes18&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Hughes|1998|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While on a [[Grand Embassy of Peter I|tour of Europe]] in 1698, Peter learned that the [[Streltsy]] had [[Streltsy Uprising|rebelled]], and immediately rushed home from Vienna.&lt;ref name=&quot;Massie249&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Massie|1981|p=249}}&lt;/ref&gt; After defeating the rebellious regiments, Peter angrily ordered the torture of those who had incited the Streltsy to rebel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Massie249&quot; /&gt; For almost a month and a half, men from Peter's Jolly Company, including [[Fyodor Romodanovsky]], Boris Golitsyn, and Zotov, led the torture in secret.&lt;ref name=&quot;Massie254-255&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Massie|1981|pp=254–255}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1701, Zotov was made the head of the Tsar's newly created [[Privy council|Privy Council]], a committee akin to the defunct [[Duma]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Wittram108&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Wittram|1964|p=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;LeDonne238&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|LeDonne|1987|p=238}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1710, Peter made Zotov a [[count]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Encyclopedic Dictionary Short&quot;&gt;{{cite web |year=1890–1907 |title=Зотов, Никита Моисеевич |url=http://gatchina3000.ru/great-soviet-encyclopedia/bse/048/658.htm |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fgatchina3000.ru%2Fgreat-soviet-encyclopedia%2Fbse%2F048%2F658.htm&amp;date=2009-08-08 |work=Энциклопедия Брокгауза и Эфрона ([[Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary]]) |publisher=Ф.

Nikita Zotov was twice married, and had three sons from his first marriage.

According to Robert K. Massie and Lindsey Hughes, Peter told Zotov in October 1713 that he intended to have him marry a second time, to Anna Pashkova, a widow 50 years Zotov's junior, despite Zotov's wish to spend his final years in a [[monastery]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hughes2004-109-110&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Hughes|2004|pp=109–110}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Massie618&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Massie|1981|p=618}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the ''[[Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary]]'' and [[Sergey Solovyov]] say that Zotov came up with the idea to marry Pashkova in 1714, and that his plan to become a monk was merely a joke.&lt;ref name=&quot;Solovyov2001&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Encyclopedic Dictionary&quot;&gt;{{cite web|year=1890–1907|title=Зотов, Никита Моисеевич |url=http://gatchina3000.ru/brockhaus-and-efron-encyclopedic-dictionary/042/42435.htm |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fgatchina3000.ru%2Fbrockhaus-and-efron-encyclopedic-dictionary%2F042%2F42435.htm&amp;date=2009-08-08 |work=Энциклопедия Брокгауза и Эфрона ([[Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary]]) |publisher=Ф.

The wedding was described by [[Friedrich Christian Weber]], the ambassador of [[Hanover]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Massie613&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Massie|1981|p=613}}&lt;/ref&gt; as &quot;solemnized by the court in masks&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Massie618&quot; /&gt; Guests were instructed to pre-register in groups of three with their costumes so as not to look too similar to other guests.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hughes2004-109&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Hughes|2004|p=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; Witnesses described the event, which took place on 27 and 28 January 1715, and which had been prepared for three months,&lt;ref name=&quot;Massie618&quot; /&gt; as a &quot;world turned upside-down&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hughes2004-110&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Hughes|2004|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jolly Company dressed in ridiculous regalia, and many people behaved exactly opposite to the norm; &quot;invitations to the guests were delivered by stammerers, the bridesmen were cripples, the runners were fat men with gout, the priest was allegedly one hundred years old&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hughes254&quot; /&gt; (and blind).&lt;ref name=&quot;Cracraft18&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Cracraft|1971|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hughes notes that the event may have been a &quot;variation on the Western ''[[charivari]]'' or shaming ceremonies&quot;, through which the Tsar could demonstrate how much power he had over his subjects' lives.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hughes2004-110&quot; /&gt; During the wedding, the Drunken Synod routinely sang [[Carol (music)|carols]] in the streets of Moscow and demanded money, which became a New Year tax for the wealthy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hughes254&quot; /&gt;

==Death==
Nikita Zotov died in December 1717 of unknown causes. Peter wasted no time in moving on, at least publicly; he replaced Zotov as &quot;Prince-Pope&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hughes2004-120-121&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Hughes|2004|pp=120–121}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Peter Buturlin]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Hughes254&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Troyat229&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Troyat|1987|p=229}}&lt;/ref&gt; by &quot;electing&quot; him on 28 December 1717, and appointing him on 10 January 1718.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hughes254&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Hughes|1998|p=254}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peter even ordered that Zotov's widow be married to Buturlin in the fall of 1721.&lt;ref name=&quot;Troyat248&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Troyat|1987|p=248}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a disagreement between Konon Zotov and his stepmother over the division of Nikita Zotov's estate; Konon tried to declare Nikita's second marriage illegitimate, to avoid having to give any money to his stepmother's family.&lt;ref name=&quot;Solovyov2001&quot; /&gt;
