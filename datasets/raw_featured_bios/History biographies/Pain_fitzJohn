'''Pain fitzJohn''' (sometimes '''Payn fitzJohn''',&lt;ref name=CP270&gt;Cockayne ''Complete Peerage'' '''XII/2''' pp. 270–271&lt;/ref&gt; '''Payn FitzJohn''',&lt;ref name=Govern15&gt;Green ''Government of England'' p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; or '''Pagan fitzJohn''';&lt;ref name=DD919/&gt; died 1137) was an [[Anglo-Norman]] nobleman and administrator, one of King [[Henry I of England]]'s &quot;[[List of Henry I's new men|new men]]&quot;, who owed their positions and wealth to the king. Pain's family originated in Normandy, but there is little to suggest that he had many ties there, and he appears to have spent most of his career in England and the [[Welsh Marches]].  A son of a minor nobleman, he rose through ability to become an important royal official during Henry's reign. In 1115 he was rewarded with marriage to an heiress, thereby gaining control of the town of [[Ludlow]] and [[Ludlow Castle|its castle]], which he augmented with further acquisitions.

Although later medieval traditions described Pain as a [[Chamberlain (office)|chamberlain]] to King Henry, that position is not securely confirmed in contemporary records. He did hold other offices though, including that of [[sheriff]] in two counties near the border between England and Wales.  In his capacity as a [[judge|royal justice]] Pain also heard legal cases for the king throughout much of western England.

After King Henry's death in 1135 Pain supported Henry's nephew, King [[Stephen of England|Stephen]], and was with the new king throughout 1136.  In July 1137 Pain was ambushed by the Welsh and killed as he was leading a relief expedition to the garrison at [[Carmarthen]].  His heirs were his daughters, Cecily and Agnes. Cecily married the son of one of Pain's close associates, [[Miles of Gloucester]].  Pain was generous in his gifts of land to a number of monastic houses.

==Family background==
Pain was a son, likely the eldest, of John fitzRichard,{{efn|The usage of the patronymic &quot;fitz&quot; denotes &quot;son of&quot;. This makes Pain's name &quot;Pain, son of John&quot; and his father's name &quot;John, son of Richard&quot;.&lt;ref name=Dict126&gt;Coredon ''Dictionary of Medieval Terms'' p. 126&lt;/ref&gt;}} a [[tenant-in-chief]] listed in ''[[Domesday Book]]''.&lt;ref name=EustaceDNB&gt;Tout and Dalton &quot;[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/9614 Eustace fitz John (d. 1157)]&quot; ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|W. E. Wrightman wrote in his 1966 study of the Lacy family that Pain was a younger son, rather than the eldest son, but gives no reasoning for this belief.&lt;ref name=Lacy177&gt;Wrightman ''Lacy Family'' pp. 177–178&lt;/ref&gt;}} John may have had two wives, therefore the identity of Pain's mother is uncertain.&lt;ref name=DP284/&gt; On the basis of landholding, it has been speculated that Pain's mother was a daughter of [[Ranulph de Mortimer|Ralph Mortimer]], who held [[Wigmore, Herefordshire|Wigmore]] in ''Domesday Book''.&lt;ref name=Remfry404&gt;Remfry &quot;Early Mortimers of Wigmore&quot; ''Foundations'' pp. 404–406&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|The basis for this is that both Eustace and Pain held lands in Lincolnshire previously held by Mortimer. Pain also had Wigmore on top of the lands in Lincolnshire.&lt;ref name=Remfry404/&gt; Eustace's son [[William de Vesci]], held lands which were stated to have been &quot;given to a predecessor of William in marriage&quot;.&lt;ref name=QRemfry405&gt;Quoted in Remfry &quot;Early Mortimers of Wigmore&quot; ''Foundations'' p. 405&lt;/ref&gt;}}  As well as being a [[moneyer]], Pain's paternal grandfather, who came from near [[Avranches]] in Normandy, owned a mill.{{efn|19th-century accounts sometimes state that Pain's father John fitzRichard was the brother of Serlo de Burg, but later research has shown that John fitzRichard was the son of Richard, himself the son of Ranulf the Moneyer.&lt;ref name=CPAppB&gt;Cockayne ''Complete Peerage'' '''XII/2''' Appendices pp. 7–11&lt;/ref&gt;}} Pain's brother, [[Eustace fitz John|Eustace fitzJohn]], became a royal official who owned lands in the north of England.&lt;ref name=DNB&gt;Mason &quot;[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/9615 Pain fitz John (d. 1137)]&quot; ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''&lt;/ref&gt;  His other siblings included William, Alice and Agnes.&lt;ref name=DP284/&gt; William was probably the same William who later held [[East Harptree|Harptree]] in [[Somerset]],&lt;ref name=DD920&gt;Keats-Rohan ''Domesday Descendants'' p. 920&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1130 was a royal justice in western England.&lt;ref name=Dalton360&gt;Dalton &quot;Eustace Fitz John&quot; ''Speculum'' p. 360&lt;/ref&gt; Alice was the abbess of [[Barking Abbey]] and Agnes became the wife of [[Roger de Valognes]].&lt;ref name=DP284&gt;Keats-Rohan ''Domesday People'' p. 284&lt;/ref&gt;

Pain was born some time before 1100.&lt;ref name=CP270/&gt; His father may have been in the service of King Henry in Normandy before Henry became king. The family lands in England, which were not extensive, were mainly in [[East Anglia]],&lt;ref name=Ludlow179/&gt; and Pain appears to have inherited most of them; his payment for [[danegeld]], a tax, in 1130 for his East Anglian properties was 40&amp;nbsp;[[shilling]]s, compared to only 9 shillings for his brother Eustace.&lt;ref name=Dalton359&gt;Dalton &quot;Eustace Fitz John&quot; ''Speculum'' p. 359&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|The lands of John fitzRichard were valued at about 26 [[Anglo-Saxon pound|pounds]] in ''Domesday Book'' in 1086.&lt;ref name=Dalton359fn&gt;Dalton &quot;Eustace Fitz John&quot; ''Speculum'' p. 359 footnote 4&lt;/ref&gt;}}{{efn|Eustace inherited the manor of Saxlingham in Norfolk, but all the other lands in Norfolk held by John fitzRichard went to Pain. The manor of Elsenham in Essex, which ''[[Domesday Book]]'' recorded as held by John fitzRichard went to neither Pain nor Eustace and it is unknown to whom it descended.&lt;ref name=Govern251&gt;Green ''Government of England'' p. 251 footnote 209&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Marriage and lands==

All accounts agree that Pain married in 1115 and that his wife was named Sybil, although the identity of Sybil's parents is unclear. Pain's ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'' entry states that he married Sybil Talbot, the niece of [[Hugh de Lacy (before 1040-1085)|Hugh de Lacy]].&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; The ''[[Complete Peerage]]'' states that he married Sybil, the daughter of [[Geoffrey Talbot (died 1129)|Geoffrey Talbot]] and Talbot's wife Agnes, who was herself probably the daughter of [[Walter de Lacy (died 1085)|Walter de Lacy]].&lt;ref name=CP270/&gt; The historian [[Katharine Keats-Rohan|K. S. B. Keats-Rohan]] states that Pain married Sybil de Lacy, the daughter of Hugh de Lacy,&lt;ref name=DD919&gt;Keats-Rohan ''Domesday Descendants'' p. 919&lt;/ref&gt; a view shared by fellow historians [[Judith Green (historian)|Judith Green]] and Paul Dalton.&lt;ref name=Dalton360/&gt;&lt;ref name=GreenHenry133/&gt;{{efn|Among other historians that accept  Sybil as Hugh's  daughter are Brock Holden&lt;ref name=Marches17&gt;Holden ''Lords of the Central Marches'' pp. 17–18&lt;/ref&gt; and W. E. Wrightman.&lt;ref name=Lacy175&gt;Wrightman ''Lacy Family'' p. 175&lt;/ref&gt;}} Others such as Bruce Coplestone-Crow and [[David Crouch (historian)|David Crouch]] agree with the ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''{{'}}s designation of Sybil as Hugh's niece,&lt;ref name=Ludlow171&gt;Coplestone-Crow &quot;Payn fitzJohn and Ludlow Castle&quot; ''Shropshire History and Archaeology'' pp. 171–172&lt;/ref&gt; and daughter of Geoffrey Talbot and Agnes, the sister of Hugh de Lacy.&lt;ref name=Ludlow179&gt;Coplestone-Crow &quot;Payn fitzJohn and Ludlow Castle&quot; ''Shropshire History and Archaeology'' p. 179&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Crouch79&gt;Crouch ''Reign of King Stephen'' p. 79 footnote 21&lt;/ref&gt;

King Henry and King Stephen recognized Pain as the legitimate holder of the lands acquired through his wife Sybil. Her kinsman Gilbert de Lacy was the son of [[Roger de Lacy]], who had been banished from England in 1095 and his English estates confiscated; he had though retained his properties in Normandy. Roger's English possessions were given to his brother Hugh de Lacy, from whom Sybil had inherited them. On Roger's death Gilbert inherited the lands in Normandy, and pressed his claim to the family's former English estates. Coplestone-Crow speculates that the uncertainty hanging over the inheritance was one reason why Pain endeavoured to secure more lands around Ludlow.&lt;ref name=Ludlow178&gt;Coplestone-Crow &quot;Payn fitzJohn and Ludlow Castle&quot; ''Shropshire History and Archaeology'' p. 178&lt;/ref&gt;

Pain is the presumed builder of [[Painscastle|Pain's Castle]] in the Welsh county of [[Radnorshire|Radnor]]. He also controlled [[Caus Castle]] in Shropshire,&lt;ref name=CP270/&gt; and through his wife [[Ludlow Castle]] in the same county.&lt;ref name=GreenHenry174&gt;Green ''Henry I'' p. 174&lt;/ref&gt; Although he held the title to [[Weobley Castle, England|Weobley Castle]],&lt;ref name=Ludlow171/&gt; he does not appear to have exercised any control over it, which eventually went to [[Gilbert de Lacy]].&lt;ref name=Sanders95&gt;Sanders ''English Baronies'' p. 95&lt;/ref&gt; Pain was not the only recipient of Hugh de Lacy's lands; some went to [[Jocelin de Dinan]] and some to Miles of Gloucester.&lt;ref name=Marches17/&gt; Pain's share included property in Gloucestershire, Herefordshire, and Worcestershire,&lt;ref name=Lacy175/&gt; and he succeeded in acquiring additional lands near Ludlow, adding to the manors he held there through his wife;&lt;ref name=Ludlow176&gt;Coplestone-Crow &quot;Payn fitzJohn and Ludlow Castle&quot; ''Shropshire History and Archaeology'' p. 176&lt;/ref&gt; his holdings of land were considered to be worth 17 [[knight's fee|knights fees]].&lt;ref name=LC25&gt;Coplestone-Crow &quot;From Foundation to Anarchy&quot; ''Ludlow Castle'' p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; By 1130 he had evidently acquired additional properties in Oxfordshire, where he is recorded as being excused payment of danegeld that year.&lt;ref name=Lacy178/&gt;

==Career==
===Under Henry I===
[[File:WelshMarches.png|thumb|284px|right|The counties considered to form the Welsh Marches are shown in red, with some major towns.]]
Pain was too young to serve King [[William II of England|William Rufus]], but according to the later 12th-century writings of [[Walter Map]] he may have been a [[Chamberlain (office)|chamberlain]]—one of the officials in charge of the royal household—for William's brother, King Henry I (reigned 1100–1135). There is no contemporary evidence for Pain having held that office and nor is it likely, given Map's story, that Pain was involved with Henry's financial affairs; rather it appears that if indeed he was a chamberlain, he was a [[servant|body servant]].&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; Map relates a story about Pain serving the king personally at night, providing Henry with wine if the king called for it. The story continues that Pain once drank the wine and was caught out by Henry when the king subsequently demanded his nightcap. Map finishes the story by saying that the king then ordered that Pain should be given wine every night while awaiting the king's pleasure. Although the story is unlikely to be true in all details, it suggests that Pain's service to the king was personal as well as judicial and governmental.&lt;ref name=Govern30&gt;Green ''Government of England'' pp. 30–31&lt;/ref&gt; Other evidence against Map's claim that Pain was a chamberlain is that he never attested a royal charter in that office.&lt;ref name=Govern252/&gt;

The author of the ''[[Gesta Stephani]]'' described Pain as having been a [[page (servant)|page]] at Henry's court, stating that he owed his position to being one of the &quot;special and very intimate friends of King Henry&quot; and that although Pain had been &quot;taken into [Henry's] service as [one of his] court pages&quot;,&lt;ref name=QDalton360&gt;Quoted in Dalton &quot;Eustace Fitz John&quot; ''Speculum'' p. 360&lt;/ref&gt; it appears likely that the three fitzJohn brothers—Pain, Eustace and William—worked to advance each other's careers, as they are frequently found witnessing, or attesting, the same charters and other royal documents.&lt;ref name=Dalton361&gt;Dalton &quot;Eustace Fitz John&quot; ''Speculum'' p. 361&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1115, Pain was a witness to a [[charter]] of confirmation that King Henry issued to [[Geoffrey de Clive]], the [[Bishop of Hereford]], issued in the Welsh Marches.&lt;ref name=GreenHenry133&gt;Green ''Henry I'' p. 133&lt;/ref&gt;  Sometime between 1123 and 1127 he was appointed [[High Sheriff of Herefordshire|Sheriff of Herefordshire]], and in 1127  became [[High Sheriff of Shropshire|Sheriff of Shropshire]] also.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; He held the sheriffdoms of Hereford and Shropshire at least until 1136,&lt;ref name=Sheriff45&gt;Green ''English Sheriffs'' p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; and probably until his death.&lt;ref name=Ludlow179/&gt;  Pain is also often termed the king's &quot;viceregent&quot; or &quot;justiciar&quot; for those counties,&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lacy178&gt;Wrightman ''Lacy Family'' pp. 178–179&lt;/ref&gt; and he had the custody of King Henry's prisoner, [[Waleran de Beaumont, 1st Earl of Worcester|Waleran of Melun]], from September 1126 until late 1126, when Waleran was moved to [[Wallingford Castle]] and the custody of [[Brien FitzCount|Brian fitzCount]].&lt;ref name=Hollister313&gt;Hollister ''Henry I'' p. 313&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Waleran was a rebel captured in 1124 by Henry.&lt;ref name=Hollister313/&gt;}}

Pain was one of Henry's &quot;new men&quot;, who owed their positions and wealth to the king. The medieval writer [[Orderic Vitalis]] described them as a group as &quot;of base stock who had served him [Henry] well, raised them, so to say, from the dust&quot; and that the king &quot;stationed them above earls and famous [[castellan]]s&quot;.{{efn|Castellans are the officials in charge of a castle.&lt;ref name=Coredon61&gt;Coredon ''Dictionary of Medieval Terms'' p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;ref name=QDalton359&gt;Quoted in Dalton &quot;Eustace Fitz John&quot; ''Speculum'' p. 359&lt;/ref&gt;  Although Orderic stated that the families of these men were not considered high status, this likely was an exaggeration on the chronicler's part. Pain's family was respectable enough, as his father held a number of properties directly from the king.&lt;ref name=Govern140&gt;Green ''Government of England'' p. 140&lt;/ref&gt; It appears that Pain did not always take the king's side; the historian [[C. Warren Hollister]] has argued that Pain was not among the supporters of Henry's only surviving legitimate child, [[Empress Matilda|Matilda]], in 1126, when Henry had his nobility swear that they would recognise her as his heiress. Hollister feels that the removal of Waleran from Pain's custody was a sign that Pain had not supported Matilda.&lt;ref name=Debate30&gt;Hollister &quot;Anglo-Norman Succession Debate&quot; ''Journal of Medieval History'' pp. 30–31&lt;/ref&gt;

Pain consolidated much of his power in Shropshire and Herefordshire at [[Bridgnorth Castle]], often using that site as a place of business in preference to Shrewsbury, which had previously been the main centre of business for his predecessors as sheriff. As well as Waleran, Pain imprisoned a Welsh hostage there in 1128, [[Llywelyn ab Owain]], the nephew of [[Maredudd ap Bleddyn]], ruler of the Welsh principality of [[Powys]].&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; Besides Bridgnorth, Pain used his possession of Ludlow Castle to consolidate his power in the [[Welsh Marches]].&lt;ref name=LC23&gt;Coplestone-Crow &quot;From Foundation to Anarchy&quot; ''Ludlow Castle'' p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; During Henry's reign, the Welsh border was a zone of frequent raids and conflict between the Anglo-Normans and the Welsh.&lt;ref name=Bartlett73&gt;Bartlett ''England Under the Norman and Angevin Kings'' p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Caus Castle - geograph.org.uk - 487557.jpg|thumb|left|thumb|Remains of Caus Castle]]

The ''Gesta Stephani'' indicates that Pain, along with Miles of Gloucester, was a major landholder in the western part of England, and the pair managed to dominate justice in that region.&lt;ref name=Newman103&gt;Newman ''Anglo-Norman Nobility'' p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; According to the document the two men &quot;raised their power to such a pitch that from the Severn to the sea, all along the border between England and Wales, they involved everyone in litigation and forced services.&quot;&lt;ref name=QLudlow179/&gt; The later medieval writer [[Gerald of Wales]] called Miles and Pain &quot;secretaries and privy councillors of the king&quot;.&lt;ref name=QLudlow179&gt;Quoted in Coplestone-Crow &quot;Payn fitzJohn and Ludlow Castle&quot; ''Shropshire History and Archaeology'' p. 179&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1130 [[Pipe Roll]] noted that Pain was a royal justice in Staffordshire, Gloucestershire, and Pembroke.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; Besides the ordinary court, Pain also heard cases relating to the [[forest law]] in those counties.&lt;ref name=Just63&gt;Stenton ''English Justice'' p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; The Pipe Roll does not record Pain as sheriff in Shropshire, but this is likely due to the fact that the Shropshire returns for that year are missing from it.&lt;ref name=Govern252&gt;Green ''Government of England'' pp. 252–253&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1130, Pain was consulted by the king about the appointment to a vacant bishopric.&lt;ref name=Brett105&gt;Brett ''English Church Under Henry I'' p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Diocese of Hereford]] had been vacant since the death of [[Richard de Capella]] in August 1127,&lt;ref name=Handbook&gt;Fryde, et al. ''Handbook of British Chronology'' p. 250&lt;/ref&gt; and the king consulted with Pain and the constable of Hereford before accepting their candidate—[[Robert de Bethune]], the [[prior]] of  [[Llanthony Priory]].&lt;ref name=Brett105/&gt;  In 1132 Pain was present, along with his brother, at the Christmas court held by King Henry.&lt;ref name=King36&gt;King ''King Stephen'' p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently Caus Castle, which was under Pain's control, was burnt by the Welsh in 1134.&lt;ref name=CP270/&gt; As lord of Caus, Pain was involved in efforts to suppress Welsh raiding.&lt;ref name=Matilda77&gt;Chibnall ''Empress Matilda'' p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; Although Pain held Caus, his title to the fortification was unclear, as it had earlier been held by Robert Corbet.&lt;ref name=Ludlow180&gt;Coplestone-Crow &quot;Payn fitzJohn and Ludlow Castle&quot; ''Shropshire History and Archaeology'' p. 180&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of Henry's reign, Pain had witnessed over 60 royal charters for the king, spanning a period from around 1115 until 1135.&lt;ref name=Debate&gt;Hollister &quot;Anglo-Normal Succession Debate&quot; ''Journal of Medieval History'' p. 38 footnote 40&lt;/ref&gt; Although Pain witnessed a large number of royal documents, this activity took place mostly in England, as few of the documents he witnessed were drawn up while the king was in Normandy.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; As a reward for his service, Henry gave Pain the [[Honour (feudal land tenure)|lordship]]s of [[Ewias Lacy]]&lt;ref name=Govern15/&gt; and [[Archenfield]], both in Wales.&lt;ref name=Arist285&gt;Green ''Aristocracy of Norman England'' p. 285&lt;/ref&gt;

===Under Stephen===

Following King Henry's death in 1135, the succession was disputed between the king's nephews—[[Stephen of England|Stephen]] and his elder brother, [[Theobald II, Count of Champagne]]—and Henry's surviving legitimate child [[Empress Matilda|Matilda]], usually known as the Empress Matilda because of her first marriage to the [[Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry V]]. King Henry's only legitimate son, [[William Adelin|William]], had died in 1120. After Matilda was widowed in 1125, she returned to her father, who married her to [[Geoffrey V, Count of Anjou|Geoffrey, Count of Anjou]]. All the magnates of England and Normandy were required to declare fealty to Matilda as Henry's heir, but when Henry I died in 1135, Stephen rushed to England and had himself crowned before either Theobald or Matilda could react. The Norman barons accepted Stephen as Duke of Normandy, and Theobald contented himself with his possessions in France. Matilda, though, was less sanguine, and secured the support of the Scottish king, [[David I of Scotland|David]], who was her maternal uncle, and in 1138 also that of her half-brother, [[Robert, 1st Earl of Gloucester|Robert, Earl of Gloucester]], an illegitimate son of Henry I.&lt;ref name=Huscroft71&gt;Huscroft ''Ruling England'' pp. 71–73&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Henry I had more than 20&amp;nbsp;illegitimate children.&lt;ref name=HenryI41&gt;Hollister ''Henry I'' p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On  Henry's death in December 1135, Pain attended the king's funeral. Pain was an early supporter of King [[Stephen of England|Stephen]],&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; although he was said initially to have been afraid to appear at Stephen's court for fear of being confronted by those he had oppressed.&lt;ref name=GreenHenry115&gt;Green ''Henry I'' p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless Pain was with the new king by early January 1136, when he  witnessed  one of Stephen's documents, dated to around 4 January 1136, at [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]]. By Easter, both Pain and his brother Eustace had formally submitted to the king.&lt;ref name=Dalton366/&gt; Pain witnessed a royal charter at Oxford in April 1136.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; The king rewarded the brothers by continuing to appoint them to judicial functions, and confirmed grants made by them to various religious houses.&lt;ref name=Dalton366&gt;Dalton &quot;Eustace Fitz John&quot; ''Speculum'' p. 366&lt;/ref&gt;

After Henry's death, the Welsh attempted to drive out the Norman lords who had been extending their control into Wales during Henry's reign.&lt;ref name=Matilda77/&gt; Pain was with King Stephen at the siege of Exeter from June to August 1136, early in the king's reign.&lt;ref name=Crouch57&gt;Crouch ''Reign of King Stephen'' p. 57&lt;/ref&gt;  Crouch argues that Stephen did not at that time trust Pain, and kept him at the siege to more easily monitor his actions, and to prevent him from defecting to Matilda's cause.&lt;ref name=Crouch57/&gt;&lt;ref name=Crouch74&gt;Crouch ''Reign of King Stephen'' p. 74&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relations with the Church==
In 1119, [[Pope Calixtus II]] addressed letters to a group of Anglo-Norman landholders in the Welsh Marches, including Pain, accusing them of having appropriated the lands of the [[Diocese of Llandaff]] and ordering their return. Pain was among a group of nobles similarly accused by [[Pope Honorius II]] in 1128. Honorius once again ordered the nobles to restore to the Church lands they had confiscated.&lt;ref name=Llandaf47&gt;Davies ''Book of Llandaf'' p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;

Pain gave lands to Llanthony Priory, helping to establish the endowment of that monastic house,&lt;ref name=Llandaf49&gt;Davies ''Book of Llandaf'' p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; although it is difficult to distinguish his gifts from those of Hugh de Lacy, as the monks of Llanthony grouped the gifts of both men together in their records.&lt;ref name=Lacy183&gt;Wrightman ''Lacy Family'' p. 183&lt;/ref&gt; In addition Pain granted lands to [[Gloucester Abbey]], which had benefited from the generosity of his father and brother, as did his wife Sybil, together with other grants to her uncle the abbot.  She also gave to two churches in Hereford: St Peter and St Guthlac.&lt;ref name=Cownie151&gt;Cownie &quot;Gloucester Abbey&quot; ''England and Normandy'' p. 151&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and legacy==
On 10 July 1137 Pain was killed by a javelin blow to the head,&lt;ref name=Crouch59/&gt; during an ambush by the Welsh&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;{{efn|Only [[John of Worcester]] gives the exact date. Likewise, he is the only chronicler who dates the event to 1137, with the ''Gesta Stephani'', [[John of Hexham]], and [[Richard of Hexham]] dating the event to 1136 without an exact date.&lt;ref name=CP270/&gt; Most modern historians agree with John of Worcester's date.&lt;ref name=CP270/&gt;&lt;ref name=DD919/&gt;&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;&lt;ref name=Govern252/&gt;}} as he was leading a relief expedition to the garrison at [[Carmarthen]].&lt;ref name=Crouch59&gt;Crouch ''Reign of King Stephen'' p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; He was buried in Gloucester Abbey,&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; following a funeral service conducted by Robert de Bethune. A number of barons from the Welsh Marches attended, including Miles of Gloucester.&lt;ref name=Reeds121&gt;Marritt &quot;Reeds Shaken by the Wind?&quot; ''King Stephen's Reign'' p. 121&lt;/ref&gt;  Pain's widow continued to hold Ludlow Castle until the middle of 1139, when she was forced to surrender it to King Stephen.&lt;ref name=Crouch102&gt;Crouch ''Reign of King Stephen'' p. 102&lt;/ref&gt; Stephen then gave Sybil in marriage to Jocelin de Dinan, who consequently acquired Ludlow Castle through his new wife, setting up the background to Gilbert Lacy's attempts to seize Ludlow from Dinan on which the medieval Welsh [[Romance (heroic literature)|romance]] work ''[[Fouke le Fitz Waryn]]'' is based.&lt;ref name=Ludlow181&gt;Coplestone-Crow &quot;Payn fitzJohn and Ludlow Castle&quot; ''Shropshire History and Archaeology'' p. 181&lt;/ref&gt;

Pain's heirs were his two daughters, Cecily and Agnes.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; His [[heir male]] was his brother, Eustace fitzJohn.&lt;ref name=DD919/&gt; The two daughters were married five times in total;&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; Cecily married three times but failed to produce any direct heirs.&lt;ref name=Newman172&gt;Newman ''Anglo-Norman Nobility'' pp. 172–173&lt;/ref&gt; Her first husband was [[Roger Fitzmiles, 2nd Earl of Hereford|Roger]], the son of Miles of Gloucester.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; Pain arranged Cecily and Roger's marriage. The marriage contract specified that Roger would inherit all of Pain's lands, but as result of the latter's death the marriage was not contracted until December 1137, when King Stephen confirmed the terms of the settlement.&lt;ref name=Ludlow171/&gt; The king also settled the bulk of the inheritance on Cecily, which led to disturbances and a minor war among disappointed claimants.&lt;ref name=Arist381&gt;Green ''Aristocracy of Norman England'' p. 381&lt;/ref&gt; Agnes married [[Warin de Munchensy]] and after his death [[Haldenald de Bidun]]. She died after 1185, by which time she was described as a widow.&lt;ref name=CP270/&gt;

The historian W. E. Wrightman described Pain as a &quot;second-class baron and first-class civil servant&quot;.&lt;ref name=Lacy239&gt;Wrightman ''Lacy Family'' p. 239&lt;/ref&gt;
