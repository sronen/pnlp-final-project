'''Carsten Egeberg Borchgrevink''' (1 December 1864 – 21 April 1934) was an Anglo-Norwegian [[geographical pole|polar]] explorer and a pioneer of modern [[Antarctica|Antarctic]] travel. He was the precursor of [[Robert Falcon Scott]], [[Ernest Shackleton]], [[Roald Amundsen]] and other more famous names associated with the [[Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration]]. He began his exploring career in 1894 by joining a Norwegian whaling expedition, from which he brought back a collection of the first specimens of vegetable life within the Antarctic Circle.

In 1898–1900 Borchgrevink led the British-financed [[Southern Cross Expedition]], which in 1899 became the first to overwinter on the Antarctic mainland and the first to visit the [[Ross Ice Shelf|Great Ice Barrier]] since the expedition of [[James Clark Ross|Sir James Ross]] nearly sixty years previously. Borchgrevink landed on the Barrier with two companions and made the first sledge journey on its surface, setting a new [[Farthest South]] record at 78°50'S. On its return to England, notwithstanding its array of &quot;firsts&quot;, the expedition was received with only moderate interest by the public and by the British geographical establishment, whose attention was fixed on Scott's upcoming [[Discovery Expedition|National Antarctic Expedition]]. Borchgrevink's colleagues were critical of his leadership, and his own accounts of the expedition were regarded as journalistic and unreliable.

After the Southern Cross Expedition, Borchgrevink was one of three scientists sent to the Caribbean in 1902 by the [[National Geographic Society]], to report on the aftermath of the [[Mount Pelée#1902 eruption|Mount Pelée disaster]]. Thereafter he settled in [[Oslo]], leading a life mainly away from public attention. His pioneering work was subsequently recognised and honoured by several countries, and in 1912 he received a handsome tribute from Roald Amundsen, conqueror of the South Pole. In 1930 Britain's [[Royal Geographical Society]] finally acknowledged Borchgrevink's contribution to polar exploration and awarded him its Patron's Medal. The Society admitted in its citation that justice had not previously been done to his work with the Southern Cross Expedition.

== Early life ==
Carsten Borchgrevink was born in [[Oslo]], the son of a Norwegian lawyer, nobleman Henrik Christian Borchgrevink, and an English mother Annie, née Ridley.&lt;ref name= Borchbiog&gt;{{cite web|last= Swan|first= R.A.|title= Borchgrevink, Carsten Egeberg (1864–1934)|url= http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A070353b.htm|publisher=Australian Dictionary of Biography|accessdate=6 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family lived in the [[Uranienborg, Norway|Uranienborg]] neighbourhood, where Roald Amundsen, an occasional childhood playmate, also grew up.&lt;ref&gt;Huntford (''Last Place on Earth''), p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; Borchgrevink was educated at Gjerstsen College, Oslo, and later (1885–88) at the Royal Forestry School at [[Tharandt]], Saxony, in Germany.&lt;ref name= Borchexped&gt;{{cite web|title= Southern Cross Expedition Members|url=http://www.heritage-antarctica.org/english/expedition-members/|publisher=Antarctic Heritage Trust|accessdate=7 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to historian [[Roland Huntford]], Borchgrevink was of a restless nature, with a passion for adventure which took him, after his forestry training, to Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Huntford (''Shackleton''), p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; For four years he worked with government surveying teams in [[Queensland]] and [[New South Wales]] before settling in the small town of [[Bowenfels, New South Wales|Bowenfels]], where he became a teacher in languages and natural sciences at [[Cooerwull Academy]].&lt;ref name= Borchbiog/&gt;  His initial interest in polar exploration developed from reading press reports about the work of local scientists on the first Australian Antarctic Exploration Committee.&lt;ref name= Borchbiog/&gt; This organisation, founded in 1886, was investigating the establishment of permanent scientific research stations in the Antarctic regions. These plans were not realised; it was a revival of interest in commercial whaling in the early 1890s that gave Borchgrevink the opportunity, in 1894, to sign up for a Norwegian expedition to Antarctica.&lt;ref name= AAD&gt;{{cite web|title= Australian Antarctic Division|url= http://www.aad.gov.au/default.asp?casid=1307|publisher=Australian Government: Department of the Environment|accessdate=16 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Whaling voyage ==
The expedition that Borchgrevink joined was organised by [[Henryk Bull]], a Norwegian businessman and entrepreneur who, like Borchgrevink, had settled in Australia in the late 1880s. Bull planned to make a sealing and whaling voyage into Antarctic waters. After failing to interest Melbourne's learned societies in a cost-sharing venture of a commercial–scientific nature,&lt;ref name= McConville&gt;{{cite journal|last= McConville|first= Andrew|title= Henrik Bull, the Antarctic Exploration Committee and the first confirmed landing on the Antarctic continent|journal=Polar Record|volume= 43|issue= 2|pages= 143–152|publisher=Cambridge University Press|date= April 2007|url= http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract;jsessionid=E6F3CB49DC9459D939F832532360E368.tomcat1?fromPage=online&amp;aid=967620#|accessdate=7 September 2008|doi= 10.1017/S0032247407006109}}&lt;/ref&gt; he returned to Norway to organise his expedition there. He met [[Svend Foyn]], the 84-year-old &quot;father of modern whaling&quot; and inventor of the harpoon gun. With Foyn's help he acquired the whaler ''Kap Nor'' (&quot;North Cape&quot;), which he renamed ''[[Antarctic (ship)|Antarctic]]''.&lt;ref name= Burton677&gt;Burton, pp. 677–78&lt;/ref&gt; Bull hired an experienced whaling captain, [[Leonard Kristensen]], and with a crew and a small scientific team left Norway in September 1893.&lt;ref name= Burton677/&gt;&lt;ref name= Forex&gt;{{cite web|title= Norway's Forgotten Explorer|url= http://www.heritage-antarctica.org/english/forgotten-explorer/|publisher=Antarctic Heritage Trust|accessdate=8 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When Borchgrevink learned that ''Antarctic'' was due to visit Melbourne in September 1894, he hurried there hoping to find a vacancy. He was fortunate; [[William Speirs Bruce]], later an Antarctic expedition leader in his own right, had intended to join Bull's expedition as a natural scientist but could not reach the ship before it left Norway. This created an opening for Borchgrevink, who met Bull in Melbourne and persuaded him to take him on as a deck-hand and part-time scientist.&lt;ref name= Burton677/&gt;
[[File:SSAntarctic.jpg|thumb|left|Henryk Bull's ship ''Antarctic'' in the pack ice]]

During the following months, ''Antarctic's'' sealing activities around the [[sub-Antarctic islands]] were successful, but whales proved difficult to find. Bull and Kristensen decided to take the ship further south, to areas where the presence of whales had been reported by earlier expeditions.&lt;ref name= FirstLanding&gt;{{cite web|title= The First Landing on the Antarctic Mainland|url= http://www.heritage-antarctica.org/english/first-landing/|publisher=Antarctic Heritage Trust|accessdate=8 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ship penetrated a belt of [[pack ice]] and sailed into the [[Ross Sea]], but whales were still elusive. On 17 January 1895 a landing was made at [[Possession Island, Antarctica|Possession Island]], where Sir James Clark Ross had planted the British flag in 1841. Bull and Borchgrevink left a message in a canister there, as future proof of their presence.&lt;ref name = Southpole&gt;{{cite web|title= Carsten Borchgrevink (1864–1934)|url= http://www.south-pole.com/p0000087.htm|publisher=South-pole.com|accessdate=8 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the island Borchgrevink found a [[lichen]], the first plant life discovered south of the Antarctic Circle.&lt;ref name= Burton677/&gt; On 24 January the ship reached the vicinity of [[Cape Adare]], at the northern extremity of the [[Victoria Land]] coastline of the Antarctic mainland.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt; Ross's 1841 expedition been unable to land here, but as ''Antarctic'' neared the cape, conditions were calm enough for a boat to be lowered. A party including Bull, Kristensen, Borchgrevink and others then headed for a [[shingle beach|shingled foreshore]] below the cape. Exactly who went ashore first became a matter of dispute, with both Kristensen and Borchgrevink contending for the honour&lt;ref name= FirstLanding/&gt; along with a 17-year-old New Zealand seaman, [[Alexander von Tunzelmann]], who said that he had &quot;leapt out to hold the boat steady&quot;.&lt;ref name= Burton677/&gt; The party claimed this as the first landing on the Antarctic mainland, although they may have been preceded by the American whaling captain John Davis, on the [[Antarctic Peninsula]] in 1821, or by other whaling expeditions.&lt;ref name= Burton677/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= An Antarctic Timeline|url= http://www.south-pole.com/p0000052.htm|publisher=South-pole.com|accessdate=29 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While ashore at Cape Adare, Borchgrevink collected further specimens of rocks and lichens, the latter of which would prove of great interest to the scientific community, which had doubted the ability of vegetation to survive so far south.&lt;ref name = BorchbookIntro&gt;{{cite book|author=Borchgrevink, Carstens|title= ''First on the Antarctic Continent|url= http://books.google.com/?id=aMRgMxzhEI8C&amp;pg=PA24&amp;lpg=PA24&amp;dq=Southern+Cross+Expedition|publisher=George Newnes Ltd|year= 1901|accessdate=11 August 2008|isbn = 978-0-905838-41-0}} Introduction, p.

Each hoped to raise funds for a further Antarctic expedition, but their efforts were unsuccessful.&lt;ref name= Southpole/&gt; An animosity developed between them, possibly because of their differing accounts of the voyage on the ''Antarctic''; each emphasised his own role without fully acknowledging that of the other.&lt;ref name= Speak38&gt;Speak, pp. 38–40&lt;/ref&gt;

== Making plans ==
=== International Geographical Congress 1895 ===

To promote his ideas for an expedition that would overwinter on the Antarctic continent at Cape Adare, Borchgrevink hurried to London, where the Royal Geographical Society was hosting the Sixth International Geographical Congress. On 1 August 1895 he addressed the conference, giving an account of the Cape Adare foreshore as a location where a scientific expedition might establish itself for the Antarctic winter.&lt;ref name= Borchbook4/&gt; He described the site as &quot;a safe situation for houses, tents and provisions&quot;, and said there were indications that in this place &quot;the unbound forces of the Antarctic Circle do not display the full severity of their powers&quot;.&lt;ref name= Borchbook4/&gt; He also suggested that the interior of the continent might be accessible from the foreshore by an easy route—a &quot;gentle slope&quot;. He ended his speech by declaring his willingness to lead an expedition there himself.&lt;ref name= Borchbook4/&gt; [[Hugh Robert Mill]], the Royal Geographical Society's librarian, who was present at the Congress, reported reactions to the speech: &quot;His blunt manner and abrupt speech stirred the academic discussions with a fresh breeze of realism. Nobody liked Borchgrevink very much at that time, but he had a dynamic quality and a set purpose to get out again to the unknown South that struck some of us as boding well for exploration&quot;.&lt;ref name= Southpole/&gt; The Congress did not, however, endorse Borchgrevink's ideas, instead passing a general resolution in support of Antarctic exploration, proposing that &quot;the various scientific societies throughout the world should urge, in whatever way seems to them most effective, that this work be undertaken before the close of the century&quot;.&lt;ref name= Borchbook9&gt;{{cite book|author=Borchgrevink, Carstens|title= ''First on the Antarctic Continent|url= http://books.google.com/?id=aMRgMxzhEI8C&amp;pg=PA24&amp;lpg=PA24&amp;dq=Southern+Cross+Expedition|publisher=George Newnes Ltd|year= 1901|accessdate=11 August 2008|isbn = 978-0-905838-41-0}} pp. 9–10&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Seeking support ===
[[File:ClementsRMarkham geographer.jpg|thumb|Sir Clements Markham, the Royal Geographical Society president who opposed Borchgrevink's Antarctic plans]]
For the next two years Borchgrevink travelled in Europe and in Australia, seeking support and backing for his expedition ideas without success.&lt;ref name= Forex/&gt; One of those with whom he sought to join forces was William Speirs Bruce, who was planning his own Antarctic expedition. Their joint plans foundered when Borchgrevink, who had severed relations with Henryk Bull, learned that Bruce was in discussions with him; &quot;I regret therefore that we cannot collaborate&quot;, wrote Borchgrevink to Bruce.&lt;ref name= Speak38/&gt; He also discovered that the Royal Geographical Society had been harbouring its own plans for an Antarctic expedition since 1893. Under the influence of its president, Sir [[Clements Markham]], this RGS project was envisaged not only as a scientific endeavour, but as an attempt to relive the former glories of Royal Naval polar exploration.&lt;ref name=&quot;Crane, p. 75&quot;&gt;Crane, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; This would eventually develop into the National Antarctic Expedition, under Captain Scott, and it was these plans that attracted the interest of the learned societies rather than Borchgrevink's more modest proposals. Markham was fiercely opposed to private ventures that might divert financial support from his project, and Borchgrevink found himself starved of practical help:  &quot;It was up a steep hill&quot;, he wrote, &quot;that I had to roll my Antarctic boulder.&quot;&lt;ref name= Borchbook9/&gt;

=== Sir George Newnes ===
During his search for backers, Borchgrevink met Sir [[George Newnes]], a leading British magazine publisher and cinema pioneer whose portfolio included the ''[[Westminster Gazette]]'', ''[[Tit-Bits]]'', ''[[Country Life (magazine)|Country Life]]'' and the ''[[Strand Magazine]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Jenks|first= John|title= Review of Jackson, Kate: George Newnes and the New Journalism in Britain, 1880–1910 (Ashgate Publishing, Aldershot, 2001)|url= http://victorianresearch.org/jackson_newnes.html|publisher=JHistory|accessdate=14 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not unusual for publishers to support exploration—Newnes's great rival [[Alfred Harmsworth]] (later Lord Northcliffe) had recently financed [[Frederick George Jackson|Frederick Jackson]]'s expedition to [[Franz Josef Land]], and had pledged financial backing to the National Antarctic Expedition.&lt;ref name= Jones59&gt;Jones, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; Newnes was sufficiently impressed by Borchgrevink to offer the full costs of his proposed expedition—around £40,000,&lt;ref name = Jones59/&gt; (at least £3&amp;nbsp;million in 2008 values).&lt;ref name= Measuringworth&gt;{{cite web|title= Measuringworth|url=  http://www.measuringworth.com/uscompare/|publisher=The Institute for the Measurement of Worth|accessdate=9 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This generosity infuriated Sir Clements Markham and the geographical establishment, who saw Borchgrevink as a penniless Norwegian nobody who had secured British money which they believed ought to have been theirs.&lt;ref name= Hux&gt;Huxley, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; Markham maintained an attitude of hostility and contempt towards Borchgrevink,&lt;ref name= Hux/&gt; and chastised Mill for attending the launch of his expedition.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;

Newnes stipulated that the expedition should sail under a British flag, and should be styled the &quot;British Antarctic Expedition&quot;.&lt;ref name= Preston14&gt;Preston, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;  In the event, of the total party of 29, only two were British, with one Australian and the rest Norwegian.&lt;ref name= Jones59/&gt; Despite this, Borchgrevink would attempt to emphasise the expedition's British character, flying the personal flag of the [[George V of the United Kingdom|Duke of York]] and taking 500 bamboo poles with miniature [[Union Jack]]s for, as he put it, &quot;purpose of survey and extension of the British Empire&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Harrowfield|first= David|title= The Southern Cross Expedition|url= http://www.anta.canterbury.ac.nz/resources/sth_cross/equip.html|publisher=University of Canterbury|accessdate=11 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Southern Cross Expedition ==
{{Main|Southern Cross Expedition}}

=== Winter in Antarctica ===
[[File:Cape adere.JPG|thumb|The Cape Adare foreshore in 2001, showing the penguin colony]]
With funding assured, Borchgrevink purchased the whaling ship ''Pollux'', renamed her [[Southern Cross (ship)|''Southern Cross'']], and had her fitted out for Antarctic service.&lt;ref name= Southpole/&gt;  ''Southern Cross'' sailed from London on 22 August 1898, and after a three-week pause in [[Hobart]], Tasmania, reached Cape Adare on 17 February 1899.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt; Here, on the site which Borchgrevink had described to the Congress, the expedition set up the first ever shore base on the Antarctic continent—in the midst of a penguin colony. It was named &quot;Camp Ridley&quot; in honour of Borchgrevink's mother.&lt;ref name= ForgotExped/&gt; On 2 March the ship departed for New Zealand to winter there, leaving a shore party of 10 with their provisions, equipment and 70 dogs.&lt;ref name= anta-canterbury-arrival&gt;{{cite web|last= Harrowfield|first= David|title = The Southern Cross Expedition: Arrival at Cape Adare|url= http://www.anta.canterbury.ac.nz/resources/sth_cross/arrival.html|publisher=University of Canterbury|accessdate=10 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were the first dogs brought to the Antarctic; likewise, the expedition pioneered the use there of the [[Primus stove]], invented in Sweden six years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;Rubin, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; Dogs and the Primus would be staples of every Antarctic expedition that followed during the Heroic Age.

[[Louis Bernacchi]], the party's Australian physicist, was later to write: &quot;In many respects, Borchgrevink was not a good leader&quot;.&lt;ref name= Crane74&gt;Crane, pp. 74–75&lt;/ref&gt; Borchgrevink was evidently no autocrat, but without the framework of an accepted hierarchy, according to Bernacchi a state of &quot;democratic anarchy&quot; prevailed, with &quot;dirt, disorder and inactivity the order of the day&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Fiennes, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, as winter developed, Borchgrevink's hopes that Cape Adare would escape the worst Antarctic weather proved false; in fact he had chosen a site which was particularly exposed to the freezing winds blown northwards from the inland ice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Mills|first=William James|title= Exploring Polar Frontiers|url= http://books.google.com/?id=PYdBH4dOOM4C&amp;pg=PA435&amp;lpg=PA435&amp;dq=Morrell+Land|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location= Santa Barbara|year= 2003|accessdate=10 February 2009|isbn= 978-1-57607-422-0}} (pp. 94–96)&lt;/ref&gt; As time progressed, tempers wore thin; the party became irritable and boredom set in.&lt;ref&gt;Crane, p. 153&lt;/ref&gt;  There were accidents: a candle left burning caused extensive fire damage, and on another occasion several members of the party were almost asphyxiated by fumes from the stove.&lt;ref name= Southpole/&gt; Borchgrevink did attempt to establish a routine, and scientific work was carried on throughout, but as he wrote himself, referring to the general lack of fellowship: &quot;The silence roars in one's ears&quot;.&lt;ref name= Preston14/&gt;  Further dampenening morale, the group's zoologist, [[Nicolai Hansen]], fell ill, failed to respond to treatment, and died on 14 October.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Harrowfield|first= David|title= The Southern Cross Expedition: First Burial on the Continent|url= http://www.anta.canterbury.ac.nz/resources/sth_cross/burial.html|publisher=University of Canterbury|accessdate=10 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Ross Barrier 1843.jpg|thumb|left|A drawing of the Great Ice Barrier from 1843. Borchgrevink was the first to visit the Barrier after Ross's 1839–43 expedition.]]
When winter ended and sledging activity became possible, Borchgrevink's assumptions about an easy route to the interior proved false; the glaciated mountain ranges adjoining Cape Adare precluded any travel inland, restricting exploration to the immediate area around the cape.&lt;ref name= Preston14/&gt;&lt;ref name= Crane74/&gt; However, Borchgrevink's basic expedition plan—to overwinter on the Antarctic continent and carry out scientific observations there—had been achieved. When ''Southern Cross'' returned at the end of January 1900, Borchgrevink decided to abandon the camp, although there were sufficient fuel and provisions left to last another year.&lt;ref name = AntaDepart&gt;{{cite web|last= Harrowfield|first= David|title= The Southern Cross Expedition: Departure of the Expedition|url= http://www.anta.canterbury.ac.nz/resources/sth_cross/depart.html|publisher=University of Canterbury|accessdate=10 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Instead of returning home directly, ''Southern Cross'' sailed south until it reached the [[Ross Ice Shelf|Great Ice Barrier]], discovered by Sir James Clark Ross during his 1839–43 voyage and later renamed in his honour.&lt;ref name= Southpole/&gt; No one had visited the Barrier since then, and Ross had been unable to effect a landing. Borchgrevink discovered an inlet in the Barrier edge; in later years this would be named the &quot;Bay of Whales&quot; by Shackleton.&lt;ref name= ForgotExped/&gt; Here, on 16 February 1900, Borchgrevink, [[William Colbeck (seaman)|William Colbeck]] and the [[Sami people|Sami]] dog-handler Per Savio made the first ascent of the Barrier and, with dogs and sledges, travelled 10&amp;nbsp;miles (16&amp;nbsp;km) south to set a new Farthest South record at 78°50'S.&lt;ref name= Southpole/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mill. p. 402&lt;/ref&gt; ''Southern Cross'' visited other [[Ross Sea]] islands before turning for home, reaching New Zealand on 1 April.&lt;ref name= ForgotExped&gt;{{cite web|title= The Forgotten Expedition|url= http://www.heritage-antarctica.org/english/forgotten-expedition/|publisher=Antarctic Heritage Trust|accessdate=11 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Borchgrevink then took a steamer to England, arriving early in June.&lt;ref&gt;Coleman, p. 243&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Return and reception ===

The reception afforded to the expedition on its return to England was lukewarm. Public attention was firmly fixed on the forthcoming national expedition, to which Robert Falcon Scott had just been appointed commander,&lt;ref&gt;Crane, p. 89. Scott accepted his appointment on 11 June, five days after Borchgrevink's return.&lt;/ref&gt; rather than on a venture which appeared British only in name. In spite of the Southern Cross Expedition's achievements there was still resentment in geographical circles—harboured especially by Sir Clements Markham—that Borchgrevink's acceptance of Newnes's gift had deprived the National Antarctic Expedition of money.&lt;ref name= Southpole/&gt;  Furthermore, Bruce complained that Borchgrevink had appropriated plans that he had developed but been forced to abandon.&lt;ref name= Speak38/&gt; Borchgrevink's credibility was not helped by the boastful tone sounded in various articles which were published in Newnes's magazines,&lt;ref name= Hux/&gt; nor by the journalistic style of his rapidly-written expedition account, ''First on the Antarctic Continent'', the English edition of which appeared in 1901.&lt;ref name= Borchbiog/&gt;
[[File:ROSSISLAND.JPG|thumb|Ross Island, where Borchgrevink made the first landing in February 1900]]
Hailing his expedition as a great success, Borchgrevink spoke of &quot;another Klondyke&quot;, an abundance of fish, seals and birds, and of &quot;quartz, in which metals are to be seen&quot;.&lt;ref name = anta&gt;{{cite web|last= Harrowfield|first= David|title= The Southern Cross Expedition: Results of the Expedition|url= http://www.anta.canterbury.ac.nz/resources/sth_cross/results.html|publisher=University of Canterbury|accessdate=11 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his book he listed the expedition's main achievements: proof that an expedition could live on Victoria Land over winter; a year's continuous magnetic and meteorological observations; an estimate of the current position of the South Magnetic Pole; discoveries of new species of insects and shallow-water fauna; coastal mapping and the discovery of new islands; the first landing on [[Ross Island]] and, finally, the scaling of the Great Ice Barrier and the sledging to 78°50'S, &quot;the furthest south ever reached by man&quot;.&lt;ref name= Borchbook7&gt;{{cite book|author=Borchgrevink, Carstens|title= ''First on the Antarctic Continent|url= http://books.google.com/?id=aMRgMxzhEI8C&amp;pg=PA24&amp;lpg=PA24&amp;dq=Southern+Cross+Expedition|publisher=George Newnes Ltd|year= 1901|accessdate=11 September 2008|isbn = 978-0-905838-41-0}} p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; However, in reality, the choice of the winter site at Cape Adare had ruled out any serious geographical exploration of the Antarctic interior.&lt;ref name=&quot;Crane, p. 75&quot;/&gt; The scientific results were less than had been anticipated, due in part to the loss of some of Nikolai Hansen's natural history notes.&lt;ref name=Mill403/&gt; Borchgrevink may have been responsible for this loss;&lt;ref&gt;Coleman, p. 240&lt;/ref&gt; he would later be involved in a dispute with Hansen's former employers, London's [[Natural History Museum]], over these missing notes and other specimens collected by Hansen.&lt;ref name= AntaWhat/&gt;

During the years following his return Borchgrevink was honoured by the [[American Geographical Society]], and was made a [[Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav|Knight of St Olaf]] by his own sovereign, [[King Oscar II]] of Sweden.&lt;ref name= Forex/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Norway was a part of the Swedish kingdom between 1814 and 1905.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1929, the [[Parliament of Norway]] decided to give Borchgrevink a [[stipend]] of 3,000 [[Norwegian krone]]r.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt; Later he received equivalent honours from Denmark and Austria, but in England his work was for many years largely disregarded, despite Mill's acknowledgement of &quot;a dashing piece of pioneer work, useful in training men for later service&quot;.&lt;ref name= Mill403&gt;Mill, p. 403&lt;/ref&gt; Historian David Crane suggests that if Borchgrevink had been a British naval officer, England would have taken his achievements more seriously.&lt;ref name= Crane74/&gt;

== Post-expedition life ==
=== Mount Pelée disaster ===
In summer 1902 Borchgrevink was one of three geographers invited by the [[National Geographic Society]] (NGS) to report on the after-effects of the catastrophic eruptions of [[Mount Pelée]], on the French-Caribbean island of [[Martinique]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Fellows|first= Rev.

=== Retirement ===

On his return from Washington, Borchgrevink virtually retired into private life. On 7 September 1896, he married an English bride, Constance Prior Standen, with whom he settled in Slemdal, in Oslo, where two sons and two daughters were born.&lt;ref name=nbl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=1999|title=Carsten Borchgrevink|encyclopedia=[[Norsk biografisk leksikon]]|first=Susan|last=Barr|editor-first=Knut|editor-last=Helle|editor-link=Knut Helle|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo|url=http://snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Carsten_Borchgrevink/utdypning|language=Norwegian|accessdate=27 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Borchgrevink devoted himself mainly to sporting and literary activities, producing a book entitled ''The Game of Norway''.&lt;ref name= Southpole/&gt;&lt;ref name= AntaWhat/&gt; On two occasions he apparently considered returning to the Antarctic; in August 1902 he stated his intention to lead a new Antarctic expedition for the NGS, but nothing came of this, and a later venture, announced in Berlin in 1909, was likewise stillborn.&lt;ref name= AntaWhat&gt;{{cite web|last= Harrowfeld|first= David|title= The Southern Cross Expedition: What became of Borchgrevink?|url= http://www.anta.canterbury.ac.nz/resources/sth_cross/what.html|publisher=University of Canterbury|accessdate=20 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Scott of the Antarctic crop.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Robert Falcon Scott. Borchgrevink paid tribute to Scott, following the [[Terra Nova Expedition]] disaster.]]
Although he remained out of the limelight, Borchgrevink retained his interest in Antarctic matters, visiting Captain Scott shortly before the ''Terra Nova'' sailed on Scott's last Antarctic expedition in June 1910. When news of his fate reached the outside world, Borchgrevink paid tribute to Scott: &quot;He was the first in the field with a finely organised expedition and the first who did systematic work on the great south polar continent&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Untitled news report|work=New York Times|date= 12 February 1913|url= http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9806E4D71E3AE633A25751C1A9649C946296D6CF|accessdate=19 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter of condolence to John Scott Keltie, the Royal Geographical Society's secretary, Borchgrevink said of Scott: &quot;He was a man!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Jones, p. 248&lt;/ref&gt;

In Norway Borchgrevink divided opinion; Roald Amundsen was a long-time friend and supporter,&lt;ref name=&quot;Preston14&quot;/&gt; whereas [[Fridtjof Nansen]], according to Scott, spoke of him as a &quot;tremendous fraud&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Crane, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; When Amundsen returned from his South Pole conquest in 1912 he paid full tribute to Borchgrevink's pioneering work: &quot;We must acknowledge that in ascending the Barrier, Borchgrevink opened the way to the south and threw aside the greatest obstacle to the expeditions that followed&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Amundsen, pp. 25–26&lt;/ref&gt;

During his remaining years Borchgrevink lived quietly. In 1930 came belated recognition from London—the Royal Geographical Society awarded him its Patron's Medal, proclaiming that the magnitude of the difficulties overcome by Borchgrevink had initially been underestimated: &quot;It was only after the work of Scott's Northern Party [...] that we were able to realise the improbability that any explorer could do more in the Cape Adare district than Mr Borchgrevink had accomplished. It appeared, then, that justice had not been done at the time to the pioneer work of the Southern Cross expedition, which had been carried out under the British flag and at the expense of a British benefactor.&quot;&lt;ref name= Southpole/&gt;

== Death and commemoration ==
[[File:Borchgrevink Hut.jpg|thumb|A modern photograph of the Southern Cross expedition huts at Cape Adare. The accommodation hut is on the left.]]
Carsten Borchgrevink died in Oslo on 21 April 1934. Despite his &quot;somewhat obsessive desire to be first&quot;,&lt;ref name= Borchbiog/&gt; and his limited formal scientific training, he has been acknowledged as a pioneer in Antarctic work and as a forerunner for later, more elaborate expeditions.&lt;ref name= Borchbiog/&gt;  A number of geographical features in Antarctica commemorate his name, including the Borchgrevink Coast of Victoria Land, between Cape Adare and [[Cape Washington]], the [[Borchgrevink Glacier]] and Glacier Tongue in Victoria Land, and the Borchgrevinkisen glacier in [[Queen Maud Land]].&lt;ref name= Forex/&gt; His name is also carried by the small Antarctic fish [[Bald notothen|''Pagothenia borchgrevinki'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= ITIS Report: Pagothenia Borchgrevinki|url= http://www.itis.gov/servlet/SingleRpt/SingleRpt?search_topic=TSN&amp;search_value=642902|publisher=ITIS|accessdate=14 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; His expedition's accommodation hut still stands at Cape Adare, and is under the care of The New Zealand [[Antarctic Heritage Trust]], which acts as guardian to this hut and to those of Scott and Shackleton elsewhere on the continent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Antarctic Specially Protected Areas|url= http://www.heritage-antarctica.org/AHT/ManagementPlans/|publisher=Antarctic Heritage Trust|accessdate=20 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Borchgrevink hut was designated by the Trust as Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA) No. 159 in 2002. In June 2005 the Trust adopted a management plan for its future maintenance and accessibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Management Plan for Cape Adare ASPA No. 159|url= http://www.heritage-antarctica.org/content/library/ASPA_159_Management_Plan_Cape_Adare.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=Antarctic Heritage Trust|accessdate=20 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
