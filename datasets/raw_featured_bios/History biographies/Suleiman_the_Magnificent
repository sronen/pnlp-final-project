'''Suleiman I''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|s|uː|l|i|m|ɑː|n}}; {{lang-ota|{{Script|Arab|سلطان سليمان اول}}}}, ''Sultān Suleimān-i evvel'' or {{rtl-lang|ota|{{Script|Arab|قانونى سلطان سليمان}}}}, ''Kānūnī Sultān Suleimān'', [[Turkish language|Modern Turkish]]: ''I. Süleyman'' ({{IPA-tr|sylejˈmɑn}}) or ''Kanuni Sultan Süleyman''; 6 November 1494 – 5/6/7 September 1566) was the tenth and longest-reigning [[Emperor]], [[Sultan]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]], from 1520 to his death in 1566. He is known in [[Western world|the West]] as '''Suleiman the Magnificent'''&lt;ref&gt;Merriman.&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Eastern world|the East]], as &quot;'''The Lawgiver'''&quot; ({{lang-tr|Kanuni}}; {{lang-ar|{{Script|Arab|القانونى}}}}, ''al‐Qānūnī''), for his complete reconstruction of the Ottoman legal system. Suleiman became a prominent monarch of 16th century Europe, presiding over the apex of the Ottoman Empire's military, political and economic power. Suleiman personally led Ottoman armies to conquer the Christian strongholds of [[Belgrade]], [[Rhodes]], and most of [[Hungary]] before his conquests were checked at the [[Siege of Vienna]] in 1529. He annexed most of the [[Middle East]] in his conflict with the [[Safavid dynasty|Safavids]] and large swathes of [[North Africa]] as far west as [[Algeria]]. Under his rule, the [[Ottoman Navy|Ottoman fleet]] dominated the seas from the [[Mediterranean]] to the [[Red Sea]] and the [[Persian Gulf]].&lt;ref&gt;Mansel, 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the helm of an expanding empire, Suleiman personally instituted legislative changes relating to society, education, taxation, and criminal law. His canonical law (or the ''Kanuns'') fixed the form of the empire for centuries after his death. Not only was Suleiman a distinguished poet and [[goldsmith]] in his own right; he also became a great patron of culture, overseeing the golden age of the Ottoman Empire's [[Culture of the Ottoman Empire|artistic]], [[Turkish literature#Ottoman literature|literary]] and [[Ottoman architecture#Classical period (1437-1703)|architectural]] development.&lt;ref name=atil24&gt;Atıl, 24.&lt;/ref&gt; He spoke five languages: [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Chagatai language|Chagatai]] (a dialect of [[Turkic languages]] and related to [[Uyghur language|Uyghur]]), [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Serbian language|Serbian]].

In a break with Ottoman tradition, Suleiman married a [[harem]] girl, [[Roxelana]], who became Hürrem Sultan; her intrigues as queen in the court and power over the Sultan made her quite renowned. Their son, [[Selim II]], succeeded Suleiman following his death in 1566 after 46 years of rule.

==Early life==
Suleiman was born in [[Trabzon]] along the coast of the [[Black Sea]], probably on 6 November 1494.&lt;ref&gt;Clot, 25.&lt;/ref&gt; His mother was Valide Sultan [[Ayşe Hafsa Sultan|Aishe Hafsa Sultan]] or Hafsa Hatun Sultan, who died in 1534. At the age of seven, he was sent to study [[science]], [[history]], [[literature]], [[theology]], and [[military tactics]] in the schools of the [[Topkapı Palace]] in [[Constantinople]]. As a young man, he befriended [[Pargalı Ibrahim Pasha|Pargalı Ibrahim]], a slave who later became one of his most trusted advisers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Noel|last=Barber|title=The Sultans|location=New York|publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]]|year=1973|pages=36|isbn=0786106824}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the age of seventeen, young Suleiman was appointed as the governor of first [[Feodosiya#Caffa|Kaffa]] (Theodosia), then Sarukhan ([[Manisa]]) with a brief tenure at [[Adrianople]] (now [[Edirne]]).&lt;ref&gt;Clot, 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Upon the death of his father, [[Selim I]] (1465–1520), Suleiman entered Constantinople and acceded to the throne as the tenth Ottoman Sultan. An early description of Suleiman, a few weeks following his accession, was provided by the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] envoy [[Bartolomeo Contarini]]: &quot;He is twenty-six years of age, tall, but wiry, and of a delicate complexion. His neck is a little too long, his face thin, and his nose aquiline. He has a shade of a moustache and a small beard; nevertheless he has a pleasant mien, though his skin tends to pallor. He is said to be a wise Lord, fond of study, and all men hope for good from his rule.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Kinross, 175.&lt;/ref&gt; Some historians claim that in his youth Suleiman had an admiration for [[Alexander the Great]].&lt;ref&gt;Lamb, 14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barber, 23.&lt;/ref&gt; He was influenced by Alexander's vision of building a world empire that would encompass the east and the west, and this created a drive for his subsequent military campaigns in Asia and in Africa, as well as in Europe.

===Conquests in Europe===
{{See also|Ottoman wars in Europe|Islam and Protestantism}}
[[File:OsmanenDeutscheKavallerie-1-.jpg|thumb|250px|Battle between the Turks and Christians, 16th century]]
Upon succeeding his father, Suleiman began a series of military conquests, eventually suppressing a revolt led by the Ottoman-appointed governor of [[Damascus]] in 1521. Suleiman soon made preparations for the [[Siege of Belgrade 1521|conquest of Belgrade]] from the [[Kingdom of Hungary]]—something his great-grandfather [[Mehmed II]] had failed to achieve. Its capture was vital in eliminating the Hungarians who, following the defeats of the [[Serbs]], [[Bulgarians]], [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] and [[Albanians]], remained the only formidable force who could block further Ottoman gains in Europe. Suleiman encircled [[Belgrade]] and began a series of heavy bombardments from an island in the [[Danube]]. With a garrison of only 700 men, and receiving no aid from Hungary, Belgrade fell in August 1521.&lt;ref&gt;Imber, 49.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Semailname 47b.jpg|left|thumb|Suleiman as a young man]]

News of the conquest of one of Christendom's major strongholds spread fear across Europe. As the ambassador of the Holy Roman Empire to [[Constantinople]] was to note, &quot;The capture of Belgrade was at the origin of the dramatic events which engulfed Hungary. It led to the death of [[Louis II of Hungary|King Louis]], the capture of [[Buda]], the occupation of [[Transylvania]], the ruin of a flourishing kingdom and the fear of neighbouring nations that they would suffer the same fate...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Clot, 39.&lt;/ref&gt;


The road to Hungary and [[Austria]] lay open, but Suleiman diverted his attention to the Eastern [[Mediterranean]] island of [[Rhodes]], the home base of the [[Knights Hospitaller]]. In the summer of 1522, taking advantage of the navy he inherited from his father, Suleiman dispatched an armada of some 400 ships while personally leading an army of 100,000&amp;nbsp;across Asia Minor to a point opposite the island.&lt;ref&gt;Kinross, 176.&lt;/ref&gt; Following a [[Siege of Rhodes (1522)|siege]] of five months with brutal encounters, Rhodes capitulated and Suleiman allowed the [[Knights of Rhodes]] to depart. They eventually formed their new base in Malta.

As relations between Hungary and the Ottoman Empire deteriorated, Suleiman resumed his campaign in Eastern Europe and on 29 August 1526, he defeated [[Louis II of Hungary]] (1506–26) at the [[Battle of Mohács]]. In its wake, Hungarian resistance collapsed and the Ottoman Empire became the pre-eminent power in Eastern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Kinross, 187.&lt;/ref&gt; Upon encountering the lifeless body of King Louis, Suleiman is said to have lamented: &quot;I came indeed in arms against him; but it was not my wish that he should be thus cut off while he scarcely tasted the sweets of life and royalty.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Severy, 580&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Embree, [http://www.ccds.charlotte.nc.us/History/MidEast/04/embree/embree.htm Suleiman The Magnificent].&lt;/ref&gt;

Under [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] and his brother Ferdinand, Archduke of Austria, the [[Habsburgs]] reoccupied Buda and took Hungary. As a result, in 1529, Suleiman once again marched through the valley of the Danube and regained control of Buda and in the following autumn laid [[Siege of Vienna|siege to Vienna]]. It was to be the Ottoman Empire's most ambitious expedition and the apogee of its drive towards the West. With a reinforced garrison of 16,000&amp;nbsp;men,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Stephen|last=Turnbull|title=The Ottoman Empire 1326&amp;nbsp;– 1699|location=New York|publisher=[[Osprey Publishing]]|year=2003|pages=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Austrians inflicted upon Suleiman his first defeat, sowing the seeds of a bitter Ottoman-Habsburg rivalry which lasted until the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Imber, 50.&lt;/ref&gt; A second attempt to conquer Vienna failed in 1532, with Suleiman retreating before reaching the city. In both cases, the Ottoman army was plagued by bad weather (forcing them to leave behind essential siege equipment) and was hobbled by overstretched supply lines.&lt;ref&gt;Labib, 444.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:John Sigismund of Hungary with Suleiman the Magnificient in 1556.jpg|thumb|King [[John II Sigismund Zápolya|John Sigismund]] of [[Hungary]] with Suleiman in 1556.]]
By the 1540s a renewal of the conflict in Hungary presented Suleiman with the opportunity to avenge the defeat suffered at Vienna. Some Hungarian nobles proposed that [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand, Archduke of Austria]] (1519–64), who was ruler of neighbouring [[Austria]] and tied to Louis II's family by marriage, be King of Hungary, citing previous agreements that the [[Habsburgs]] would take the Hungarian throne if Louis died without heirs.&lt;ref&gt;Imber, 52.&lt;/ref&gt; However, other nobles turned to the nobleman [[John Zápolya]] who, being supported by Suleiman, remained unrecognized by the Christian powers of Europe.

[[File:Siege of Esztergom 1543.jpg|thumb|left|Ottoman [[Siege of Esztergom (1543)]].]]
In 1541 the Habsburgs once again engaged in conflict with the Ottomans, attempting to lay siege to Buda. With their efforts repulsed, and more Habsburg fortresses captured as a result,&lt;ref&gt;Imber, 53.&lt;/ref&gt; Ferdinand and his brother Charles V were forced to conclude a humiliating five-year treaty with Suleiman. Ferdinand renounced his claim to the Kingdom of Hungary and was forced to pay a fixed yearly sum to the Sultan for the Hungarian lands he continued to control. Of more symbolic importance, the treaty referred to Charles V not as 'Emperor', but in rather plainer terms as the 'King of Spain', leading Suleiman to consider himself the true 'Caesar'.&lt;ref&gt;Imber, 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

With his main European rivals subdued, Suleiman had assured the Ottoman Empire a powerful role in the political landscape of Europe.

===Ottoman–Safavid War===
{{Main|Ottoman–Safavid War (1532–1555)}}
[[Image:Sueleymanname nahcevan.jpg|right|thumb|Miniature depicting Suleiman marching with an army in [[Nakhchivan]], summer 1554]]
As Suleiman stabilized his European frontiers, he now turned his attention to the ever present threat posed by the [[Shi'a]] [[Safavid dynasty]] of [[Persia]]. Two events in particular were to precipitate a recurrence of tensions. First, [[Shah]] [[Tahmasp I|Tahmasp]] had the [[Baghdad]] governor loyal to Suleiman killed and replaced with an adherent of the Shah, and second, the governor of Bitlis had defected and sworn allegiance to the Safavids.&lt;ref name=imber51&gt;Imber, 51.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, in 1533, Suleiman ordered his Grand Vizier Pargalı Ibrahim Pasha to lead an army into Asia where he retook [[Bitlis]] and occupied [[Tabriz]] without resistance. Having joined Ibrahim in 1534, Suleiman made a push towards Persia, only to find the Shah sacrificing territory instead of facing a pitched battle, resorting to harassment of the Ottoman army as it proceeded along the harsh interior.&lt;ref name=sicker206&gt;Sicker, 206.&lt;/ref&gt; When in the following year Suleiman and Ibrahim made a grand entrance into [[Baghdad]], its commander surrendered the city, thereby confirming Suleiman as the leader of the Islamic world and the legitimate successor to the [[Abbasid]] [[Caliphs]].&lt;ref&gt;Clot, 93.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hans Eworth Osmanischer Wurdentrager zu Pferd.jpg|thumb|left|Suleiman the Magnificent on horseback. Painting by [[Hans Eworth]].]]

Attempting to defeat the Shah once and for all, Suleiman embarked upon a second campaign in 1548–1549. As in the previous attempt, Tahmasp avoided confrontation with the Ottoman army and instead chose to retreat, using scorched earth tactics in the process and exposing the Ottoman army to the harsh winter of the [[Caucasus]].&lt;ref name=sicker206/&gt; Suleiman abandoned the campaign with temporary Ottoman gains in Tabriz and the Urmia region, a lasting presence in the province of [[Van Province|Van]], and some forts in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]].&lt;ref name=bartleby794&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/67/794.html 1548–49]&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1553 Suleiman began his third and final campaign against the Shah. Having initially lost territories in [[Erzurum]] to the Shah's son, Suleiman retaliated by recapturing Erzurum, crossing the Upper [[Euphrates]] and laying waste to parts of Persia. The Shah's army continued its strategy of avoiding the Ottomans, leading to a stalemate from which neither army made any significant gain. In 1554, a settlement was signed which was to conclude Suleiman's Asian campaigns. It included the return of Tabriz, but secured Baghdad, lower [[Mesopotamia]], the mouths of the river Euphrates and [[Tigris]], as well as part of the [[Persian Gulf]].&lt;ref name=Kinross236&gt;Kinross, 236.&lt;/ref&gt; The Shah also promised to cease all raids into Ottoman territory.&lt;ref name=bartleby795&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/67/795.html 1553–55]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ottoman fleet Indian Ocean 16th century.jpg|thumb|Ottoman fleet in the [[Indian Ocean]] in the 16th century.]]

Ottoman ships had been sailing in the [[Indian Ocean]], since the year 1518. [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Admiral]]s such as: [[Hadim Suleiman Pasha]], [[Seydi Ali Reis]]&lt;ref&gt;http://books.google.com.pk/books?id=s04pus5jBNwC&amp;pg=PA11&amp;dq=tipu+sultan+and+ottoman&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=nfgCT9OKHtGKhQf93c3jAw&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=snippet&amp;q=seydi&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Kurtoğlu Hızır Reis]] are known to have voyaged to the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] imperial ports of [[Thatta]], [[Surat]] and [[Janjira]]. The [[Mughal Emperor]] [[Akbar]], himself is known to have exchanged six documents with Suleiman the Magnificent.&lt;ref&gt;http://jis.oxfordjournals.org/content/7/1/32.extract&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://books.google.com/books?id=uB1uAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=akbar#search_anchor&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://books.google.com.pk/books?id=s04pus5jBNwC&amp;pg=PA11&amp;dq=tipu+sultan+and+ottoman&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=nfgCT9OKHtGKhQf93c3jAw&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=snippet&amp;q=akbar&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ottoman fleet Indian Ocean 16th century.jpg|thumb|Ottoman fleet in the [[Indian Ocean]] in the 16th century.]]

In the [[Indian Ocean]], Suleiman led several naval campaigns against the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] in an attempt to remove them and reestablish trade with [[India]]. [[Aden]] in [[Yemen]] was captured by the Ottomans in 1538, in order to provide an Ottoman base for raids against Portuguese possessions on the western coast of modern [[Pakistan]] and [[India]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Kour&quot;&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=KrsmNygcbNgC&amp;pg=PA2 ''The history of Aden, 1839-72'' by Zaka Hanna Kour p.2]&lt;/ref&gt; Sailing on to India, the Ottomans failed against the Portuguese at the [[Siege of Diu]] in September 1538, but then returned to Aden where they fortified the city with 100 pieces of artillery.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kour&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''An economic and social history of the Ottoman Empire'' by Halil İnalcik p.326 [http://books.google.com/books?id=Ovg_RQlklU4C&amp;pg=PA326]&lt;/ref&gt; From this base, Sulayman Pasha managed to take control of the whole country of Yemen, also taking Sa'na.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kour&quot;/&gt; Aden rose against the Ottomans however and invited the Portuguese instead, so that the Portuguese were in control of the city until its seizure by [[Piri Reis]] in the [[Capture of Aden (1548)]].

With its strong control of the [[Red Sea]], Suleiman successfully managed to dispute control of the Indian trade routes to the Portuguese and maintained a significant level of trade with the [[Mughal Empire]] of [[South Asia]] throughout the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;''History of the Ottoman Empire and modern Turkey'' by Ezel Kural Shaw p.107 [http://books.google.com/books?id=UVmsI0P9RDUC&amp;pg=PA107]&lt;/ref&gt; His admiral [[Piri Reis]] led an Ottoman fleet in the [[Indian Ocean]], achieving the [[Capture of Muscat (1552)|Capture of Muscat]] in 1552.

In 1564, Suleiman received an embassy from [[Aceh]] (modern [[Indonesia]]), requesting Ottoman support against the Portuguese. As a result an [[Ottoman expedition to Aceh]] was launched, which was able to provide extensive military support to the Acehnese.&lt;ref&gt;''Cambridge illustrated atlas, warfare: Renaissance to revolution, 1492-1792'' by Jeremy Black p.17 [http://books.google.com/books?id=neUKEvaYPZYC&amp;pg=PA17]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mediterranean and North Africa===

[[Image:Battle of Preveza (1538).jpg|right|thumb|230px|[[Barbarossa (Ottoman admiral)|Barbarossa Hayreddin Pasha]] defeats the Holy League under the command of [[Andrea Doria]] at the [[Battle of Preveza]] in 1538]]
Having consolidated his conquests on land, Suleiman was greeted with the news that the fortress of [[Koroni]] in [[Morea]] (the modern [[Peloponnese]]) had been lost to [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V's]] admiral, [[Andrea Doria]]. The presence of the Spanish in the Eastern Mediterranean concerned Suleiman, who saw it as an early indication of Charles V's intention to rival Ottoman dominance in the region. Recognizing the need to reassert the navy's preeminence in the [[Mediterranean]], Suleiman appointed an exceptional naval commander in the form of [[Hayreddin Barbarossa|Khair ad Din]], known to Europeans as [[Barbarossa (Ottoman admiral)|Barbarossa]]. Once appointed admiral-in-chief, Barbarossa was charged with rebuilding the Ottoman fleet, to such an extent that the Ottoman navy equalled in number those of all other Mediterranean countries put together.&lt;ref&gt;Clot, 87.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1535 Charles V won an important victory against the Ottomans at [[Tunis]], which together with the war against [[Republic of Venice|Venice]] the following year, led Suleiman to accept proposals from [[Francis I of France]] to form [[Franco-Ottoman alliance|an alliance against Charles]].&lt;ref name=imber51/&gt; In 1538, the Spanish fleet was defeated by Barbarossa at the [[Battle of Preveza]], securing the eastern Mediterranean for the Turks for 33 years until the defeat at the [[Battle of Lepanto (1571)|Battle of Lepanto]] in 1571.

[[File:Francois I Suleiman.jpg|thumb|230px|[[Francis I of France|Francis I]] (left) and Suleiman the Magnificent (right) initiated a [[Franco-Ottoman alliance]] from the 1530s.]]
East of [[Morocco]], huge territories in [[North Africa]] were annexed. The [[Barbary States]] of [[Tripolitania]], [[Tunisia]], and [[Algeria]] became autonomous provinces of the Empire, serving as the leading edge of Suleiman's conflict with Charles V, whose attempt to drive out the Turks failed in 1541.&lt;ref&gt;Kinross, 227.&lt;/ref&gt; The piracy carried on thereafter by the [[Barbary pirates]] of North Africa can be seen in the context of the wars against Spain. For a short period Ottoman expansion secured naval dominance in the Mediterranean. Ottoman navies also controlled the [[Red Sea]], and held the [[Persian Gulf]] until 1554, when their ships were defeated by the navy of the [[Portuguese Empire]]. The Portuguese had taken [[Ormus]] (in the [[Strait of Hormuz]]) in 1515 and would continue to vie with Suleiman's forces for control of [[Aden]], in present-day [[Yemen]].
[[Image:Siege of malta 1.jpg|210px|The Siege of Malta in 1565: Arrival of the Turkish fleet, by [[Matteo Perez d' Aleccio]]|thumb|left]]

In 1542, facing a common Habsburg enemy, Francis I sought to renew the [[Franco-Ottoman alliance]]. As a result, Suleiman dispatched 100 galleys&lt;ref&gt;Kinross, 53.&lt;/ref&gt; under Barbarossa to assist the French in the western Mediterranean. Barbarossa pillaged the coast of [[Naples]] and [[Sicily]] before reaching France where Francis made [[Toulon]] the Ottoman admirals naval headquarters. The same campaign had seen Barbarossa attack and [[Siege of Nice|capture Nice in 1543]]. By 1544, a peace between Francis I and Charles V had put a temporary end to the alliance between France and the Ottoman Empire.

Elsewhere in the Mediterranean, when the Knights Hospitallers were re-established as the [[Knights Hospitaller|Knights of Malta]] in 1530, their actions against Muslim navies quickly drew the ire of the Ottomans who assembled another massive army in order to dislodge the Knights from Malta. The Ottomans invaded in 1565, undertaking the [[Siege of Malta (1565)|Great Siege of Malta]], which began on May 18 and lasted until September 8, and is portrayed vividly in the frescoes of [[Matteo Perez d'Aleccio]] in the Hall of St. Michael and St. George. At first it seemed that this would be a repeat of the battle on [[Rhodes]], with most of Malta's cities destroyed and half the Knights killed in battle; but a relief force from [[Spain]] entered the battle, resulting in the loss of 30,000 &amp;nbsp;Ottoman troops and the victory of the local Maltese citizenry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.malta.com/about-malta/history-of-malta.html The History of Malta]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Administrative reforms==
[[Image:Suleiman bas-relief in the U.S. House of Representatives chamber.jpg|thumb|left|A [[bas-relief]] of Suleiman adorning the interior of the [[United States House of Representatives]]. It is one of 23 commemorating famous lawmakers throughout history.]]
While Sultan Suleiman was known as &quot;the Magnificent&quot; in the West, he was always ''Kanuni'' Suleiman or &quot;The Lawgiver&quot; to his own Ottoman subjects. As the historian [[Lord Kinross]] notes, &quot;Not only was he a great military campaigner, a man of the sword, as his father and great-grandfather had been before him. He differed from them in the extent to which he was also a man of the pen. He was a great legislator, standing out in the eyes of his people as a high-minded sovereign and a magnanimous exponent of justice&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Kinross, 205.&lt;/ref&gt; The overriding law of the empire was the [[Shari'ah]], or Sacred Law, which as the divine law of [[Islam]] was outside of the Sultan's powers to change. Yet an area of distinct law known as the ''Kanuns'' (canonical legislation) was dependent on Suleiman's will alone, covering areas such as criminal law, land tenure and taxation.&lt;ref&gt;Imber, 244.&lt;/ref&gt; He collected all the judgments that had been issued by the nine Ottoman Sultans who preceded him. After eliminating duplications and choosing between contradictory statements, he issued a single legal code, all the while being careful not to violate the basic laws of Islam.&lt;ref&gt;Greenblatt, 20.&lt;/ref&gt; It was within this framework that Suleiman, supported by his [[Grand Mufti]] [[Mehmet Ebussuud el-İmadi|Ebussuud]], sought to reform the legislation to adapt to a rapidly changing empire. When the Kanun laws attained their final form, the code of laws became known as the ''kanun‐i Osmani'', or the &quot;Ottoman laws&quot;. Suleiman's legal code was to last more than three hundred years.&lt;ref&gt;Greenblatt, 21.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:SuleimanIofOttomanEmpire.jpg|thumb|right|The emperor Suleiman the Magnificent. Sixteenth-century painting by a member of the Venetian school.]]

Suleiman gave particular attention to the plight of the [[Rayah|rayas]], Christian subjects who worked the land of the [[Sipahi]]s. His Kanune Raya, or &quot;Code of the Rayas&quot;, reformed the law governing levies and taxes to be paid by the rayas, raising their status above serfdom to the extent that Christian [[serfs]] would migrate to Turkish territories to benefit from the reforms.&lt;ref&gt;Kinross, 210.&lt;/ref&gt; The Sultan also played a role in protecting the Jewish subjects of his empire for centuries to come. In late 1553 or 1554, on the suggestion of his favorite doctor and dentist, the Spanish Jew [[Moses Hamon]], the Sultan issued a [[firman (decree)|''firman'']] formally denouncing [[blood libels]] against the Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Mansel, 124.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Suleiman enacted new criminal and police legislation, prescribing a set of fines for specific offences, as well as reducing the instances requiring death or mutilation. In the area of taxation, taxes were levied on various goods and produce, including animals, mines, profits of trade, and import-export duties. In addition to taxes, officials who had fallen into disrepute were likely to have their land and property confiscated by the Sultan.

Education was another important area for the Sultan. Schools attached to mosques and funded by religious foundations provided a largely free education to Muslim boys in advance of the Christian countries of the time.&lt;ref name=kinross211&gt;Kinross, 211.&lt;/ref&gt; In his capital, Suleiman increased the number of ''mektebs'' (primary schools) to fourteen, teaching boys to read and write as well as the principles of Islam. Young men wishing further education could proceed to one of eight ''[[Madrasah|medreses]]'' (colleges), whose studies included grammar, metaphysics, philosophy, astronomy, and astrology.&lt;ref name=kinross211 /&gt; Higher ''medreses'' provided education of university status, whose graduates became ''imams'' or teachers. Educational centers were often one of many buildings surrounding the courtyards of mosques, others included libraries, refectories, fountains, soup kitchens and hospitals for the benefit of the public.

Under Suleiman's patronage, the Ottoman empire entered the golden age of its [[Culture of the Ottoman Empire|cultural development]]. Hundreds of imperial artistic societies (called the ''Ehl-i Hiref'', &quot;Community of the Talented&quot;) were administered at the Imperial seat, the [[Topkapı Palace]]. After an apprenticeship, artists and craftsmen could advance in rank within their field and were paid commensurate wages in quarterly annual installments. Payroll registers that survive testify to the breadth of Suleiman's patronage of the arts, the earliest of documents dating from 1526 list 40&amp;nbsp;societies with over 600&amp;nbsp;members. The ''Ehl-i Hiref'' attracted the empire's most talented artisans to the Sultan's court, both from the Islamic world and recently conquered territories in Europe, resulting in a blend of Islamic, Turkish and European cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Atıl, [http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/198704/the.golden.age.of.ottoman.art.htm The Golden Age of Ottoman Art], 24–33.&lt;/ref&gt; Artisans in service of the court included painters, book binders, furriers, jewellers and goldsmiths. Whereas previous rulers had been influenced by [[Persian culture]] (Suleiman's father, Selim I, wrote poetry in Persian), Suleiman's patronage of the arts had seen the Ottoman Empire assert its own artistic legacy.&lt;ref&gt;Mansel, 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

Suleiman himself was an accomplished poet, writing in Persian and Turkish under the [[nom de plume]] ''Muhibbi'' (Lover). Some of Suleiman's verses have become Turkish proverbs, such as the well-known ''Everyone aims at the same meaning, but many are the versions of the story''. When his young son Mehmed died in 1543, he composed a moving [[chronogram]] to commemorate the year: ''Peerless among princes, my Sultan Mehmed''.&lt;ref name=byegm&gt;Halman, [http://web.archive.org/web/20060309091926/http://www.byegm.gov.tr/yayinlarimiz/NEWSPOT/1999/JulyAug/N6.htm Suleyman the Magnificent Poet]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.turkcebilgi.net/kim-kimdir/m/muhibbi-kanuni-sultan-suleyman-31612.html Muhibbî (Kanunî Sultan Süleyman){{tr icon}}] In Turkish the chronogram reads  شهزاده&amp;zwnj;لر گزيده&amp;zwnj;سی سلطان محمدم(''Şehzadeler güzidesi Sultan Muhammed’üm''), in which the Arabic [[Abjad numerals]] total 955, the equivalent in the [[Islamic calendar]] of 1543&amp;nbsp;AD.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to Suleiman's own work, many great talents enlivened the literary world during Suleiman's rule, including [[Fuzuli]] and [[Bâkî|Baki]]. The literary historian E. J. W. Gibb observed that &quot;at no time, even in Turkey, was greater encouragement given to poetry than during the reign of this Sultan&quot;.&lt;ref name=byegm /&gt; Suleiman's most famous verse is:
[[File:Istanbul - Süleymaniye camii dal Corno d'oro - Foto G. Dall'Orto 28-5-2006.jpg|thumb|right|[[Süleymaniye Mosque]] in Istanbul, built by [[Mimar Sinan]], Suleiman's chief architect.]]
{{quote|The people think of wealth and power as the greatest fate,&lt;/br&gt;
But in this world a spell of health is the best state.&lt;/br&gt;
What men call sovereignty is a worldly strife and constant war;&lt;/br&gt;
Worship of God is the highest throne, the happiest of all estates.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mansel, 84.&quot;&gt;Mansel, 84.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Suleiman also became renowned for sponsoring a series of monumental [[Ottoman architecture#Classical period (1437-1703)|architectural]] developments within his empire. The Sultan sought to turn Constantinople into the center of Islamic civilization by a series of projects, including bridges, mosques, palaces and various charitable and social establishments. The greatest of these were built by the Sultan's chief architect, [[Mimar Sinan]], under whom Ottoman architecture reached its zenith. Sinan became responsible for over three hundred monuments throughout the empire, including his two masterpieces, the [[Süleymaniye Mosque|Süleymaniye]] and [[Selimiye Mosque (Edirne)|Selimiye]] mosques—the latter built in [[Adrianople]] (now [[Edirne]]) in the reign of Suleiman's son [[Selim II]]. Suleiman also restored the [[Dome of the Rock]] in Jerusalem and the Jerusalem city walls (which are the current walls of the [[Old City (Jerusalem)|Old City of Jerusalem]]), renovated the [[Kaaba]] in [[Mecca]], and constructed a complex in Damascus.&lt;ref&gt;Atıl, 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
===Hürrem Sultan===

Suleiman was infatuated with [[Roxelana|Hürrem Sultan]], a [[Harem (household)|harem]] girl from [[Ruthenian Voivodeship|Ruthenia]], then part of [[Poland]]. In the West foreign diplomats, taking notice of the palace gossip about her, called her &quot;Russelazie&quot; or &quot;Roxelana&quot;, referring to her Ruthenian ([[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]]) origins.&lt;ref&gt;Ahmed, 43.&lt;/ref&gt; The daughter of an [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] priest,&lt;ref name=Kinross236/&gt; she was enslaved and rose through the ranks of the Harem to become Suleiman's [[favourite]]. Breaking with two centuries of Ottoman tradition,&lt;ref name=&quot;Kinross236&quot;/&gt; a former concubine had thus become the legal wife of the Sultan, much to the astonishment of observers in the palace and the city.&lt;ref&gt;Mansel, 86.&lt;/ref&gt; He also allowed Hürrem Sultan to remain with him at court for the rest of her life, breaking another tradition—that when imperial heirs came of age, they would be sent along with the imperial concubine who bore them to govern remote provinces of the Empire, never to return unless their progeny succeeded to the throne.&lt;ref&gt;Imber, 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under his pen name, Muhibbi, Suleiman composed this poem for Roxelana:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Throne of my lonely [[mihrab|niche]], my wealth, my love, my moonlight.&lt;/br&gt;
My most sincere friend, my confidant, my very existence, my Sultan, my one and only love.&lt;/br&gt;
The most beautiful among the beautiful...&lt;/br&gt;
My springtime, my merry faced love, my daytime, my sweetheart, laughing leaf...&lt;/br&gt;
My plants, my sweet, my rose, the one only who does not distress me in this world...&lt;/br&gt;
My Constantinople, my [[Karaman|Caraman]], the earth of my [[Anatolia]]&lt;/br&gt;
My [[Badakhshan]], my [[Baghdad]] and [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]]&lt;/br&gt;
My woman of the beautiful hair, my love of the slanted brow, my love of eyes full of mischief...&lt;/br&gt;
I'll sing your praises always&lt;/br&gt;
I, lover of the tormented heart, Muhibbi of the eyes full of tears, I am happy.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.womeninworldhistory.com/sample-10.html A 400 Year Old Love Poem]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Pargalı Ibrahim Pasha===
[[File:Szulejmán a sátrában Buda alatt (1529).JPG|thumb|The [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Sultan]] Suleiman the Magnificent, awaits the arrival of his [[Grand Vizier]] [[Pargalı Ibrahim Pasha]] at [[Buda]], in the year 1529.]]

[[Pargalı Ibrahim Pasha]] was the boyhood friend of Suleiman. Ibrahim was originally a Christian Greek,or Albanian and when he was young was educated at the [[Palace School]] under the [[devshirme]] system. Suleiman made him the royal [[Falconry|falconer]], then promoted him to first officer of the Royal Bedchamber.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mansel, 87.&quot;&gt;Mansel, 87.&lt;/ref&gt; Ibrahim Pasha rose to [[Grand Vizier]] in 1523 and commander-in-chief of all the armies. Suleiman also conferred upon Ibrahim Pasha the honor of ''beylerbey'' of [[Rumelia]], granting Ibrahim authority over all Turkish territories in Europe, as well as command of troops residing within them in times of war. According to a 17th century chronicler, Ibrahim had asked Suleiman not to promote him to such high positions, fearing for his safety; to which Suleiman replied that under his reign no matter what the circumstance, Ibrahim would never be put to death.&lt;ref&gt;Clot, 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet Ibrahim eventually fell from grace with the Sultan. During his thirteen years as Grand Vizier, his rapid rise to power and vast accumulation of wealth had made Ibrahim many enemies among the Sultan's court. Reports had reached the Sultan of Ibrahim's impudence during a campaign against the Persian Safavid empire: in particular his adoption of the title ''serasker sultan'' was seen as a grave affront to Suleiman.&lt;ref name=kinross230&gt;Kinross, 230.&lt;/ref&gt;

Suleiman's suspicion of Ibrahim was worsened by a quarrel between the latter and the Minister of Finance Iskender Chelebi. The dispute ended in the disgrace of Chelebi on charges of intrigue, with Ibrahim convincing Suleiman to sentence the Minister to death. Before his death however, Chelebi's last words were to accuse Ibrahim of conspiracy against the Sultan.&lt;ref name=kinross230 /&gt; These dying words convinced Suleiman of Ibrahim's disloyalty,&lt;ref name=kinross230/&gt; and on 15 March 1536 Ibrahim's lifeless body was discovered in the Topkapi Palace.

==Succession==
Suleiman's two [[Haseki Sultan]]s had borne him eight sons, four of whom survived past the 1550s. They were [[Sehzade Mustafa|Mustafa]], [[Selim II|Selim]], Bayezid, and Jihangir. Of these, only Mustafa was not Hürrem Sultan's son, but rather [[Mahidevran|Mahidevran Gülbahar Sultan]]'s (&quot;Rose of Spring&quot;), and therefore preceded Hürrem's children in the order of succession. Hürrem was aware that should Mustafa become Sultan her own children would be strangled. Yet Mustafa was recognised as the most talented of all the brothers and was supported by [[Pargalı İbrahim Pasha]], who was by this time Suleiman's [[Grand Vizier]]. The Austrian ambassador [[Ogier Ghiselin de Busbecq|Busbecq]] would note &quot;Suleiman has among his children a son called Mustafa, marvellously well educated and prudent and of an age to rule, since he is 24 or 25 years old; may God never allow a Barbary of such strength to come near us&quot;, going on to talk of Mustafa's &quot;remarkable natural gifts&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Clot, 155.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Suleiman Mohacs.jpg|left|thumb|Portrait of Suleiman by Nigari towards the end of his reign in 1560]]
[[Image:Suleiman Agostino.JPG|thumb|[[Agostino Veneziano]]'s [[engraving]] of Suleiman the Magnificent.&lt;ref&gt;Agostino never saw the Sultan, but probably did see and sketch the helmet in Venice.&lt;/ref&gt; Note the four tiers on the helmet, which he had commissioned from [[Venice]], symbolizing his imperial power, and excelling the three-tiered [[papal tiara]].&lt;ref&gt;The Metropolitan Museum of Art. 1968. &quot;Turquerie&quot; ''The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin'', New Series 26 (5): 229.&lt;/ref&gt; This tiara was made for 115,000 [[ducats]] and offered to Suleiman by the French ambassador [[Antonio Rincon]] in 1532.&lt;ref&gt;Garnier, p.52&lt;/ref&gt; This was a most atypical piece of headgear for an Ottoman sultan, which he probably never normally wore, but which he placed beside him when receiving visitors, especially ambassadors. It was crowned with an enormous feather.&lt;ref&gt;Levey, 65.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Hürrem is usually held at least partly responsible for the intrigues in nominating a successor. Although she was Suleiman's wife, she exercised no official public role. This did not, however, prevent Hürrem from wielding powerful political influence. Since the Empire lacked any formal means of nominating a successor, succession usually involved the death of competing princes in order to avert civil unrest and rebellions. In attempting to avoid the execution of her sons, Hürrem used her influence to eliminate those who supported Mustafa's accession to the throne.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mansel, 84.&quot;/&gt;

Thus in power struggles apparently instigated by Hürrem,&lt;ref name=&quot;Mansel, 87.&quot;/&gt; Suleiman had Ibrahim murdered and replaced with her sympathetic son-in-law, [[Rüstem Pasha]]. By 1552, when the campaign against Persia had begun with Rustem appointed commander-in-chief of the expedition, intrigues against Mustafa began. Rustem sent one of Suleiman's most trusted men to report that since Suleiman was not at the head of the army, the soldiers thought the time had come to put a younger prince on the throne; at the same time he spread rumors that Mustafa had proved receptive to the idea. Angered by what he came to believe were Mustafa's plans to claim the throne, the following summer upon return from his campaign in Persia, Suleiman summoned him to his tent in the [[Ereğli, Konya|Ereğli valley]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Tahsin|last=Ünal|publisher=Anıt|issue=28|article=The Execution of Prince Mustafa in Eregli|year=1961|pages=9–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; stating he would &quot;be able to clear himself of the crimes he was accused of and would have nothing to fear if he came&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Clot, 157.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mustafa was confronted with a choice: either he appeared before his father at the risk of being killed; or, if he refused to attend, he would be accused of betrayal. In the end, Mustafa chose to enter his father's tent, confident that the support of the army would protect him. Busbecq, who claims to have received an account from an eyewitness, describes Mustafa's final moments. As Mustafa entered his father's tent, Suleiman's [[Eunuch]]s attacked Mustafa, with the young prince putting up a brave defence. Suleiman, separated from the struggle only by the linen hangings of the tent, peered through the chamber of his tent and &quot;directed fierce and threatening glances upon the mutes, and by menacing gestures sternly rebuked their hesitation. Thereupon, the mutes in their alarm, redoubling their efforts, hurled Mustafa to the ground and, throwing the bowstring round his neck, strangled him.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Kinross, 239.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jihangir is said to have died of grief a few months after the news of his half-brother's murder.&lt;ref name=Mansel89&gt;Mansel, 89.&lt;/ref&gt; The two surviving brothers, Bayezid and Selim, were given command in different parts of the empire. Within a few years, however, civil war broke out between the brothers, each supported by his loyal forces.&lt;ref&gt;Kinross, 240.&lt;/ref&gt; With the aid of his father's army, Selim defeated Bayezid in [[Konya]] in 1559, leading the latter to seek refuge with the [[Safavids]] along with his four sons. Following diplomatic exchanges, the Sultan demanded from the [[Tahmasp I|Safavid Shah]] that Bayezid be either extradited or executed. In return for large amounts of gold, the Shah allowed a Turkish executioner to strangle Bayezid and his four sons in 1561,&lt;ref name=Mansel89/&gt; clearing the path for Selim's succession to the throne seven years later. On 5/6 September 1566,&lt;ref&gt;Yapp, [http://uk.encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761575054_2/Suleiman_I.html Suleiman I]&lt;/ref&gt; Suleiman, who had set out from Constantinople to command an expedition to Hungary, died before an Ottoman victory at the [[Battle of Szigetvár]] in Hungary.&lt;ref&gt;Imber, 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
[[File:Suleiman sequin 1520.jpg|left|thumb|Sequin of Suleiman the Magnificent.]]
[[File:Ottoman empire.svg|thumb|Suleiman I's conquests were followed by continuous territorial expansion until the Empire's peak in 1683.]]

KKSgb6141]]

At the time of Suleiman's death, the Ottoman Empire was one of the world's foremost powers.&lt;ref&gt;Clot, 298.&lt;/ref&gt; Suleiman's conquests had brought under the control of the Empire the major [[Muslim]] cities ([[Mecca]], [[Medina]], [[Jerusalem]], [[Damascus]], and [[Baghdad]]), many [[Balkan peninsula|Balkan]] provinces (reaching present day [[Croatia]] and [[Austria]]), and most of [[North Africa]]. His expansion into Europe had given the Ottoman Turks a powerful presence in the European balance of power. Indeed, such was the perceived threat of the Ottoman Empire under the reign of Suleiman that ambassador [[Ogier Ghiselin de Busbecq|Busbecq]] warned of Europe's imminent conquest: &quot;On [the Turks'] side are the resources of a mighty empire, strength unimpaired, habituation to victory, endurance of toil, unity, discipline, frugality and watchfulness... Can we doubt what the result will be?...When the Turks have settled with Persia, they will fly at our throats supported by the might of the whole East; how unprepared we are I dare not say.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even thirty years after his death &quot;Sultan Solyman&quot; was quoted by the English playwright [[William Shakespeare]] as a military prodigy in ''[[Merchant of Venice|The Merchant of Venice]]'' (Act 2, Scene 1).

[[File:İstanbul 5622.jpg|thumb|left|180px|[[Türbe]] (tomb) of Sultan Süleyman at [[Süleymaniye Mosque]].]]
Suleiman's legacy was not, however, merely in the military field. The French traveler [[Jean de Thévenot]] a century later bears witness to the &quot;strong agricultural base of the country, the well being of the peasantry, the abundance of staple foods, and the pre-eminence of organization in Suleiman's government&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Ahmed, 147.&lt;/ref&gt; The administrative and legal reforms which earned him the name Law Giver ensured the Empire's survival long after his death, an achievement which &quot;took many generations of decadent heirs to undo&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Lamb, 325.&lt;/ref&gt;

Through his personal patronage, Suleiman also presided over the Golden Age of the Ottoman Empire, representing the pinnacle of the Ottoman Turks' cultural achievement in the realm of architecture, literature, art, theology and philosophy.&lt;ref name=&quot;atil24&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Russell, [http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE7D6163EF935A15752C0A961948260 The Age of Sultan Suleyman].&lt;/ref&gt; Today the skyline of the [[Bosphorus]], and of many cities in modern Turkey and the former Ottoman provinces, are still adorned with the architectural works of [[Mimar Sinan]]. One of these, the [[Süleymaniye Mosque]], is the final resting place of Suleiman and Herenzaltan: they are buried in separate domed mausoleums attached to the mosque.
