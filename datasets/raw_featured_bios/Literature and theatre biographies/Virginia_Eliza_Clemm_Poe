'''Virginia Eliza Clemm Poe''' ([[née]] '''Clemm'''; August 15, 1822{{spaced ndash}}January 30, 1847) was the wife of American writer [[Edgar Allan Poe]]. The couple were [[cousin|first cousins]] and married when Virginia Clemm was 13 and Poe was 27. Some biographers have suggested that the couple's relationship was more like that between brother and sister than like husband and wife in that they might have never [[Consummation|consummated]] their marriage. In January 1842 she contracted [[tuberculosis]] and died of the disease in January 1847 at the age of 24 in [[Edgar Allan Poe Cottage|the family's cottage]] outside [[New York City]].

Along with other family members, Virginia Clemm and Edgar Allan Poe lived together off and on for several years before their marriage. The couple often moved to accommodate Poe's employment, living intermittently in [[Baltimore]], [[Philadelphia]], and [[New York City|New York]]. A few years after their wedding, Poe was involved in a substantial scandal involving [[Frances Sargent Osgood]] and [[Elizabeth F. Ellet]]. Rumors about amorous improprieties on her husband's part affected Virginia Poe so much that on her deathbed she claimed that Ellet had murdered her. After her death, her body was eventually placed under the same memorial marker as her husband's in [[Westminster Hall and Burying Ground]] in Baltimore, [[Maryland]]. Only one image of Virginia Eliza Clemm Poe has been authenticated: a watercolor portrait painted several hours after her death.

The disease and eventual death of his wife had a substantial effect on Edgar Allan Poe, who became despondent and turned to alcohol to cope. Her struggles with illness and death are believed to have affected his poetry and prose, where dying young women appear as a frequent motif, as in &quot;[[Annabel Lee]]&quot;, &quot;[[The Raven]]&quot;, and &quot;[[Ligeia]]&quot;.

==Biography==
===Early life===
[[Image:PoeFamilyTree.svg|thumb|400px|Poe family tree]]

Virginia Eliza Clemm was born on August 15, 1822&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Dwight &amp; David K. Jackson. ''The Poe Log: A Documentary Life of Edgar Allan Poe, 1809–1849''. Boston: G. K. Hall &amp; Co., 1987: 52. ISBN 0-7838-1401-1&lt;/ref&gt; and named after an older sister who had died as an infant&lt;ref name=Silverman82&gt;Silverman, 82&lt;/ref&gt; only ten days earlier.&lt;ref&gt;Quinn, 17&lt;/ref&gt; Her father William Clemm, Jr. was a hardware merchant in Baltimore.&lt;ref name=Silverman81&gt;Silverman 81&lt;/ref&gt; He had married Maria Poe, Virginia's mother, on July 12, 1817,&lt;ref&gt;Quinn, 726&lt;/ref&gt; after the death of his first wife, Maria's first cousin Harriet.&lt;ref&gt;Meyers, 59&lt;/ref&gt; Clemm had five children from his previous marriage and went on to have three more with Maria.&lt;ref name=Silverman81/&gt; After his death in 1826, he left very little to the family&lt;ref name=Meyers60&gt;Meyers, 60&lt;/ref&gt; and relatives offered no financial support because they had opposed the marriage.&lt;ref name=Silverman81/&gt; Maria supported the family by sewing and taking in boarders, aided with an annual $240 pension granted to her mother Elizabeth Cairnes, who was paralyzed and bedridden.&lt;ref name=Meyers60/&gt; Elizabeth received this pension on behalf of her late husband, &quot;General&quot; David Poe, a former [[quartermaster]] in Maryland who had loaned money to the state.&lt;ref&gt;Quinn, 256&lt;/ref&gt;

Edgar Poe first met his cousin Virginia in August 1829, four months after his discharge from the Army. She was seven at the time.&lt;ref name=Sova52&gt;Sova, 52&lt;/ref&gt; In 1832, the family – made up of Elizabeth, Maria, Virginia, and Virginia's brother Henry&lt;ref name=Sova52/&gt; – was able to use Elizabeth's pension to rent a home at what was then [[Edgar Allan Poe House and Museum|3 North Amity Street]] in Baltimore.&lt;ref&gt;Haas, Irvin. ''Historic Homes of American Authors''. Washington, DC: The Preservation Press, 1991. ISBN 0-89133-180-8. p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; Poe's older brother [[William Henry Leonard Poe]], who had been living with the family,&lt;ref name=Sova52/&gt; had recently died on August 1, 1831.&lt;ref&gt;Quinn, 187–188&lt;/ref&gt; Poe joined the household in 1833&lt;ref&gt;Silverman, 96&lt;/ref&gt; and was soon smitten by a neighbor named Mary Devereaux. The young Virginia served as a messenger between the two, at one point retrieving a lock of Devereaux's hair to give to Poe.&lt;ref&gt;Sova, 67&lt;/ref&gt; Elizabeth Cairnes Poe died on July 7, 1835, effectively ending the family's income and making their financial situation even more difficult.&lt;ref&gt;Quinn, 218&lt;/ref&gt; Henry died around this time, sometime before 1836, leaving Virginia as Maria Clemm's only surviving child.&lt;ref name=Silverman323&gt;Silverman, 323&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1835, Poe left the destitute family behind and moved to [[Richmond, Virginia]] to take a job at the ''[[Southern Literary Messenger]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Sova, 225&lt;/ref&gt; While Poe was away from Baltimore, another cousin, Neilson Poe, the husband of Virginia's half-sister Josephine Clemm,&lt;ref name=Quinn219/&gt; heard that Edgar was considering marrying Virginia. Neilson offered to take her in and have her educated in an attempt to prevent the girl's marriage to Edgar at such a young age, though suggesting that the option could be reconsidered later.&lt;ref&gt;Silverman, 104&lt;/ref&gt; Edgar called Neilson, the owner of a newspaper in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]], his &quot;bitterest enemy&quot; and interpreted his cousin's actions as an attempt at breaking his connection with Virginia.&lt;ref name=Meyers72&gt;Meyers, 72&lt;/ref&gt; On August 29, 1835,&lt;ref name=Meyers72/&gt; Edgar wrote an emotional letter to Maria, declaring that he was &quot;blinded with tears while writing&quot;,&lt;ref name=Quinn219&gt;Quinn, 219&lt;/ref&gt; and pleading that she allow Virginia to make her own decision.&lt;ref&gt;Silverman, 105&lt;/ref&gt;  Encouraged by his employment at the ''Southern Literary Messenger'', Poe offered to provide financially for Maria, Virginia and Henry if they moved to Richmond.&lt;ref&gt;Meyers, 74&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marriage===
[[Image:PoeMarriage.JPG|thumb|right|Virginia and Edgar's [[marriage certificate]]]]

Marriage plans were confirmed and Poe returned to Baltimore to file for a [[marriage license]] on September 22, 1835. The couple might have been quietly married as well, though accounts are unclear.&lt;ref name=Silverman107&gt;Silverman, 107&lt;/ref&gt; Their only public ceremony was in Richmond on May 16, 1836, when they were married by a Presbyterian minister named Rev. Amasa Converse.&lt;ref name=Meyers85&gt;Meyers, 85&lt;/ref&gt; Poe was 27 and Virginia was 13, though her age was listed as 21.&lt;ref name=Meyers85/&gt; This marriage bond was filed in Richmond and included an [[affidavit]] from Thomas W. Cleland confirming the bride's alleged age.&lt;ref&gt;Quinn, 252&lt;/ref&gt; The ceremony was held in the evening at the home of a Mrs. James Yarrington,&lt;ref name=Quinn254&gt;Quinn, 254&lt;/ref&gt; the owner of the [[boarding house]] in which Poe, Virginia, and Virginia's mother Maria Clemm were staying.&lt;ref&gt;Quinn, 230&lt;/ref&gt; Yarrington helped Maria Clemm bake the wedding cake and prepared a wedding meal.&lt;ref&gt;Sova, 263&lt;/ref&gt; The couple then had a short [[honeymoon]] in [[Petersburg, Virginia]].&lt;ref name=Quinn254/&gt;

Debate has raged regarding how unusual this pairing was based on the couple's age and blood relationship. Noted Poe biographer Arthur Hobson Quinn argues it was not particularly unusual, nor was Poe's nicknaming his wife &quot;Sissy&quot; or &quot;Sis&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, 26&lt;/ref&gt; Another Poe biographer, [[Kenneth Silverman]], contends that though their first-cousin marriage was not unusual, her young age was.&lt;ref name=Silverman107/&gt; It has been suggested that Clemm and Poe had a relationship more like that between brother and sister than between husband and wife.&lt;ref&gt;Krutch, 52&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars, including [[Princess Marie Bonaparte|Marie Bonaparte]], have read many of Poe's works as autobiographical and have concluded that Virginia died a [[virginity|virgin]]&lt;ref name=Hoffman27&gt;Hoffman, 27&lt;/ref&gt; because she and her husband never consummated their marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Richard, Claude and Jean-Marie Bonnet, &quot;[http://www.eapoe.org/pstudies/PS1960/P1968108.HTM Raising the Wind; or, French Editions of the Works of Edgar Allan Poe]&quot;, ''Poe Newsletter'', vol. I, No. 1, April 1968, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; This interpretation often assumes that Virginia is represented by the title character in the poem &quot;[[Annabel Lee]]&quot;: a &quot;maiden... by the name of Annabel Lee&quot;.&lt;ref name=Hoffman27/&gt; Poe biographer Joseph Wood Krutch suggests that Poe did not need women &quot;in the way that normal men need them&quot;, but only as a source of inspiration and care,&lt;ref&gt;Krutch, 54&lt;/ref&gt; and that Poe was never interested in women sexually.&lt;ref&gt;Krutch, 25&lt;/ref&gt; Friends of Poe suggested that the couple did not share a bed for at least the first two years of their marriage but that, from the time she turned 16, they had a &quot;normal&quot; married life until the onset of her illness.&lt;ref name=Sova53&gt;Sova, 53&lt;/ref&gt;

Virginia and Poe were by all accounts a happy and devoted couple. Poe's one-time employer [[George Rex Graham]] wrote of their relationship: &quot;His love for his wife was a sort of rapturous worship of the spirit of beauty.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Oberholtzer, 299&lt;/ref&gt; Poe once wrote to a friend, &quot;I see no one among the living as beautiful as my little wife.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, 1184&lt;/ref&gt; She, in turn, by many contemporary accounts, nearly idolized her husband.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, 318&lt;/ref&gt; She often sat close to him while he wrote, kept his pens in order, and folded and addressed his manuscripts.&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, 1183&lt;/ref&gt; She showed her love for Poe in an [[acrostic]] poem she composed when she was 23, dated February 14, 1846:

[[Image:VirginiaValentine.jpg|thumb|right|Virginia's handwritten [[Valentine's day|Valentine]] poem to her husband]]

&lt;poem&gt;
:Ever with thee I wish to roam —
:Dearest my life is thine.
:Give me a cottage for my home
:And a rich old cypress vine,
:Removed from the world with its sin and care
:And the tattling of many tongues.
:Love alone shall guide us when we are there —
:Love shall heal my weakened lungs;
:And Oh, the tranquil hours we'll spend,
:Never wishing that others may see!
:Perfect ease we'll enjoy, without thinking to lend
:Ourselves to the world and its glee —
:Ever peaceful and blissful we'll be.&lt;ref&gt;Quinn, 497&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;

===Osgood/Ellet scandal===
[[Image:FannyOsgood.jpg|right|thumb|[[Frances Sargent Osgood]]]]

The &quot;tattling of many tongues&quot; in Virginia's Valentine poem was a reference to actual incidents.&lt;ref&gt;Moss, 214&lt;/ref&gt; In 1845, Poe had begun a flirtation with [[Frances Sargent Osgood]], a married 34-year-old poet.&lt;ref&gt;Silverman, 280&lt;/ref&gt; Virginia was aware of the friendship and might even have encouraged it.&lt;ref name=Meyers190&gt;Meyers, 190&lt;/ref&gt; She often invited Osgood to visit them at home, believing that the older woman had a &quot;restraining&quot; effect on Poe, who had made a promise to &quot;give up the use of stimulants&quot; and was never drunk in Osgood's presence.&lt;ref&gt;Silverman, 287&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, another poet, [[Elizabeth F. Ellet]], became enamored of Poe and jealous of Osgood.&lt;ref name=Meyers190/&gt; Though, in a letter to [[Sarah Helen Whitman]], Poe called her love for him &quot;loathsome&quot; and wrote that he &quot;could do nothing but repel [it] with scorn&quot;, he printed many of her poems to him in the ''[[Broadway Journal]]'' while he was its editor.&lt;ref&gt;Moss, 212&lt;/ref&gt; Ellet was known for being meddlesome and vindictive&lt;ref&gt;Silverman, 288&lt;/ref&gt; and, while visiting the Poe household in late January 1846, she saw one of Osgood's personal letters to Poe.&lt;ref name=Meyers191&gt;Meyers, 191&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ellet, Virginia pointed out &quot;fearful paragraphs&quot; in Osgood's letter.&lt;ref name=Moss213&gt;Moss, 213&lt;/ref&gt; Ellet contacted Osgood and suggested she should beware of her indiscretions and asked Poe to return her letters,&lt;ref name=Meyers191/&gt; motivated either by jealousy or by a desire to cause scandal.&lt;ref name=Moss213/&gt; Osgood then sent [[Margaret Fuller]] and [[Anne Lynch Botta]] to ask Poe on her behalf to return the letters. Angered by their interference, Poe called them &quot;Busy-bodies&quot; and said that Ellet had better &quot;look after her ''own'' letters&quot;, suggesting indiscretion on her part.&lt;ref name=Silverman290&gt;Silverman, 290&lt;/ref&gt; He then gathered up these letters from Ellet and left them at her house.&lt;ref name=Meyers191/&gt;

Though these letters had already been returned to her, Ellet asked her brother &quot;to ''demand of me the letters''&quot;.&lt;ref name=Silverman290/&gt; Her brother, Colonel William Lummis, did not believe that Poe had already returned them and threatened to kill him. In order to defend himself, Poe requested a pistol from [[Thomas Dunn English]].&lt;ref name=Meyers191/&gt; English, Poe's friend and a minor writer who was also a trained doctor and lawyer, likewise did not believe that Poe had already returned the letters and even questioned their existence.&lt;ref name=Silverman290/&gt; The easiest way out of the predicament, he said, &quot;was a retraction of unfounded charges&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Moss, 220&lt;/ref&gt; Angered at being called a liar, Poe pushed English into a fistfight. Poe later claimed he was triumphant in the fight, though English claimed otherwise, and Poe's face was badly cut by one of English's rings.&lt;ref name=Meyers191/&gt; In Poe's version, he said, &quot;I gave E. a flogging which he will remember to the day of his death.&quot; Either way, the fight further sparked gossip over the Osgood affair.&lt;ref&gt;Silverman, 291&lt;/ref&gt;

Osgood's husband stepped in and threatened to sue Ellet unless she formally apologized for her insinuations. She retracted her statements in a letter to Osgood saying, &quot;The letter shown me by Mrs Poe ''must have been a forgery''&quot; created by Poe himself.&lt;ref&gt;Moss, 215&lt;/ref&gt; She put all the blame on Poe, suggesting the incident was because Poe was &quot;intemperate and subject to acts of lunacy&quot;.&lt;ref name=Silverman292&gt;Silverman, 292&lt;/ref&gt; Ellet spread the rumor of Poe's insanity, which was taken up by other enemies of Poe and reported in newspapers. The St. Louis ''Reveille'' reported: &quot;A rumor is in circulation in New York, to the effect that Mr. Edgar A. Poe, the poet and author, has been deranged, and his friends are about to place him under the charge of [[Amariah Brigham|Dr. Brigham]] of the [[Utica Psychiatric Center|Insane Retreat]] at Utica.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Meyers, 192&lt;/ref&gt; The scandal eventually died down only when Osgood reunited with her husband.&lt;ref name=Silverman292/&gt; Virginia, however, had been very affected by the whole affair. She had received anonymous letters about her husband's alleged indiscretions as early as July 1845. It is presumed that Ellet was involved with these letters, and they so disturbed Virginia that she allegedly declared on her deathbed that &quot;Mrs. E. had been her murderer.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Moss, 213–214&lt;/ref&gt;

===Illness===
By this time, Virginia had developed [[Tuberculosis|consumption]], first seen sometime in the middle of January 1842. While singing and playing the piano, Virginia began to bleed from the mouth, though Poe said she merely &quot;ruptured a blood-vessel&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Silverman, 179&lt;/ref&gt; Her health declined and she became an invalid, which drove Poe into a deep depression, especially as she occasionally showed signs of improvement.  In a letter to a friend, Poe described his resulting mental state: &quot;Each time I felt all the agonies of her death&amp;mdash;and at each accession of the disorder I loved her more dearly &amp; clung to her life with more desperate pertinacity. But I am constitutionally sensitive&amp;mdash;nervous in a very unusual degree. I became insane, with long intervals of horrible sanity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Meyers, 208&lt;/ref&gt;

Virginia's condition might have been what prompted the Poe family to move, in the hopes of finding a healthier environment for her. They moved several times within [[Philadelphia]] in the early 1840s and their last home in that city is now preserved as the [[Edgar Allan Poe National Historic Site]] in [[Spring Garden District, Pennsylvania|Spring Garden]].&lt;ref name=Silverman183&gt;Silverman, 183&lt;/ref&gt; In this home, Virginia was well enough to tend the flower garden&lt;ref&gt;Quinn, 385&lt;/ref&gt; and entertain visitors by playing the harp or the piano and singing.&lt;ref&gt;Oberholtzer, 287&lt;/ref&gt; The family then moved to New York sometime in early April 1844, traveling by train and steamboat. Virginia waited on board the ship while her husband secured space at a boarding house on Greenwich Street.&lt;ref&gt;Silverman, 219–220&lt;/ref&gt; By early 1846, family friend [[Elizabeth Oakes Smith]] said that Virginia admitted, &quot;I know I shall die soon; I know I can't get well; but I want to be as happy as possible, and make Edgar happy.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, 1098&lt;/ref&gt; She promised her husband that after her death she would be his guardian angel.&lt;ref&gt;Silverman, 301&lt;/ref&gt;

===Move to Fordham===
[[Image:Poe cottage - 1900.jpg|thumb|right|Virginia Poe endured the latter part of her illness at [[Edgar Allan Poe Cottage|this cottage]] in the [[Fordham, Bronx|Bronx]], [[New York]], shown here in 1900.]]
In May 1846, the family (Poe, Virginia, and her mother, Maria) moved to a small [[cottage]] in [[Fordham, Bronx|Fordham]], about fourteen miles outside the city,&lt;ref&gt;Meyers, 322&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Edgar Allan Poe Cottage|home which is still standing today]]. In what is the only surviving letter from Poe to Virginia, dated June 12, 1846, he urged her to remain optimistic: &quot;Keep up your heart in all hopelessness, and trust yet a little longer.&quot; Of his recent loss of the ''Broadway Journal'', the only magazine Poe ever owned, he said, &quot;I should have lost my courage ''but for you''&amp;mdash;my darling little wife you are my ''greatest'' and ''only'' stimulus now to battle with this uncongenial, unsatisfactory and ungrateful life.&quot;&lt;ref name=Meyers203&gt;Meyers, 203&lt;/ref&gt; But by November of that year, Virginia's condition was hopeless.&lt;ref name=Silverman323 /&gt; Her symptoms included irregular appetite, flushed cheeks, unstable pulse, night sweats, high fever, sudden chills, shortness of breath, chest pains, coughing and spitting up blood.&lt;ref name=Meyers203/&gt;

[[Nathaniel Parker Willis]], a friend of Poe's and an influential editor, published an announcement on December 30, 1846, requesting help for the family, though his facts were not entirely correct:&lt;ref name=Meyers202&gt;Meyers, 202&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Illness of Edgar A. Poe. &amp;mdash;We regret to learn that this gentleman and his wife are both dangerously ill with the consumption, and that the hand of misfortune lies heavily on their temporal affairs. We are sorry to mention the fact that they are so far reduced as to be barely able to obtain the necessaries of life. That is, indeed, a hard lot, and we do hope that the friends and admirers of Mr. Poe will come promptly to his assistance in his bitterest hour of need.&lt;ref name=Silverman324/&gt;}}
[[Image:VirginiaPoeBedroom.jpg|thumb|right|Her bedroom at Poe Cottage.]]
Willis, who had not corresponded with Poe for two years and had since lost his own wife, was one of his greatest supporters in this period. He sent Poe and his wife an inspirational Christmas book, ''The Marriage Ring; or How to Make a Home Happy''.&lt;ref name=Silverman324&gt;Silverman, 324&lt;/ref&gt;

The announcement was similar to one made for Poe's mother, [[Eliza Poe]], during her last stages of tuberculosis.&lt;ref name=Meyers202/&gt; Other newspapers picked up on the story: &quot;Great God!&quot;, said one, &quot;is it possible, that the literary people of the Union, will let poor Poe perish by starvation and lean faced beggary in New York? For so we are led to believe, from frequent notices in the papers, stating that Poe and his wife are both down upon a bed of misery, death, and disease, with not a ducat in the world.&quot;&lt;ref name=Silverman324/&gt; The ''[[Saturday Evening Post]]'' asserted that Virginia was in a hopeless condition and that Poe was bereft: &quot;It is said that Edgar A. Poe is lying dangerously with brain fever, and that his wife is in the last stages of consumption&amp;mdash;they are without money and without friends.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Meyers203&quot;/&gt; Even editor Hiram Fuller, whom Poe had previously sued for [[defamation|libel]], attempted in the ''New York Mirror'' to garner support for Poe and his wife: &quot;We, whom he has quarrelled with, will take the lead&quot;, he wrote.&lt;ref name=Silverman324/&gt;

Virginia was described as having dark hair and violet eyes, with skin so pale it was called &quot;pure white&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Krutch, 55–56&lt;/ref&gt; causing a &quot;bad complexion that spoiled her looks&quot;.&lt;ref name=Silverman82/&gt; One visitor to the Poe family noted that &quot;the rose-tint upon her cheek was too bright&quot;, possibly a symptom of her illness.&lt;ref&gt;Silverman, 182&lt;/ref&gt; Another visitor in Fordham wrote, &quot;Mrs. Poe looked very young; she had large black eyes, and a pearly whiteness of complexion, which was a perfect pallor. Her pale face, her brilliant eyes, and her raven hair gave her an unearthly look.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Meyers, 204&lt;/ref&gt; That unearthly look was mentioned by others who suggested it made her look not quite human.&lt;ref name=Krutch56&gt;Krutch, 56&lt;/ref&gt; William Gowans, who once lodged with the family, described Virginia as a woman of &quot;matchless beauty and loveliness, her eye could match that of any [[houri]], and her face defy the genius of a [[Antonio Canova|Canova]] to imitate&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Meyers, 92–93&lt;/ref&gt; She might have been a little plump.&lt;ref name=Krutch56/&gt; Many contemporary accounts as well as modern biographers remark on her child-like appearance even in the last years of her life.&lt;ref name=Sova52/&gt;&lt;ref name=Krutch56/&gt;&lt;ref name=Meyers206/&gt;

[[Image:VirginiaPoeMonument.jpg|thumb|left|Memorial marker to Virginia Clemm, Maria Clemm, and Edgar Allan Poe in [[Baltimore, Maryland]]]]

While dying, Virginia asked her mother: &quot;Darling... will you console and take care of my poor Eddy&amp;mdash;you will ''never never'' leave him?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Silverman, 420&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother stayed with Poe until his own death in 1849. As Virginia was dying, the family received many visitors, including an old friend named Mary Starr. At one point Virginia put Starr's hand in Poe's and asked her to &quot;be a friend to Eddy, and don't forsake him&quot;.&lt;ref name=Silverman326/&gt; Virginia was tended to by 25-year old Marie Louise Shew. Shew, who served as a nurse, knew medical care from her father and her husband, both doctors.&lt;ref&gt;Sova, 218&lt;/ref&gt; She provided Virginia with a [[comforter]] as her only other cover was Poe's old military [[cloak]], as well as bottles of wine, which the invalid drank &quot;smiling, even when difficult to get it down&quot;.&lt;ref name=Silverman326&gt;Silverman, 326&lt;/ref&gt; Virginia also showed Poe a letter from Louisa Patterson, second wife of Poe's foster-father John Allan, which she had kept for years&lt;ref&gt;Quinn, 527&lt;/ref&gt; and which suggested that Patterson had purposely caused the break between Allan and Poe.&lt;ref name=Silverman326/&gt;

===Death===
On January 29, 1847, Poe wrote to Marie Louise Shew: &quot;My poor Virginia still lives, although failing fast and now suffering much pain.&quot;&lt;ref name=Meyers206&gt;Meyers, 206&lt;/ref&gt;
Virginia died the following day, January 30,&lt;ref&gt;Krutch, 169&lt;/ref&gt; after five years of illness. Shew helped in organizing her funeral, even purchasing the coffin.&lt;ref name=Silverman327&gt;Silverman, 327&lt;/ref&gt; Death notices appeared in several newspapers. On February 1, The New York ''Daily Tribune'' and the ''Herald'' carried the simple obituary: &quot;On Saturday, the 30th ult., of pulmonary consumption, in the 25th year of her age, VIRGINIA ELIZA, wife of EDGAR A. POE.&quot;&lt;ref name=Silverman326/&gt; The funeral was February 2, 1847.&lt;ref name=Meyers206/&gt; Attendees included Nathaniel Parker Willis, [[Ann S. Stephens]], and publisher [[George Pope Morris]]. Poe refused to look at his dead wife's face, saying he preferred to remember her living.&lt;ref name=&quot;Phillips1203&quot;/&gt; Though now buried at [[Westminster Hall and Burying Ground]], Virginia was originally buried in a [[burial vault|vault]] owned by the Valentine family, from whom the Poes rented their Fordham cottage.&lt;ref name=Silverman327/&gt;

Only one image of Virginia is known to exist, for which the painter had to take her corpse as model.&lt;ref name=Sova52/&gt; A few hours after her death, Poe realized he had no image of Virginia and so commissioned a portrait in [[watercolor painting|watercolor]].&lt;ref name=Meyers206/&gt; She is shown wearing &quot;beautiful linen&quot; that Shew said she had dressed her in;&lt;ref name=Phillips1203&gt;Phillips, 1203&lt;/ref&gt; Shew might have been the portrait's artist, though this is uncertain.&lt;ref name=Silverman327/&gt; The image depicts her with a slight double chin and with hazel eyes.&lt;ref name=Meyers206/&gt; The image was passed down to the family of Virginia's half-sister Josephine, wife of Neilson Poe.&lt;ref name=Phillips1203/&gt;

In 1875, the same year in which her husband's body was reburied, the cemetery in which she lay was destroyed and her remains were almost forgotten. An early Poe biographer, William Gill, gathered the bones and stored them in a box he hid under his bed.&lt;ref&gt;Meyers, 263&lt;/ref&gt; Gill's story was reported in the ''[[Boston Herald]]'' twenty-seven years after the event: he says that he had visited the Fordham cemetery in 1883 at exactly the moment that the [[sexton (office)|sexton]] Dennis Valentine held Virginia's bones in his shovel, ready to throw them away as unclaimed. Poe himself had died in 1849, and so Gill took Virginia's remains and, after corresponding with Neilson Poe and John Prentiss Poe in Baltimore, arranged to bring the box down to be laid on Poe's left side in a small bronze casket.&lt;ref name=Miller&gt; Miller, John C. &quot;[http://www.eapoe.org/pstudies/ps1970/p1974204.htm The Exhumations and Reburials of Edgar and Virginia Poe and Mrs. Clemm]&quot;, from ''Poe Studies'', vol. VII, no. 2, December 1974, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; Virginia's remains were finally buried with her husband's on January 19, 1885&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, 1205&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;mdash;the seventy-sixth anniversary of her husband's birth and nearly ten years after his current monument was erected. The same man who served as sexton during Poe's original burial and his exhumations and reburials was also present at the rites which brought his body to rest with Virginia and Virginia's mother Maria Clemm.&lt;ref name=Miller/&gt;

==Effect and influence on Poe==
Virginia's death had a significant effect on Poe. After her death, Poe was deeply saddened for several months. A friend said of him, &quot;the loss of his wife was a sad blow to him. He did not seem to care, after she was gone, whether he lived an hour, a day, a week or a year; she was his all.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Meyers, 207&lt;/ref&gt; A year after her death, he wrote to a friend that he had experienced the greatest evil a man can suffer when, he said, &quot;a wife, whom I loved as no man ever loved before&quot;, had fallen ill.&lt;ref name=Sova53/&gt; While Virginia was still struggling to recover, Poe turned to alcohol after abstaining for quite some time. How often and how much he drank is a controversial issue, debated in Poe's lifetime and also by modern biographers.&lt;ref name=Silverman183/&gt; Poe referred to his emotional response to his wife's sickness as his own illness, and that he found the cure to it &quot;in the ''death'' of my wife. This I can &amp; do endure as becomes a man&amp;mdash;it was the horrible never-ending oscillation between hope &amp; despair which I could ''not'' longer have endured without the total loss of reason&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Moss, 233&lt;/ref&gt;

Poe regularly visited Virginia's grave. As his friend Charles Chauncey Burr wrote, &quot;Many times, after the death of his beloved wife, was he found at the dead hour of a winter night, sitting beside her tomb almost frozen in the snow&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, 1206&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after Virginia's death, Poe courted several other women, including Nancy Richmond of [[Lowell, Massachusetts]], [[Sarah Helen Whitman]] of [[Providence, Rhode Island]], and childhood sweetheart [[Sarah Elmira Royster]] in Richmond. Even so, Frances Sargent Osgood, whom Poe also attempted to woo, believed &quot;that [Virginia] was the only woman whom he ever loved&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Krutch, 57&lt;/ref&gt;

===References in literature===
Many of [[Bibliography of Edgar Allan Poe|Poe's works]] are interpreted autobiographically, with much of his work believed to reflect Virginia's long struggle with tuberculosis and her eventual death. The most discussed example is &quot;[[Annabel Lee]]&quot;. This poem, which depicts a dead young bride and her mourning lover, is often assumed to have been inspired by Virginia, though other women in Poe's life are potential candidates including Frances Sargent Osgood&lt;ref&gt;Meyers, 244&lt;/ref&gt; and Sarah Helen Whitman.&lt;ref&gt;Sova, 12&lt;/ref&gt; A similar poem, &quot;[[Ulalume]]&quot;, is also believed to be a memorial tribute to Virginia,&lt;ref&gt;Meyers, 211&lt;/ref&gt; as is &quot;[[Lenore]]&quot;, whose title character is described as &quot;the most lovely dead that ever died so young!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Silverman, 202&lt;/ref&gt; After Poe's death, [[George Gilfillan]] of the London-based ''Critic'' said Poe was responsible for his wife's death, &quot;hurrying her to a premature grave, that he might write 'Annabel Lee' and '[[The Raven]]'&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Killis. &quot;The Poe-Griswold Controversy&quot;, ''The Mind of Poe and Other Studies''. New York: Russell &amp; Russell, Inc., 1962: 79.&lt;/ref&gt;  The aforementioned critic was either unconcerned with, or unaware of, the fact that ''The Raven'' was written and published two years before Virginia's death.

Virginia is also seen in Poe's prose. The [[short story]] &quot;[[Eleonora (short story)|Eleonora]]&quot; (1842)&amp;mdash;which features a narrator preparing to marry his cousin, with whom he lives alongside her mother&amp;mdash;may also refer to Virginia's illness. When Poe wrote it, his wife had just begun to show signs of her illness.&lt;ref&gt;Sova, 78&lt;/ref&gt; It was shortly thereafter that the couple moved to New York City by boat and Poe published &quot;[[The Oblong Box (short story)|The Oblong Box]]&quot; (1844). This story, which shows a man mourning his young wife while transporting her corpse by boat, seems to suggest Poe's feelings about Virginia's impending death. As the ship sinks, the husband would rather die than be separated from his wife's corpse.&lt;ref&gt;Silverman, 228–229&lt;/ref&gt; The short story &quot;[[Ligeia]]&quot;, whose title character suffers a slow and lingering death, may also be inspired by Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, 255–256&lt;/ref&gt; After his wife's death, Poe edited his first published story, &quot;[[Metzengerstein]]&quot;, to remove the narrator's line, &quot;I would wish all I love to perish of that gentle disease&quot;, a reference to tuberculosis.&lt;ref name=Meyers206/&gt;
