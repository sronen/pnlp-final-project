'''Ann Bannon''' ([[pseudonym]] of '''Ann Weldy''', born September 15, 1932) is an American author who, from 1957 to 1962, wrote six [[lesbian pulp fiction]] novels known as ''The Beebo Brinker Chronicles''. The books' enduring popularity and impact on lesbian identity has earned her the title &quot;Queen of Lesbian Pulp Fiction&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Costello, Becca|url=http://www.newsreview.com/sacramento/Content?oid=12449|title=Pulp friction|work=Sacramento News &amp; Review|date=2002-06-20|accessdate=2007-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bannon was a young housewife trying to address her own issues of sexuality when she was inspired to write her first novel. Her subsequent books featured four characters who reappeared throughout the series, including her eponymous heroine, Beebo Brinker, who came to embody the [[archetype]] of a [[Butch and femme|butch]] lesbian. The majority of her characters mirrored people she knew, but their stories reflected a life she did not feel she was able to live. Despite her traditional upbringing and role in married life, her novels defied conventions for romance stories and depictions of lesbians by addressing complex homosexual relationships. 

Her books shaped lesbian identity for lesbians and heterosexuals alike, but Bannon was mostly unaware of their impact. She stopped writing in 1962. Later, she earned a doctorate in [[linguistics]] and became an academic. She endured a difficult marriage for 27&amp;nbsp;years and, as she separated from her husband in the 1980s, her books were republished; she was stunned to learn of their influence on society. They were released again between 2001 and 2003 and were adapted as an award-winning [[Off-Broadway]] production. They are taught in [[Women's studies|Women's]] and [[LGBT studies]] courses, and Bannon has received numerous awards for pioneering lesbian and gay literature. She has been described as &quot;the premier fictional representation of US lesbian life in the fifties and sixties&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Nealon, Christopher (1995). &quot;Invert-History: The ambivalence of Lesbian Pulp Fiction.&quot; ''New Literary History'' '''31''' (4): pp. 745–64.&lt;/ref&gt; and it has been said that her books &quot;rest on the bookshelf of nearly every even faintly literate Lesbian&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Damon, Gene (1969). &quot;The lesbian paperback.&quot; ''The Ladder'' '''13''' (9/10): pp. 18–23.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Ann Bannon was born Ann Weldy in [[Joliet, Illinois]], in 1932. She grew up in nearby [[Hinsdale, Illinois|Hinsdale]] with her mother and stepfather, and had the responsibility of taking care of four siblings due to the family's financial problems. She took comfort in a vibrant imaginary life during this time and found solace in writing.&lt;ref name=&quot;elliott&quot;/&gt; Growing up, she was surrounded by music, particularly jazz, as her family hosted small recitals for friends and neighbors. One became a character in her books: a perennial bachelor named Jack who slung jokes and witticisms at the audiences.&lt;ref name=&quot;womantext&quot;/&gt;

At the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign]] she belonged to [[Kappa Kappa Gamma]] [[sorority]]&lt;ref name=&quot;cain&quot;/&gt; where she befriended a beautiful older sorority sister, &quot;the prettiest I had ever seen&quot;, quite popular with men and with women. Bannon witnessed a younger sorority sister's unabashed infatuation with the older sister. She recalls it was an awkward situation, even though the older sorority sister was &quot;unfailingly gracious&quot; to the younger one. In recognizing the younger woman's attractions, she began to suspect her own sexuality.&lt;ref name=&quot;forrestinterview&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Forrest |first=Katherine |year=2002 |url=http://www.lambdaliterary.org/lambda_book_report/ann_bannon.html |title=Ann Bannon |work=Lambda Book Report |accessdate=2007-12-02| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070927024140/http://www.lambdaliterary.org/lambda_book_report/ann_bannon.html| archivedate = September 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; She said, &quot;I saw a lot of it happening and I didn't know what to make of it. I don't even know how to put it—I was absolutely consumed with it, it was an extraordinary thing.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;maida&quot;/&gt; Another sorority sister was physically remarkable, very tall—almost {{convert|6|ft|m}}, with a husky voice and boyish nickname, that Bannon imagined was a blend of [[Johnny Weissmuller]] and [[Ingrid Bergman]]. She recalled entering the communal restroom and seeing the sister, &quot;both of us in underwear, and experienc(ing) a sort of electric shock&quot;, and trying not to stare at her.&lt;ref name=&quot;womantext&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;forrestinterview&quot;/&gt; In 1954, she graduated with a degree in French and soon married an engineer whose job made them relocate frequently.&lt;ref name=&quot;elliott&quot;&gt;Elliott, Mary (2005). &quot;Ann Bannon.&quot; ''Encyclopedia of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender History in America''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bannon was 22&amp;nbsp;years old when she began writing her first pulp novel. She was influenced by the only lesbian novels she had read, ''[[The Well of Loneliness]]'' by [[Radclyffe Hall]] from 1928 and [[Vin Packer]]'s ''[[Spring Fire]]'' from 1952, albeit in two different ways: she was unable to relate to the dismal tones in Hall's novel,&lt;ref name=&quot;lovisi&quot;&gt;Lovisi, Gary (2003). &quot;On writing Lesbian Pulp Fiction: An interview with Ann Bannon.&quot; ''Paperback Parade''.

In the beginning of her marriage she was left alone quite a lot and said, &quot;I was kind of desperate to get some of the things that had been consuming me for a long time down on paper.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;maida&quot;/&gt;

==Writing career==
===Background===
Paperback books in the United States expanded prominently after World War&amp;nbsp;II through the marketing strategies of [[Pocket Books]], who began to distribute publications through newspapers, newsstands, grocery stores, and bus and train stations. The retail opportunities of paperback books grew about tenfold with this method.&lt;ref&gt;Sky, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1950, rival company [[Gold Medal Books]] published ''[[Women's Barracks]]'', a fictionalized account of author [[Tereska Torres]]' experience serving in the [[Free French Forces]]. The book depicts a lesbian relationship the author witnessed, ending with one of the women committing suicide. It sold 4.5&amp;nbsp;million copies, and Gold Medal Books' editors were &quot;thrilled&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Server, Lee (2002). &quot;Tereska Torres.&quot; ''Encyclopedia of Pulp Fiction Writers: The Essential Guide to More than 200 Pulp Pioneers and Mass-Market Masters''.

Retrieved on December 2, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Gold Medal Books was a branch of [[Fawcett Publications]] that focused on paperback books which at the time were printed on very cheap paper, not designed to last for more than a year, sold for 25&amp;nbsp;cents in drug stores and other venues all over the United States and Canada. The books made for cheap, easy reading that could be discarded at the end of a trip at very little cost to the customer. Because of the low quality of production, they earned the name [[pulp fiction (genre)|pulp fiction]].

Gold Medal Books quickly followed ''Women's Barracks'' with ''Spring Fire'', eager to cash in on the unprecedented sales, and it sold almost {{Nowrap|1.5 million}} copies in 1952. Vin Packer, whose real name is [[Marijane Meaker]], and Gold Medal Books were overwhelmed with mail from women who identified with the lesbian characters.&lt;ref name=&quot;Keller&quot;&gt;Keller, Yvonne (2005). &quot;Was it right to love her brother's wife so passionately?

One of the letters was from Bannon, asking for professional assistance in getting published. On writing to Meaker, she said, &quot;To this day I have no idea why she responded to me out of the thousands of letters she was getting at that time. Thank God she did. I was both thrilled and terrified.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Nikola|last=Luksic|title=Authors look back at the heyday of lesbian pulp|url=http://www.xtra.ca/public/viewstory.aspx?AFF_TYPE=3&amp;STORY_ID=785&amp;PUB_TEMPLATE_ID=5|work= XTra!

It was a story about the women in her sorority whom she admired, with a [[subplot]] consisting of two sorority sisters who had fallen in love with each other. Carroll told her to take it back and focus on the two characters who had an affair. Bannon claims she went back and told their story, delivered the draft to Carroll and saw it published without a single word changed.&lt;ref name=&quot;oddgirltext&quot;&gt;Bannon, Ann (2001). {{cite web|url=http://www.annbannon.com/bp/oddgirltext.html|title=Introduction}}''Odd Girl Out''.

She said of the women she saw in Greenwich Village, &quot;I wanted to be one of them, to speak to other women, if only in print. And so I made a beginning—and that beginning was the story that became ''Odd Girl Out''.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;forrest2&quot;&gt;Forrest, Katherine (February 2002) &quot;Acts of individual valor.&quot; ''Lambda Book Report'' '''10''' (7) 6–10.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Beebo Brinker Chronicles''===
====''Odd Girl Out''====
{{Main|Odd Girl Out (novel)}}
[[Image:Odd Girl Out Cover 1957.jpg|thumb|alt=Original cover of ''Odd Girl Out'' brightly painted showing a dark haired woman face down on a bed, and a blonde woman massaging her shoulders|upright|Original [[Gold Medal Books]] cover of ''[[Odd Girl Out (novel)|Odd Girl Out]]'', published in 1957]]

''The Beebo Brinker Chronicle''s are six books in all, first published between 1957 and 1962. They featured four characters who appeared in at least three of the books in a chronological saga of coming to terms with their homosexuality and navigating their ways through gay and lesbian relationships. The first in the series, ''[[Odd Girl Out (novel)|Odd Girl Out]]'', was published in 1957, and became Gold Medal Books' second best-selling title of the year.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Top Sellers of 1957 Reported for Mass-Market and Trade Paperbacks&quot;, ''Publishers' Weekly'' (January 20, 1958), '''173''' (3), pp. 47–51.&lt;/ref&gt; Based on Bannon's own experiences, the plot involved a lesbian relationship between two sorority sisters in a fictional sorority at a fictional midwestern university. As was custom with pulp fiction novels, neither the cover art nor the title were under the control of the author. Both were approved by the publisher in order to be as suggestive and lurid as possible.&lt;ref name=&quot;oddgirltext&quot;/&gt; The main character is Laura Landon, who realizes that she's in love with Beth, her older, more experienced roommate, a leader in the sorority.

Lesbians depicted in literature were relatively rare in the 1950s. It was the publisher's policy in any novel involving lesbianism that the characters would never receive any satisfaction from the relationship. One or both usually ended up committing suicide, going insane, or leaving the relationship.&lt;ref name=&quot;meaker&quot;&gt;Packer, Vin. &quot;Introduction&quot; ''Spring Fire''. Cleis Press, 2004. ISBN 978-1-57344-187-2&lt;/ref&gt; Marijane Meaker discusses this in the 2004 foreword of ''Spring Fire'': she was told by editor Dick Carroll that because the books were distributed by the U.S. Post Office instead of private companies delivering directly to stores, [[United States Postal Inspection Service|postal inspectors]] would send the books back to the publisher if homosexuality was depicted positively.&lt;ref name=&quot;meaker&quot;/&gt; The Postal Service relaxed their [[censorship]] after several First Amendment obscenity trials, including [[Roth v. United States]] and another regarding [[Allen Ginsberg]]'s ''[[Howl]]'' in the mid-1950s,&lt;ref name=&quot;stonewall&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sky, pp. 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt; which gave Bannon a modicum of freedom in her plots.&lt;ref name=&quot;garland&quot;&gt;Garland, David. Interview with Ann Bannon. ''Spinning on Air.'' WNYC. November 26, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the ending to ''Odd Girl Out'' did not veer too far from the unsatisfactory resolution formula of ''Spring Fire'', ''Women's Barracks'', and [[Radclyffe Hall]]'s ''[[The Well of Loneliness]]'', it examined Laura's internal struggle in the realization that despite her femininity, she was deeply in love with another woman, and at the end she embraced it, which was rare in lesbian fiction.

The characters and their stories served as an extension of the fantasy life Bannon developed as a child. They became her &quot;fantasy friends&quot; whose loves and lives she witnessed and through which she lived her own life vicariously, helping her through a difficult marriage, and a longing for a life she did not feel she was free to live.&lt;ref name=&quot;brandt&quot;&gt;Brandt, Kate (2003). &quot;Ann Bannon: A 1950s icon rediscovered.&quot; ''Paperback Parade'' '''59''' 39–45.&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;I realized very early that I should not marry, but I was going to make the best of a bad thing, and I was going to make it a good thing,&quot; she remembered.&lt;ref name=&quot;lootens&quot;&gt;Lootens, Tricia (December 31, 1983). &quot;Ann Bannon: A writer of lost lesbian fiction finds herself and her public.&quot; ''Off Our Backs.'' '''13''' (11) p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Having no practical experience in a lesbian relationship while writing ''Odd Girl Out'', she set out to gain what she termed &quot;fieldwork experience&quot; in her trips to Greenwich Village,&lt;ref name=&quot;oddgirltext&quot;/&gt; and was successful enough to introduce those experiences into the next book in the series before relocating once more to Southern [[California]]. But she explained her fears about staying in Greenwich Village, saying &lt;blockquote&gt;I would sit there (in a gay bar) in the evenings thinking, 'What if (a police raid) happens tonight and I get hauled off to the [[jail|slam]] with all these other women?' I had been extremely low profile, very proper, very [[Victorian morality|Victorian]] wife. I know that sounds crazy in the 60s, but I was raised by my mother and grandmother, who really came out of that era, and talk about a rigid role-playing crowd! I couldn't imagine living through it. I just couldn't. I thought, 'Well, that would do it. I'd have to go jump off the [[Brooklyn Bridge]].' As easy as it might be if you were a young woman in today's generation to think that was exaggerating, it wasn't. It was terrifying.&lt;ref name=&quot;lootens&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====''I Am a Woman''====
{{Main|I Am a Woman}}
[[Image:I Am A Woman 1959.jpg|alt=Original cover of ''I Am a Woman'' featuring a photograph taken of a woman from above; the model's cleavage is prominent and Bannon's name is placed directly over it|thumb|upright|Original Gold Medal Books cover of ''[[I Am a Woman]]'' from 1959]]

Bannon followed ''Odd Girl Out'' with ''[[I Am a Woman]] (In Love With a Woman — Must Society Reject Me?)'' in 1959. ''I Am a Woman'' (the working and common title) featured Laura after her affair with Beth, as she finds herself in New York City's Greenwich Village, and meets a wisecracking gay man named Jack, and becomes his best friend. Laura has to choose between a straight woman with a wild and curious streak, and a fascinating new character that proved to be her most popular of the series,&lt;ref name=&quot;server&quot;/&gt; Beebo Brinker, who came to embody the description of a thoroughly [[Butch and femme|butch]] lesbian. Beebo was smart, handsome, chivalrous, and virile. Once again based on what Bannon knew, Beebo was nearly {{convert|6|ft|m}} tall with a husky voice and a formidable physique. The personality however, Bannon says, was drawn out of her sheer need for Beebo to exist. After spending time in Greenwich Village and not finding anyone like her, Bannon instead created her.&lt;ref name=&quot;womantext&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;forrestinterview&quot;/&gt; She remembered, &quot;I put Beebo together just as I wanted her, in my heart and mind&amp;nbsp;... She was just, quite literally, the butch of my dreams.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;parks&quot;/&gt; The resolution to ''I Am a Woman'' completely flouted the trends of miserable lesbian fiction endings, which made Ann Bannon a hero to many lesbians.&lt;ref name=&quot;strang&quot;&gt;Strang, Lennox (1959). &quot;I Am a Woman&quot; (book review); ''The Ladder'', '''3''' (5) pp. 16–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Letters began to pour in for her from all over the country. There were mostly propositions from men, but the letters from women thanked her profusely and begged her for reassurance that they would be all right. Bannon described the impact her books had from the letters she received from people who were isolated in small towns: &quot;The most important things they learned (from the books) were that 1) they weren't unique and doomed to lifelong isolation, 2)&amp;nbsp;... they weren't 'abnormal,' and 3) there was hope for a happy life. They wrote to me in thousands, asking me to confirm these wonderful things, which I gladly did—even though I felt only marginally better informed than they were.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Dean, William (January 8, 2003). {{cite web|url=http://www.cleansheets.com/articles/dean_01.08.03.shtml|title=Out of the shadows: An interview with Ann Bannon.}} cleansheets.com.

ISBN 0-415-92926-1&lt;/ref&gt; Bannon received international and domestic mail from women, saying, &quot;This is the only book (and they would say this about all of them) that I've read where the women really love each other, where its OK for them to love each other, and they don't have to kill themselves afterwards.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;maida&quot;&gt;Tilchen, Maida (January 8, 1983). &quot;Ann Bannon: The mystery solved!&quot; ''Gay Community News''.

====''Women in the Shadows''====
{{Main|Women in the Shadows}}
Although her husband was aware of the books she was writing, he showed no interest in the subject. He was interested enough in the money she made from them, however, but had forbidden her to use her married surname, not wishing to see it on a book cover with art of questionable taste.&lt;ref name=&quot;server&quot;&gt;Server, Lee (2002). &quot;Ann Bannon.&quot; ''Encyclopedia of pulp fiction writers: The essential guide to more than 200 pulp pioneers and mass-market masters''.

The book examined [[interracial relationships]], [[self-loathing]] in matters of sexuality and race, [[alcoholism]], jealousy, violence, and as Laura marries Jack in an atypical arrangement in the 1950s, also explored the intricate details of what it was like to [[Passing (sexual orientation)|pass]] as [[heterosexual]] in an attempt to live some semblance of what was considered a normal life at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;hamer&quot;/&gt;

====''Journey to a Woman''====
{{Main|Journey to a Woman}}
Her fourth book in the series, ''[[Journey To A Woman]],'' published in 1960, again shows parallels between Bannon's own life and her plots. Beth, of Laura's affair in ''Odd Girl Out'', is living with her husband and children in Southern California. She tries to find Laura again nine years after college, and escapes a deranged woman who has a fixation on her, a reflection of a relationship Bannon had with a beautiful, but &quot;very bewildered and unstable person.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;maida&quot;/&gt; Beth writes to an author of lesbian books in New York, and goes to meet her in hope of finding Laura. They have a brief relationship, after which Beth finds Laura married to Jack and with a child, then discovers Beebo as well. A fifth book, ''The Marriage'', also published in 1960, again addresses issues of love outside the realm of socially acceptable relationships, although it is not primarily about homosexuality. In it, Jack and Laura are friends with a young married couple who discover they are brother and sister, and must decide whether they will stay together or conform to societal standards.

====''Beebo Brinker''====
{{Main|Beebo Brinker (novel)}}
Returning to the character she fantasized about the most, the last book in the series, ''[[Beebo Brinker (novel)|Beebo Brinker]]'', published in 1962, was Bannon's [[prequel]] to ''Odd Girl Out''. It follows Beebo around [[Greenwich Village]] ten years before she meets Laura in ''I Am a Woman.'' Beebo gets off the bus from her rural hometown into New York City to find a waiting friend in Jack, and to discover herself. She begins an affair with a famous and fading movie star, and follows her to California, only to return to be more honest about what she wants in her life.

In 1961 and 1962 Bannon also contributed several articles to ''[[ONE, Inc.]]'', the magazine of a [[homophile]] activist organization in Southern California. One of them was a chapter that had been cut from the final draft of ''Women in the Shadows''.&lt;ref&gt;Bannon, Ann (July 1961). &quot;Secrets of the Gay Novel.&quot; ONE, '''9'''(7) 6–12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bannon, Ann (January 1961). &quot;The Nice Kid.&quot; ONE, '''9''' (1) p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bannon, Ann (April 1962). &quot;Scene From: The Story of Beebo Brinker: Beebo and Paula.&quot; ONE, '''10''' (4) p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; She was invited to speak to the [[Mattachine Society]] in the early 1960s, but her husband's stern disapproval of her activities began to take its toll. She stated later, &quot;It began to be very painful. So every time I would start to reach out (to the lesbian/gay community), I would get struck down&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;In my own life, I couldn't operationalize (my feeling that gays should end the secrecy and take more pride in themselves and their lives). I couldn't find a way.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;cain&quot;&gt;Cain, Paul (2007). &quot;Ann Bannon.&quot; ''Leading the parade: Conversations with America's most influential lesbians and gay men''.

==Rediscovery==
After ''Beebo Brinker'', Bannon said the energy to write about the characters left her, but she got so good at her &quot;obsessive fantasies&quot; that even after the books were written she continued to live internally, and suspected it affected her subsequent relationships. &quot;I realize now that I was in a sort of 'holding pattern,' a way of keeping my sanity intact while waiting for my children to grow up and the freedom door to open&quot;, she recalled.&lt;ref name=&quot;parks&quot;&gt;Parks, Joy (Summer, 2003). &quot;Sleaze Trash and Miracles: How Ann Bannon changed lesbian fiction by writing about the butch of her dreams.&quot; ''Velvet Park''; 42–43.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;forbidden&quot;&gt;''Forbidden Love: Unashamed Stories of Lesbian Lives''.

She was an English [[professor]] at Sacramento State and later became associate dean of the School of Arts and Sciences—later the College of Arts and Letters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Kel|last=Munger |title=Paperback writer |url=http://www.newsreview.com/sacramento/Content?oid=oid%3A34731 |publisher=Chico Community Publishing, Inc|date=April 7, 2005|accessdate=2007-12-02 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ann Bannon's books began to fade away from publishing memory after initial publication, especially after Gold Medal Books went out of business. In 1975, however, Bannon was asked to include four of her books in Arno Press's library edition of ''Homosexuality: Lesbians and Gay Men in Society, History and Literature''. Then, in 1983, [[Barbara Grier]] of the lesbian publishing company [[Naiad Press]] actively tracked Bannon down and reissued the books in new covers. Grier discussed the novels, answering the question of who among lesbian paperback authors should be highlighted: &quot;Ann Bannon. Without even a discussion&amp;nbsp;... In terms of actual influence, sales, everything, Bannon.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;cain&quot;/&gt;

Bannon did not outwardly advertise the fact that the books had been released again in her department at Sacramento State. Not being tenured, she was unsure how the information would be received. However, word got out: &quot;I was jet-propelled out of the closet. People stared at me around campus, and the [[Physical education|PE]] majors all waved.

At the time I denied it fiercely, but I really think I beat myself up horribly, in ways I'll never know.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;cain&quot;/&gt;

In 1984, Bannon's books were featured in the documentary ''[[Before Stonewall]]'' about how gay men and lesbians lived prior to the 1969 [[Stonewall riots]], wherein one woman remembered picking up one of Bannon's books for the first time: &quot;I picked up this paperback and I opened it up&amp;nbsp;... and it sent a shiver of excitement in my whole body that I had never felt before.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;stonewall&quot;&gt;

The books were selected for the [[Quality Paperback Book Club]] in 1995. Bannon also provided the foreword for ''Strange Sisters: The Art of Lesbian Pulp Fiction 1949–1969'' in 1999, discussing her reaction to the artwork on her own books and the other lesbian pulp fiction books she bought and read. Five of ''The Beebo Brinker Chronicles'' were reissued by [[Cleis Press]] again between 2001 and 2003—excluding ''The Marriage''—with [[autobiography|autobiographical]] forewords that described Bannon's experiences of writing the books and her reaction to their popularity, causing another wave of interest.

Reacting to the renewed interest in the books, Bannon wrote in the 2002 introduction to ''Odd Girl Out'' that she was shocked to find out that her characters were not only remembered but that they were [[archetypes]] among the lesbian community.&lt;ref&gt;Bannon, Ann (2002).

Retrieved on July 15, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The books are frequently on required reading lists for Women's and [[LGBT studies]] college courses. Bannon often admits to being surprised by this, explaining that she had no such aspirations when she was writing ''Odd Girl Out'': &quot;If I ''had'' known, it might well have resulted in a much more polished product, but one that would have been so cautious and self-conscious as to be entirely forgettable. It would never—my best guess—have had the vibrant life it has now.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;erotica&quot;/&gt;

==Themes==
===Identity===
Since so little information was available about lesbians and lesbianism at the time, Bannon's books, through their far-reaching distribution and popularity served to form a part of a lesbian [[identity (social science)|identity]] not only for the heterosexual population at large, but lesbians themselves. Lesbian author and historian [[Joan Nestle]] called the books &quot;survival literature&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;

Scholar Andrea Loewenstein published the first in-depth review of Bannon's books in 1980, and notes that they were &quot;exceptionally good pulp&quot; that caused unexpected strong feelings of sadness or anger among lesbians when they were read twenty years after being published. Bannon depicts strict roles of butch and femme, and gays and lesbians as self-destructive, closeted, paranoid, and alcoholic. Loewenstein remarks that readers in 1980 had a tendency to reject that kind of reality in Bannon's stories. &quot;Since much of our past is so bitter, [we]&amp;nbsp;... pretend away our most recent history&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;loewenstein&quot;&gt;Loewenstein, Andrea (May 24, 1980). &quot;Sad Stories: A Reflection on the Fiction of Ann Bannon,&quot; ''Gay Community News'' '''7''' (43) pp. 8–12.&lt;/ref&gt; Loewenstein suggests the struggles Bannon's characters endured were ones that Bannon must have faced herself. When Laura declares her joy in her love for Beth in ''Odd Girl Out'' while simultaneously questioning if it is right, Loewenstein states &quot;one hears quite clearly the voice of Ann Bannon, questioning her own right to happiness&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;loewenstein&quot;/&gt; Similarly, remarking on Bannon's treatment of Beebo in ''Women in the Shadows'' by making her violent, alcoholic and self-destructive, Loewenstein notes, &quot;she needs to humiliate Beebo so badly that she makes her disappear&quot;. Loewenstein remarks Bannon's characters are deeply conflicted by enjoying relationships they feel are morally wrong, and they are acting out cycles of self-hatred, though what remains at the end is &quot;surprisingly&amp;nbsp;... passionate, tender, and erotic&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;loewenstein&quot;/&gt;

Writer Diane Hamer attests that Bannon's books and characters represent a part of identity where women are unsure if they are gay or straight, man or woman, ashamed or accepting of who they are. In receiving no clear answers from Bannon herself, women were left to try to figure these questions out for themselves. Hamer writes, &quot;What Bannon did was to provide a ''range'' of possible trajectories to lesbianism&amp;nbsp;... Bannon, by constructing fictional biographies for her lesbian characters, produced a new knowledge about how one arrives at a lesbian identity.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;hamer&quot;&gt;Hamer, Diane (1990). &quot;I Am a Woman: Ann Bannon and the Writing of Lesbian Identity in the 1950s.&quot; ''Lesbian and Gay Writing'', Mark Lilly, ed. Temple University Press. ISBN 0-87722-706-3&lt;/ref&gt;

Bannon also addresses the issue of race in ''Women in the Shadows'' when Laura begins an affair with a woman representing herself as Eastern Indian, but who is actually a lighter skinned African American. The duality of their relationship is expressed not only in skin color but through their personalities. Laura, blond and passionate, contrasts with Tris, who is dark but emotionally detached. Race, in this instance, is a &quot;metaphor for the opposition between inside and outside that govern Bannon's sense of what a lesbian is&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Nealon, p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of a lesbian identity is also explored throughout ''Journey to a Woman'', as Beth leaves her husband and children to find Laura. Beth is followed by Vega, a woman scarred deeply—both emotionally and physically—with whom Beth had an affair. Vega shoots herself at the end of the story. Scholar Christopher Nealon suggests that Vega's scars and emotional pain represent the anguish of self-hatred and the self-destructive phases Bannon imposed upon her characters in ''Women in the Shadows''.&lt;ref name=&quot;nealon168&quot;/&gt; Because Laura has grown from the complete adoration of Beth in ''Odd Girl Out'' and is unable to give Beth the same devotion when Beth finds her again, Nealon writes that Bannon makes the point that it is impossible to sustain &quot;a lesbian identity that always returns to the moment of self-discovery&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;nealon168&quot;&gt;Nealon, p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt; Beth, instead, finds Beebo, now older and much calmer, who gives her hope and the promise of love, which Nealon equates to a final identity for Bannon's characters.&lt;ref&gt;Nealon, p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the new forewords to the Cleis Press editions, Bannon addressed the criticisms of her characters as self-destructive in limiting roles, explaining that she simply depicted what she knew and felt at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;womantext&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Bannon, Ann|year=2002|url=http://www.annbannon.com/bp/imawomantext.html|title= Introduction: The Beebo Brinker Chronicles: I Am A Woman|publisher=annbannon.com|accessdate=2007-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;shadowstext&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Bannon, Ann|year=2003|url=http://www.annbannon.com/bp/womenshadowstext.html|title=Introduction to Cleis Press Edition: The Beebo Brinker Chronicles: Women In The Shadows|publisher=annbannon.com|accessdate=2007-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Bannon, Ann|year=2003|url=http://www.annbannon.com/bp/journeytext.html|title= Introduction: The Beebo Brinker Chronicles: Journey to a Woman|publisher=annbannon.com|accessdate=2007-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bannon has said she knows the concerns of the women who are uncomfortable with the themes of her books: &quot;I can understand that; they weren't there. To them some of it looks negative and some of it looks depressing. Although I didn't feel that way. I always felt excited when I was writing them.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;maida&quot;/&gt;

===Gender===
All five books of ''The Beebo Brinker Chronicles'' depict characters trying to come to terms with their ostracism from heterosexual society. Christopher Nealon adds that the characters are also trying to &quot;understand the relationship between their bodies and their desires&quot;; the continuing appeal of the novels, Nealon states, is due to the characters being &quot;beautifully misembodied&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Nealon, p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Odd Girl Out'', Laura Landon's resistance to the idea that she may be homosexual lies in her own concept of femininity rather than any repugnance for loving women. In ''I Am a Woman'', the second book in the series, Beebo's butch appearance &quot;seems to alternately terrify and attract Laura&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;loewenstein&quot;/&gt; leading to a very erotic physical relationship. However, when Laura lashes out at Beebo in a moment of self-pity, it is her masculinity that Laura attacks, invalidating Beebo's uniqueness and the core of her desirability violently.&lt;ref&gt;Nealon, p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt; In the book that exhibits the most self-destruction in the series, ''Women in the Shadows'', Laura expresses shame when accompanying Beebo outside of Greenwich Village, fearing Beebo will be arrested and jailed.&lt;ref&gt;Bannon, ''Women in the Shadows'', pp. 28–29.&lt;/ref&gt; Facing the end of their relationship, Beebo expresses the desire to be a man, if only to be able to marry Laura to give her a normal life.

Bannon's last book, ''Beebo Brinker'', which takes place before the others when Beebo is eighteen years old, focuses on her realization not only that she is gay, but that she is also a masculine woman. Nealon writes that Bannon's exploration of Beebo's masculinity is not to give excuses for her desires, but &quot;to get at the source of specialness, the sources of her claim to be treated with dignity&quot;. By connecting her characters' bodies with their desires, Bannon allows further understanding of self as normal, and that homosexuality is acceptable.&lt;ref&gt;Nealon, p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style==
Bannon's books, like most pulp fiction novels, were not reviewed by newspapers or magazines when they were originally published between 1957 and 1962. However, since their release they have been the subject of analyses that offer differing opinions of Bannon's books as a reflection of the moral standards of the decade, a subtle defiance of those morals, or a combination of both. Andrea Loewenstein notes Bannon's use of cliché, suggesting that it reflected Bannon's own belief in the culturally repressive ideas of the 1950s.&lt;ref name=&quot;loewenstein&quot;/&gt; Conversely, writer Jeff Weinstein remarks that Bannon's &quot;potboilers&quot; are an expression of freedom because they address issues mainstream fiction did not in the 1950s. Instead of cliché, Weinstein writes that her characters become more realistic as she exploits the dramatic plots, because they &quot;are influenced by the melodramatic conventions of the culture that excludes them&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;weinstein&quot;/&gt;

Diane Hamer likens Bannon's work to the [[Mills and Boon]] of lesbian literature, but unlike conventional romance novels, her stories never really have neat and tidy conclusions.&lt;ref name=&quot;hamer&quot;/&gt; Hamer also takes note of Bannon's use of Freudian symbolism: in ''I Am a Woman'', Jack frequently mentions that he is being [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalyzed]], and his friends react with interest. Jack labels Laura &quot;Mother&quot; and continues to refer to this nickname instead of her real name throughout the series, as though Bannon—through Jack—is vaguely mocking Freud and the ideas that have framed the construction of sexuality in the 1950s.&lt;ref name=&quot;hamer&quot;/&gt; Scholar Michele Barale remarks that Bannon's literary devices in ''Beebo Brinker'' defy the expectations of the audience for whom the novel was specifically marketed: heterosexual males. Bannon chooses the first character, an &quot;everyman&quot; named—significantly—Jack Mann, with whom the male audience identifies, only to divulge that he is gay and has maternal instincts.&lt;ref name=&quot;barale&quot;/&gt; His interest turns to Beebo, whom he finds &quot;handsome&quot; and lost, and he takes her home, gets her drunk, and becomes asexually intimate with her. Barale writes that Bannon manipulates male readers to become interested in the story, then turns them into voyeurs and imposes homosexual desires upon them, though eventually places them in a safe position to understand a gay story from a heterosexual point of view.&lt;ref name=&quot;barale&quot;/&gt;

The erotic nature of the books has been noted as adding to their uniqueness. Loewenstein remarks on the intensity of Laura's passion: &quot;The presentation of a woman as a joyfully aggressive person is, in itself, a rare achievement in 1957&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;loewenstein&quot;/&gt; A 2002 retrospective of Bannon's books claims &quot;there were more explicit and nuanced representations of sexuality in those paperbacks than could be found almost anywhere else&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;nakao&quot;/&gt; Author Suzana Danuta Walters represents the eroticism in Bannon's books as a form of rebellion.&lt;ref name=&quot;walters&quot;/&gt; In the ''Harvard Gay &amp; Lesbian Review'', [[Jenifer Levin]] writes, &quot;Know this: ''Beebo lives''. From the midst of a repressive era, from the pen of a very proper, scholarly, ''seemingly'' conforming wife and mother, came this astonishingly open queer figment of fictional being, like molten material from some volcano of the lesbian soul.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Levin, Jenifer (Spring 1995). &quot;Beebo Lives.&quot; ''Harvard Gay &amp; Lesbian Review'' '''2'''(1) p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bannon's books have, with the benefit of time, been described in vastly different terms, from &quot;literary works&quot; among pulp contemporaries,&lt;ref name=&quot;barale&quot;&gt;Barale, Michele (Autumn, 1992). &quot;When Jack Blinks: Si (gh) ting Gay Desire in Ann Bannon's 'Beebo Brinker{{'&quot;}} ''Feminist Studies'' '''18''' (3) pp. 533–549&lt;/ref&gt; to &quot;libidinised trash.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Weir, Angela, Wilson, E. (1992) &quot;The Greyhound Bus Station in the Evolution of Lesbian Popular Culture.&quot; In ''New Lesbian Criticism''. Columbia University Press. ISBN 0-231-08018-2&lt;/ref&gt; However disparate Bannon's books are described in feminist and lesbian literary retrospectives, almost every mention accedes the significance of ''The Beebo Brinker Chronicles''. One retrospective writer called Bannon's books &quot;titillating trash, but indispensable reading to the nation's lesbians.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;rutledge&quot;&gt;Rutledge, Leigh (2002). ''The Gay Decades''. Alyson Publications. ISBN 0-452-26810-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Critics have since remarked that Bannon's books are remarkable for portraying homosexual relationships relatively accurately.&lt;ref name=&quot;weinstein&quot;&gt;Weinstein, Jeff (October 1983). &quot;In Praise of Pulp: Bannon's Lusty Lesbians,&quot; ''Voice Literary Supplement'', 8–9.&lt;/ref&gt; The continuity of characters in the series also gave her books a unique quality, especially when most lesbian characters during this time were one-dimensional [[stereotypes]] who met punishment for their desires. Bannon's characters have been called &quot;accessibly human&quot;, and still engrossing by contemporary standards compared to being &quot;revolutionary&quot; when first released.&lt;ref name=&quot;blankenship&quot;&gt;{{cite news|first=Mark|last=Blankenship|title=Sapphic Pulp Fiction, life onstage in the New York Times|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/30/theater/30blank.html?em&amp;ex=1191211200&amp;en=e4db202d3cb8940f&amp;ei=5087%0A|work=[[New York Times]]|publisher=New York Times|date=September 30, 2007|accessdate=2007-12-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; LGBT historian Susan Stryker describes the relationships between Bannon's characters as mostly positive, satisfactory, and at times complex depictions of lesbian and gay relationships,&lt;ref&gt;Stryker, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; which Bannon attributed to not letting go of the hope that she could &quot;salvage (her) own life.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;parks&quot;/&gt; One retrospective of lesbian pulp fiction remarked on the reasons why Bannon's books in particular were popular is because they were so different from anything else being published at the time: &quot;Bannon was implicitly challenging the prevailing belief that homosexual life was brief, episodic, and more often than not resulted in death&amp;nbsp;... Bannon insisted on the continuity of lesbian love, while everything in her culture was speaking of its quick and ugly demise.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;walters&quot;&gt;Walters, Suzanne (Fall-Winter 1989). &quot;Her Hand Crept Slowly Up Her Thigh.&quot; ''Social Text'', '''23''' 83–101.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bannon set her stories in and among gay bars in the 1950s and 1960s that were secret. As described in ''Beebo Brinker'', one had to knock on the door and be recognized before being let in. In reality, women were not allowed to wear pants in some bars in New York City. Police raided bars and arrested everyone within regularly;&lt;ref&gt;Lyon, Phyllis (1956). &quot;San Francisco Police raid reveals lack of knowledge of citizens rights&quot; ''The Ladder''.

Because of the atmosphere of secrecy and shame, little was recorded at the time about what it was like to be gay then, and Bannon unwittingly recorded history from her own visits to Greenwich Village. In 2007, one of the writers who adapted three of the books into a play said of Bannon's work, &quot;I think she rises above the pulp. She wasn't trying to write trash. There wasn't any place for a woman to be writing this kind of material&amp;nbsp;... But I just think the writing's transcended its time and its era and its market.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Kia|last=Corthron|title=Lesbian Pulp Fiction: The Beebo Brinker Chronicles|url=http://www.brooklynrail.org/2007/9/theater/lesbian-pulp|work=The Brooklyn Rail|publisher=The Brooklyn Rail|date=September 2007|accessdate=2007-12-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

They—and we—may still not be regarded as conventionally acceptable 'nice' literature, as it were—but I have come to value that historical judgment. We wrote the stories no one else could tell.
