'''Talbot Baines Reed''' (3 April 1852&amp;nbsp;– 28 November 1893) was an English writer of [[Young-adult fiction|boys' fiction]] who established a genre of [[school story|school stories]] that endured into the second half of the 20th century. Among his best-known work is ''[[The Fifth Form at St. Dominic's]]''. He was a regular and prolific contributor to ''[[The Boy's Own Paper]]'' (''B.O.P.''), in which most of his fiction first appeared. Through his family's  business, Reed became a prominent [[type foundry|typefounder]], and wrote a classic ''History of the Old English Letter Foundries''.

Reed's father, [[Charles Reed (British politician)|Charles Reed]], was a successful London printer who later became a [[Member of Parliament]] (MP). Talbot attended the [[City of London School]] before leaving at 17 to join the family business at the Fann Street type foundry. His literary career began in 1879, when  the ''B.O.P.''  was launched. The  family were staunchly Christian, pillars of the  [[Congregational Church]], and were heavily involved in charitable works. However, Reed did not use his  writing as a vehicle for moralising, and was dismissive of those early school story writers, such as [[Frederick William Farrar|Dean Farrar]], who did. Reed's affinity with boys, his instinctive understanding of their  standpoint in life and his gift for creating believable characters, ensured that his popularity survived through several generations. He was widely imitated by other writers in the school story genre.

In 1881, following the death of his father, Reed became head of the Fann Street foundry. By then he had begun his monumental ''Letter Foundries'' history which,  published in 1887,  was hailed as the standard work on the subject. Along with his ''B.O.P.'' obligations  Reed wrote regular articles and book reviews for his cousin Edward Baines's newspaper, the ''[[Leeds Mercury]]''. He was busy elsewhere, as a co-founder and first honorary secretary of the [[Bibliographical Society]],  as a deacon in his local church, and as a trustee for his family's charities. All this activity may have undermined his health; after struggling with illness for most of 1893, Reed died in November that year, at the age of 41. Tributes honoured him both for his contribution to children's fiction and for his work as the definitive historian of English typefounding.

==Family background==
[[File:CharlesReed.jpg|thumb|upright|Charles Reed MP, father of Talbot Baines Reed]]
The Reeds were descended from John Reed, a colonel in [[Oliver Cromwell]]'s army during the [[English Civil War]]. The family was based in [[Maiden Newton]] in the county of [[Dorset]]  before moving to London at the end of the 18th century. Talbot Reed's grandfather, [[Andrew Reed (clergyman)|Andrew Reed]] (1787–1862), was a minister of the [[Congregational Church]] and  the founder of several charitable institutions, including the London Orphan Asylum  and a hospital for the incurably sick. He was also a hymn-writer of repute; his &quot;Spirit Divine, attend our prayers&quot;  is still found in several 20th and 21st century hymnals.&lt;ref name= Morison3&gt;Morison, pp. 1–3&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|This hymn is No. 239 in the revised (1950) version of [[Hymns Ancient and Modern]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Knight|first= G.H. and Bower, J. Dykes (eds)|title= Hymns Ancient and Modern, Revised|publisher= William Clowes and Sons Ltd|location= London|year= 1950}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}}

Andrew Reed had five sons, the third of whom, [[Charles Reed (British politician)|Charles Reed]] (1819–81), was apprenticed in 1836 to a wool manufacturer in Leeds, Yorkshire, where he also became secretary of the local [[Sunday School]] union. Through this work he met  [[Edward Baines (1774–1848)|Edward Baines]], proprietor of the ''[[Leeds Mercury]]'' one of the town's  [[Leeds (UK Parliament constituency)|two MPs]]. The Baines family had a strong tradition of public and political service; both of Edward Baines's sons followed him into Parliament, the elder, [[Matthew Talbot Baines]], eventually reaching [[Cabinet (government)|Cabinet]] rank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title= Baines, Edward 1774–1848|encyclopedia= Encyclopedia Britannica Fourteenth edition|volume= 2|page= 941|publisher= The Encyclopedia Britannica Co. Ltd|location= London|year= 1930}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charles Reed was attracted to the youngest Baines offspring, a daughter, Margaret, whom he married in 1844. By this time Charles  had left the wool industry and returned to London, where he founded his first business, a printing firm.&lt;ref name= Morison3/&gt;

The family settled in the London district of [[London Borough of Hackney|Hackney]] where Charles was active in public and religious affairs, with a particular interest in education. He became a member, and later chairman, of the [[London School Board]], and helped to establish the Congregational Church Board of Education. From 1868 to 1881 he was one of [[Hackney (UK Parliament constituency)|Hackney's MPs]].  He also raised a family of five sons, the third of whom, named Talbot Baines after his distinguished uncle, was born at  the family home, &quot;Earlsmead&quot;,  on 3 April 1852. Over the years, Charles expanded his business interests, and by 1861  had prospered sufficiently  to acquire the Thorowgood [[type foundry]] in Fann Street, [[City of London]].&lt;ref name= Morison3/&gt;

==Early life==
[[File:City of London School J.Woods after Hablot Browne &amp; Garland publ 1837 edited.jpg|thumb|upright|The City of London School in Milk Street, Cheapside]]
Talbot Baines Reed grew up in a happy household, dominated by Charles Reed's religious zeal and his belief that hardy outdoor sports were the best means for bringing up boys.&lt;ref name= Morison3/&gt; This atmosphere of &quot;simple, cheerful Puritanism&quot; was, according to a friend, &quot;eminently suited to [Talbot's]  character and disposition&quot;.&lt;ref name= DNB&gt;{{cite web|last= Richards|first= Jeffrey|title= Talbot Baines Reed (1852–93)|url= http://www.oxforddnb.com/|publisher= Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|year= 2004|accessdate= 29 September 2010}}{{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; Talbot began his education at Priory House School, Clapton,&lt;ref&gt;Sime, p. x&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1864  became a [[day pupil]] at the [[City of London School]], a relatively new foundation  that had been established in Milk Street, [[Cheapside]], in 1837.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Knight|first= Lionel|title= The history of the School|publisher= City of London School|url= http://www.clsb.org.uk/history/|year= 2010|accessdate= 28 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Talbot's eldest brother, Charles junior, had been notably successful there, as captain of the school and a leading figure in its cricket and football teams. Talbot soon made his own mark, particularly on the sporting field; a contemporary describes him as &quot;full of life and vigour&amp;nbsp;... his strength of muscle, length of limb, boldness of attack, absolute fearlessness and perfection of nerve always made him conspicuous&quot;. Reed later showed some reticence about his academic achievements, asserting that one of his few successes was winning &quot;the comfortable corner desk near the fire&quot;, reserved for the bottom place in Mathematics. In fact, in keeping with the school's record of producing men of letters and language scholars, Reed had excellent results in French, Greek and Latin, and had competed for the [[Sixth Form]] Latin prize. One of his school contemporaries was [[Herbert Henry Asquith]], the future British prime minister. Reed and Asquith were participants in a sixth form debate on the motion that &quot;the execution of Mary Queen of Scots was unjustifiable&quot;.&lt;ref name= Morison4&gt;Morison, pp. 4–7&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite evidence of considerable academic ability, Reed did not follow his brother Charles, who went on from the school to [[Trinity College, Cambridge]]. Instead, in 1869,  Reed left the school to join the family firm at the Fann Street foundry, beginning the association with the printing trade that would continue for the rest of his  life.  He found time, however, to pursue many other interests, physical, artistic and intellectual. Twice he walked the {{convert|53|mi|km|sigfig= 2}} from London to Cambridge, each time leaving on Friday afternoon and arriving at [[St John's College, Cambridge|St John's College]] for breakfast on Saturday. Reed was a competent swimmer, and won a [[Royal Humane Society]] medal for saving a cousin from drowning in rough seas.&lt;ref name= Morison4/&gt;  He was an accomplished  pianist, a skilful pen-and-ink illustrator, and had an engaging style of writing. These artistic talents were put to service in the production of a family magazine, ''The Earlsfield Chronicle'', which Reed edited (and largely wrote) from the mid-1870s. The magazine circulated only among the extended Reed family, and included serious articles (&quot;Is total abstinence a moral duty?&quot;) alongside comic verses and cartoons.&lt;ref name= Morison4/&gt;&lt;ref name= Cox28&gt;Cox, pp. 28–29&lt;/ref&gt;

==Printer and typefounder==
[[File:CaxtonExhibition1877.jpg|thumb|The Caxton Exhibition, South Kensington, July 1877. In this illustration, W.E. Gladstone stands centre picture; on the right are William Blades (bearded) and, far right, Charles Reed]]
Although Reed would later jokingly describe his work for the family firm as &quot;drudgery&quot;,&lt;ref name= Q78&gt;Quigly, p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; in reality he was enthusiastic about the trade and worked hard to master it. Early in his career he met the leading printer and bibliographer of the day, [[William Blades]],  from whom he acquired a lasting fascination with the printing and typefounding crafts.&lt;ref&gt;Morison, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; While still relatively inexperienced, Reed was asked by Blades to help  organise a major exhibition to mark the 400th anniversary of [[William Caxton]]'s  printing of ''[[The Game and Playe of the Chesse]]''. This was thought to be the first book printed in England, and the exhibition was originally planned for 1874. However,  Blades's research proved that Caxton's first printing in England had in fact been in 1477, of a different book, so the quatercentenary celebrations were rescheduled accordingly.&lt;ref&gt;Morison, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;  The exhibition was held during the summer of 1877, at [[South Kensington]], and was opened by [[William Ewart Gladstone|William Gladstone]], the former and future prime minister.&lt;ref&gt;Morison, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; It included displays of Caxton's printed works, together with many examples of printing through the intervening years.  Reed's main contribution was to the exhibition's catalogue, for which he wrote an essay entitled &quot;The Rise and Progress of Typography and Type-Founding in England&quot;. The exhibition was supported by leading London printers, publishers, booksellers, antiquarians and scholars,  and attracted wide public interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= The Caxton Exhibition of 1877: Printing to inscription|publisher= The University of Edinburgh|url=  http://www.hss.ed.ac.uk/chb/materialcultures2010/pdf/smith_c.pdf|year= 2010|accessdate= 30 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Editorial|title= The Caxton Exhibition|url= http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v16/n401/abs/016177a0.html|journal= Nature|volume= 16|date= 5 July 1877|accessdate= 30 September 2010|issue=401|doi=10.1038/016177a0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sir Charles Reed, who had been knighted on Gladstone's recommendation in 1874, died in 1881. A few months later, Talbot's elder brother Andrew retired from the business because of ill health. As a result, at the age of 29, Talbot became the sole managing director of the Fann Street business, a position he held until his death.&lt;ref name= Morison37&gt;Morison, pp. 37–44&lt;/ref&gt; This was, however, by no means Reed's sole activity in connection with the trade. In 1878, in response to a suggestion from Blades, he had begun work on a general history of typefounding in England, a task which occupied him intermittently for ten years. Published  by Elliot Stock in 1887 under the title of ''History of the Old English Letter Foundries'', the book became the standard text on the subject.&lt;ref name= DNB/&gt; Its 21 chapters are illustrated throughout with examples of typefaces and symbols used for four centuries. The text is presented in modern style, but with the initial letter of each chapter ornately drawn from a 1544 pattern.&lt;ref&gt;Morison, pp. 48–50&lt;/ref&gt; {{#tag:ref|A new edition was brought out in 1952 to mark the centenary of Reed's birth.&lt;ref&gt;Quigly, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} Also in 1887 Reed produced a revised and enlarged specimen book for the Fann Street foundry, with many new typeface designs and artistic ornamentations.&lt;ref name= Morison37/&gt;  As an acknowledged expert in his field, Reed was in demand as a lecturer to  learned societies. Among the papers he  delivered  were &quot;Old and New Fashions in Typography&quot;, to the [[Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts, Manufactures &amp; Commerce|Royal Society of Arts]] in 1890, and &quot;On the Use and Classification of a Typographical Library&quot;, to the [[Chartered Institute of Library and Information Professionals|Library Association]] in 1892.&lt;ref&gt;Morison, pp. 50–52&lt;/ref&gt; After Blades's death in 1890, Reed prepared his former mentor's unfinished ''Pentateuch of Printing'' for publication, adding a long memorial tribute to Blades.&lt;ref name= DNB/&gt;

==''The Boy's Own Paper''==
[[File:BoysOwnPaperIssue1Jan1879.jpg|thumb|left|Issue No. 1 of ''The Boy's Own Paper'', 18 January 1879, with Reed's short story &quot;My First Football Match&quot;]]
The Reed family had longstanding connections with   [[Religious Tract Society|The Religious Tract Society]] (RTS), which had been founded in 1799  to publish and disseminate material of a Christian nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Fyfe|first= Aileen Kennedy|title= A brief history of the Religious Tract Society|url= http://www.nuigalway.ie/history/fyfe/thesis.html#RTShist|publisher= National University of Ireland, Galway|year= 2000|accessdate= 3 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Talbot's grandfather Andrew Reed, at the age of 12, had attended the Society's inaugural meeting; Charles Reed and his eldest son, Charles junior, were both active members.&lt;ref name= DNB/&gt; On 23 July 1878 an RTS subcommittee (including both Charles Reeds) recommended the publication of &quot;a magazine for Boys to be issued weekly at a price of one penny&quot;.&lt;ref name= Cox18&gt;Cox, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Society had frequently expressed a desire to  counter the &quot;cheap and sensational&quot; magazines that were read by young people, its main committee was initially hesitant about this proposal, fearing its financial implications. Finally, however, it felt obliged &quot;to attempt an enterprise from which others shrank&quot;.&lt;ref name= Cox18/&gt; Thereafter the committee moved swiftly, and the first issue of the new publication,  ''[[The Boy's Own Paper]]'',  was on sale on 18 January 1879.&lt;ref&gt;Cox, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

Although at that time his writing experience was limited, Reed was asked by his father and brother to contribute to the new venture, a challenge he accepted enthusiastically.&lt;ref name= M14&gt;Morison, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from his stories for ''The Earlsfield Chronicle'', his sole prior experience of magazine writing had been an article entitled &quot;Camping Out&quot;, for the Edinburgh-based young peoples' magazine ''Morning of Life''. This account of a boating excursion on the Thames had appeared in 1875.&lt;ref&gt;Morison, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; For the first issue of the ''B.O.P.'', Reed wrote a school story, &quot;My First Football Match&quot; which, accompanied by a half-page illustration, appeared on the front page  &quot;by An Old Boy&quot;. The story was very well received, and prompted demands for more  about &quot;Parkhurst&quot;, the school where the football match was played. Reed responded with several more tales, among which were &quot;The Parkhurst Paper Chase&quot; and  &quot;The Parkhurst Boat Race&quot;.&lt;ref name= Cox35/&gt;

In the new magazine's first year Reed was a regular contributor of articles and stories on a range of subjects, joining   distinguished writers such as [[G. A. Henty]],&lt;ref&gt;Morison, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; [[R.M. Ballantyne]] and [[Jules Verne]].&lt;ref name= Cox35&gt;Cox, pp. 35–37&lt;/ref&gt; A prominent illustrator for the magazine was the artist and mountaineer [[Edward Whymper]].&lt;ref&gt;Cox, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; Reed's association with the ''B.O.P.'' lasted for the remainder of his life; the magazine would be the initial publisher for almost all his subsequent output of fiction. This commitment to the ''B.O.P.'' delayed progress on his ''History of the Old English Letter Foundries'', especially as Reed began writing regular columns and book reviews for the ''Leeds Mercury'',&lt;ref name= DNB/&gt; now edited by his cousin, the younger Edward Baines.&lt;ref&gt;Morison, pp. 23–24&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1880s was a decade of growing prosperity, and increasing numbers of families from the expanding middle classes  were sending their sons to boarding schools. ''B.O.P.'' editor George Hutchinson  felt that such schools would provide the  ideal setting for stories in which a boy hero (or heroes) could display Christian principles and strength of character in the face of temptations, and planned to run a long serial story. Reed, who had not himself attended a boarding school, was not the obvious choice as the writer. However,  the skill and imagination he had displayed in his short school  stories convinced Hutchinson that Reed should be given the assignment.&lt;ref name= Cox42&gt;Cox, pp. 40–42&lt;/ref&gt;

==School stories==
[[File:Saint Dominics Boys.jpg|thumb|Boys at St. Dominic's: an illustration from the first book edition, 1887]]
Reed's first response to the request for [[school story|school stories]] for ''The Boy's Own Paper'' was ''The Adventures of a Three-Guinea Watch'', which ran for 19 instalments from October 1880 to April 1881. The travels of a schoolboy's [[pocket watch]] are charted through school, university and, finally, India at the time of the  [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]].&lt;ref&gt;Morison, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; The school, &quot;Randlebury&quot;, is believed to be based, like &quot;Parkhurst&quot;, on information Reed received from friends who had boarded at [[Radley College|Radley]].&lt;ref&gt;Cox, pp. 29 and 41–42&lt;/ref&gt; The success of the story encouraged the  ''B.O.P.'''s editors to ask Reed to attempt a longer and more ambitious work. The result was ''[[The Fifth Form at St. Dominic's]]'', which became the favourite and most influential of all Reed's stories.&lt;ref name= Quigly79&gt;Quigly, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; Extended over 38 episodes, each  a self-contained unit within an overall plot, this was the first of a sequence of school stories, all serialised in the ''B.O.P.''   The boarding school milieu was repeated, with a few variations, in ''The Willoughby Captains'' (serialised 1883–84), ''The Master of the Shell'' (1887–88), ''The Cock-House at Fellsgarth'' (1891){{#tag:ref|The term &quot;Cock-House&quot; refers to the champion house within the school. English schools were (and are) often divided into &quot;houses&quot; who compete against each other, particularly in games. See, for example, {{cite web|title= Cock House trophy|url= http://www.strs.org.uk/house/main.html|publisher= Sir Thomas Rich's School|accessdate= 9 October 2010}} {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot}}|group= n}} and ''Tom, Dick and Harry'' (1892–93). Reed followed the suggestion of his editors by setting ''My Friend Smith'' (1882–83) in a different kind of school, a &quot;modest establishment for the backward and troublesome&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;This is the description given by Hutchinson in his preface to the first book edition of ''My Friend Smith'', The Religious Tract Society, London 1889&lt;/ref&gt; It was, however, the boarding school stories that endured and which became the standard model for school stories for many decades.&lt;ref name= Q83&gt;Quigly, pp. 83–85&lt;/ref&gt; All the serials were quickly issued in book form, and most were reprinted for the benefit of successive generations of boys, up to the 1950s.&lt;ref name= DNB/&gt; The model was  imitated or copied by other writers  for the next half century; according to historian Isabel Quigly, &quot;Reed was a better writer than his followers, and has been diminished by their imitations.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Quigly, p. 82&lt;/ref&gt;

In a  biographical sketch written in 2004, historian [[Jeffrey Richards]] characterises Reed's work as a mixing of the earlier school story traditions established by [[Frederic William Farrar|Dean Farrar]] and [[Thomas Hughes]], crafted with a vivid readability.&lt;ref name= DNB/&gt; Reed dismissed Farrar's ''[[Eric, or, Little by Little]]'' as a religious tract thinly disguised as a school story, and sought to produce something more &quot;manly&quot;.&lt;ref name= Quigly79/&gt; Many of the incidents and characterisations  introduced by Reed in ''St. Dominic's'' became standard elements in his subsequent stories, and in those of his imitators. Quigly lists among other recurrent features the stolen exam paper, the innocent who is wrongly accused and ultimately justified after much proud suffering, the boating accident, the group rivalries, the noble friendships. Adult characters are largely stereotypes:  a headmaster known as &quot;the Doctor&quot; and modelled on [[Thomas Arnold]] of [[Rugby School|Rugby]], &quot;the jabbering French master (pointed beard and two-tone shoes)&quot;, the popular games master, the dry pedant, the generally comic domestic staff.&lt;ref&gt;Quigly, pp. 27 and 87&lt;/ref&gt; Reed established a tradition in which the fictional boarding school was peopled by such characters and was almost invariably represented in terms of &quot;dark passages, iron bedsteads, scratched desks, chill dormitories and cosy, shabby studies.&lt;ref&gt;Quigly, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; Quigly suggests that one reason for the success of Reed's stories and their longlasting appeal is that they are not so much books about school as books about people.&lt;ref&gt;Quigly, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; John Sime of the RTS, in a memorial tribute to Reed  after his death, notes that the boys in the stories are recognisably of flesh and blood, with &quot;just that spice of wickedness ... without which a boy is not a boy&quot;.&lt;ref name= Simevii&gt;Sime, pp. vii–viii&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life and other activities==
[[File:Lough swilly.jpg|thumb|left|Lough Swilly, County Donegal, Ireland, the annual holiday destination for the Reed family]]
In 1876 Reed married Elizabeth Greer, the daughter of Samuel Greer, a [[County Court]] judge and former MP for the [[County Londonderry|County of Londonderry]] in the north of Ireland. Their first child, a daughter, died in infancy, but three healthy children followed: Charles in 1879, Margaret in 1882 and Talbot in 1886.&lt;ref name= Morison23&gt;Morison, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; The connection with Ireland was of great value to Reed, and the family regularly spent annual holidays on the shores of [[Lough Swilly]] in [[County Donegal]].&lt;ref&gt;Sime, pp. xvi–xvii&lt;/ref&gt;

Reed was constantly busy; he held the loafer—defined by him as &quot;anyone who worked from nine to five and did nothing with the rest of the day&quot;—in contempt.&lt;ref name= Q78/&gt; Alongside his heavy schedule of duties at the foundry and his prolific writing, he took his share in the supervision of the various charities founded by his grandfather Andrew Reed, and was a [[deacon#Other traditions|deacon]] at his local Congregational Church.&lt;ref name= Morison23/&gt;  In 1892 he was a co-founder of the [[Bibliographical Society]] and its first honorary secretary, an office he modestly agreed to hold &quot;pro tem in the hopes of your finding a better man&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Morison, pp. 66–70&lt;/ref&gt;

Physically active and energetic, Reed keenly followed his old school's fortunes on the sports field, on one occasion writing anxiously to the school about its apparent loss of enthusiasm for football and cricket.&lt;ref name= Morison4/&gt; As part of a busy social life he regularly attended City of London Old Boys' reunion dinners, and was a member of two London clubs, the [[Savile Club|Savile]] and the [[Reform Club|Reform]]. In politics Reed was a lifelong [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]], although he disagreed with Gladstone's  [[Government of Ireland Bill 1886|Irish Home Rule policy]].&lt;ref&gt;Sime, pp. xii and xxi&lt;/ref&gt; Reed's busy and fulfilling life was punctuated from time to time by private tragedies. The loss of his baby daughter was followed, soon after, by the death of his younger brother Kenneth, drowned with a companion in [[Lough Allen]] in [[County Leitrim]], while exploring the [[River Shannon]]. In 1883 his elder brother, The Rev. Charles Reed, &quot;my 'father confessor' in times of all trouble&quot;, died after a fall during a walking holiday in Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;Sime, pp. xvii–xviii&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and legacy==
[[File:O'shea sculpture Talbot Baines Reed.jpg|thumb|upright|Reed's memorial stone in Abney Park cemetery]]
Reed generally enjoyed vigorous good health. However, early in 1893 there were signs that his workload was taking its toll. In January of that year he left London for an extended stay in Ireland, hoping to recover his energies. He returned to his various duties in May, but later in the summer became seriously ill with what was  identified at the time as &quot;consumption&quot;, and was probably [[pulmonary tuberculosis]].&lt;ref name= Morison70&gt;Morison, pp. 70–71&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Cox46&gt;Cox, pp. 46–47&lt;/ref&gt; He relinquished the secretaryship of the Bibliographical Society and returned to Ireland where, though largely confined indoors, he  continued writing his regular weekly column for the ''Leeds Mercury'' and finished his final novel, ''Kilgorman''. Letters to friends at home indicated that he remained in good spirits and was hopeful of recovery.&lt;ref&gt;Sime, pp. xxii–xxiii&lt;/ref&gt; However, his condition worsened, and he was advised to return home for urgent medical treatment.  Back in London he wrote his final piece for the ''Mercury'', a review of ''Seventy Years of Irish Life'' by W.R. Le Fanu. He died at his home in Highgate on 28 November 1893, aged 41, and was buried in [[Abney Park Cemetery]], by the side of his father and grandfather.&lt;ref name= Morison70/&gt;&lt;ref name= Morison72&gt;Morison, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the many tributes paid to Reed, Joseph Sime spoke for &quot;the boys of the English-speaking world&quot; who had &quot;lost one of their best friends&quot;. Sime wrote of Reed's particular empathy with the young: &quot;He possessed in himself the healthy freshness of heart of boyhood&amp;nbsp;... and could place himself sympathetically at the boy's standpoint in life.&quot;&lt;ref name= Simevii/&gt; Reed's grave was visited by boys and their families for many years. He died a wealthy man,{{#tag:ref|The probate value of Reed's estate was £21,305,&lt;ref name= DNB/&gt; which on the basis of the Retail Price Index (RPI) was worth approximately £1.75 million in 2010, or around £10 million on an average earnings basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Five Ways to Compute the Relative Value of a UK Pound Amount, 1830 to Present|url= http://www.measuringworth.com/ukcompare/|publisher= Measuringworth|accessdate= 13 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} although long before his death he had transferred the copyright of his books to the Religious Tract Society for a nominal sum.&lt;ref&gt;Morison, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; After his death, Elizabeth Reed agreed that Reed's considerable personal library should be given to the St Bride Foundation Institute, whose collection of typographic literature  included the library of Reed's early mentor, William Blades.&lt;ref name= Morison73&gt;Morison, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= History|url= http://stbride.org/library/history|publisher= St Bride Library|accessdate= 13 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reed's regular readers included the young [[P.G. Wodehouse]], who particularly loved the school stories.&lt;ref&gt;Donaldson, p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; Wodehouse's literary biographer [[Benny Green (saxophonist)|Benny Green]], while excoriating Reed as a &quot;hereditary prig&quot; and a &quot;religious huckster&quot;,  accepts that he influenced  Wodehouse, and cites in particular ''The Willoughby Captains''. Green also echoes Quigly in asserting that none of Reed's successors could match his abilities as a storyteller.&lt;ref&gt;Green, pp. 15–17&lt;/ref&gt;  Quigly summarises Reed's legacy to future school story writers: he established a genre by &quot;alter[ing] the shapeless, long-winded, garrulous and moralistic school story&quot; into something popular and readable, a convention followed by all his successors.&lt;ref&gt;Quigly, pp. 82–83&lt;/ref&gt; Reed himself expressed the guiding principles of his life in a letter addressed to a new Boys' Club in Manchester: &quot;The strong fellows should look after the weak, the active must look after the lazy, the merry must cheer up the dull, the sharp must lend a helping hand to the duffer. Pull together in all your learning, playing and praying.&quot;&lt;ref name= Morison72/&gt;

The grave in Abney Park was eventually surmounted by a memorial stone in the style of a [[Celtic cross]].  Although Reed biographer Stanley Morison suggests that Reed's legacy is his ''History of the Old English Letter Foundries'',&lt;ref name=&quot;Morison73&quot;/&gt; Jack Cox, historian of the ''B.O.P'', asserts that the school stories first serialised in the magazine are the writer's true memorial.&lt;ref&gt;Cox, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bibliography==
This does not include Reed's uncollected short stories,  journalism or trade publications. All the school stories, and much of the other fiction, first appeared in ''The Boy's Own Paper''.
