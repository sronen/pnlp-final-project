'''Samuel Johnson''' (18 September 1709 {{smaller|&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Old Style and New Style dates|O.S.]] 7 September]}}&amp;nbsp;– 13 December 1784), often referred to as '''Dr Johnson''', was an English author who made lasting contributions to [[English literature]] as a poet, essayist, moralist, literary critic, biographer, editor and [[lexicographer]]. Johnson was a devout [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] and committed [[Tory]], and has been described as &quot;arguably the most distinguished man of letters in English history&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Rogers|first=Pat|contribution=Johnson, Samuel (1709–1784)|title=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2006|edition=online|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/14918|accessdate=25 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also the subject of &quot;the most famous single work of biographical art in the whole of literature&quot;: [[James Boswell]]'s ''[[Life of Samuel Johnson]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Batexix&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1977|p=xix}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnson was born in [[Lichfield]], Staffordshire, and attended [[Pembroke College, Oxford]] for just over a year, before his lack of funds forced him to leave. After working as a teacher he moved to London, where he began to write miscellaneous pieces for ''[[The Gentleman's Magazine]]''. His early works include the biography ''[[Life of Savage|The Life of Richard Savage]]'', the poems &quot;[[London (1738 poem)|London]]&quot; and &quot;[[The Vanity of Human Wishes]]&quot;, and the play ''[[Irene (play)|Irene]]''.

After nine years of work, Johnson's ''[[A Dictionary of the English Language]]'' was published in 1755; it had a far-reaching effect on [[Modern English]] and has been described as &quot;one of the greatest single achievements of scholarship.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bate240&quot;/&gt; This work brought Johnson popularity and success. Until the completion of the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' 150 years later, Johnson's was viewed as the pre-eminent British dictionary.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lynch p. 1&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Lynch|2003|p= 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; His later works included essays, an influential annotated edition of [[The Plays of William Shakespeare|William Shakespeare's plays]], and the widely read tale ''[[The History of Rasselas, Prince of Abissinia|Rasselas]]''. In 1763, he befriended James Boswell, with whom he later travelled to Scotland; Johnson described their travels in ''[[A Journey to the Western Islands of Scotland]]''. Towards the end of his life, he produced the massive and influential ''[[Lives of the Most Eminent English Poets]]'', a collection of biographies and evaluations of 17th- and 18th-century poets.

Johnson had a tall and robust figure, but his odd gestures and [[tic]]s were confusing to some on their first encounter with him. Boswell's ''Life'', along with [[List of contemporary accounts of Samuel Johnson's life|other biographies]], documented Johnson's behaviour and mannerisms in such detail that they have informed the [[Samuel Johnson's health#Posthumous diagnosis|posthumous diagnosis]] of [[Tourette syndrome]] (TS),&lt;ref name=&quot;ContTSDiagnosis&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Murray|1979}} and {{Harvnb|Stern|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; a condition not defined or diagnosed in the 18th century. After a series of illnesses he died on the evening of 13 December 1784, and was buried in [[Westminster Abbey]]. In the years following his death, Johnson began to be recognised as having had a lasting effect on literary criticism, and even as the only great critic of English literature.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winters p. 240&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Winters|1943|p=240}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Johnson house Lichfield.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Large three-storey house on a corner site|[[Samuel Johnson Birthplace Museum|Johnson's birthplace]] in Market Square, [[Lichfield]]]]

Born on 18 September 1709 (New Style) to Michael Johnson, a bookseller, and his wife, Sarah Ford,&lt;ref name=&quot;Bate p. 5&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1977|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Samuel Johnson often claimed that he grew up in poverty. Since both families had money, it is uncertain what happened between Michael and Sarah's marriage and the birth of Samuel just three years later to provoke such a change in fortune.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lane p. 1314&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Lane|1975|pp=13–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson was born in the [[Samuel Johnson Birthplace Museum|family home]] above his father's bookshop in [[Lichfield]], Staffordshire and,&lt;ref name=&quot;Bate p. 5&quot;/&gt; because his mother Sarah was 40 when she gave birth, a &quot;man-midwife&quot; and surgeon of &quot;great reputation&quot; named George Hector was brought in to assist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lane|1975|pp=15–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; He did not cry and, with doubts surrounding the newborn's health, his aunt claimed &quot;that she would not have picked such a poor creature up in the street&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;Watkins p.25&quot;/&gt; As it was feared the baby might die, the vicar of [[St Mary's Church, Lichfield|St Mary's]] was summoned to perform a baptism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lane|1975|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two godfathers were chosen: Samuel Swynfen, a physician and graduate of [[Pembroke College, Oxford]], and Richard Wakefield, a lawyer, coroner, and Lichfield town clerk.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1977|pp=5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnson's health improved and he was put to wet-nurse with Joan Marklew. He soon contracted [[scrofula]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Lane pp. 16-17&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Lane|1975|pp=16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; known at that time as the &quot;King's Evil&quot; because it was thought royalty could cure it. [[John Floyer|Sir John Floyer]], former physician to [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], recommended that the young Johnson should receive the &quot;[[scrofula|royal touch]]&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Lane p. 18&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Lane|1975|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; which he received from [[Anne of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] on 30 March 1712. However, the ritual was ineffective, and an operation was performed that left him with permanent scars across his face and body.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lane pp. 19-20&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Lane|1975|pp=19–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the birth of Johnson's brother, Nathaniel, a few months later, Michael was unable to keep on top of the debts he had accumulated over the years, and his family was no longer able to live in the style to which it had been accustomed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lane pp. 20-21&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Lane|1975|pp=20–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote box|quoted=yes|width=25em|align=left|quote=When he was a child in petticoats, and had learned to read, Mrs Johnson one morning put the common prayer-book into his hands, pointed to the collect for the day, and said, 'Sam, you must get this by heart.' She went up stairs, leaving him to study it: But by the time she had reached the second floor, she heard him following her. 'What's the matter?' said she. 'I can say it,' he replied; and repeated it distinctly, though he could not have read it over more than twice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Boswell|1986|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|source=Boswell's ''Life of Samuel Johnson''}}

Johnson demonstrated signs of great intelligence as a child, and his parents, to his later disgust, would show off his &quot;newly acquired accomplishments&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1977|pp=18–19}}&lt;/ref&gt; His education began at the age of three, and came from his mother who had him memorise and recite passages from the [[Book of Common Prayer]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bate p. 21&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1977|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Johnson turned four, he was sent to a nearby school, and, when he reached the age of six, he was sent to a retired shoemaker to continue his education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lane|1975|pp=25–26}}&lt;/ref&gt; A year later, Johnson was sent to [[Lichfield Grammar School]], where he excelled in Latin.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lane p. 26&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Lane|1975|p=&amp;nbsp;26}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, Johnson started to exhibit the [[tic]]s that would influence how people viewed him in his later years, and which formed the basis for the posthumous diagnosis of [[Tourette syndrome]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Demaria pp. 5-6&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|DeMaria|1994|pp=5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; He excelled at his studies and was promoted to the upper school at the age of nine.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lane p. 26&quot;/&gt; During this time, he befriended Edmund Hector, nephew of his &quot;man-midwife&quot; George Hector, and John Taylor, with whom he remained in contact for the rest of his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1977|p=23,&amp;nbsp;31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the age of 16, Johnson was given the opportunity to stay with his cousins, the Fords, at [[Pedmore]], Worcestershire.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lane p. 29&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Lane|1975|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; There he became a close friend of Cornelius Ford, who employed his knowledge of the classics to tutor Johnson while he was not attending school.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wain p. 32&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Wain|1974|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ford was a successful, well-connected academic, but was also a notorious alcoholic whose excesses contributed to his death six years after Johnson's visit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lane|1975|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having spent six months with his cousins, Johnson returned to Lichfield, but Mr. Hunter, the headmaster, &quot;angered by the impertinence of this long absence&quot;, refused to allow him to continue at the grammar school.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lane p. 33&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Lane|1975|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unable to return to Lichfield Grammar School, Johnson was enrolled into the [[King Edward VI College, Stourbridge|King Edward VI grammar school at Stourbridge]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Wain p. 32&quot;/&gt; Because the school was located near Pedmore, Johnson was able to spend more time with the Fords, and he began to write poems and verse translations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lane p. 33&quot;/&gt; However, he spent only six months at Stourbridge before returning once again to his parents' home in Lichfield.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1977|p=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Pembroke Lodge.jpg|thumb|upright|Entrance of Pembroke College, Oxford]]

During this time, Johnson's future was uncertain as his father was deeply in debt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lane|1975|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; To earn money, Johnson began to stitch books for his father, and it is possible that Johnson spent most of his time in his father's bookshop reading various works and building his literary knowledge. They remained in poverty until Sarah Johnson's cousin, Elizabeth Harriotts, died in February 1728 and left enough money to send Johnson to college.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bate p. 87&quot;/&gt; On 31 October 1728, a few weeks after he turned 19, Johnson entered Pembroke College, Oxford.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lane|1975|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inheritance did not cover all of his expenses at Pembroke, but Andrew Corbet, a friend and fellow student at Pembroke, offered to make up the deficit.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bate p. 88&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1977|p=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnson made friends at Pembroke and read much. In later life, he told stories of his idleness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1977|pp=90–100}}. Bate also comments that Johnson's standard of effort was very high, so high that Johnson said he had never known a man to study hard.&lt;/ref&gt; He was later asked by his tutor to produce a Latin translation of [[Alexander Pope]]'s ''Messiah'' as a Christmas exercise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Boswell|1986|pp=91–92}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson completed half of the translation in one afternoon and the rest the following morning. Although the poem brought him praise, it did not bring the material benefit he had hoped for.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bate p. 92&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1977|p=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; The poem later appeared in ''Miscellany of Poems'' (1731), edited by John Husbands, a Pembroke tutor, and is the earliest surviving publication of any of Johnson's writings. Johnson spent the rest of his time studying, even over the Christmas vacation. He drafted a &quot;plan of study&quot; called &quot;Adversaria&quot;, which was left unfinished, and used his time to learn French while working on his knowledge of Greek.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bate p. 9394&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1977|pp=93–94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After thirteen months, a shortage of funds forced Johnson to leave Oxford without a degree, and he returned to Lichfield.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bate p. 87&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1977|p=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; Towards the end of Johnson's stay at Oxford his tutor, Jorden, left Pembroke and was replaced by [[William Adams (master)|William Adams]]. He enjoyed Adams as a tutor, but by December, Johnson was already a quarter behind in his student fees, and he was forced to return home. He left behind many books that he had borrowed from his father because he could not afford to transport them and as a symbolic gesture in that he hoped to return to his studies soon.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bate p. 106107&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1977|pp=106–107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He eventually received a degree: just before the publication of his ''Dictionary'' in 1755, Oxford University awarded Johnson the degree of [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)|Master of Arts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lane|1975|pp=128–129}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded an honorary [[Honorary degree|doctorate]] in 1765 by [[Trinity College Dublin]] and in 1775 by Oxford University.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bate Achievement p. 36&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1955|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1776, he returned to Pembroke with [[James Boswell|Boswell]] and toured the college with his previous tutor Adams, who was then its Master. He used that visit to recount his time at the college, his early career, and to express his later fondness for Jorden.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bate p. 99&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1977|p=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early career===
Little is known about Johnson's life between the end of 1729 and 1731; it is likely that he lived with his parents. He experienced bouts of mental anguish and physical pain during years of illness;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bate p. 127&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1977|p=127}}&lt;/ref&gt; his tics and gesticulations associated with [[Tourette syndrome]] became more noticeable and were often commented upon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wiltshire|1991|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1731 Johnson's father was deeply in debt and had lost much of his standing in Lichfield. Johnson hoped to get an usher's position which became available at Stourbridge Grammar School, but as he did not have a degree his application was passed over on 6 September 1731.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bate p. 127&quot;/&gt; At about this time, Johnson's father became ill and developed an &quot;inflammatory fever&quot; which led to his death in December 1731.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bate p. 129&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1977|p=129}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson eventually found employment as undermaster at a school in [[Market Bosworth]], run by Sir [[Wolstan Dixie, 4th Baronet]] who allowed Johnson to teach without a degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Boswell|1986|pp=130–131}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Johnson was treated as a servant,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hopewell|1950|p= 53}}&lt;/ref&gt; he found pleasure in teaching despite thinking it boring. After an argument with Dixie he quit the school, and by June 1732 he had returned home.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1977|pp=131–132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Johnson Wife.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Elizabeth &quot;Tetty&quot; Porter, Johnson's wife]]

Johnson continued to look for a position at a Lichfield school. After being turned down for a position in Ashbourne, he spent his time with his friend Edmund Hector, who was living in the home of the publisher [[Thomas Warren]]. At the time Warren was starting his ''[[Birmingham Journal (eighteenth century)|Birmingham Journal]]'', and he enlisted Johnson's help.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bate p. 134&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1977|p=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; This connection with Warren grew, and Johnson proposed a translation of [[Jeronimo Lobo]]'s account of the [[Ethiopian Empire|Abyssinians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Boswell|1986|pp=137–138}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson read Abbé Joachim Le Grand's French translations, and thought that a shorter version might be &quot;useful and profitable&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bate p. 138&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1977|p=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of writing the whole work himself, he dictated to Hector, who then took the copy to the printer and made any corrections. Johnson's ''A Voyage to Abyssinia'' was published a year later.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bate p. 138&quot;/&gt; He returned to Lichfield in February 1734, and began an annotated edition of [[Poliziano]]'s Latin poems, along with a history of Latin poetry from [[Petrarch]] to Poliziano; a ''Proposal'' was soon printed, but a lack of funds halted the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Boswell|1986|pp=140–141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnson remained with his close friend Harry Porter during a terminal illness,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1977|p=144}}&lt;/ref&gt; which culminated when Porter died on 3 September 1734, leaving his wife [[Elizabeth Porter|Elizabeth Jervis Porter]] (otherwise known as &quot;Tetty&quot;) widowed at the age of 45, with three children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1977|p=143}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some months later, Johnson began to court her. The Reverend William Shaw claims that &quot;the first advances probably proceeded from her, as her attachment to Johnson was in opposition to the advice and desire of all her relations&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Boswell|1969|p=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson was inexperienced in such relationships, but the well-to-do widow encouraged him and promised to provide for him with her substantial savings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1977|p=145}}&lt;/ref&gt; They married on 9 July 1735, at [[St Werburgh's Church, Derby|St Werburgh's Church]] in [[Derby]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1977|p=147}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Porter family did not approve of the match, partly because Johnson was 25 and Elizabeth was 21 years his elder, and Elizabeth's marriage to Johnson so disgusted her son Jervis that he severed relations with her.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wain p. 65&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Wain|1974|p=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, her daughter Lucy had accepted Johnson from the start, and her other son, Joseph, accepted the marriage later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1977|p=146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Edial Hall School.jpg|thumb|[[Edial Hall School]]]]

In June 1735, while working as a tutor for the children of Thomas Whitby, a local Staffordshire gentleman, Johnson had applied for the position of headmaster at [[Solihull School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1977|pp=153–154}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Johnson's friend Gilbert Walmesley gave his support, Johnson was passed over because the school's directors thought he was &quot;a very haughty, ill-natured gent., and that he has such a way of distorting his face (which though he can't help) the gent[s] think it may affect some lads&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bate p. 154&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1977|p=154}}&lt;/ref&gt; With Walmesley's encouragement, Johnson decided that he could be a successful teacher if he ran his own school.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1977|p=153}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the autumn of 1735, Johnson opened [[Edial Hall School]] as a private academy at [[Edial]], near Lichfield. He had only three pupils: Lawrence Offley, George Garrick, and the 18-year-old [[David Garrick]], who later became one of the most famous actors of his day.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bate p. 154&quot;/&gt; The venture was unsuccessful and cost Tetty a substantial portion of her fortune. Instead of trying to keep the failing school going, Johnson began to write his first major work, the historical tragedy ''[[Irene (play)|Irene]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1977|p=156}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biographer Robert DeMaria believed that Tourette syndrome likely made public occupations like schoolmaster or tutor almost impossible for Johnson to hold; this may have led Johnson to &quot;the invisible occupation of authorship&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Demaria pp. 5-6&quot;/&gt;

Johnson left for London with his former pupil David Garrick on 2 March 1737, the day Johnson's brother had died. He was penniless and pessimistic about their travel, but fortunately for them, Garrick had connections in London, and the two were able to stay with his distant relative, Richard Norris.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bate p. 16465&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1977|pp=164–165}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson soon moved to Greenwich near the Golden Hart Tavern to finish ''Irene''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Boswell|1986|pp=168–169}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 July 1737 he wrote to [[Edward Cave]] with a proposal for a translation of [[Paolo Sarpi]]'s ''The History of the Council of Trent'' (1619), which Cave did not accept until months later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wain|1974|p=81}}; {{Harvnb|Bate|1977|p=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1737 Johnson brought his wife to London, and he found employment with Cave as a writer for ''[[The Gentleman's Magazine]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Boswell|1986|pp=169–170}}&lt;/ref&gt; His assignments for the magazine and other publishers during this time were &quot;almost unparalleled in range and variety&quot;, and &quot;so numerous, so varied and scattered&quot; that &quot;Johnson himself could not make a complete list&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1955|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name ''[[Columbia (name)|Columbia]]'', a poetic name for America coined by Johnson, first appears in a 1738 weekly publication of the debates of the British Parliament in the Magazine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bodley.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/ilej/image1.pl?item=page&amp;seq=5&amp;size=1&amp;id=gm.1738.6.x.8.x.x.285a The Gentleman's Magazine, Vol. 8, June 1738, p. 285] Retrieved 22 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=_DoJAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PR13 ''Debates in Parliament'', Samuel Johnson.] Retrieved 22 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Johnson London 01.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Title page of ''London'' second edition]]

In May 1738 his first major work, the poem ''[[London (1738 poem)‎|London]]'', was published anonymously.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lynch p. 5&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Lynch|2003|p= 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on [[Juvenal]]'s [[Satires of Juvenal#Satire III: There is no Room in Roma for a Roman|Satire III]], it describes the character Thales leaving for Wales to escape the problems of London,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1977|p=172}}&lt;/ref&gt; which it portrays as a place of crime, corruption, and neglect of the poor. Johnson could not bring himself to regard the poem as earning him any merit as a poet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1955|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alexander Pope]] claimed that the author &quot;will soon be déterré&quot; (brought to light, become well known), but this would not happen until 15 years later.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lynch p. 5&quot;/&gt;

In August, Johnson's lack of an [[MA degree]] from Oxford or Cambridge led to his being denied a position as master of the Appleby Grammar School. In an effort to end such rejections, [[Alexander Pope|Pope]] asked [[John Leveson-Gower, 1st Earl Gower|Lord Gower]] to use his influence to have a degree awarded to Johnson.&lt;ref name=&quot;Watkins p.25&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Watkins|1960|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gower petitioned Oxford for an honorary degree to be awarded to Johnson, but was told that it was &quot;too much to be asked&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bate p. 182&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1977|p=182}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gower then asked a friend of [[Jonathan Swift]] to plead with Swift to use his influence at the [[University of Dublin]] to have a Masters degree awarded to Johnson, in the hope that this could then be used to justify an MA from Oxford,&lt;ref name=&quot;Bate p. 182&quot;/&gt; but Swift refused to act on Johnson's behalf.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Watkins|1960|pp=25–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1737 and 1739, Johnson befriended [[Richard Savage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Watkins|1960|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feeling guilty about living on Tetty's money, Johnson stopped living with her and spent his time with Savage. They were poor and would stay in taverns or sleep in &quot;night-cellars&quot; except for nights that they would roam the streets because they lacked the necessary funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1977|pp=178–179}}&lt;/ref&gt; Savage's friends tried to help him by attempting to persuade him to move to Wales, but Savage ended up in Bristol and again fell into debt. He was committed to debtors' prison and died in 1743. A year later, Johnson wrote ''[[Life of Mr Richard Savage]]'' (1744), a &quot;moving&quot; work which, in the words of the biographer and critic [[Walter Jackson Bate]], &quot;remains one of the innovative works in the history of biography&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1977|pp=180–181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Johnson Dictionary2.jpg|upright|thumb|Johnson's ''Dictionary'' Vol. 1 (1755) title page]]

In 1746, a group of publishers approached Johnson about creating an authoritative dictionary of the English language;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lynch p. 5&quot;/&gt; a contract with [[William Strahan]] and associates, worth 1,500 [[Guinea (British coin)|guinea]]s, was signed on the morning of 18 June 1746.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hitchings&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Hitchings|2005|p=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson claimed that he could finish the project in three years. In comparison, the [[Académie Française]] had forty scholars spending forty years to complete its dictionary, which prompted Johnson to claim, &quot;This is the proportion. Let me see; forty times forty is sixteen hundred. As three to sixteen hundred, so is the proportion of an Englishman to a Frenchman&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lynch p. 5&quot;/&gt; Although he did not succeed in completing the work in three years, he did manage to finish it in nine, justifying his boast.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lynch p. 5&quot;/&gt; According to Bate, the ''Dictionary'' &quot;easily ranks as one of the greatest single achievements of scholarship, and probably the greatest ever performed by one individual who laboured under anything like the disadvantages in a comparable length of time&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bate240&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1977|p=240}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, others, such as [[Thomas Babington Macaulay]] who described Johnson as &quot;a wretched etymologist,&quot; have criticised Johnson's dictionary.&lt;ref&gt;Winchester 2003, p.33&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnson's dictionary was not the first, nor was it unique. It was, however, the most commonly used and imitated for the 150 years between its first publication and the completion of the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' in 1928. Other dictionaries, such as [[Nathan Bailey]]'s ''Dictionarium Britannicum'', included more words,&lt;ref name=&quot;Lynch p. 1&quot;/&gt; and in the 150 years preceding Johnson's dictionary about twenty other general-purpose monolingual &quot;English&quot; dictionaries had been produced.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lynch p. 2&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Lynch|2003|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there was open dissatisfaction with the dictionaries of the period. In 1741, [[David Hume]] claimed: &quot;The Elegance and Propriety of Stile have been very much neglected among us. We have no Dictionary of our Language, and scarce a tolerable Grammar&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lynch p. 4&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Lynch|2003|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson's ''Dictionary'' offers insights into the 18th century and &quot;a faithful record of the language people used&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lynch p. 1&quot;/&gt; It is more than a reference book; it is a work of literature.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lynch p. 2&quot;/&gt;

For a decade, Johnson's constant work on the ''Dictionary'' disrupted his and Tetty's living conditions. He had to employ a number of assistants for the copying and mechanical work, which filled the house with incessant noise and clutter. He was always busy with his work, and kept hundreds of books around.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lane p. 109&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Lane|1975|p=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Hawkins (author)|John Hawkins]] described the scene: &quot;The books he used for this purpose were what he had in his own collection, a copious but a miserably ragged one, and all such as he could borrow; which latter, if ever they came back to those that lent them, were so defaced as to be scarce worth owning&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hawkins|1787|p=175}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson was also distracted by Tetty's health, as she started to show signs of a terminal illness.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lane p. 109&quot;/&gt; To accommodate both his wife and his work, he moved to [[Dr. Johnson's House|17 Gough Square]] near his printer, William Strahan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lane|1975|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Johnson Dictionary3.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Johnson's ''Dictionary'' Vol. 2 (1755) title page]]

In preparation for the work, Johnson wrote a ''Plan'' for the ''Dictionary''. [[Philip Stanhope, 4th Earl of Chesterfield]], was the patron of the ''Plan'', to Johnson's displeasure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lane|1975|pp=117–118}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seven years after first meeting Johnson to go over the work, Chesterfield wrote two anonymous essays in ''The World'' recommending the ''Dictionary''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lane p. 118&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Lane|1975|p=118}}&lt;/ref&gt; He complained that the English language lacked structure and argued in support of the dictionary. Johnson did not like the tone of the essay, and he felt that Chesterfield had not fulfilled his obligations as the work's patron.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lane p. 121&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Lane|1975|p=121}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson wrote a [[Letter to Chesterfield|letter]] expressing this view and harshly criticising Chesterfield, saying &quot;Is not a patron, my lord, one who looks with unconcern on a man struggling for life in the water, and when he has reached ground, encumbers him with help? The notice which you have been pleased to take of my labours, had it been early, had been kind: but it has been delayed till I am indifferent and cannot enjoy it; till I am solitary and cannot impart it; till I am known and do not want it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bate p. 257&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1977|p=257}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chesterfield, impressed by the language, kept the letter displayed on a table for anyone to read.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bate p. 257&quot;/&gt;

The ''Dictionary'' was finally published in April 1755, with the title page acknowledging that Oxford had awarded Johnson a Master of Arts degree in anticipation of the work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1977|pp=256, 318}}&lt;/ref&gt; The published dictionary was a huge book. Its pages were nearly {{convert|18|in|cm|0}} tall, and the book was {{convert|20|in|cm|0}} wide when opened; it contained 42,773 entries, to which only a few more were added in subsequent editions, and sold for the extravagant price of £4 10s, perhaps the rough equivalent of £350 today.&lt;ref name=CC&gt;{{citation|chapter=Currency Converter|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/currency/|title=The National Archives|place= Kew, Richmond, Surrey|accessdate=24 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; An important innovation in English lexicography was to illustrate the meanings of his words by literary quotation, of which there are around 114,000. The authors most frequently cited include [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], [[John Milton|Milton]] and [[John Dryden|Dryden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lynch|2003|pp=8–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was years before &quot;Johnson's Dictionary&quot;, as it came to be known, turned a profit. Author's royalties were unknown at that time, and Johnson, once his contract to deliver the book was fulfilled, received no further money from its sale. Years later, many of its quotations would be repeated by various editions of the ''[[Webster's Dictionary]]'' and the ''[[New English Dictionary]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1955|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides working on the ''Dictionary'', Johnson also wrote various essays, sermons, and poems during these nine years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lane|1975|p=113}}&lt;/ref&gt; He decided to produce a series of essays under the title ''[[The Rambler]]'' that would run every Tuesday and Saturday for twopence each. Explaining the title years later, he told his friend, the painter [[Joshua Reynolds]]: &quot;I was at a loss how to name it. I sat down at night upon my bedside, and resolved that I would not go to sleep till I had fixed its title. ''The Rambler'' seemed the best that occurred, and I took it&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lane p. 115&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Lane|1975|p=115}}&lt;/ref&gt; These essays, often on moral topics, tended to be more grave than the title of the series would suggest; his first comments in ''The Rambler'' were to ask &quot;that in this undertaking thy Holy Spirit may not be withheld from me, but that I may promote thy glory, and the salvation of myself and others&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lane p. 115&quot;/&gt; The popularity of ''The Rambler'' took off once the issues were collected as a volume; they were reprinted nine times during Johnson's life. Writer and printer [[Samuel Richardson]], enjoying the essays greatly, questioned the publisher as to who wrote the works; only he and a few of Johnson's friends were told of Johnson's authorship.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lane p. 116&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Lane|1975|p=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; One friend, the novelist [[Charlotte Lennox]], includes a defence of ''The Rambler'' in her novel ''The Female Quixote'' (1752). In particular, the character Mr. Glanville says, &quot;you may sit in Judgment upon the Productions of a ''Young'', a ''Richardson'', or a ''Johnson''. Rail with premeditated Malice at the ''Rambler''; and for the want of Faults, turn even its inimitable Beauties into Ridicule&quot; (Book VI, Chapter XI). Later, she claims Johnson as &quot;the greatest Genius in the present Age&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lynn|1997|p=241}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote box|quoted=yes|width=25em|quote=His necessary attendance while his play was in rehearsal, and during its performance, brought him acquainted with many of the performers of both sexes, which produced a more favourable opinion of their profession than he had harshly expressed in his Life of Savage&amp;nbsp;... He for considerable time used to frequent the Green Room, and seemed to take delight in dissipating his gloom, by mixing in the sprightly chit-chat of the motley circle then to be found there. Mr David Hume related to me from Mr Garrick, that Johnson at last denied himself this amusement, from considerations of rigid virtue; saying, &quot;I'll come no more behind your scenes, David; for the silk stockings and white bosoms of your actresses excite my amorous propensities&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Boswell|1986|p=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, not all of his work was confined to ''The Rambler''. His most highly regarded poem, ''[[The Vanity of Human Wishes]]'', was written with such &quot;extraordinary speed&quot; that [[James Boswell|Boswell]] claimed Johnson &quot;might have been perpetually a poet&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bate Achievement p. 22&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1955|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The poem is an imitation of [[Juvenal]]'s ''[[Satires of Juvenal#Satire X: Wrong Desire is the Source of Suffering|Satire X]]'' and claims that &quot;the antidote to vain human wishes is non-vain spiritual wishes&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Weinbrot|1997|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, Johnson emphasises &quot;the helpless vulnerability of the individual before the social context&quot; and the &quot;inevitable self-deception by which human beings are led astray&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1977|p=281}}&lt;/ref&gt; The poem was critically celebrated but it failed to become popular, and sold less than ''London''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lane|1975|pp=113–114}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1749, Garrick made good on his promise that he would produce ''Irene'', but its title was altered to ''[[Irene (play)#Stage history|Mahomet and Irene]]'' to make it &quot;fit for the stage&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lane p. 114&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Lane|1975|p=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show eventually ran for nine nights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1955|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tetty Johnson spent most of her time in London ill, and in 1752 she decided to return to the countryside while Johnson was busy working on his ''Dictionary''. She died on 17 March 1752, and, at word of her death, Johnson wrote a letter to his old friend Taylor, which according to Taylor &quot;expressed grief in the strongest manner he had ever read&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1977|pp=272–273}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote a sermon in her honour, to be read at her funeral, but Taylor refused to read it, for reasons which are unknown. This only exacerbated Johnson's feelings of being lost, and his despair after the death of his wife, and [[John Hawkesworth (book editor)|John Hawkesworth]] had to take over organising the funeral. Johnson felt guilty about the poverty in which he believed he had forced Tetty to live, and blamed himself for neglecting her. He became outwardly discontent, and his diary was filled with prayers and laments over her death until his own. She was his primary motivation, and her death hindered his ability to complete his work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1977|pp=273–275}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 March 1756, Johnson was arrested for an outstanding debt of £5 18[[Shilling|s]]. Unable to contact anyone else, he wrote to the writer and publisher [[Samuel Richardson]]. Richardson, who had previously lent Johnson money, sent him six guineas to show his good will, and the two became friends.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bate p. 321&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1977|p=321}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after, Johnson met and befriended the painter [[Joshua Reynolds]], who so impressed Johnson that he declared him &quot;almost the only man whom I call a friend&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1977|p=324}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reynolds' younger sister Frances observed during their time together &quot;that men, women and children gathered around him [Johnson]&quot;, laughing at his gestures and gesticulations.&lt;ref name=Murray1611&gt;{{Harvnb|Murray|1979|p=1611}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to Reynolds, Johnson was close to [[Bennet Langton]] and [[Arthur Murphy (writer)|Arthur Murphy]]. Langton was a scholar and an admirer of Johnson who persuaded his way into a meeting with Johnson which led to a long friendship. Johnson met Murphy during the summer of 1754 after Murphy came to Johnson about the accidental republishing of the ''Rambler'' No. 190, and the two became friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1977|pp=322–323}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around this time, [[Anna Williams (poet)|Anna Williams]] began boarding with Johnson. She was a minor poet who was poor and becoming blind, two conditions that Johnson attempted to change by providing room for her and paying for a failed cataract surgery. Williams, in turn, became Johnson's housekeeper.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Martin|2008|p=319}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{The Club|caption=A literary party, 1781, of Johnson (second from left) and other [[The Club (Literary Club)#Members|members of &quot;The Club&quot;]].|align=left|size=220px}}
To occupy himself, Johnson began to work on ''The Literary Magazine, or Universal Review'', the first issue of which was printed on 19 March 1756. Philosophical disagreements erupted over the purpose of the publication when the [[Seven Years' War]] began and Johnson started to write polemical essays attacking the war. After the war began, the ''Magazine'' included many reviews, at least 34 of which were written by Johnson.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bate p. 328&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1977|p=328}}&lt;/ref&gt; When not working on the ''Magazine'', Johnson wrote a series of prefaces for other writers, such as [[Giuseppe Baretti]], [[William Payne]] and [[Charlotte Lennox]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1977|p=329}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson's relationship with Lennox and her works was particularly close during these years, and she in turn relied so heavily upon Johnson that he was &quot;the most important single fact in Mrs Lennox's literary life&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Clarke|2000|pp=221–222}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later attempted to produce a new edition of her works, but even with his support they were unable to find enough interest to follow through with its publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Clarke|2000|pp=223–224}}&lt;/ref&gt; To help with domestic duties while Johnson was busy with his various projects, Richard Bathurst, a physician and a member of Johnson's Club, pressured him to take on a freed slave, [[Francis Barber]], as his servant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1977|pp=325–326}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Johnson's work on ''[[The Plays of William Shakespeare|Edition of Shakespeare]]'' took up most of his time. On 8 June 1756, Johnson published his ''[[The Plays of William Shakespeare#Proposal|Proposals for Printing, by Subscription, the Dramatick Works of William Shakespeare]]'', which argued that previous editions of Shakespeare were edited incorrectly and needed to be corrected.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bate p. 330&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1977|p=330}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Johnson's progress on the work slowed as the months passed, and he told music historian [[Charles Burney]] in December 1757 that it would take him until the following March to complete it. Before that could happen, he was arrested again, for a debt of £40, in February 1758. The debt was soon repaid by Jacob Tonson, who had contracted Johnson to publish ''Shakespeare'', and this encouraged Johnson to finish his edition to repay the favour. Although it took him another seven years to finish, Johnson completed a few volumes of his ''Shakespeare'' to prove his commitment to the project.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bate p. 332&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1977|p=332}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1758, Johnson began to write a weekly series, ''The Idler'', which ran from 15 April 1758 to 5 April 1760, as a way to avoid finishing his ''Shakespeare''. This series was shorter and lacked many features of ''The Rambler''. Unlike his independent publication of ''The Rambler'', ''The Idler'' was published in a weekly news journal ''The Universal Chronicle'', a publication supported by John Payne, [[John Newbery]], Robert Stevens and William Faden.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bate p. 334&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1977|p=334}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since ''The Idler'' did not occupy all Johnson's time, he was able to publish his philosophical novella ''[[The History of Rasselas, Prince of Abissinia|Rasselas]]'' on 19 April 1759. The &quot;little story book&quot;, as Johnson described it, describes the life of Prince Rasselas and Nekayah, his sister, who are kept in a place called the Happy Valley in the land of Abyssinia. The Valley is a place free of problems, where any desire is quickly satisfied. The constant pleasure does not, however, lead to satisfaction; and, with the help of a philosopher named Imlac, Rasselas escapes and explores the world to witness how all aspects of society and life in the outside world are filled with suffering. They return to Abyssinia, but do not wish to return to the state of constantly fulfilled pleasures found in the Happy Valley.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1977|pp=337–338}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Rasselas'' was written in one week to pay for his mother's funeral and settle her debts; it became so popular that there was a new English edition of the work almost every year. References to it appear in many later works of fiction, including ''[[Jane Eyre]]'', ''[[Cranford (novel)|Cranford]]'' and ''[[The House of the Seven Gables]]''. Its fame was not limited to English-speaking nations: ''Rasselas'' was immediately translated into five languages (French, Dutch, German, Russian and Italian), and later into nine others.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bate p. 337&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1977|p=337}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:James Boswell.jpg|thumb|upright|[[James Boswell]] at 25]]

By 1762, however, Johnson had gained notoriety for his dilatoriness in writing; the contemporary poet [[Charles Churchill (satirist)|Churchill]] teased Johnson for the delay in producing his long-promised edition of Shakespeare: &quot;He for subscribers baits his hook / and takes your cash, but where's the book?&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bate p. 391&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1977|p=391}}&lt;/ref&gt; The comments soon motivated Johnson to finish his ''Shakespeare'', and, after receiving the first payment from a government pension on 20 July 1762, he was able to dedicate most of his time towards this goal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bate p. 391&quot;/&gt; Earlier that July, the 24-year-old King [[George III]] granted Johnson an annual pension of £300 in appreciation for the ''Dictionary''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bate Achievement p. 36&quot;/&gt; While the pension did not make Johnson wealthy, it did allow him a modest yet comfortable independence for the remaining 22 years of his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1977|p=356}}&lt;/ref&gt; The award came largely through the efforts of [[Thomas Sheridan (actor)|Sheridan]] and the [[John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute|Earl of Bute]]. When Johnson questioned if the pension would force him to promote a political agenda or support various officials, he was told by Bute that the pension &quot;is not given you for anything you are to do, but for what you have done&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bate p. 354-356&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Boswell|1986|pp=354–356}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 May 1763, Johnson first met 22-year-old [[James Boswell]]—who would later become Johnson's first major biographer—in the bookshop of Johnson's friend, Tom Davies. They quickly became friends, although Boswell would return to his home in Scotland or travel abroad for months at a time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bate p. 360&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1977|p=360}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around the spring of 1763, Johnson formed &quot;[[The Club (dining club)|The Club]]&quot;, a social group that included his friends Reynolds, [[Edmund Burke|Burke]], Garrick, [[Oliver Goldsmith|Goldsmith]] and others (the membership later expanded to include [[Adam Smith]] and [[Edward Gibbon]]). They decided to meet every Monday at 7:00&amp;nbsp;pm at the Turk's Head in Gerrard Street, [[Soho]], and these meetings continued until long after the deaths of the original members.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bate p. 366&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1977|p=366}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote box|quoted=yes|width=25em|align=left|quote=During the whole of the interview, Johnson talked to his Majesty with profound respect, but still in his firm manly manner, with a sonorous voice, and never in that subdued tone which is commonly used at the levee and in the drawing-room. After the King withdrew, Johnson shewed himself highly pleased with his Majesty's conversation and gracious behaviour. He said to Mr Barnard, 'Sir, they may talk of the King as they will; but he is the finest gentleman I have ever seen.'&lt;ref name=&quot;Boswell p. 135&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Boswell|1986|p= 135}}&lt;/ref&gt;|source=Boswell's ''Life of Samuel Johnson''}}

On 9 January 1765, Murphy introduced Johnson to [[Henry Thrale]], a wealthy brewer and [[Member of Parliament|MP]], and his wife [[Hester Thrale|Hester]]. They struck up an instant friendship; Johnson was treated as a member of the family, and was once more motivated to continue working on his ''Shakespeare''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bate p. 393&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1977|p=393}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, Johnson stayed with the Thrales for 17 years until Henry's death in 1781, sometimes staying in rooms at Thrale's [[Anchor Brewery, Southwark|Anchor Brewery]] in [[Southwark]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wain|1974|p=262}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hester Thrale's documentation of Johnson's life during this time, in her correspondence and her diary (''[[Thraliana]]''), became an important source of biographical information on Johnson after his death.&lt;ref name=&quot;Keymer p. 186&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Keymer|1999|p=186}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnson's edition of ''Shakespeare'' was finally published on 10 October 1765 as ''The Plays of William Shakespeare, in Eight Volumes&amp;nbsp;... To which are added Notes by Sam. Johnson'' in a printing of one thousand copies. The first edition quickly sold out, and a second was soon printed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bate p. 395&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1977|p=395}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plays themselves were in a version that Johnson felt most true to the original based on his analysis of the manuscript editions. Johnson's revolutionary innovation was to create a set of corresponding notes that allow readers to identify the meaning behind many of Shakespeare's more complicated passages or ones that may have been transcribed incorrectly over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1977|p=397}}&lt;/ref&gt; Included within the notes are occasional attacks upon rival editors of Shakespeare's works and their editions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wain|1974|p=194}}&lt;/ref&gt; Years later, [[Edmond Malone]], an important Shakespearean scholar and friend of Johnson's, stated that Johnson's &quot;vigorous and comprehensive understanding threw more light on his authour than all his predecessors had done&quot;.&lt;!-- NOTE: &quot;authour&quot; is the sourced spelling--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1977|p=396}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1767 Johnson was granted a special meeting with King George III. This took place at the library of the Queen's house, and it was organised by [[Frederick Augusta Barnard|Barnard]], the King's librarian.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boswell p. 133&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Boswell|1986|p= 133}}&lt;/ref&gt; The King, hearing that Johnson would visit the library, commanded Barnard to introduce him to Johnson.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Boswell|1986|p= 134}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a short meeting, Johnson was impressed with both the King himself and their conversation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boswell p. 135&quot;/&gt;

On 6 August 1773, eleven years after first meeting [[James Boswell|Boswell]], Johnson set out to visit his friend in Scotland, to begin &quot;a journey to the western islands of Scotland&quot;, as Johnson's 1775 account of their travels would put it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1977|p=463}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work was intended to discuss the social problems and struggles that affected the Scottish people, but it also praised many of the unique facets of Scottish society, such as a school in Edinburgh for the deaf and mute.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1977|p=471}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, Johnson used the work to enter into the dispute over the authenticity of [[James Macpherson]]'s [[Ossian]] poems, claiming they could not have been translations of ancient Scottish literature on the grounds that &quot;in those times nothing had been written in the Earse [i.e. Gaelic] language&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Johnson|1970|pp=104–105}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were heated exchanges between the two, and according to one of Johnson's letters, MacPherson threatened physical violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wain|1974|p=331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boswell's account, ''[[The Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides]]'' (1786), was a preliminary attempt at a biography before his ''[[Life of Johnson]]''. Included were various quotes and descriptions of events, including anecdotes such as Johnson swinging around a broadsword while wearing Scottish garb, or dancing a Highland jig.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1977|pp=468–469}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1770s, Johnson, who had tended to be an opponent of the government early in life, published a series of pamphlets in favour of various government policies. In 1770 he produced ''The False Alarm'', a political pamphlet attacking [[John Wilkes]]. In 1771, his ''Thoughts on the Late Transactions Respecting Falkland's Islands'' cautioned against war with Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1977|pp=443–445}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1774 he printed ''The Patriot'', a critique of what he viewed as false patriotism. On the evening of 7 April 1775, he made the famous statement, &quot;Patriotism is the last refuge of the scoundrel.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Boswell|1996|p=182}}&lt;/ref&gt; This line was not, as widely believed, about patriotism in general, but the false use of the term &quot;patriotism&quot; by [[John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute]] (the patriot-minister) and his supporters; Johnson opposed &quot;self-professed Patriots&quot; in general, but valued what he considered &quot;true&quot; patriotism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Griffin p. 21&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Griffin|2005|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The last of these pamphlets, ''Taxation No Tyranny'' (1775), was a defence of the [[Coercive Acts]] and a response to the [[Declaration and Resolves of the First Continental Congress|Declaration of Rights]] of the [[First Continental Congress]] of America, which protested against [[No taxation without representation|taxation without representation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1977|p=446}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson argued that in emigrating to America, colonists had &quot;voluntarily resigned the power of voting&quot;, but they still had &quot;[[virtual representation]]&quot; in Parliament. In a parody of the Declaration of Rights, Johnson suggested that the Americans had no more right to govern themselves than the [[Cornish people]], and asked &quot;How is it that we hear the loudest ''yelps'' for liberty among the drivers of negroes?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;
Johnson, Samuel, TAXATION NO TYRANNY; An answer to the resolutions and address of the American congress (1775)&lt;/ref&gt; If the Americans wanted to participate in Parliament, said Johnson, they could move to England and purchase an estate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ammerman|1974|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson denounced English supporters of American separatists as &quot;traitors to this country&quot;, and hoped that the matter would be settled without bloodshed, but that it would end with &quot;English superiority and American obedience&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|DeMaria|1994|pp=252–256}}&lt;/ref&gt; Years before, Johnson had advocated that the English and the French were just &quot;two robbers&quot; who were stealing land from the natives, and that neither deserved to live there.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bate p. 328&quot;/&gt; After the signing of the [[Peace of Paris (1783)|1783 Peace of Paris]] treaties, marking the colonists' defeat of the British, Johnson was &quot;deeply disturbed&quot; with the &quot;state of this kingdom&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Griffin|2005|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote box|quoted=yes|width=25em|align=left|quote=Mr Thrale's death was a very essential loss to Johnson, who, although he did not foresee all that afterwards happened, was sufficiently convinced that the comforts which Mr Thrale's family afforded him, would now in great measure cease.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boswell p. 273&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Boswell|1986|p= 273}}&lt;/ref&gt;|source=Boswell's ''Life of Samuel Johnson''}}

On 3 May 1777, while Johnson was trying to save [[William Dodd (clergyman)|Reverend William Dodd]] from execution, he wrote to Boswell that he was busy preparing a &quot;little Lives&quot; and &quot;little Prefaces, to a little edition of the English Poets&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1977|p=525}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tom Davies, William Strahan and Thomas Cadell had asked Johnson to create this final major work, the ''[[Lives of the English Poets]]'', for which he asked 200 guineas, an amount significantly less than the price he could have demanded.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bate p. 526&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1977|p=526}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Lives'', which were critical as well as biographical studies, appeared as prefaces to selections of each poet's work, and they were quite larger than originally expected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1977|p=527}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work was finished in March 1781 and the whole collection was published in six volumes. As Johnson justified in the advertisement for the work, &quot;my purpose was only to have allotted to every Poet an Advertisement, like those which we find in the French Miscellanies, containing a few dates and a general character.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Clingham|1997|p=161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnson was unable to enjoy this success because [[Henry Thrale]], the dear friend with whom he lived, died on 4 April 1781.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1977|pp=546–547}}&lt;/ref&gt; Life changed quickly for Johnson, and [[Hester Thrale]] became interested in the Italian singing teacher Gabriel Mario Piozzi, which forced Johnson to move on from his previous lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1977|pp=557,&amp;nbsp;561}}&lt;/ref&gt; After returning home and then travelling for a short period, Johnson received word that his friend and tenant [[Robert Levet]], had died on 17 January 1782.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1977|p=562}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson was shocked by the death of Levet, who had resided at Johnson's London home since 1762.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://books.google.com/?id=qXHv5EClgZgC&amp;pg=PA231&amp;lpg=PA231&amp;dq=wakefield+levett|title= The Samuel Johnson Encyclopedia|author=Rogers, Pat|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|location= Westport, CT|year=1996|isbn=978-0-313-29411-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly afterwards Johnson caught a cold which turned into bronchitis, lasting for several months, and his health was further complicated by &quot;feeling forlorn and lonely&quot; by Levet's death being accompanied by the deaths of Johnson's friend Thomas Lawrence and his housekeeper Williams.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Martin|2008|pp=501–502}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Final years===
[[Image:Hester Thrale.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Grandly dressed woman, seated, with her daughter kneeling on her right|[[Hester Thrale]] and her daughter Queeney]]

Although he had recovered his health by August, he experienced emotional trauma when he was given word that Hester Thrale would sell the residence that Johnson shared with the family. What hurt Johnson the most was the possibility that he would be left without her constant company.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bate p. 566&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1977|p=566}}&lt;/ref&gt; Months later, on 6 October 1782, Johnson attended church for the final time in his life, to say goodbye to his former residence and life. The walk to the church strained him, but he managed the journey unaccompanied.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bate p. 569&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1977|p=569}}&lt;/ref&gt; While there, he wrote a prayer for the Thrale family:

{{quote|To thy fatherly protection, O Lord, I commend this family. Bless, guide, and defend them, that they may pass through this world, as finally to enjoy in thy presence everlasting happiness, for Jesus Christ's sake. Amen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Boswell|1986|p=284}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Hester Thrale did not completely abandon Johnson, and asked him to accompany the family on a trip to Brighton.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bate p. 569&quot;/&gt; He agreed, and was with them from 7 October until 20 November 1782.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1977|p=570}}&lt;/ref&gt; On his return, his health began to fail him, and he was left alone following [[James Boswell|Boswell]]'s visit on 29 May 1783 until he travelled to Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1977|p=575}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 June 1783, Johnson's poor circulation resulted in a stroke&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wiltshire|1991|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he wrote to his neighbour, Edmund Allen, that he had lost the ability to speak.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Watkins|1960|p=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two doctors were brought in to aid Johnson; he regained his ability to speak two days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Watkins|1960|pp=71–72}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson feared that he was dying, and referring to his struggle with depression, which he and the Thrales called &quot;the black dog&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;blackdoginstitute&quot;&gt;http://www.blackdoginstitute.org.au/docs/McKinlay.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; wrote:

{{quote|The black dog I hope always to resist, and in time to drive, though I am deprived of almost all those that used to help me. The neighbourhood is impoverished. I had once Richardson and Lawrence in my reach. Mrs. Allen is dead. My house has lost Levet, a man who took interest in everything, and therefore ready at conversation. Mrs. Williams is so weak that she can be a companion no longer. When I rise my breakfast is solitary, the black dog waits to share it, from breakfast to dinner he continues barking, except that Dr. Brocklesby for a little keeps him at a distance. Dinner with a sick woman you may venture to suppose not much better than solitary. After dinner, what remains but to count the clock, and hope for that sleep which I can scarce expect. Night comes at last, and some hours of restlessness and confusion bring me again to a day of solitude. What shall exclude the black dog from an habitation like this?&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Watkins|1960|p=72}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
By this time he was sick and [[gout]]-ridden. He had surgery for gout, and his remaining friends, including novelist [[Frances Burney|Fanny Burney]] (the daughter of Charles Burney), came to keep him company.&lt;ref name=&quot;Watkins p.73&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Watkins|1960|p=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was confined to his room from 14 December 1783 to 21 April 1784.&lt;ref name=&quot;Watkins p.74&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Watkins|1960|p=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His health had begun to improve by May 1784, and he travelled to Oxford with Boswell on 5 May 1784.&lt;ref name=&quot;Watkins p.74&quot;/&gt; By July, many of Johnson's friends were either dead or gone; Boswell had left for Scotland and Hester Thrale had become engaged to Piozzi. With nobody to visit, Johnson expressed a desire to die in London and arrived there on 16 November 1784. On 25 November 1784, he allowed Burney to visit him and expressed an interest to her that he should leave London; he soon left for [[Islington]], to George Strahan's home.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Watkins|1960|pp=76–77}}&lt;/ref&gt; His final moments were filled with mental anguish and delusions; when his physician, Thomas Warren, visited and asked him if he were feeling better, Johnson burst out with: &quot;No, Sir; you cannot conceive with what acceleration I advance towards death.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Watkins p.78&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Watkins|1960|p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote box|quoted=yes|width=25em|align=left|quote=A few days before his death, he had asked Sir John Hawkins, as one of his executors, where he should be buried; and on being answered, &quot;Doubtless, in Westminster Abbey,&quot; seemed to feel a satisfaction, very natural to a Poet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Boswell|1986|p=341}}&lt;/ref&gt;|source=Boswell's ''Life of Samuel Johnson''}}

Many visitors came to see Johnson as he lay sick in bed, but he preferred only Langton's company.&lt;ref name=&quot;Watkins p.78&quot;/&gt; Burney waited for word of Johnson's condition, along with Windham, Strahan, Hoole, Cruikshank, Des Moulins and Barber.&lt;ref name=&quot;Watkins p.79&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Watkins|1960|p=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 December 1784, Johnson met with two others: a young woman, Miss Morris, whom Johnson blessed, and Francesco Sastres, an Italian teacher, who was given some of Johnson's final words: &quot;''Iam Moriturus''&quot; (&quot;I who am about to die&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;Bate p. 599&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1977|p=599}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly afterwards he fell into a coma, and died at 7:00&amp;nbsp;pm.&lt;ref name=&quot;Watkins p.79&quot;/&gt;

Langton waited until 11:00&amp;nbsp;pm to tell the others, which led to John Hawkins' becoming pale and overcome with &quot;an agony of mind&quot;, along with Seward and Hoole describing Johnson's death as &quot;the most awful sight&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hill|1897|p=160 (Vol. 2)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boswell remarked, &quot;My feeling was just one large expanse of Stupor&amp;nbsp;... I could not believe it. My imagination was not convinced.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bate p. 599&quot;/&gt; [[William Gerard Hamilton]] joined in and stated, &quot;He has made a chasm, which not only nothing can fill up, but which ''nothing has a tendency to fill up''. -Johnson is dead.- Let us go to the next best: There is nobody; -''no man can be said to put you in mind of Johnson''.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Watkins p.79&quot;/&gt;

==Critical theory==
{{Main|Samuel Johnson's literary criticism}}

[[Image:Vanity of Human Wishes.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=&quot;&quot;|''The Vanity of Human Wishes'' (1749) title page]]

Johnson's works, especially his ''Lives of the Poets'' series, describe various features of excellent writing. He believed that the best poetry relied on contemporary language, and he disliked the use of decorative or purposefully archaic language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Needham|1982|pp=95–96}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, he was suspicious of the poetic language used by Milton, whose [[blank verse]] he believed would inspire many bad imitations, but he later praised ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' as &quot;a poem which...with respect to design may claim the first place, and with respect to performance, the second, among the productions of the human mind&quot;.  Johnson opposed the poetic language of his contemporary [[Thomas Gray]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Greene|1989|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; His greatest complaint was that obscure allusions found in works like Milton's ''Lycidas'' were overused; he preferred poetry that could be easily read and understood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Greene|1989|pp=28–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to his views on language, Johnson believed that a good poem incorporated new and unique imagery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Greene|1989|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his smaller poetic works, Johnson relied on short lines and filled his work with a feeling of empathy, which possibly influenced [[Housman]]'s poetic style.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Greene|1989|pp=31, 34}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''London'', his first imitation of Juvenal, Johnson uses the poetic form to express his political opinion and, as befits a young writer, approaches the topic in a playful and almost joyous manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Greene|1989|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, his second imitation, ''The Vanity of Human Wishes'', is completely different; the language remains simple, but the poem is more complicated and difficult to read because Johnson is trying to describe complex Christian ethics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Greene|1989|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; These Christian values are not unique to the poem, but contain views expressed in most of Johnson's works. In particular, Johnson emphasises God's infinite love and shows that happiness can be attained through virtuous action.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Greene|1989|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Apollo and the muses, inflicting penance on Dr Pomposo, round Parnassus' (Samuel Johnson) by James Gillray.jpg|left|thumb|A caricature of Johnson by [[James Gillray]] mocking him for his literary criticism; he is shown doing penance for [[Apollo]] and the [[Muse]]s with [[Mount Parnassus]] in the background.]]
When it came to biography, Johnson disagreed with [[Plutarch]]'s use of biography to praise and to teach morality. Instead, Johnson believed in portraying the biographical subjects accurately and including any negative aspects of their lives. Because his insistence on accuracy in biography was little short of revolutionary, Johnson had to struggle against a society that was unwilling to accept biographical details that could be viewed as tarnishing a reputation; this became the subject of ''Rambler'' 60.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Greene|1989|pp=62–64}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Johnson believed that biography should not be limited to the most famous and that the lives of lesser individuals, too, were significant;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Greene|1989|p=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus in his ''Lives of the Poets'' he chose both great and lesser poets. In all his biographies he insisted on including what others would have considered trivial details to fully describe the lives of his subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Greene|1989|p=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson considered the genre of autobiography and diaries, including his own, as one having the most significance; in ''Idler'' 84 he explains how a writer of an autobiography would be the least likely to distort his own life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Greene|1989|p=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnson's thoughts on biography and on poetry coalesced in his understanding of what would make a good critic. His works were dominated with his intent to use them for literary criticism. This was especially true of his ''Dictionary'' of which he wrote: &quot;I lately published a Dictionary like those compiled by the academies of Italy and France, ''for the use of such as aspire to exactness of criticism, or elegance of style''&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Greene|1989|p=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although a smaller edition of his ''Dictionary'' became the standard household dictionary, Johnson's original ''Dictionary'' was an academic tool that examined how words were used, especially in literary works. To achieve this purpose, Johnson included quotations from Bacon, Hooker, Milton, Shakespeare, Spenser, and many others from what he considered to be the most important literary fields: natural science, philosophy, poetry, and theology. These quotations and usages were all compared and carefully studied in the ''Dictionary'' so that a reader could understand what words in literary works meant in context.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Greene|1989|pp=134–135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Plays of Shakespeare title page.jpg|thumb|right|upright|alt=&quot;&quot;|''Plays of William Shakespeare'' (1773 expanded edition) title page]]
Johnson did not attempt to create schools of theories to analyse the aesthetics of literature. Instead, he used his criticism for the practical purpose of helping others to better read and understand literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Greene|1989|p=140}}&lt;/ref&gt; When it came to Shakespeare's plays, Johnson emphasised the role of the reader in understanding language: &quot;If Shakespeare has difficulties above other writers, it is to be imputed to the nature of his work, which required the use of common colloquial language, and consequently admitted many phrases allusive, elliptical, and proverbial, such as we speak and hear every hour without observing them&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Green p. 141&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Greene|1989|p=141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His works on Shakespeare were devoted not merely to Shakespeare, but to understanding literature as a whole; in his ''Preface'' to Shakespeare, Johnson rejects the previous dogma of the [[classical unities]] and argues that drama should be faithful to life.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greene p. 142&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Greene|1989|p=142}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Johnson did not only defend Shakespeare; he discussed Shakespeare's faults, including his lack of morality, his vulgarity, his carelessness in crafting plots, and his occasional inattentiveness when choosing words or word order.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Needham|1982|p=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; As well as direct literary criticism, Johnson emphasised the need to establish a text that accurately reflects what an author wrote. Shakespeare's plays, in particular, had multiple editions, each of which contained errors caused by the printing process. This problem was compounded by careless editors who deemed difficult words incorrect, and changed them in later editions. Johnson believed that an editor should not alter the text in such a way.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Greene|1989|p=143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote box|quoted=yes|width=25em|quote=After we came out of the church, we stood talking for some time together of Bishop Berkeley's ingenious sophistry to prove the non-existence of matter, and that every thing in the universe is merely ideal.

Johnson's tall and robust figure combined with his odd gestures were confusing to some; when [[William Hogarth]] first saw Johnson standing near a window in [[Samuel Richardson]]'s house, &quot;shaking his head and rolling himself about in a strange ridiculous manner&quot;, Hogarth thought Johnson an &quot;ideot, whom his relations had put under the care of Mr. Richardson&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bate Achievement p. 16&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1955|p=16 quoting from Boswell}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hogarth was quite surprised when &quot;this figure stalked forwards to where he and Mr. Richardson were sitting and all at once took up the argument&amp;nbsp;... [with] such a power of eloquence, that Hogarth looked at him with astonishment, and actually imagined that this ideot had been at the moment inspired&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bate Achievement p. 16&quot;/&gt; Not everyone was misled by Johnson's appearance; [[Adam Smith]] claimed that &quot;Johnson knew more books than any man alive&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Hill p. 423b&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Hill|1897|p=423 (Vol. 2)}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Edmund Burke thought that if Johnson were to join Parliament, he &quot;certainly would have been the greatest speaker that ever was there&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1955|pp=15–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson relied on a unique form of rhetoric, and he is well known for his &quot;refutation&quot; of [[George Berkeley|Bishop Berkeley's]] [[immaterialism]], his claim that matter did not actually exist but only seemed to exist:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1977|p=316}}&lt;/ref&gt; during a conversation with [[James Boswell|Boswell]], Johnson powerfully stomped a nearby stone and proclaimed of Berkeley's theory, &quot;I refute it ''thus''!&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Boswell p. 122&quot;/&gt;

Johnson was a devout, conservative [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] and a compassionate man who supported a number of poor friends under his own roof, even when unable to fully provide for himself.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bate Achievement p. 36&quot;/&gt; Johnson's Christian morality permeated his works, and he would write on moral topics with such authority and in such a trusting manner that, Walter Jackson Bate claims, &quot;no other moralist in history excels or even begins to rival him&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1977|p=297}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Johnson's moral writings do not contain, as [[Donald Greene]] points out, &quot;a predetermined and authori&lt;!-- quote --&gt;zed pattern of 'good behav&lt;!-- quote --&gt;ior{{' &quot;}}, even though Johnson does emphasise certain kinds of conduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Greene|1989|p=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; He did not let his own faith prejudice him against others, and had respect for those of other denominations who demonstrated a commitment to Christ's teachings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Greene|1989|p=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Johnson respected [[John Milton]]'s poetry, he could not tolerate Milton's Puritan and Republican beliefs, feeling that they were contrary to England and Christianity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bate p. 537&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1977|p=537}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was an opponent of slavery on moral grounds, and once proposed a toast to the &quot;next rebellion of the negroes in the West Indies&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Boswell|1986|p=200}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beside his beliefs concerning humanity, Johnson is also known for his love of cats,&lt;ref name=&quot;Skargon&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Skargon|1999|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially his own two cats, [[Hodge (cat)|Hodge]] and Lily.&lt;ref name=&quot;Skargon&quot;/&gt; Boswell wrote, &quot;I never shall forget the indulgence with which he treated Hodge, his cat.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Boswell|1986|p=294}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnson was also known as a staunch [[Tory]]; he admitted to sympathies for the [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] cause during his younger years but, by the reign of [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]], he came to accept the [[Act of Settlement 1701|Hanoverian Succession]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bate p. 537&quot;/&gt; It was Boswell who gave people the impression that Johnson was an &quot;arch-conservative&quot;, and it was Boswell, more than anyone else, who determined how Johnson would be seen by people years later. However, Boswell was not around for two of Johnson's most politically active periods: during Walpole's control over British Parliament and during the Seven Years' War. Although Boswell was present with Johnson during the 1770s and describes four major pamphlets written by Johnson, he neglects to discuss them because he is more interested in their travels to Scotland. This is compounded by the fact that Boswell held an opinion contradictory to two of these pamphlets, ''The False Alarm'' and ''Taxation No Tyranny'', and so attacks Johnson's views in his biography.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Greene|2000|p=xxi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ''Life of Samuel Johnson'' Boswell referred to Johnson as ‘Dr. Johnson’ so often that he would always be known as such, albeit he hated being called so. Boswell's emphasis on Johnson's later years shows him too often as merely an old man discoursing in a tavern to a circle of admirers, though this depiction is appealing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Boswell|1986|p=365}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Boswell, a Scotsman, was a close companion and friend to Johnson during many important times of his life, like many of his fellow Englishmen Johnson had a reputation for despising Scotland and its people. Even during their journey together through Scotland, Johnson &quot;exhibited prejudice and a narrow nationalism&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rogers|1995|p=192}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hester Thrale, in summarising Johnson's nationalistic views and his anti-Scottish prejudice, said: &quot;We all know how well he loved to abuse the Scotch, &amp; indeed to be abused by them in return.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Piozzi|1951|p=165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health==
{{Main|Samuel Johnson's health}}
Johnson had several health problems, including childhood [[scrofula|tuberculous scrofula]], [[gout]], [[testicular cancer]], and a stroke in his final year that left him unable to speak; his autopsy indicated that he had [[pulmonary fibrosis]] along with [[cardiac failure]] probably due to [[hypertension]], a condition then unknown. Although Johnson overall was probably as healthy as others of his generation,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Murray|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; he displayed signs consistent with several diagnoses, including depression and [[Tourette syndrome]] (TS).

There are many accounts of Johnson suffering from bouts of depression and what Johnson thought might be madness.  Johnson and the Thrales later referred to these bouts of melancholy as appearances of a sinister &quot;black dog&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;R. W. Chapman, ed., ''The Letters of Samuel Johnson, II: 1775-1782'', London: Oxford University Press, 1952, p. 314 &lt;/ref&gt; a metaphor later borrowed, and popularized, by similarly afflicted [[Winston Churchill]].&lt;ref name=&quot;blackdoginstitute&quot; /&gt; As Walter Jackson Bate puts it, &quot;one of the ironies of literary history is that its most compelling and authoritative symbol of common sense—of the strong, imaginative grasp of concrete reality—should have begun his adult life, at the age of twenty, in a state of such intense anxiety and bewildered despair that, at least from his own point of view, it seemed the onset of actual insanity&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1955|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; To overcome these feelings, Johnson tried to constantly involve himself with various activities, but this did not seem to help. Taylor said that Johnson &quot;at one time strongly entertained thoughts of Suicide&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bate p. 116&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1977|p=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boswell claimed that Johnson &quot;felt himself overwhelmed with an horrible melancholia, with perpetual irritation, fretfulness, and impatience; and with a dejection, gloom, and despair, which made existence misery&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bate p. 117&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1977|p=117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Johnson 1769.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Reynolds' 1769 portrait depicting Johnson's &quot;odd gesticulations&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lane|1975|p=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Early on, when Johnson was unable to pay off his debts, he began to work with professional writers and identified his own situation with theirs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pittock p. 159&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Pittock|2004|p=159}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, Johnson witnessed [[Christopher Smart]]'s decline into &quot;penury and the madhouse&quot;, and feared that he might share the same fate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pittock p. 159&quot;/&gt; [[Hester Thrale Piozzi]] claimed, in a discussion on Smart's mental state, that Johnson was her &quot;friend who feared an apple should intoxicate him&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Keymer p. 186&quot;/&gt; To Hester Thrale, what separated Johnson from others who were placed in asylums for madness—like Christopher Smart—was his ability to keep his concerns and emotions to himself.&lt;ref name=&quot;Keymer p. 186&quot;/&gt;

Two hundred years after Johnson's death, the posthumous diagnosis of Tourette syndrome became widely accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stern|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[History of Tourette syndrome|condition was unknown during Johnson's lifetime]], but Boswell describes Johnson [[Sociological and cultural aspects of Tourette syndrome#Samuel Johnson|displaying signs of TS]] including [[tic]]s and other involuntary movements.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pearce p. 396&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Pearce|1994|p=396}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Murray p. 1610&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Murray|1979|p=1610}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Boswell &quot;he commonly held his head to one side&amp;nbsp;... moving his body backwards and forwards, and rubbing his left knee in the same direction, with the palm of his hand&amp;nbsp;... [H]e made various sounds&quot; like &quot;a half whistle&quot; or &quot;as if clucking like a hen&quot;, and &quot;... all this accompanied sometimes with a thoughtful look, but more frequently with a smile. Generally when he had concluded a period, in the course of a dispute, by which time he was a good deal exhausted by violence and vociferation, he used to blow out his breath like a Whale.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hibbert p. 203&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Hibbert|1971|p=203}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many similar accounts; in particular, Johnson was said to &quot;perform his gesticulations&quot; at the threshold of a house or in doorways.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hibbert|1971|p=202}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked by a little girl why he made such noises and acted in that way, Johnson responded: &quot;From bad habit.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hibbert p. 203&quot;/&gt; The diagnosis of the syndrome was first made in a 1967 report,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McHenry|1967|pp=152–168}} and {{Harvnb|Wiltshire|1991|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and TS researcher [[Arthur K. Shapiro]] described Johnson as &quot;the most notable example of a successful adaptation to life despite the liability of Tourette syndrome&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shapiro|1978|p=361}}&lt;/ref&gt; Details provided by the writings of Boswell, Hester Thrale, and others reinforce the diagnosis, with one paper concluding:

{{quote|[Johnson] also displayed many of the obsessional-compulsive traits and rituals which are associated with this syndrome&amp;nbsp;... It may be thought that without this illness Dr Johnson's remarkable literary achievements, the great dictionary, his philosophical deliberations and his conversations may never have happened; and Boswell, the author of the greatest of biographies would have been unknown.|JMS Pearce|''[[Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine]]'', July 1994.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pearce p. 398&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Pearce|1994|p=398}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

From early childhood, Johnson suffered from poor eyesight, especially in his left eye, which interfered with his education. There were somewhat contradictory reports about his eyesight from his contemporaries. He appeared to have been near-sighted, yet he did not use eyeglasses. His eyesight became worse with age; still, his handwriting remained quite legible.&lt;ref&gt;''Blinking Sam: The Ocular Afflictions of Dr Samuel Johnson.'' Graham A. Wilson, MB, ChB, FRANZCO; James G. Ravin, MD, MS. Arch Ophthalmol. 2004;122:1370–1374. {{DOI|10.1001/archopht.122.9.1370}} PMID 15364718 [http://archopht.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/122/9/1370 available online]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
[[File:Samuel Johnson Statue.jpg|thumb|upright|Statue of Dr. Johnson erected in 1838 opposite the house where he was born at Lichfield's Market Square. There are also statues of him in London and Uttoxeter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nq.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/issue_pdf/frontmatter_pdf/s11-IV/88.pdf Statue Reference]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Johnson was, in the words of Steven Lynn, &quot;more than a well-known writer and scholar&quot;;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lynn|1997|p=240}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was a celebrity. His activities and the state of his health in his later years were constantly reported in various journals and newspapers, and when there was nothing to report, something was invented.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lynn|1997|pp=240–241}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Bate, &quot;Johnson loved biography,&quot; and he &quot;changed the whole course of biography for the modern world. One by-product was the most famous single work of biographical art in the whole of literature, Boswell's ''Life of Johnson'', and there were many other memoirs and biographies of a similar kind written on Johnson after his death.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Batexix&quot; /&gt; These [[List of contemporary accounts of Samuel Johnson's life|accounts of his life]] include Thomas Tyers's ''[[A Biographical Sketch of Dr Samuel Johnson]]'' (1784);&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hill|1897|p=335 (Vol. 2)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boswell's ''[[The Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides]]'' (1785); [[Hester Thrale]]'s ''[[Anecdotes of the Late Samuel Johnson]]'', which drew on entries from [[Thraliana|her diary]] and other notes;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bloom|1998|p=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Hawkins (author)|John Hawkins]]'s ''[[Life of Samuel Johnson (1787)]]'', the first full-length biography of Johnson;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Davis|1961|p=vii}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, in 1792, [[Arthur Murphy (writer)|Arthur Murphy]]'s ''[[An Essay on the Life and Genius of Samuel Johnson]]'', which replaced Hawkins's biography as the introduction to a collection of Johnson's ''Works''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hill|1897|p=355}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another important source was Fanny Burney, who described Johnson as &quot;the acknowledged Head of Literature in this kingdom&quot; and kept a diary containing details missing from other biographies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Clarke|2000|pp=4–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Above all, Boswell's portrayal of Johnson is the work best known to general readers. Although critics like Donald Greene argue about its status as a true biography, the work became successful as Boswell and his friends promoted it at the expense of the many other works on Johnson's life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Boswell|1986|p= 7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In criticism, Johnson had a lasting influence, although not everyone viewed him favourably. Some, like [[Thomas Babington Macaulay, 1st Baron Macaulay|Macaulay]], regarded Johnson as an [[Savant syndrome|idiot savant]] who produced some respectable works, and others, like the [[Romantic poetry|Romantic poets]], were completely opposed to Johnson's views on poetry and literature, especially in regards to [[John Milton|Milton]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Lynn p. 245&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Lynn|1997|p=245}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some of their contemporaries disagreed: [[Stendhal]]'s ''Racine et Shakespeare'' is based in part on Johnson's views of Shakespeare,&lt;ref name=&quot;Greene p. 142&quot;/&gt; and Johnson influenced [[Jane Austen]]'s writing style and philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Grundy|1997|pp=199–200}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Johnson's works came into favour, and [[Matthew Arnold]], in his ''Six Chief Lives from Johnson's &quot;Lives of the Poets&quot;'', considered the ''Lives'' of Milton, [[John Dryden|Dryden]], [[Alexander Pope|Pope]], [[Joseph Addison|Addison]], [[Jonathan Swift|Swift]], and [[Thomas Gray|Gray]] as &quot;points which stand as so many natural centres, and by returning to which we can always find our way again.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Arnold|1972|p=351}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One of Samuel Johnson's famous quotes, &quot;He who makes a beast of himself gets rid of the pain of being a man.&quot;  was used at the beginning of [[Hunter Thompson|Dr. Hunter S. Thompson's]] book, ''[[Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas]]'' and in the movie adaptation, as well as [[Avenged Sevenfold]]'s song, ''[[Bat Country]]''.

More than a century after his death, literary critics such as [[George Birkbeck Norman Hill|G. Birkbeck Hill]] and [[T. S. Eliot]] came to regard Johnson as a serious critic. They began to study Johnson's works with an increasing focus on the critical analysis found in his edition of Shakespeare and ''Lives of the Poets''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lynn p. 245&quot;/&gt; [[Yvor Winters]] claimed that &quot;A great critic is the rarest of all literary geniuses; perhaps the only critic in English who deserves that epithet is Samuel Johnson&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winters p. 240&quot;/&gt; [[F. R. Leavis]] agreed and, on Johnson's criticism, said, &quot;When we read him we know, beyond question, that we have here a powerful and distinguished mind operating at first hand upon literature. This, we can say with emphatic conviction, really ''is'' criticism&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wilson|1950|p=244}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edmund Wilson]] claimed that &quot;The ''Lives of the Poets'' and the prefaces and commentary on Shakespeare are among the most brilliant and the most acute documents in the whole range of English criticism&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winters p. 240&quot;/&gt; The critic [[Harold Bloom]] placed Johnson's work firmly within the [[Western Canon]] describing him as &quot;unmatched by any critic in any nation before or after him...Bate in the finest insight on Johnson I know, emphasised that no other writer is so obsessed by the realisation that the mind is an ''activity'', one that will turn to destructiveness of the self or of others unless it is directed to labour.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Bloom 1995 pp. 183, 200.&lt;/ref&gt; It is no wonder that his philosophical insistence that the language within literature must be examined became a prevailing mode of [[literary theory]] during the mid-20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Greene|1989|p=139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many societies formed around and dedicated to the study and enjoyment of Samuel Johnson's life and works. On the bicentennial of Johnson's death in 1984, Oxford University held a week-long conference featuring 50 papers, and the [[Arts Council of Great Britain]] held an exhibit of &quot;Johnsonian portraits and other memorabilia&quot;. The London ''[[The Times|Times]]'' and ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' produced parodies of Johnson's style for the occasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Greene|1989|pp=174–175}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, the [[BBC Four]] television channel started the [[Samuel Johnson Prize]], an award for non-fiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfour/books/features/samueljohnson/|title=Samuel Johnson Prize 2008|publisher=BBC |accessdate=25 August 2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;I&gt;[[The Economist]]&lt;/i&gt; published a column about language in the 1990s called Johnson, named after Samuel Johnson, and the name was revived in 2010 for the magazine's language blog.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.economist.com/blogs/johnson&lt;/ref&gt;

Half of Johnson's surviving correspondence, together with some of his manuscripts, editions of his books, paintings and other items associated with him are in the Donald and [[Mary Eccles, Viscountess Eccles|Mary Hyde]] Collection of Dr. Samuel Johnson, housed at [[Houghton Library]] at [[Harvard University]] since 2003. Materials in the collection may be accessed through the Houghton Reading Room. The collection includes drafts of his &quot;Plan for a Dictionary&quot;, documents associated with Hester Thrale Piozzi and James Boswell (including corrected proofs of his ''Life of Johnson'') and a teapot owned by Johnson.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://hcl.harvard.edu/libraries/houghton/collections/hyde.cfm|title=The Donald and Mary Hyde Collection of Dr. Samuel Johnson and Early Modern Books and Manuscripts|publisher=Harvard College Library|accessdate=10 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
