==Legacy==
Having had so many starring roles in famous musicals, many to critical acclaim, Paige is often referred to as the First Lady of British Musical Theatre.&lt;ref name=&quot;sexdrugs&quot;/&gt; In 2008, she celebrated the 40th anniversary of her professional debut on the West End stage debut.&lt;ref name=&quot;memories&quot;/&gt; Paige has never married nor had children,&lt;ref name=&quot;sexdrugs&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;know&quot;/&gt; although she had an 11-year affair with the lyricist [[Tim Rice]] throughout the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Bertodano, Helena de. [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2001/01/25/barice25.xml Tunes are child's play]. ''The Daily Telegraph''. Retrieved on 6 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; She has said that she wanted to have children, but &quot;it's a wonderful life I have, so I'm very fulfilled in other ways&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;rock&quot;/&gt;

Paige's singing abilities have won her worldwide praise, as have her acting skills with Andrew Gans of ''Playbill'' magazine writing that &quot;Paige's gift is to dissect a role and determine what phrasing, gesture or emotion can bring a scene to its fullest dramatic potential&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;meetelaine&quot;/&gt; Mark Shenton also highlighted her voice in 2008 as &quot;one of the most distinctive and impressive voices in the business&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Shenton, Mark. [http://blogs.thestage.co.uk/shenton/2008/09/another-turn-of-the-paige/ Another turn of (the) Paige…..] ''The Stage'', 24 September 2008. Retrieved on 25 August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  Lloyd-Webber insists that her rendition of &quot;As If We Never Said Goodbye&quot; is one of the best interpretations of a song by him.&lt;ref name=&quot;newnorma&quot;/&gt;  

Paige has gained herself a reputation as someone who can be &quot;difficult&quot;.  ''[[The Times|The Times']]'' Brian Logan wrote, &quot;Paige is not exactly known for her humility. In newspaper profiles, that dread word 'difficult' is often applied&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;turning&quot;/&gt; On one occasion, she told a male interviewer that she was going to stop giving interviews to female reporters because, in her own words, &quot;I don't trust other women in these situations. They establish a sisterhood with you and then betray it every time&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;show&quot;/&gt; What has been seen as a cold side to her personality was also noted by Logan,&lt;ref name=&quot;turning&quot;/&gt; but Paige has said that a common misconception of her is that she is confident and very serious.&lt;ref name=&quot;broadcaster&quot;&gt;Dykes, Andy. [http://news.independent.co.uk/people/profiles/article2539335.ece The 5-Minute Interview: Elaine Paige, Singer, actor and broadcaster]. ''[[The Independent]]'', 14 May 2007. Retrieved on 18 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  Another editor found her &quot;refreshingly down-to-earth&quot; and &quot;very friendly&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;walesonline&quot;/&gt;

==Views on theatre==
Though Paige has enjoyed a long career in musical theatre, she rarely goes to watch musicals, much preferring to watch films or plays.&lt;ref name=&quot;metro&quot;&gt;Ellis, James. [http://www.metro.co.uk/fame/interviews/article.html?in_article_id=914&amp;in_page_id=11 Elaine Page Interview]. ''[[Metro (Associated Metro Limited)|Metro]]'', 5 January 2001. Retrieved on 7 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, she considers herself primarily an actress before a singer,&lt;ref name=&quot;show&quot;/&gt; stating, &quot;I really prefer to be in character&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;scotsman&quot;/&gt; Comparing the work of Rodgers and Hammerstein to that of Lloyd Webber, Paige has said that she finds [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]] songs more difficult to sing, and described them as challenging. She concluded, &quot;it's a quieter kind of singing, more controlled, not belting it out&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;show&quot;/&gt;

In light of the physical demands of performing in theatre Paige has said &quot;Musical theatre is the hardest thing any actor will ever do.  You become obsessive about sleeping, eating the right food, not speaking and giving yourself vocal rest and keeping exercised&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;thestageturning&quot;/&gt; Regarding the pressure of having to be in a fit condition to perform in theatre each night, she remarked &quot;you wouldn't want to read the letters people write when you're off and they're disappointed — it's so awful, the guilt one feels for not being there&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;show&quot;/&gt; As part of a rigorous routine before musical roles to look after her voice, Paige stops eating [[dairy product]]s and drinking alcohol and also focuses on keeping fit.&lt;ref name=&quot;show&quot;/&gt; After about three months into the production when her voice is tiring from performing, she even gives up her social life, sometimes only communicating by notepad and fax.&lt;ref name=&quot;show&quot;/&gt;  The rehearsal process is when Paige is most contented, using the valuable time to &quot;delve and discover&quot; without the need to feel embarrassed.&lt;ref name=&quot;meetelaine&quot;/&gt; She also never reads her reviews from critics, finding that it is not helpful to have too many opinions.&lt;ref name=&quot;artist&quot;/&gt;

Paige has named reality television series such as ''[[Any Dream Will Do (TV series)|Any Dream Will Do]]'', which aim to find an unknown actor to play the lead role in a musical, as the greatest threat to theatre today, believing that &quot;actors already striving in the theatre wouldn't dream of putting themselves on these shows&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;artist&quot;/&gt; In a later interview, she questioned the seriousness of the actors auditioning for these types of shows: &quot;you wouldn't put yourself up for one of those shows in case you got bumped off the first week and all your colleagues saw it&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;turning&quot;/&gt; She has also expressed a wish for more new musicals to be put into production, instead of frequent revivals.&lt;ref name=&quot;walesonline&quot;/&gt;
