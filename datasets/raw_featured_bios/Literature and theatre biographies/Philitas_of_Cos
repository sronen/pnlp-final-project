'''Philitas of Cos''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|f|ɪ|ˈ|l|aɪ|t|ə|s}}; {{lang-el|Φιλίτας}}, ''Philītas''; {{circa|340}} – {{c.|285 BC}}), sometimes spelled '''Philetas''' ({{IPAc-en|f|aɪ|ˈ|l|iː|t|ə|s}}; {{lang|grc|Φιλήτας}}, ''Philētas''; see [[#Bibliography|Bibliography]] below), was a scholar and poet during the early [[Hellenistic period]] of [[ancient Greece]].&lt;ref name=Bulloch-4/&gt; A Greek associated with [[Alexandria]], he [[flourished]] in the second half of the 4th century&amp;nbsp;BC and was appointed tutor to the heir to the throne of [[Ptolemaic Egypt]]. He was thin and frail; [[Athenaeus]] later caricatured him as an academic so consumed by his studies that he wasted away and died.&lt;ref name=Bing/&gt;

Philitas was the first major Greek writer who was both a scholar and a poet.&lt;ref name=Bulloch-4/&gt; His reputation continued for centuries, based on both his pioneering study of words and his verse in [[elegiac]] meter. His vocabulary ''Disorderly Words'' described the meanings of rare literary words, including those used by [[Homer]]. His poetry, notably his elegiac poem ''Demeter'', was highly respected by later ancient poets. However, almost all his work has since been lost.&lt;ref name=Bing/&gt;

==Life==
Little is known of Philitas' life. Ancient sources refer to him as a Coan, a native or long-time inhabitant of [[Kos|Cos]],&lt;ref name=Span-24/&gt; one of the [[Dodecanese]] islands in the [[Aegean Sea]] just off the coast of Asia. His student [[Theocritus]] wrote that Philetas' father was Telephos (Τήλεφος, ''{{transl|el|ISO|Tḗlephos}}'') and his mother, assuming the manuscript is supplemented correctly, Euctione (Εὐκτιόνη, ''{{transl|el|ISO|Euktiónē}}'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Spanoudakis |title= Philitas of Cos |page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; From a comment about Philitas in the ''[[Suda]]'', a 10th century&amp;nbsp;AD historical encyclopedia, it is estimated he was born {{c.|340 BC}}, and that he might have established a reputation in Cos by {{c.|309/8 BC}}. During the [[Wars of the Diadochi]] that followed the death of [[Alexander the Great]] and divided Alexander's empire, [[Ptolemy I Soter|Ptolemy]] had captured Cos from his rival successor, [[Antigonus I Monophthalmus|Antigonus]], in 310&amp;nbsp;BC; his son, [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus|Ptolemy&amp;nbsp;II Philadelphus]], was born there in 308&amp;nbsp;BC. It was a favorite retreat for men of letters weary of Alexandria.&lt;ref name=Sandys&gt;{{cite book |title= A History of Classical Scholarship: from the Sixth Century&amp;nbsp;B.C. to the End of the Middle Ages |author= [[John Edwin Sandys]] |publisher= Cambridge University Press |location=London |year=1903 |pages=118–9 |oclc=2759759}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Ptolemaic-Empire-300BC.jpeg|thumb|left|alt=Map of eastern Mediterranean, showing the Ptolemaic Kingdom, Alexandria in the north of Egypt, and Cos in the Aegean just off the coast of Asia|The [[Ptolemaic Kingdom]], {{c.|300 BC}}, was centered on [[Alexandria]] in [[ancient Egypt]]; [[Kos|Cos]] was on its northwest frontier.]]

Philetas was appointed Philadelphus' ''[[preceptor]],'' or tutor, which suggests he moved to [[Alexandria]] {{c.|297/6 BC}}&lt;ref name=Span-23&gt;{{cite book |author=Spanoudakis |title= Philitas of Cos |page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and moved back to Cos in the later 290s&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref name=Span-24&gt;{{cite book |author=Spanoudakis |title= Philitas of Cos |page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; He may also have tutored [[Arsinoe II of Egypt|Arsinoe&amp;nbsp;II]], Philadelphus' older sister and eventual wife.&lt;ref name=Span-29&gt;{{cite book |author=Spanoudakis |title= Philitas of Cos |page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later tutors of royal offspring in Ptolemaic Egypt generally headed the [[Library of Alexandria]], but it is unknown whether Philitas held that position.&lt;ref name=Bulloch-4/&gt; Philitas also taught the poets [[Hermesianax]] and Theocritus and the [[Philologist|grammarian]] [[Zenodotus]], and after he returned to Cos he seems to have spent at least ten years leading a brotherhood of intellectuals and poets that included [[Aratus]], Hermesianax, and Theocritus.&lt;ref name=Sandys/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pauly/&gt;

Hermesianax wrote of &quot;Philitas, singing of nimble Bittis&quot;, and [[Ovid]] twice calls her &quot;Battis&quot;. It is commonly thought that Bittis or Battis was Philitas' mistress, and that Hermesianax referred to love poetry; another possibility is that her name connoted &quot;chatterbox&quot;, and that she was a humorous personification of Philitas' passion for words.&lt;ref name=Bing/&gt;

Philitas was thin and frail, and may have suffered and died from a [[wasting disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=The Classical Quarterly |volume=41 |issue=2 |year=1991 |pages=534–8 |author=[[Alan Cameron (classical scholar)|Alan Cameron]] |title=How thin was Philitas? |doi=10.1017/S0009838800004717 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He seems to have died in Cos sometime in the 280s&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref name=Span-24/&gt; His pupil Hermesianax wrote that a statue of him was erected under a [[plane tree]] by the people of Cos, depicting him as &quot;frail with all the glosses&quot;.&lt;ref name=Bing/&gt; His contemporary [[Posidippus]] wrote that Philadelphus commissioned a bronze of Philitas in old age from the sculptor [[Hecataeus]],&lt;ref name=Stewart&gt;{{cite book |author=Andrew Stewart |chapter=Posidippus and the truth in sculpture |pages=183–205 |editor=Gutzwiller (ed.) |title=The New Posidippus |year=2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sens-Posidippus/&gt; which &quot;included nothing from the physique of heroes.

[[Thomas Stanley (author)|Thomas Stanley]]). ''Various History'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/aelian/varhist9.xhtml#chap14 9.14]. Retrieved 2009-08-26.&lt;/ref&gt;
A 2nd century&amp;nbsp;AD Greek author, [[Athenaeus of Naucratis]], wrote that Philitas studied false arguments and erroneous word-usage so intensely that he wasted away and starved to death, and that his [[epitaph]] read:&lt;ref&gt;[[Athenaeus]] (tr. [[Charles Duke Yonge|C.D. Yonge]]).

St. George Stock analyzed the story as saying Philitas studied the [[Megarian school of philosophy]], which cultivated and studied [[paradox]]es such as the [[liar paradox]]: if someone says &quot;I am lying&quot;, is what he says true or false?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor= Edward N. Zalta (ed.) |title= Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |chapterurl=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/insolubles/#1 |chapter=Insolubles |author= Paul Vincent Spade |year=2009 |accessdate=2009-12-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stock wrote that Philitas worried so much over the liar paradox that he died of [[insomnia]], and translated the epitaph as follows:

&lt;poem style='margin-left: 1em'&gt;
&lt;div style='margin-left: 2em; text-indent: -2em'&gt;Philetas of Cos am I,&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style='margin-left: 2em; text-indent: -2em'&gt;'Twas the Liar who made me die,&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style='margin-left: 2em; text-indent: -2em'&gt;And the bad nights caused thereby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= St. George Stock |title=Stoicism |year=1908 |page=36 |publisher= Archibald Constable |location=London |oclc=1201330}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;

A more literal translation suggests that the invented epitaph pokes fun at Philitas' focus on using the right words:

Philitas wrote a vocabulary explaining the meanings of rare literary words, words from local dialects, and technical terms; it probably took the form of a lexicon.&lt;ref name=Pauly/&gt; The vocabulary, called ''Disorderly Words'' (Ἄτακτοι γλῶσσαι, ''{{transl|el|ISO|Átaktoi glôssai}}''), has been lost, with only a few fragments quoted by later authors.&lt;ref name=Bing/&gt; One example, quoted in [[Athenaeus]], is that the word πέλλα (''{{transl|el|ISO|pélla}}'') meant &quot;wine cup&quot; in the ancient Greek region of [[Boeotia]];&lt;ref&gt;Athenaeus (tr. C.D. Yonge). ''The Gastronomers'', [http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/Literature/Literature-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=Literature.AthV2.p0274&amp;id=Literature.AthV2 11.495e].

About thirty fragments of Philitas' poetry are known, along with four definite titles:&lt;ref name=Pauly/&gt;
*''Demeter'', Philitas' most famous work, consisted of [[elegiac couplet]]s, or [[couplets]] in the [[elegiac]] meter.&lt;ref name=Hopkinson&gt;{{cite journal |journal= The Classical Review |year=2003 |volume=53 |issue=2 |pages=311–2 |title= Coi sacra Philitae |author= N.

Heyworth |pages=139–60}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fragments describe Demeter's arrival on Cos and warm welcome by its royal family of Meropids, or humans twice normal size, thus presenting the [[founding myth]] of a local cult of Demeter on Cos.&lt;ref name=Pauly/&gt;
*''Hermes'' was an ''[[Epic poetry|epyllion]],'' or brief mythological narrative, written in [[hexameter]]. It had the structure of a [[hymn]], with a central narrative telling of [[Odysseus]]' visit to the island of the king [[Aeolus#Æolus (son of Hippotes)|Aeolus]], keeper of the winds, and of Odysseus' secret affair with the king's daughter Polymele.  It is also possible that ''Hermes'' was a collection of such stories, with the patronage of Hermes himself as the common thread.&lt;ref name=Pauly/&gt;
*''Playthings'' (Παίγνια, {{transl|el|ISO|''Paígnia''}}) had two shorter collections. These poems had the structure of [[epigram]]s and their themes may have included [[erotica]]. The only surviving poem contains two elegiac couplets and has a puzzle or riddle structure characteristic of some ancient Greek [[Skolion|drinking-party songs]].&lt;ref name=Pauly/&gt;
*Only one of the ''Epigrams'' has been fully reconstructed.&lt;ref name=Pauly/&gt;
Another possible poem is ''Telephus'', which may have been a companion to ''Demeter''.&lt;ref name=Pauly/&gt;

At most fifty verses of Philitas survive.&lt;ref name=Bing/&gt; Below is an example fragment of two verses, which was quoted in the ''Collection of Paradoxical Stories'', whose putative author Antigonus (often identified with [[Antigonus of Carystus]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Kathryn Gutzwiller |title= A Guide to Hellenistic Literature |location= Malden, MA |publisher=Blackwell |year=2007 |isbn=0-631-23321-0 |pages=166–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; a near-contemporary) does not specify which work they came from; indirect evidence suggests ''Demeter''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Spanoudakis |title= Philitas of Cos |pages=209–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; These two verses show the confluence of Philitas' interests in poetry and obscure words:

&lt;/poem&gt;

According to Antigonus, the &quot;cactus&quot; (κάκτος, ''{{transl|el|ISO|káktos}}'') was a thorny plant from Sicily, and &quot;When a deer steps on it and is pricked, its bones remain soundless and unusable for flutes. For that reason Philitas spoke of it.&quot;&lt;ref name=Bing/&gt; Antigonus quotes one more passage, and the 5th century&amp;nbsp;AD anthologist [[Stobaeus]] quotes eleven passages from Philitas; the remaining fragments are derived from ancient commentators who quoted Philitas when discussing rare words or names used by other authors.&lt;ref name=Bulloch-5&gt;Bulloch, &quot;Hellenistic poetry&quot;, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Philitas was the most important intellectual figure in the early years of [[Hellenistic civilization]].&lt;ref&gt;Bulloch, &quot;Hellenistic poetry&quot;, p. 4. &quot;The most important intellectual figure in the early years of the new Hellenistic world was Philetas from the east Greek island of Cos.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; He gained instant recognition in both poetry and literary scholarship,&lt;ref name=Bulloch-4&gt;Bulloch, &quot;Hellenistic poetry&quot;, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; and, as far as is known, was the first person called &quot;poet as well as scholar&quot; (ποιητὴς ἅμα καὶ κριτικός, ''poiētḕs [h]áma kaì kritikós'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Rudolf |last=Pfeiffer |title= The future of studies in the field of Hellenistic poetry |journal=[[Journal of Hellenic Studies]] |volume=75 |pages=69–73 |year=1955 |doi = 10.2307/629171 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As tutor to Philadelphus he is assumed to have had great influence on the development of the ''[[Mouseion]]'' at Alexandria, a scholarly institution that included the famous [[Library of Alexandria]]. A statue was erected of him, possibly at a ''Mouseion'' at Cos,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Zeitschrift für Papyrologie und Epigraphik |year=1997 |volume=119 |pages=21–36|author= Alex Hardie |title= Philitas and the plane tree |url=http://uni-koeln.de/phil-fak/ifa/zpe/downloads/1997/119pdf/119021.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his work was explicitly acknowledged as a classic by both Theocritus and [[Callimachus]].&lt;ref name=Bulloch-5/&gt;

His reputation for scholarship endured for at least a century. In Athens, the comic playwright [[Strato]] made jokes that assumed audiences knew about Philitas' vocabulary, and the vocabulary was criticized more than a century later by the influential Homeric scholar [[Aristarchus of Samothrace]] in his ''Against Philitas'' (Πρὸς Φιλίταν, ''{{transl|el|ISO|Pròs Philítan}}''). The geographer [[Strabo]] described him three centuries later as &quot;simultaneously a poet and a critic&quot;.&lt;ref name=Bing/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Strabo]].

Philitas was the first writer whose works represent the combination of qualities now regarded as [[Ancient Greek literature#Hellenistic poetry|Hellenistic]]: variety, scholarship, and use of Homeric sources in non-[[Epic poetry|epic]] works. He directly influenced the major Hellenistic poets Callimachus and [[Apollonius of Rhodes]].&lt;ref name=Bulloch-5/&gt; His poetry was mentioned or briefly quoted by his rival Callimachus and by other ancient authors,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Spanoudakis |title= Philitas of Cos |pages=85–346}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his poetic reputation endured for at least three centuries, as [[Augustan poets]] identified his name with great elegiac writing.&lt;ref name=Bulloch-5/&gt; [[Propertius]] linked him to his rival with the following well-known couplet:

&lt;poem style='margin-left: 1em'&gt;

''Elegies'', [http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/prop3.html#1 III.1] (in Latin). Retrieved 2009-08-26.
