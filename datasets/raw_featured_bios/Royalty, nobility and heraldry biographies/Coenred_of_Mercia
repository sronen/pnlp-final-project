'''Coenred''' (also spelled '''Cenred'''; [[floruit|fl.]] 675&amp;ndash;709) was king of [[Mercia]], now part of England, from 704 to 709. He was a son of the Mercian king [[Wulfhere of Mercia|Wulfhere]], whose brother [[Æthelred of Mercia|Æthelred]] succeeded to the throne in 675 on Wulfhere's death. In 704, Æthelred abdicated in favour of Coenred to become a monk.

Coenred's reign is poorly documented, but a contemporary source records that he faced attacks from the Welsh. Coenred is not known to have married or had children, although later chronicles describe him as an ancestor of [[Wigstan of Mercia|Wigstan]], a 9th-century Mercian king. In 709, Coenred abdicated and went on pilgrimage to Rome, where he remained as a monk until his death. In the view of his contemporary, [[Bede]], Coenred &quot;who had ruled the kingdom of Mercia for some time and very nobly, with still greater nobility renounced the throne of his kingdom&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Bede, ''The Ecclesiastical History of the English People'', Oxford University Press, 1994, p. 267&lt;/ref&gt; [[Æthelred of Mercia|Æthelred]]'s son [[Ceolred of Mercia|Ceolred]] succeeded Coenred as king of Mercia.

==Mercia in the 7th century==
[[Image:British kingdoms c 800.png|250px|thumb|right|The kingdoms of Britain in the late 7th century]]

By the 7th century, England was almost entirely divided into kingdoms ruled by the [[Anglo-Saxons]], who had come to Britain two hundred years earlier. The kingdom of [[Mercia]] occupied what is now the [[English Midlands]].&lt;ref name=BF_Origins_15&gt;[[Barbara Yorke|Yorke]], &quot;The Origins of Mercia&quot; in Brown &amp; Farr, ''Mercia'', pp.&amp;nbsp;15&amp;ndash;16.&lt;/ref&gt; Neighbouring kingdoms included [[Northumbria]] to the north, [[Kingdom of East Anglia|East Anglia]] to the east, and [[Wessex]], the kingdom of the West Saxons, to the south. [[Kingdom of Essex|Essex]], the kingdom of the East Saxons, included London and lay between East Anglia and the [[kingdom of Kent]].&lt;ref name=Yorke&gt;Yorke, ''Kings and Kingdoms''.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest Mercian king for whom there is definite historical information is [[Penda of Mercia]], Coenred's paternal grandfather.&lt;ref name=BF_Origins_18&gt;Yorke, &quot;The Origins of Mercia&quot; in Brown &amp; Farr, ''Mercia'', pp.&amp;nbsp;18&amp;ndash;19.&lt;/ref&gt;

The main source for this period is [[Bede]]’s ''[[Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum]]'' (Ecclesiastical History of the English People), completed in about 731. Despite its focus on the history of the church, this work provides valuable information about the early Anglo-Saxon kingdoms.&lt;ref name=Yorke_100&gt;Yorke, ''Kings and Kingdoms'', p.&amp;nbsp;100.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charters]], which recorded royal grants of land to individuals and to religious houses, provide further information on Coenred's reign,&lt;ref name=BlairRBaEE_14&gt;Hunter Blair, ''Roman Britain'', pp. 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Campbell_95_2&gt;Campbell, ''The Anglo-Saxons'', pp. 95&amp;ndash;98.&lt;/ref&gt; as does the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'', compiled in [[Wessex]] at the end of the 9th century. The Chronicle's anonymous scribe appears to have incorporated much information recorded in earlier periods.&lt;ref name=Lapidge_ASC&gt;Simon Keynes, &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, in ''Blackwell Encyclopedia'', p.&amp;nbsp;35.&lt;/ref&gt; Coenred is also mentioned in two 8th-century [[hagiographies]], those of [[Wilfrid|Saint Wilfrid]] and [[Saint Guthlac]].&lt;ref name=PASE_title&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.pase.ac.uk/jsp/DisplayPerson.jsp?personKey=566| title = PASE Index of Persons | accessdate=20 December 2008 |publisher=[[King's College London]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancestry and reign==
In 658, Coenred's father [[Wulfhere of Mercia|Wulfhere]] came to the throne of Mercia as the result of a coup, ending a three-year period of Northumbrian control.&lt;ref name=Yorke_96&gt;Yorke, ''Kings and Kingdoms'', p.&amp;nbsp;96.&lt;/ref&gt; Wulfhere was succeeded on his death (in 675) by his brother [[Æthelred of Mercia|Æthelred]], Coenred's uncle,&lt;ref name=&quot;Yorke_105&quot;&gt;Yorke, ''Kings and Kingdoms'', p.&amp;nbsp;105.&lt;/ref&gt; possibly because Coenred was too young to rule.&lt;ref name=Kelly_ODNB/&gt; Coenred's mother, [[Ermenilda of Ely|Ermenilda]] became a nun sometime after Wulfhere's death.  Æthelred's decisive victory over the Northumbrians at the [[Battle of the Trent]] in 679, followed by the [[Picts]]' destruction of the Northumbrian army at the [[Battle of Dun Nechtain]] in 685, reduced Northumbrian power and influence. There is evidence of Mercian activity in the south-east as well. Æthelred invaded Kent in 676, and charters survive in which he confirmed land grants made by [[Swæfheard]] and [[Oswine of Kent|Oswine]], kings of west and east Kent. Another charter of Æthelred's, dated between 693 and 704, grants land to [[Waldhere (bishop)|Waldhere]], the bishop of London.&lt;ref name=Kirby_123&gt;Kirby, ''Earliest English Kings'', p.&amp;nbsp;123.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/kemble/pelteret/Lsp/Lsp%202.htm | title = Charters of St. Paul's: 2 | accessdate=11 March 2008 |publisher=[[Trinity College, Cambridge]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=S_65&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?do=get&amp;type=charter&amp;id=65 | title = Anglo-Saxons.net: S 65 | accessdate=11 March 2008 |publisher=Sean Miller}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Æthelred does not appear to have sought expansion further south.&lt;ref name=Kirby_126-7&gt;Kirby, ''Earliest English Kings'', pp.&amp;nbsp;126&amp;ndash;127.&lt;/ref&gt; The growing strength of the West Saxons under [[Cædwalla of Wessex|Cædwalla]] and [[Ine of Wessex|Ine]] would have limited Mercian opportunities in that direction.&lt;ref name=&quot;Yorke_105&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Aethelred family tree.svg|thumb|300px|left|Coenred's family tree]]
The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle records that in 702 Coenred succeeded to the kingdom of the [[Southumbrians]] and that in 704 he became king of Mercia. As the &quot;Southumbrians&quot; were those who lived south of the [[Humber]], Mercia's northern boundary, the two annals have proved difficult to interpret: Coenred and Æthelred may have ruled jointly for two years before Æthelred abdicated,&lt;ref name=Swanton_41&gt;Swanton, ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', p.&amp;nbsp;41.&lt;/ref&gt; or the chroniclers may have recorded the same event twice, once from a source that was two years in error.&lt;ref&gt;Whitelock, ''The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', p.&amp;nbsp;25 n.&amp;nbsp;5.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the 8th-century life of [[Saint Guthlac|St Guthlac]], Æthelred appointed Coenred as his heir despite having at least one son of his own, [[Ceolred of Mercia|Ceolred]].&lt;ref name=Kirby_173&gt;Kirby, ''Earliest English Kings'', p.&amp;nbsp;173.&lt;/ref&gt; Æthelred appears to have retained influence during his nephew's reign: the ''[[Life of St Wilfrid]]'' relates how he summoned Coenred and made him swear to support Wilfrid in his conflict with the church hierarchy.&lt;ref name=Kelly_ODNB/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kirby_127&gt;Kirby, ''Earliest English Kings'', p.&amp;nbsp;127.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=VW_57&gt;Eddius Stephanus, ''Life of Wilfrid'', in ''Age of Bede'', pp.&amp;nbsp;169&amp;ndash;170.&lt;/ref&gt;

Coenred's sparsely documented reign is mentioned in the ''Life of Guthlac''. The author, Felix, reports conflicts with the [[Britons (historical)|Britons]]: &quot;in the days of Coenred King of the Mercians, [...] the Britons the implacable enemies of the [[Saxons|Saxon]] race, were troubling the English with their attacks, their pillaging, and their devastations of the people [...]&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Contigit itaque in diebus Coenredi Merciorum regis, cum Brittones, infesti hostes Saxonici generis, bellis, praedis, publicisque vastationibus Anglorum gentem deturbarent [...]''. Felix, ''Vita Sancti Guthlaci'', chapter 34, ed. and tr. B. Colgrave, pp.&amp;nbsp;108&amp;ndash;109.&lt;/ref&gt; To counter such attacks, [[Æthelbald of Mercia|Æthelbald]], who came to the throne in 716, was once thought to have built [[Wat's Dyke]], an earthwork barrier in northern Wales;&lt;ref name=Stenton_203n&gt;Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', pp.&amp;nbsp;203, n.&amp;nbsp;1; pp.&amp;nbsp;213&amp;ndash;214; p.&amp;nbsp;214 n.&amp;nbsp;1.&lt;/ref&gt; but this now seems unlikely, since an excavation of the Dyke in 1997 found charcoal from a hearth which was radiocarbon-dated to some time between 411 and 561.&lt;ref name=ZZ_165&gt;Feryok, &quot;Offa's Dyke&quot;, p.&amp;nbsp;165.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some surviving charters from Coenred's reign reveal him to have been the overlord of the [[Kingdom of Essex|East Saxon]] rulers. [[Offa of Essex|Offa]], an East Saxon king, made a grant in the territory of the [[Hwicce]] (to which he may have been connected by a marriage of his father, [[Sigeheard of Essex|Sigeheard]]) which was later confirmed by Coenred. In the charter, Coenred refers to Offa as his underking. Coenred and his successor also confirmed grants to Waldhere, the Bishop of London, evidence that London was firmly under Mercian overlordship.&lt;ref name=Kirby_123-4&gt;Kirby, ''Earliest English Kings'', pp.&amp;nbsp;123&amp;ndash;124.&lt;/ref&gt; Later Mercian kings treated London as their direct possession, rather than as a province ruled by an underking, but Coenred did not go that far.&lt;ref name=Stenton_203&gt;Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', pp.&amp;nbsp;203&amp;ndash;205.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Campbell_95&gt;Wormald, &quot;The Age of Bede and Æthelbald&quot;, p.&amp;nbsp;95.&lt;/ref&gt; A grant of land in Herefordshire to a nun named Feleburg has survived, as have forged charters in Coenred's name granting privileges to [[St Paul's Cathedral]], and to the [[Evesham Abbey|Abbey of Evesham]].&lt;ref name=Kelly_ODNB/&gt;&lt;ref name=PASE_grants&gt;Charters S 1801, S 1786, S 78, S 79, and S 80; see the listings under &quot;Confirmation of land / privileges&quot; and &quot;Grant&quot; in the &quot;Events&quot; section of {{cite web | url = http://www.pase.ac.uk/jsp/DisplayPerson.jsp?personKey=566| title = PASE Index of Persons | accessdate=20 December 2008 |publisher=[[King's College London]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mercia's influence in [[Kingdom of Kent|Kent]] was limited both before and during Coenred's reign.&lt;ref name=Kirby_123-4/&gt; In a surviving letter (written in 704 or 705), Waldhere, Bishop of London, tells [[Berhtwald]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], that Coenred had invited him to a council to be held &quot;about the reconciliation of Ælfthryth&quot;. Waldhere refused the invitation as he did not know Berhtwald's opinion on the matter, which was evidently important, although no other reference to it has survived.&lt;ref name=Kelly_ODNB&gt;Kelly, &quot;Coenred&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The letter describes a council to be held at [[Brentford]] to mediate between the kings of the East and West Saxons. In the view of the historian [[Frank Stenton]], the letter illuminates the &quot;confused relations of the southern English at a moment when they had no common overlord&quot;.&lt;ref name=Stenton_142-3&gt;Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', pp.&amp;nbsp;142&amp;ndash;143.&lt;/ref&gt; The reduced prestige of both Coenred and his successor, Ceolred, may have stirred unrest among the Mercian nobility: Æthelbald was in exile during Ceolred's reign, and the survival of a hostile account of Ceolred may indicate a more general dissatisfaction with the ruling line.&lt;ref name=Yorke_112&gt;Yorke, ''Kings and Kingdoms'', p.&amp;nbsp;112.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abdication and succession==
Coenred appears to have been a very religious king. Bede tells a story of a companion of Coenred's whose sins led him to damnation despite Coenred's pleas that he should repent and reform. In 709 Coenred abdicated in favour of his cousin [[Ceolred of Mercia|Ceolred]], son of Æthelred, in order to become a monk in Rome; Bede's story is cited by the medieval chronicler [[William of Malmesbury]] as the reason for Coenred's decision, though this is probably guesswork.&lt;ref name=Kelly_ODNB/&gt; Coenred was accompanied by the East Saxon king [[Offa of Essex|Offa]] on his journey to Rome, and was made a [[monk]] there by [[Pope Constantine]].&lt;ref name=Yorke_174&gt;Yorke, ''Kings and Kingdoms'', p.&amp;nbsp;174.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Liber Pontificalis]]'', an early record of the lives of Popes, records the arrival of their party: &quot;in his time, two kings of the Saxons came with many others to pray to the apostles; just as they were hoping, their lives quickly came to an end.&quot;&lt;ref name=Kelly_ODNB/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Liber Pontificalis'' § 90, tr. Davis, p. 94. ''Huius temporibus duo reges Saxonum ad orationem apostolorum cum aliis pluribus venientes sub velocitate suam vitam, ut obtabant, finierunt'' (ed. Mommsen, p. 225).&lt;/ref&gt; A later source, the 11th-century ''Vita Ecgwini'', claims that [[Ecgwine]] accompanied Coenred and Offa to Rome, but historians have treated this with scepticism.&lt;ref name=SimsW_15&gt;Sims-Williams, &quot;Cuthswith&quot;, p.&amp;nbsp;15, n.&amp;nbsp;6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians have generally accepted Bede's report of Coenred's and Offa's abdications, but [[Barbara Yorke]] has suggested that they may not have relinquished their thrones voluntarily. There are instances of kings being forcibly removed and placed in holy orders to make them ineligible for kingship; one such was King [[Osred II]] of Northumbria, who was forced into a monastery.&lt;ref name=Yorke_174/&gt; On the other hand, if Coenred went willingly, as Bede relates, then the apparently friendly relationship between Offa and Coenred, his overlord, makes it clear that the relationship between an overlord and his underking was not hostile in every case.&lt;ref name=Kirby_128&gt;Kirby, ''Earliest English Kings'', p.&amp;nbsp;128.&lt;/ref&gt;

Coenred was [[tonsure]]d in Rome, whence he was accompanied by Offa, son of [[Sighere of Essex|Sighere, king of the East Saxons]], and became a monk &quot;at the threshold of the apostles&quot; as Bede had it; he stayed in Rome until his death, the date of which is unknown.&lt;ref name=Bede_I_15&gt;Bede, HE, V, 19, pp.&amp;nbsp;299&amp;ndash;300.&lt;/ref&gt;   He is not recorded as having a wife or children. Chronicles kept at [[Evesham Abbey]], however, claim that he was an ancestor of [[Wigstan]]. They do not say whether this was through Wigstan's father, [[Wigmund of Mercia|Wigmund]], son of [[Wiglaf of Mercia]], or through his mother, Ælfflæd, daughter of [[Ceolwulf I of Mercia]].&lt;ref name=Kirby_191&gt;Kirby, ''Earliest English Kings'', p.&amp;nbsp;191.&lt;/ref&gt;
