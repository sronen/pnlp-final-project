'''Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna of Russia''' ({{lang-ru|О́льга Алекса́ндровна Рома́нова}}; ''Olga Alexandrovna Romanova'') ({{OldStyleDate|13 June|1882|1 June}} – 24 November 1960) was the youngest child of Emperor [[Alexander III of Russia]]. Her older brother was [[Tsar Nicholas II]].

She was raised at the [[Gatchina|Gatchina Palace]] outside of [[Saint Petersburg]]. Olga's relationship with her mother, Empress [[Maria Feodorovna (Dagmar of Denmark)|Marie]], the daughter of King [[Christian IX of Denmark]], was strained and distant from childhood. In contrast, she and her father enjoyed their time together and shared intimate secrets. He died when she was 12, and her brother Nicholas became emperor.

In 1901, she married [[Duke Peter Alexandrovich of Oldenburg]], who was privately believed by family and friends to be homosexual. The marriage did not last and was annulled in 1916, allowing Olga to marry untitled commoner [[Nikolai Kulikovsky]], with whom she had fallen in love during her first marriage. After the downfall of the [[Romanov]]s in the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]], she fled to the [[Crimea]] with her mother, husband, and children, where they were placed under house arrest and lived under the threat of assassination. Her brother and his family, including Olga's niece [[Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia|Grand Duchess Anastasia]], were [[Shooting of the Romanov family|shot by revolutionaries]]. After her escape from Russia in 1919, Olga was often sought out by [[Romanov impostors]] who claimed to be her dead relatives. She met [[Anna Anderson]], the best-known Anastasia impostor, in [[Berlin]] in 1925.

Olga lived in exile in Denmark until 1948 when, feeling threatened by [[Joseph Stalin]]'s regime, she moved her direct family to a farm in [[Ontario]], [[Canada]]. Like her father, she preferred to avoid extravagance and sought simplicity. During her lifetime, she painted over 2,000 works of art, which provided income for both her family and the charitable causes she supported. She lived in Canada until her death in a flat in East [[Toronto]] at the age of 78. She died seven months after her older sister, [[Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna of Russia|Xenia]]. At the end of her life and afterwards, Olga was widely labelled the last Grand Duchess of Imperial Russia.

==Early life==

Olga was the youngest daughter of [[Alexander III of Russia|Tsar Alexander III]] and his consort, [[Maria Feodorovna (Dagmar of Denmark)|Marie Feodorovna]], formerly Princess Dagmar of Denmark. She was [[born in the purple]], ''i.e.'' during her father's reign, on 13 June 1882&lt;!--New style date--&gt; in the [[Peterhof Palace]], west of [[Saint Petersburg]]. Her birth was announced by a traditional 101-gun salute from the ramparts of the [[Peter and Paul Fortress]], and similar salutes throughout the [[Russian Empire]].&lt;ref name=v3&gt;Vorres, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother, advised by her sister, [[Alexandra of Denmark|Alexandra, Princess of Wales]], placed Olga in the care of an English nanny, Elizabeth Franklin.&lt;ref name=v3/&gt;

The Russian imperial family was a frequent target for assassins, so for safety reasons the Grand Duchess was raised at the country palace of [[Gatchina]], about 50&amp;nbsp;miles (80&amp;nbsp;km) west of Saint Petersburg. Olga and her siblings, however, were not accustomed to a lavish early lifestyle. Conditions in the nursery were modest, even Spartan.&lt;ref name=v4&gt;Phenix, pp. 8–10; Vorres, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; They slept on hard camp beds, rose at dawn, washed in cold water, and ate a simple porridge for breakfast.&lt;ref name=v4/&gt;

Olga left Gatchina for the first time in the early fall of 1888 when the imperial family visited the [[Caucasus]]. On 29 October,&lt;!--New Style date--&gt; their return train approached the small town of [[Borki (Kharkiv oblast)|Borki]] at speed. Olga's parents and their four older children were eating lunch in the dining-car when the train lurched violently and came off the rails. The carriage was torn open; the heavy iron roof caved in, and the wheels and floor of the car were sliced off. The Tsar crawled out from beneath the crushed roof, and held it up with &quot;a Herculean effort&quot; so that the others could escape.&lt;ref&gt;Vorres, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; There were 21 fatalities. Empress Marie helped tend the wounded, and made makeshift bandages from her own clothes.&lt;ref name=v12/&gt; An official investigation found that [[Borki train disaster|the crash]] was an accident,&lt;ref&gt;Phenix, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; but it was widely assumed that two bombs had been planted on the line.&lt;ref name=v12&gt;Vorres, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

The Grand Duchess and her siblings were taught at home by private tutors. Subjects included history, geography, Russian, English and French, as well as drawing and dancing.&lt;ref&gt;Vorres, pp. 18–20&lt;/ref&gt; Physical activities such as [[equestrianism]] were taught at an early age, and they became expert riders.&lt;ref&gt;Phenix, pp. 12–13; Vorres, pp. 26–27&lt;/ref&gt; The family was deeply religious. Although Christmas and Easter were times of celebration and extravagance, [[Lent]] was strictly observed—meat, dairy products and any form of entertainment were avoided.&lt;ref&gt;Vorres, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; Family holidays were taken in the summer at Peterhof and with Olga's grandparents in Denmark.&lt;ref&gt;Phenix, pp. 11, 24; Vorres, pp. 33–41&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Portrait of Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna.jpg|right|thumb|alt=Oil painting of Olga as a girl|Portrait of Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna in 1893 by [[Valentin Serov]]]]
Empress Marie was reserved and formal with Olga as a child, and their relationship remained a difficult one.&lt;ref&gt;Phenix, p. 8; Vorres, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; However, Olga, her father, and the youngest of her brothers, [[Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich of Russia|Michael]], had a close relationship. Together, the three frequently went on hikes within the Gatchina forests, where the Tsar taught Olga and Michael woodsmanship.&lt;ref&gt;Vorres, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; Olga said of her father:
{{quote|My father was everything to me. Immersed in work as he was, he always spared that daily half-hour.&amp;nbsp;… once my father showed me a very old album full of most exciting pen and ink sketches of an imaginary city called Mopsopolis, inhabited by Mopses [pug dogs]. He showed it to me in secret, and I was thrilled to have him share his own childhood secrets with me.&lt;ref&gt;Vorres, pp. 9–11&lt;/ref&gt;}}

During 1894 Olga's father became increasingly ill, and the annual trip to Denmark was cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;Vorres, pp. 48–52&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 November 1894,&lt;!--New style date--&gt; he died at the age of 49. The emotional impact on Olga, aged only 12, was traumatic,&lt;ref&gt;Phenix, pp. 30–31; Vorres, pp. 54, 57&lt;/ref&gt; and her eldest brother, the new [[Tsar Nicholas II]], was propelled into a role for which in Olga's later opinion he was ill-prepared.&lt;ref&gt;Vorres, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;

==Court life==
Olga was due to enter society in the summer of 1899, but after the death of her brother [[Grand Duke George Alexandrovich of Russia|George]] at the age of 27, her first official public appearance was delayed by a year until 1900.&lt;ref&gt;Phenix, p. 45; Vorres, pp. 72–74&lt;/ref&gt; She hated the experience, and later told her official biographer Ian Vorres, &quot;I felt as though I were an animal in a cage—exhibited to the public for the first time.&quot;&lt;ref name=v74&gt;Vorres, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; From 1901, Olga was appointed honorary Commander-in-Chief of the 12th Akhtyrsky Hussar Regiment of the [[Imperial Russian Army]]. The Akhtyrsky Hussars were famous for their victory over [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] at the [[Battle of Kulm]] in 1813, and wore a distinctive brown [[dolman]].&lt;ref name=romanoff4&gt;[http://history-gatchina.ru/owners/olga/olga4e.htm Kulikovsky-Romanoff, p. 4]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the age of 19, on 9 August 1901,&lt;!--New style date--&gt; she married 33-year-old [[Duke Peter Alexandrovich of Oldenburg]], a member of the Russian branch of the [[House of Oldenburg]], and the couple moved into a 200-room palace on Sergievskaya street in [[Saint Petersburg]].&lt;ref&gt;Vorres, p. 81&lt;/ref&gt; The marriage, announced in May, was not expected by many, as Peter had shown no prior interest in women,&lt;ref name=v74/&gt; and members of society assumed he was homosexual.&lt;ref&gt;Phenix, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; His proposal even came as a surprise to Olga, who later explained, &quot;I was so taken aback that all I could say was 'thank you'&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Vorres, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; Their marriage remained unconsummated,&lt;ref&gt;Olga said: &quot;I shared his roof for nearly fifteen years, and never once we were husband and wife&quot; (Vorres, p. 76); see also Massie, p. 171&lt;/ref&gt; and Olga suspected that Peter was pushed into proposing by his ambitious mother.&lt;ref&gt;Vorres, pp. 75, 78&lt;/ref&gt; Biographer Patricia Phenix thought Olga may have accepted his proposal to gain independence from her own mother, the Dowager Empress Marie, or avoid marriage into a foreign court.&lt;ref&gt;Phenix, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt;

Near the Oldenburg's estate, [[Ramon, Russia|Ramon]] in [[Voronezh Oblast|Voronezh province]], Olga had her own villa, called &quot;Olgino&quot; after the local town.&lt;ref&gt;Vorres, pp. 78–79&lt;/ref&gt; She subsidized the village school out of her own pocket, and established a hospital.&lt;ref name=romanoff3&gt;[http://history-gatchina.ru/owners/olga/olga3e.htm Kulikovsky-Romanoff, p. 3]&lt;/ref&gt; Her daughter-in-law later wrote, &quot;She tried to help every needy person as far as her strengths and means would permit.&quot;&lt;ref name=romanoff3/&gt; At the hospital, she learned basic medical treatment and proper care from the local doctor.&lt;ref&gt;Vorres, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; She exemplified her strong [[Russian Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] faith by creating religious icons, which she distributed to the charitable endeavours she supported.&lt;ref name=romanoff3/&gt;

In 1903, she was introduced to a Blue [[Cuirassier]] Guards officer [[Nikolai Kulikovsky]] by her brother Michael during a royal military review at [[Pavlovsk Palace]].&lt;ref&gt;Crawford and Crawford, p. 51; Phenix, p. 62; Vorres, pp. 94–95&lt;/ref&gt; Olga and Kulikovsky began to see each other, and exchanged letters regularly. The same year, at the age of 22, she confronted her husband and asked for a divorce, which he refused with the qualification that he might reconsider after seven years.&lt;ref&gt;Phenix, p. 63; Vorres, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Oldenburg appointed Kulikovsky as an [[aide-de-camp]], and allowed him to live in the same residence as Oldenburg and the Grand Duchess on Sergievskaya street.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford and Crawford, p. 52; Phenix, p. 73; Vorres, pp. 94–95&lt;/ref&gt; The relationship between Kulikovsky and the Grand Duchess was not public,&lt;ref&gt;Vorres, pp. 95–96&lt;/ref&gt; but gossip about their romance spread through society.&lt;ref&gt;''A Cuirassier's Memoirs'' by Vladimir Trubetskoy, quoted in Phenix, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1904 to 1906, Duke Peter was appointed to a military post in [[Tsarskoye Selo]], a complex of palaces just south of Saint Petersburg. In Tsarskoye Selo, the Grand Duchess grew close to her brother Nicholas and his family, who lived at the [[Alexander Palace]] near her own residence.&lt;ref&gt;Vorres, pp. 97–99, 101&lt;/ref&gt; Olga prized her connection to the Tsar's four daughters.&lt;ref name=v102&gt;Massie, p. 171; Vorres, pp. 102–103&lt;/ref&gt; From 1906 to 1914, Olga took her nieces to parties and engagements in Saint Petersburg, without their parents, every weekend throughout the winter.&lt;ref name=v102/&gt; She especially took a liking to the youngest of Nicholas's daughters, her god-daughter Anastasia, whom she called ''Shvipsik'' (&quot;little one&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;Phenix, p. 144; Vorres, pp. 98–99&lt;/ref&gt; Through her brother and sister-in-law, Olga met [[Rasputin]], a self-styled holy man who purported to have healing powers. Although she made no public criticisms of Rasputin's association with the imperial family, she was unconvinced of his supposed powers and privately disliked him.&lt;ref&gt;Phenix, pp. 73–83; Vorres, pp. 127–139&lt;/ref&gt; As Olga grew close to her brother's family, her relationship with her other surviving brother, Michael, deteriorated. To her and Nicholas's horror, Michael eloped with his mistress, a twice-divorced commoner, and communication between Michael and the rest of the family was essentially cut off.&lt;ref&gt;Phenix, pp. 85–88; Vorres, pp. 108–109&lt;/ref&gt;

Public unrest over the [[Russo-Japanese War]] and [[1905 Russian Revolution|demands for political reform]] increased in the early years of the twentieth century. At [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]] 1905, a band of revolutionaries fired live rounds at the [[Winter Palace]] from the [[Peter and Paul Fortress]]. Olga and the Dowager Empress were showered with glass splinters from a smashed window, but were unharmed.&lt;ref&gt;Phenix, p. 68; Vorres, p. 111&lt;/ref&gt; Three weeks later, on &quot;[[Bloody Sunday (1905)|Bloody Sunday]]&quot;, at least 92 people were killed by [[Cossack]] troops during a demonstration,&lt;ref&gt;Phenix, p. 69; Vorres, p. 111&lt;/ref&gt; and a month later Olga's uncle, [[Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich of Russia]], was assassinated.&lt;ref&gt;Phenix, p. 69; Vorres, p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; Uprisings occurred throughout the country, and parts of the navy mutinied.&lt;ref&gt;Vorres, p. 113&lt;/ref&gt; Olga supported the appointment of the liberal [[Pyotr Stolypin]] as prime minister, and he embarked on a [[Stolypin reform|programme of gradual reform]], but in 1911 he was assassinated.&lt;ref&gt;Vorres, pp. 117–119&lt;/ref&gt; The public unrest, Michael's elopement, and Olga's sham marriage placed her under strain, and in 1912, while visiting England with her mother, she suffered a nervous breakdown.&lt;ref&gt;Phenix, p. 89; Vorres, pp. 121–122&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alexandra Feodorovna (Alix of Hesse)|Tsarina Alexandra]] was also unwell with fatigue, concerned by the poor health of her [[hemophilia]]c son, [[Tsarevich Alexei Nikolaevich of Russia|Alexei]].&lt;ref&gt;Vorres, p. 122&lt;/ref&gt; Olga stood in for the Tsarina at public events, and accompanied her brother on a tour of the interior, while the Tsarina remained at home.&lt;ref&gt;Vorres, p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 August 1914, just before the start of [[World War I]], Olga's regiment, the Akhtyrsky Hussars, appeared at an Imperial Review before her and the Tsar at [[Krasnoe Selo]].&lt;ref&gt;Vorres, p. 125&lt;/ref&gt; Kulikovsky volunteered for service with the Hussars, who were stationed on the frontlines in Southwestern Russia.&lt;ref name=romanoff4/&gt; With the Grand Duchess's prior medical knowledge from the village of Olgino, she started work as a nurse at an under-staffed Red Cross hospital in [[Rovno]], near to where her own regiment was stationed.&lt;ref&gt;Phenix, pp. 91–92; Vorres, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; During the war, she came under heavy Austrian fire while attending the regiment at the front. Nurses rarely worked so close to the frontlines and consequently she was awarded the [[Order of St. George]] by [[Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim|General Mannerheim]], who later became [[President of Finland]].&lt;ref name=romanoff4/&gt; As the Russians lost ground to the [[Central Powers]], Olga's hospital was moved eastwards to [[Kiev]],&lt;ref&gt;Phenix, p. 93; Vorres, p. 143&lt;/ref&gt; and Michael returned to Russia from exile abroad.&lt;ref&gt;Phenix, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fall of the House of Romanov==
[[File:Romanovs1914.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Russian imperial family, 1914. Left to right: [[Grand Duchess Olga Nikolaevna of Russia|Grand Duchess Olga Nikolaevna]], [[Grand Duchess Maria Nikolaevna of Russia (1899–1918)|Grand Duchess Maria]], [[Nicholas II of Russia|Tsar Nicholas II]], [[Alexandra Feodorovna (Alix of Hesse)|Tsarina Alexandra]], [[Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia|Grand Duchess Anastasia]], [[Tsarevich Alexei Nikolaevich of Russia|Tsarevitch Alexei]], [[Grand Duchess Tatiana Nikolaevna of Russia|Grand Duchess Tatiana]]|alt=Black-and-white photograph of Nicholas II and family]]

In 1916, [[Tsar Nicholas II]] officially annulled the marriage between Duke Peter Alexandrovich and the Grand Duchess, allowing her to marry Colonel Kulikovsky.&lt;ref&gt;Phenix, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; The service was performed on 16 November 1916&lt;!--New Style date--&gt; in the Kievo-Vasilievskaya Church on Triokhsviatitelskaya (Three Saints Street) in [[Kiev]]. The only guests were the Dowager Empress [[Maria Feodorovna (Dagmar of Denmark)|Marie]], Olga's brother-in-law [[Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich of Russia|Grand Duke Alexander]], four officers of the Akhtyrsky Regiment, and two of Olga's fellow nurses from the hospital in Kiev.&lt;ref&gt;Grand Duke Alexander's Memoirs, ''Once A Grand Duke'', p. 273, quoted in Phenix, p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;

During the war, internal tensions and economic deprivation in Russia continued to mount and revolutionary sympathies grew. After Tsar Nicholas II abdicated in early 1917, many members of the Romanov dynasty, including Nicholas and his immediate family, were detained under house arrest. In search of safety, the Dowager Empress, Grand Duke Alexander, and Grand Duchess Olga travelled to the [[Crimea]] by special train, where they were joined by Olga's sister [[Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna of Russia|Grand Duchess Xenia]].&lt;ref&gt;Phenix, pp. 115–117; Vorres, pp. 149–150&lt;/ref&gt; They lived at Alexander's estate, Ay-Todor, about 12&amp;nbsp;miles (19&amp;nbsp;km) from [[Yalta]], where they were placed under house arrest by the local forces.&lt;ref&gt;Phenix, p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 August 1917, her first child and son, Tikhon Nikolaevich was born during their virtual imprisonment. He was named after [[Tikhon of Zadonsk]], the Saint venerated near the Grand Duchess's estate at Olgino.&lt;ref name=romanoff4/&gt; Although Tikhon was the grandson of an emperor and the nephew of another, neither he nor his younger brother Guri received any title as his father was a commoner.

The Romanovs isolated in the Crimea knew little of the fate of the Tsar and his family. Nicholas, Alexandra, and their children, were originally held at their official residence, the Alexander Palace, but the Provisional government under [[Alexander Kerensky]] relocated them to [[Tobolsk]], [[Siberia]]. In February 1918, most of the imperial family at Ay-Todor was moved to another estate at Djulber, where Grand Dukes [[Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich of Russia (1856–1929)|Nicholas]] and [[Grand Duke Peter Nikolaevich of Russia|Peter]] were already under house arrest. Olga and her husband were left at Ay-Todor. The entire Romanov family in the Crimea was condemned to death by the [[Yalta]] revolutionary council, but the executions were delayed by political rivalry between the Yalta and [[Sevastopol]] [[Soviet]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Phenix, pp. 122–123; Vorres, pp. 155–156&lt;/ref&gt; By March 1918, the [[Central Powers|Central Power]] of [[Germany]] had advanced on the Crimea, and the revolutionary guards were replaced by German ones.&lt;ref&gt;Phenix, pp. 123–125; Vorres, pp. 156–157&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1918, the German forces were informed that their nation had lost the war, and they evacuated homewards. [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] forces took over the Crimean ports, in support of the loyalist [[White Army]], which temporarily allowed the surviving members of the Romanov family time to escape abroad. The Dowager Empress Marie and, at her insistence, most of her family and friends were evacuated by the British warship [[HMS Marlborough (1912)|HMS ''Marlborough'']]. Nicholas II, however, had already been assassinated and the family assumed, correctly, that [[Shooting of the Romanov family|his wife and children had also been killed]].&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Letter from [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]] to [[Princess Victoria of Hesse and by Rhine|Victoria, Marchioness of Milford Haven]], 2 September 1918, quoted in Hough, p. 326&lt;/ref&gt; Unknown to her, Olga's childhood confidant and brother [[Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich of Russia|Michael]], the emperor's supposed successor, had been assassinated near [[Perm]] on 13 June 1918.

Olga and her husband refused to leave Russia, and decided to move to the Caucasus, which the [[White Army]] had cleared of revolutionary [[Bolsheviks]].&lt;ref&gt;Phenix, p. 128; Vorres, p. 159&lt;/ref&gt; An imperial bodyguard, Timofei Yatchik, guided them to his hometown, the large [[Cossack]] village of Novominskaya. In a rented five-roomed farmhouse there, Olga gave birth to her second son, Guri Nikolaevich, on 23 April 1919.&lt;ref&gt;Phenix, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; He was named after a friend of hers, Guri Panayev, who was killed while serving in the Akhtyrsky Regiment during [[World War I]]. In November 1919, the family set out on what would be their last journey through Russia. Just ahead of revolutionary troops, they escaped to [[Novorossiysk]], and took refuge in the residence of the Danish consul, Thomas Schytte, who informed them of the Dowager Empress's safe arrival in [[Denmark]].&lt;ref name=romanoff5&gt;[http://history-gatchina.ru/owners/olga/olga5e.htm Kulikovsky-Romanoff, p. 5]&lt;/ref&gt; After a brief stay with the consul, the family were shipped to a refugee camp on the island of [[Büyükada]] in the [[Dardanelles]] Strait near [[Istanbul, Turkey]], where Olga, her husband and children shared three rooms with eleven other adults.&lt;ref&gt;Phenix, p. 132&lt;/ref&gt; After two weeks, they were evacuated to [[Belgrade]] in the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] where she was visited by Regent Alexander Karageorgevich, later King [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia]]. Alexander offered the Grand Duchess and her family a permanent home, but Olga was summoned to Denmark by her mother.&lt;ref name=romanoff5/&gt; On Good Friday 1920, Olga and her family arrived in Copenhagen. They lived with the Dowager Empress Marie, at first at the [[Amalienborg Palace]] and then at the royal estate of [[Hvidøre (building)|Hvidøre]], where Olga acted as her mother's secretary and companion.&lt;ref&gt;Vorres, pp. 167–171&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anna Anderson==
[[File:Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna.jpg|thumb|right|Olga's niece, Anastasia, was killed in 1918, but her body was not discovered until after Olga's death. Uncertainty over her fate led to her impersonation.|alt=Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna]]
In 1925, Olga and Colonel Kulikovsky travelled to Berlin to meet [[Anna Anderson]], who claimed to be Olga's niece, [[Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia]]. Anderson had attempted suicide in Berlin in 1920, which Olga later called &quot;probably the only indisputable fact in the whole story&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Olga quoted in Vorres, p. 173&lt;/ref&gt; Anderson claimed that with the help of a man named Tchaikovsky she had escaped from revolutionary Russia via [[Bucharest]], where she had given birth to his child. Olga thought the story &quot;palpably false&quot;,&lt;ref name=v175&gt;Olga quoted in Vorres, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; since Anderson made no attempt to approach Queen [[Marie of Romania]], during her entire alleged time in Bucharest. Olga said:
{{quote|If Mrs. Anderson had indeed been Anastasia, Queen Marie would have recognized her on the spot.&amp;nbsp;... Marie would never have been shocked at anything, and a niece of mine would have known it.&amp;nbsp;... There is not one tittle of genuine evidence in the story. The woman keeps away from the one relative who would have been the first to recognize her, understand her desperate plight, and symphathize with her.&lt;ref name=v175/&gt;}}

Anderson stated she was in Berlin to inform [[Princess Irene of Hesse and by Rhine|Princess Irene of Prussia]] (sister of [[Alexandra Feodorovna (Alix of Hesse)|Tsarina Alexandra]] and cousin of [[Tsar Nicholas II]]) of her survival. Olga commented, &quot;[Princess Irene] was one of the most straightlaced women in her generation. My niece would have known that her condition would have indeed have shocked [her].&quot;&lt;ref name=v175/&gt;

Olga met Anderson, who was being treated for [[tuberculosis]], at a nursing home. Of the visit Olga later said:
{{quote|My beloved Anastasia was fifteen when I saw her for the last time in the summer of 1916. She would have been twenty-four in 1925. I thought Mrs. Anderson looked much older than that. Of course, one had to make allowances for a very long illness&amp;nbsp;... All the same, my niece's features could not possibly have altered out of all recognition. The nose, the mouth, the eyes were all different.&lt;ref&gt;Olga quoted in Massie, p. 174 and Vorres, p. 174&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;... As soon as I sat down by that bed in the Mommsen Nursing Home, I knew I was looking at a stranger.&amp;nbsp;… I had left Denmark with something of a hope in my heart. I left Berlin with all hope extinguished.&lt;ref name=v176&gt;Olga quoted in Vorres, p. 176&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In addition, Olga said she was dismayed that Anderson spoke only German and showed no sign of knowing either English or Russian, while Anastasia spoke both those languages fluently and was ignorant of German.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;My nieces knew no German at all. Mrs. Anderson did not seem to understand a word of Russian or English, the two languages all the four sisters had spoken since babyhood.&quot;: Olga quoted in Vorres, p. 174&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Olga remained sympathetic towards Anderson, perhaps because she thought that she was ill rather than deliberately deceitful.&lt;ref&gt;Klier and Mingay, p. 156; Vorres, p. 176&lt;/ref&gt; Olga later explained:
{{quote|...&amp;nbsp;she did not strike me as an out-and-out impostor. Her brusqueness warred against it. A cunning impostor would have done all she could to ingratiate herself&amp;nbsp;... But Mrs. Anderson's manner would have put anyone off. My own conviction is that it all started with some unscrupulous people who hoped they might lay their hands on at least a share of the fabulous and utterly non-existent Romanov fortune&amp;nbsp;... I had a feeling she was 'briefed,' as it were, but far from perfectly. The mistakes she made could not all be attributed to lapses of memory. For instance, she had a scar on one of her fingers and she kept telling everybody that it had been crushed because of a footman shutting the door of a landau too quickly. And at once I remembered the real incident. It was Marie, her elder sister, who got her hand hurt rather badly, and it did not happen in a carriage but on board the imperial train. Obviously someone, having heard something of the incident, had passed a garbled version of it to Mrs. Anderson.&lt;ref name=v176/&gt;}}
&lt;!--&quot;I had the impression she was getting tired of playing a part someone had assigned to her. She nearly admitted to me that some people always told her what she was to say&amp;nbsp;... She did in fact admit that a scar, allegedly resulting from the blows on her head at Ekaterinburg, had been caused by her tubercular condition.&amp;nbsp;...I neither hugged nor kissed the woman. Indeed, I spoke very formally, using the German ''Sie'' all through. I would not have dreamt of saying ''Du'' to a stranger.&quot;&lt;ref name= v177/--&gt;
&lt;!--&quot;... I have said once and for all that the whole thing is a scam. I don't know who is behind that unfortunate person, but she is not Anastasia. The real one was killed together with all the others, about that there is no doubt.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Olga quoted by Aage Heinberg in Phenix, p. 216&lt;/ref--&gt;
Conceivably, Olga was initially either open to the possibility that Anderson was Anastasia or unable to make up her mind.&lt;ref&gt;Klier and Mingay, p. 102; Massie, p. 174; Phenix, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; Anderson's biographer and supporter Peter Kurth claimed that Olga wrote to the Danish ambassador, [[Herluf Zahle]], at the end of October 1925: &quot;My feeling is that she is not the one she believes—but one can't say she is not as a fact&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Olga to Herluf Zahle, 31 October 1925, quoted in Kurth, p. 119, but with a proviso that the original letter has never been seen&lt;/ref&gt; However, within a month she had made up her mind. She wrote to a friend, &quot;There is no resemblance, and she is undoubtedly not A.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Olga to Colonel Anatoly Mordvinov, 4 December 1925, ''Oberlandesgericht'' Archive, Hamburg, quoted in Kurth, p. 120&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Olga wrote in a letter to Tatiana Melnik, 30 October 1926, Botkin Archive, quoted in Kurth, p. 144; and a letter dated 13 September 1926 quoted in von Nidda, pp. 197–198: &quot;However hard we tried to recognize this patient as my niece Tatiana or Anastasia, we all came away quite convinced of the reverse.&quot; In a letter from Olga to Princess Irene, 22 December 1926, quoted in von Nidda, p. 168, she wrote, &quot;I had to go to Berlin last autumn to see the poor girl said to be our dear little niece. Well, there is no resemblance at all, and it is obviously not Anastasia&amp;nbsp;... It was pitiful to watch this poor creature trying to prove she was Anastasia. She showed her feet, a finger with a scar and other marks which she said were bound to be recognized at once. But it was Maria who had a crushed finger, and someone must have told her this. For four years this poor creature's head was stuffed with all these stories&amp;nbsp;... It has been claimed, however, that we all recognized her and were then given instructions by Mama to deny that she was Anastasia. That is a complete lie. I believe this whole story is an attempt at blackmail.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Olga sent Anderson a scarf and five letters, which were used by Anderson's supporters to claim that Olga recognized Anderson as Anastasia.&lt;ref&gt;Klier and Mingay, p. 102; Vorres, p. 177&lt;/ref&gt; Olga later said she sent the gift and letters &quot;out of pity&quot;,&lt;ref name=v177&gt;Olga quoted in Vorres, p. 177&lt;/ref&gt; and called the claims &quot;a complete fabrication&quot;.&lt;ref name= v177/&gt; When Olga refused to recognize Anderson as Anastasia publicly and published a statement denying any resemblance in a Danish newspaper,&lt;ref&gt;''National Tidende'', 16 January 1926, quoted in Klier and Mingay, p. 102 and Phenix, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; Anderson's supporters, [[Harriet von Rathlef]] and [[Gleb Botkin]], claimed that Olga was acting on instructions received from her sister Xenia by telegram, which Olga denied in private letters and sworn testimony.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;I can swear to God that I did not receive before or during my visit to Berlin, either a telegram or a letter from my sister Xenia advising that I should not acknowledge the stranger.&quot;: Sworn testimony of Grand Duchess Olga, Staatsarchiv Hamburg, File 1991 74 0 297/57 Volume 7, pp. 1297–1315, quoted in Phenix, p. 238&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;They state that we all recognized her and that we then received an order from Mama to say that she is not Anastasia. This is a great lie!&quot;: Letter from Olga to Princess Irene, quoted in Klier and Mingay, p. 149&lt;/ref&gt; She told her official biographer, &quot;I never received any such telegram.&quot;&lt;ref name= v177/&gt; The supposed telegram was never produced by Anderson's supporters, and it has never been found among any of the papers relating to the case.&lt;ref&gt;Phenix, p. 238&lt;/ref&gt; Xenia said,
{{quote|[Anderson's supporters] told the most terrible lies about my sister and me&amp;nbsp;... I was supposed to have sent Olga a telegram saying, 'On no account recognize Anastasia.' That was a fantasy. I never sent any telegrams, or gave my sister any advice about her visit to Berlin. We were all apprehensive about the wisdom of her going, but only because we feared it would be used for propaganda purposes by the claimant's supporters.&amp;nbsp;... My sister Olga felt sorry for that poor woman. She was kind to her, and because of her kindness of heart, her opinions and motives have been misrepresented.&lt;ref&gt;Xenia to Michael Thornton, quoted in a letter from Thornton to Patricia Phenix, January 10, 1998, quoted in Phenix, pp. 237–238&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Danish residency and exodus==
[[Image:royaldanishguard2.jpg|thumb|left|''Royal Danish Guard'' (1935), painted by the Grand Duchess in exile in Denmark|alt=Painting by Olga of a young guardsman in a two-toned blue uniform striding forward on the pavement of a cobbled street; behind him a well-dressed lady in a wide-brimmed hat walks with a small child and a pet dog, and a 1930s motor car and bicycle are in the street]]

The Dowager Empress died on 13 October 1928 at Hvidøre. Her estate was sold and Olga purchased ''Knudsminde'', a farm in [[Ballerup]] about 15&amp;nbsp;miles (24&amp;nbsp;km) from Copenhagen, with her portion of the proceeds.&lt;ref&gt;Phenix, p. 168; Vorres, p. 185&lt;/ref&gt; Her farm-estate became a centre for the Russian monarchist community in Denmark and many [[White émigré|Russian emigrants]] visited.&lt;ref&gt;Phenix, p. 170&lt;/ref&gt; She maintained a high level of correspondence with the Russian émigré community and former members of the Russian imperial army.&lt;ref name=romanoff5/&gt; In the 1930s, the family took annual holidays at [[Sofiero Castle]], Sweden, with [[Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden|Crown Prince Gustaf of Sweden]] and his wife, [[Louise Mountbatten|Louise]].&lt;ref&gt;Vorres, p. 186&lt;/ref&gt; Olga began to sell her own paintings of Russian and Danish scenes, with exhibition auctions in Copenhagen, London, Paris, and Berlin. Some of the proceeds were donated to the charities she supported.&lt;ref name=romanoff5/&gt;

Neutral Denmark was invaded by [[Nazi Germany]] on 9 April 1940, and was occupied for the remainder of [[World War II]]. Food shortages, communication restrictions, and transportation closures followed. As Olga's sons, Tikhon and Guri, served as officers in the [[Danish Army]], they were interned as prisoners of war, but their imprisonment in a Copenhagen hotel lasted less than two months.&lt;ref&gt;Phenix, p. 174&lt;/ref&gt; Tikhon was imprisoned for a further month in 1943 after being arrested on charges of espionage.&lt;ref&gt;Phenix, p. 176&lt;/ref&gt; Other Russian émigrés, keen to fight against the Soviets, enlisted in the German forces. Despite her sons' internment and her mother's Danish origins, Olga was implicated in her compatriots' collusion with German forces, as she continued to meet and extend help to Russian émigrés fighting against communism.&lt;ref&gt;Phenix, p. 176; Vorres, p. 187&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 May 1945, German forces in Denmark surrendered to the British. When economic and social conditions for Russian exiles failed to improve, General [[Pyotr Krasnov]] wrote to the Grand Duchess, detailing the wretched conditions affecting Russian immigrants in Denmark.&lt;ref name=romanoff6&gt;[http://history-gatchina.ru/owners/olga/olga6e.htm Kulikovsky-Romanoff, p. 6]&lt;/ref&gt; She in turn asked [[Prince Axel of Denmark]] to help them, but her request was refused.&lt;ref&gt;Phenix, p. 178&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Soviet Union]] wrote to the Danish government accusing Olga and a Danish Catholic bishop of conspiracy against the Soviet government.&lt;ref&gt;Phenix, p. 179&lt;/ref&gt; With the end of World War II, Soviet troops came close to the Danish border, and the surviving Romanovs in Denmark grew fearful of an assassination or kidnap attempt.&lt;ref&gt;Phenix, pp. 179–180; Vorres, pp. 187–188&lt;/ref&gt; Olga decided to move her family across the Atlantic to the relative safety of rural Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Mr. J. S. P. Armstrong, Agent General for Ontario, quoted in Vorres, p. 191&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emigration to Canada and death==
In May 1948, the Kulikovskys travelled to London by Danish [[troopship]]. They were housed in a [[grace and favour]] apartment at [[Hampton Court Palace]] while arrangements were made for their journey to Canada as agricultural immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;Vorres, pp. 188, 190&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 June 1948, Olga, Kulikovsky, Tikhon and his Danish-born wife Agnete, Guli and his Danish-born wife Ruth, Guli and Ruth's two children, Xenia and Leonid, and Olga's devoted companion and former maid Emilia Tenso (&quot;Mimka&quot;) departed [[Liverpool]] on board the ''[[RMS Empress of Canada (1928)|Empress of Canada]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Vorres, p. 193&lt;/ref&gt; After a rough crossing, the ship docked at [[City of Halifax|Halifax, Nova Scotia]].&lt;ref&gt;Vorres, p. 196&lt;/ref&gt; The family proceeded to [[Toronto]], where they lived until they purchased a {{convert|200|acre|km2|adj=on}} farm in [[Halton County, Ontario]], near [[Campbellville, Ontario|Campbellville]].&lt;ref&gt;Vorres, pp. 196–198&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1952, the farm had become a burden to Olga and her husband. They were both elderly; their sons had moved away; labour was hard to come by; the Colonel suffered increasing ill-health, and some of Olga's remaining jewellery was stolen.&lt;ref&gt;Vorres, pp. 207–208&lt;/ref&gt; The farm was sold, and Olga, her husband and her former maid, Mimka, moved to a smaller 5-room house at 2130 Camilla Road, [[Cooksville, Ontario]], a suburb of Toronto now amalgamated into the city of [[Mississauga]].&lt;ref&gt;Phenix, pp. 205–206; Vorres, p. 209&lt;/ref&gt; Mimka suffered a stroke that left her an invalid, and Olga nursed her until Mimka's death on 24 January 1954.&lt;ref&gt;Phenix, p. 207; Vorres, p. 210&lt;/ref&gt;

Neighbours and visitors to the region, including foreign and royal dignitaries, took interest in Olga, and visited her small home, which was also a magnet for [[Romanov impostors]] whom Olga and her family considered a menace.&lt;ref&gt;Vorres, pp. 200–205&lt;/ref&gt; Welcome visitors included [[Princess Marina, Duchess of Kent]], in 1954,&lt;ref&gt;Phenix, p. 214; Vorres, p. 211&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Louis Mountbatten]] and his wife [[Edwina Mountbatten, Countess Mountbatten of Burma|Edwina]], in August 1959.&lt;ref&gt;Vorres, p. 221&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1959, [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] and [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Prince Philip]] visited Toronto and invited the Grand Duchess for lunch onboard the [[Royal Yacht]], [[HMY Britannia|''Britannia'']].&lt;ref&gt;Phenix, pp. 238–239; Vorres, p. 207&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1958, Olga's husband was virtually paralyzed, and Olga sold some of her remaining jewellery in an attempt to raise funds.&lt;ref&gt;Vorres, p. 219&lt;/ref&gt; Following her husband's death in 1958, she became increasingly infirm until hospitalized in April 1960 at [[Toronto General Hospital]].&lt;ref&gt;Phenix, pp. 240–242; Vorres, p. 224&lt;/ref&gt; She was not informed&lt;ref&gt;Vorres, p. 225&lt;/ref&gt; or was not aware&lt;ref&gt;Phenix, p. 242&lt;/ref&gt; that her elder sister, [[Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna of Russia|Xenia]], died in London that month. Unable to care for herself, Olga went to stay with Russian émigré friends, Konstantin and Sinaida Martemianoff, in an apartment above a beauty salon in [[Gerrard Street (Toronto)|Gerrard Street East, Toronto]].&lt;ref&gt;Phenix, p. 243; Vorres, p. 226&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 November 1960, she slipped into a coma, and she died on 24 November, at the age of 78.&lt;ref&gt;Vorres, p. 227&lt;/ref&gt;

She was interred next to her husband in [[York Cemetery, Toronto]], on 30 November 1960, after a funeral service at Christ the Saviour Cathedral, Toronto.&lt;!--Attended by Princess Vera of Russia as well as Olga's family--&gt; Officers of the Akhtyrsky Hussars and the Blue Cuirassiers stood guard in the small Russian church, which overflowed with mourners.&lt;ref&gt;Phenix, pp. 246–247; Vorres, pp. 228–230&lt;/ref&gt; Although she lived simply, bought cheap clothes, and did her own shopping and gardening, her estate was valued at more than 200,000 Canadian dollars (about 1.5 million Canadian dollars as of 2010&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bankofcanada.ca/en/rates/inflation_calc.html CPI inflation calculator], Bank of Canada, retrieved 2 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;) and was mostly held as stock and bonds.&lt;ref&gt;Phenix, p. 249&lt;/ref&gt; Her material possessions were appraised at 350 Canadian dollars in total, which biographer Patricia Phenix considered an underestimate.&lt;ref&gt;Phenix, p. 250&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
[[Image:villageautumn.jpg|right|thumb|alt=Painting by Olga of a Russian church with blue onion domes, partially obscured behind trees in autumnal colors|''Village Church in Autumn'' (1920), watercolour painting by the Grand Duchess]]
Olga began drawing and painting at a young age. She told her official biographer Ian Vorres:
{{quote|Even during my geography and arithmetic lessons, I was allowed to sit with a pencil in my hand. I could listen much better when I was drawing corn or wild flowers.&lt;ref&gt;Vorres, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;}}
She painted throughout her life, on paper, canvas and ceramic, and her output is estimated at over 2,000 pieces.&lt;ref name=si&gt;Vorres, Ian (2000) [http://www.si.edu/oahp/olga/ &quot;After the Splendor... The Art of the Last Romanov Grand Duchess of Russia&quot;], Smithsonian Institution, retrieved 9 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Her usual medium was scenery and landscape, but she also painted portraits and still lifes. Vorres wrote,
{{quote|Her paintings, vivid and sensitive, are immersed in the subdued light of her beloved Russia. Besides her numerous landscapes and flower pictures that reveal her inherent love for nature, she often also dwells on scenes from simple daily life&amp;nbsp;... executed with a sensitive eye for composition, expression and detail. Her work exudes peace, serenity and a spirit of love that mirror her own character, in total contrast to the suffering she experienced through most of her life.&lt;ref name=si/&gt;}}
Her daughter-in-law wrote,
{{quote|Being a deeply religious person, the Grand Duchess perceived the beauty of nature as being divinely inspired creation. Prayer and attending church provided her with the strength not only to overcome the new difficulties befallen her, but also to continue with her drawing. These feelings of gratefulness to God pervaded not only the icons created by the Grand Duchess, but also her portraits and still life paintings.&lt;ref name=romanoff6/&gt;}}

Her paintings were a profitable source of income.&lt;ref&gt;Grand Duchess Olga, quoted in [http://history-gatchina.ru/owners/olga/olga7e.htm Kulikovsky-Romanoff, p. 7]&lt;/ref&gt; According to her daughter-in-law, Olga preferred to exhibit in Denmark to avoid the commercialism of the North American market.&lt;ref&gt;[http://history-gatchina.ru/owners/olga/olga8e.htm Kulikovsky-Romanoff, p. 8]&lt;/ref&gt; The Russian Relief Programme, which was founded by Tikhon and his third wife Olga in honour of the Grand Duchess,&lt;ref&gt;Phenix, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; exhibited a selection of her work at the residence of the Russian ambassador in Washington in 2001, in Moscow in 2002, in [[Ekaterinburg]] in 2004, in Saint Petersburg and Moscow in 2005, in [[Tyumen]] and [[Surgut]] in 2006, and at the [[Tretyakov Gallery]] in Moscow and [[Saint Michael's Castle]] in Saint Petersburg in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rusmuseum.ru/eng/exhib/lenta/exhibition2007/exhibition203/ &quot;Majestic Artist: 125th birth anniversary of Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna&quot;], Russian State Museum, retrieved 9 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Pieces by Olga are included in the collections of [[Queen Elizabeth II]], [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]], [[Harald V of Norway|King Harald of Norway]], and private collections in North America and Europe.&lt;ref name=si/&gt; [[Ballerup]] Museum in Pederstrup, Denmark, has around 100 of her works.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ballerupmuseum.dk/eng Ballerup Museum], retrieved 9 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
