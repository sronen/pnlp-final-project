[[Dom (title)|Dom]] '''Afonso''' (23 February 1845&amp;nbsp;– 11 June 1847) was the Prince Imperial and [[heir apparent]] to the throne of the [[Empire of Brazil]]. Born in [[Rio de Janeiro]], he was the eldest child of Emperor Dom [[Pedro II of Brazil|Pedro&amp;nbsp;II]] and Dona [[Teresa Cristina of the Two Sicilies]], and thus a member of the Brazilian branch of the [[House of Braganza]]. With the birth of his child, the insecure and shy 19-year-old Emperor Pedro&amp;nbsp;II became more mature and outgoing. Afonso's arrival also fostered a closer and happier relationship between his parents, who had not married for love.

Afonso died from epilepsy at the age of two, devastating the emperor. After the subsequent loss of his other son, doubts grew in Pedro&amp;nbsp;II's mind that the imperial system could be viable. He still had an heir in his daughter [[Isabel, Princess Imperial of Brazil|Isabel]], but he was unconvinced that a female would prove to be a suitable successor. He became careless about the effects of his policies on the monarchy, provided his daughter Isabel with no training for her role as potential empress, and failed to cultivate her acceptance within the country's political class. Pedro&amp;nbsp;II's disinterest in protecting the imperial system ultimately led to its downfall.

Afonso was born on 23 February 1845 in the [[Paço de São Cristóvão|Palace of São Cristóvão]], in [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Empire of Brazil|Brazil]].{{sfn|Laemmert|1847|p=35}} His full name was Afonso Pedro de Alcântara Cristiano Leopoldo Filipe Eugênio Miguel Gabriel Rafael Gonzaga.{{sfn|Laemmert|1847|p=35}} Through his father, Emperor [[Pedro II of Brazil|Pedro&amp;nbsp;II]], he was a member of the Brazilian branch of the [[House of Braganza]] (Portuguese: ''Bragança'') and was referred to using the honorific &quot;Dom&quot; ([[Lord]]) from birth.{{sfn|Barman|1999|p=424}} Afonso was the grandson of Emperor [[Pedro&amp;nbsp;I of Brazil]] and nephew of Queen [[Maria&amp;nbsp;II of Portugal]].{{sfn|Schwarcz|1998|p=47}} Through his mother, Teresa Cristina, he was a grandson of Francesco&amp;nbsp;I ([[Francis I of the Two Sicilies|Francis&amp;nbsp;I]]) and nephew to Ferdinando&amp;nbsp;II ([[Ferdinand II of the Two Sicilies|Ferdinand&amp;nbsp;II]]), who ruled as [[List of monarchs of the Two Sicilies|kings of the Two Sicilies]] in turn.{{sfn|Calmon|1975|p=210}}

As was customary within the House of Braganza, Afonso's birth was a formal event attended by the royal court.{{sfn|Barman|1999|p=110}} Pedro&amp;nbsp;II immediately presented the new born baby to the throng gathered in the palace, announcing &quot;Gentlemen, here is a Prince whom God&amp;nbsp;...&quot;—here he was overcome with emotion and was unable to continue.{{sfn|Calmon|1975|p=274}}{{sfn|Lyra 1977, Vol 1|p=139}} [[Luís Alves de Lima e Silva, Duke of Caxias|Luís Alves de Lima e Silva]] (then Baron and later Duke of Caxias) wrote to his father: &quot;No one was happier than I with the news [of the prince's birth]&quot;.{{sfn|Calmon|1975|p=276}}

Afonso was healthy, and as the eldest son of Pedro&amp;nbsp;II, was heir to the throne and styled &quot;Prince Imperial&quot;.{{sfn|Calmon|1975|p=274}}{{sfn|Lyra 1977, Vol 1|p=139}} The young prince resembled his father, particularly in his face, hair and eyes.{{sfn|Diener|Costa|2002|p=79}} Because of his gender and position as heir apparent, he became the center of attention, particularly for Pedro&amp;nbsp;II.{{sfn|Barman|2002|p=24}} A letter written by Pedro&amp;nbsp;II to his elder sister Maria&amp;nbsp;II a few months after the birth of his second child—a daughter named [[Isabel, Princess Imperial of Brazil|Isabel]]—displayed his happiness: &quot;No news here save the good state of health of myself, of the empress, and of the little ones, who are becoming increasingly cute, principally little Afonso, who is already walking and who says many words, still half incomprehensible, which increases their charm.&quot;{{sfn|Barman|2002|pp=23–24}}

=== Death ===

On 11 June 1847, the young prince was playing in the library of the palace when he experienced a series of strong convulsions and died, not quite two and a half years old.{{sfn|Calmon|1975|p=317}} His death revealed that Afonso suffered from [[epilepsy]], as did his father.{{sfn|Barman|1999|p=48}}

The grief of Pedro&amp;nbsp;II and his wife was enormous. It was feared that the shock might affect Teresa Cristina's health, as she was pregnant at the time with her third child. She later gave birth without complications on 13 July to a girl, who was christened [[Princess Leopoldina of Brazil|Leopoldina]].{{sfn|Barman|2002|p=24}} The devastated emperor wrote a letter to his stepmother, the Empress [[Amélie of Leuchtenberg|Amélia]], dated 11 July 1847, telling her of Afonso's death: &quot;With the most piercing grief I tell you that my little Afonso, your godson, unfortunately died of convulsions, which he suffered during five hours on the 4th of last month;{{efn|name=death date}} and a few days ago little Isabel was put at risk by a strong attack of convulsions that greatly frightened me.&quot;{{sfn|Barman|2002|p=24}}

A grand state funeral—not seen since the death of Pedro&amp;nbsp;II's sister Paula in 1833—was held for the Prince Imperial at 7&amp;nbsp;p.m. three days after his death.{{sfn|Calmon|1975|p=317}} He is buried alongside other members of the Brazilian House of Braganza (including his younger brother [[Pedro, Prince Imperial of Brazil|Pedro]], his uncle [[João Carlos, Prince of Beira|João]] and his aunt Paula) in the mausoleum of the ''Convento de Santo Antônio'' (Convent of Saint Anthony) in Rio de Janeiro.{{sfn|Calmon|1975|p=317}}

Photograph taken about 15 years after his death.]]
The prince's early death (and the later demise of his younger brother) had an enormous impact on Pedro&amp;nbsp;II: on a personal level, on his future conduct as monarch, and on the empire. In his eyes, the deaths of his only sons seemed to presage the end of the imperial system. Although the emperor still had a legal successor in his daughter Isabel, in the male-dominated society of the time he had little confidence that a woman could rule Brazil. He was fond and respectful of the women in his life, but he did not consider it feasible that Isabel could survive as monarch. He did nothing to prepare Isabel for the responsibilities of ascending the throne, nor did he attempt to encourage acceptance of a female ruler among the political class or in the wider public.{{sfn|Barman|1999|pp=129–130}}

Pedro&amp;nbsp;II began his rule as a figurehead who held together a realm on the verge of disintegration. He quickly matured and successfully navigated the empire through repeated and serious crises. By the time of Afonso's death, the nation was entering an unprecedented era of prosperity, development and tranquility. Even as the emperor's political successes and policies began to bear fruit, the lack of a male heir caused him to lose motivation to promote the imperial office as a position to be carried on by his descendants. The emperor turned away from personal and family ties, and focused on upholding the constitution while directing Brazil toward policies that furthered modernization and social advancement. The future of the monarchy as an institution no longer mattered to him, and in 1889, he was [[Decline and fall of Pedro II of Brazil|deposed in a coup]], marking the [[Abolished monarchy|end]] of the Empire of Brazil.{{sfn|Barman|1999|p=130}}
