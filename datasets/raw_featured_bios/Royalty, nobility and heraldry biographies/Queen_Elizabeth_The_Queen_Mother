'''Elizabeth Angela Marguerite Bowes-Lyon''' (4 August 1900{{spaced ndash}}30 March 2002) was the [[queen consort]] of [[George VI|King George VI]] from 1936 until her husband's death in 1952, after which she was known as '''Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother''',&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=55932|date=4 August 2000|startpage=8617|supp=yes }} {{London Gazette|issue=56653|date=5 August 2002|startpage=1|supp=yes }} {{London Gazette|issue=56969|date=16 June 2003|startpage=7439 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to avoid confusion with her daughter, Queen [[Elizabeth II]]. She was the last [[Monarchy of Ireland|queen consort of Ireland]] and [[Emperor of India|empress consort of India]].

Born into a family of [[British nobility]] as ''The Honourable'' Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon, she became ''Lady'' Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon when [[Claude Bowes-Lyon, 14th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne|her father]] inherited the Scottish [[Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne|Earldom of Strathmore and Kinghorne]] in 1904. She came to prominence in 1923 when she married Albert, Duke of York, the second son of [[George V|King George V]] and [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]]. As Duchess of York, she – along with her husband and their two daughters Elizabeth and [[Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon|Margaret]] – embodied traditional ideas of family and public service.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, pp. 58–59&lt;/ref&gt; She undertook a variety of public engagements, and became known as the &quot;Smiling Duchess&quot; because of her consistent public expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=British Screen News|title=Our Smiling Duchess|publisher=British Screen Productions|location=London|medium=film |year=1930}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1936, her husband unexpectedly became King when his brother, [[Edward VIII]], [[Edward VIII abdication crisis|abdicated]] in order to marry the American divorcée [[Wallis, Duchess of Windsor|Wallis Simpson]]. Queen Elizabeth accompanied her husband on diplomatic tours to [[France]] and [[North America]] before the start of [[World War II]]. During the war, her seemingly indomitable spirit provided moral support to the British public. In recognition of her role as an asset to British morale, [[Adolf Hitler]] described her as &quot;the most dangerous woman in Europe&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;rml&quot;&gt;{{citation|authorlink=Richard M. Langworth|first=Richard M.|last=Langworth|url=http://www.winstonchurchill.org/support/the-churchill-centre/publications/finest-hour/issues-109-to-144/no-114/632--hm-queen-elizabeth-the-queen-mother-1900-2002|date=Spring 2002|title=HM Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother 1900–2002|publisher=The Churchill Centre|accessdate=1 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the war, her husband's health deteriorated and she was widowed at the age of 51.

On the death of her mother-in-law Queen Mary in 1953, with her brother-in-law living abroad and her elder daughter, the Queen, aged 25, Elizabeth became the senior member of the [[British Royal Family]] and assumed a position as family matriarch. In her later years, she was a consistently popular member of the family, when other members were suffering from low levels of public approval.&lt;ref name=&quot;moore&quot;/&gt; She continued an active public life until just a few months before her death at the age of 101, seven weeks after the death of her younger daughter, [[Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon|Princess Margaret]].

==Early life==

Elizabeth Angela Marguerite Bowes-Lyon was the youngest daughter and the ninth of ten children of [[Claude Bowes-Lyon, 14th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne|Claude Bowes-Lyon]], [[Lord Glamis]], (later the 14th [[Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne]] in the [[Peerage of Scotland]]), and his wife, [[Cecilia Bowes-Lyon, Countess of Strathmore and Kinghorne|Cecilia Cavendish-Bentinck]]. Her mother was descended from [[British Prime Minister]] [[William Cavendish-Bentinck, 3rd Duke of Portland]], and [[Governor-General of India]] [[Richard Wellesley, 1st Marquess Wellesley]], who was the elder brother of another Prime Minister, [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington]].

The location of her birth remains uncertain, but reputedly she was born either in her parents' [[Westminster]] home at Belgrave Mansions, Grosvenor Gardens, or in a horse-drawn ambulance on the way to a hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Alison |last=Weir |authorlink=Alison Weir (historian)|title=Britain's Royal Families: The Complete Genealogy, Revised edition |publisher=Pimlico |location=London |year=1996 |isbn=0-7126-7448-9|page=330}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other possible locations include Forbes House in [[Ham, London]], the home of her maternal grandmother, [[Louisa Cavendish-Bentinck|Mrs Scott]].&lt;ref&gt;Shawcross, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; Her birth was registered at [[Hitchin]], Hertfordshire,&lt;ref&gt;Civil Registration Indexes: Births, General Register Office, England and Wales. Jul–Sep 1900 Hitchin, vol. 3a, p. 667&lt;/ref&gt; near the Strathmores' [[English country house]], [[St Paul's Walden Bury]], which was also given as her birthplace in the [[United Kingdom Census 1901|census the following year]].&lt;ref&gt;1901 England Census, Class RG13, piece 1300, folio 170, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; She was christened there on 23 September 1900, in the local parish church, All Saints, and her godparents included her paternal aunt Lady Maud Bowes-Lyon and cousin Mrs Arthur James.&lt;ref name=&quot;Yvonne&quot;&gt;[http://users.uniserve.com/~canyon/christenings.htm#Christenings Yvonne's Royalty Home Page— Royal Christenings]&lt;/ref&gt;

She spent much of her childhood at [[St Paul's Walden]] and at [[Glamis Castle]], the Earl's ancestral home in Scotland. She was educated at home by a governess until the age of eight, and was fond of field sports, ponies and dogs.&lt;ref&gt;Vickers, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; When she started school in London, she astonished her teachers by precociously beginning an essay with two [[Greek language|Greek]] words from [[Xenophon]]'s ''[[Anabasis (Xenophon)|Anabasis]]''. Her best subjects were literature and scripture. After returning to private education under a German Jewish governess, Käthe Kübler, she passed the [[OCR (examination board)|Oxford Local Examination]] with distinction at age 13.&lt;ref&gt;Vickers, pp. 10–14&lt;/ref&gt;

On her fourteenth birthday, Britain [[World War I|declared war]] on [[German Empire|Germany]]. Four of her brothers served in the army. Her elder brother, [[Fergus Bowes-Lyon|Fergus]], an officer in the [[Black Watch]] Regiment, was killed in action at the [[Battle of Loos]] in 1915. Another brother, Michael, was reported missing in action on 28 April 1917.&lt;ref&gt;Shawcross, p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; Three weeks later, the family discovered he had been captured after being wounded. He remained in a [[prisoner of war]] camp for the rest of the war. Glamis was turned into a convalescent home for wounded soldiers, which Elizabeth helped to run. She was particularly instrumental in organising the rescue of the Castle's contents during a serious fire on 16 September 1916.&lt;ref&gt;Shawcross, pp. 79–80&lt;/ref&gt; One of the soldiers she treated wrote in her autograph book that she was to be &quot;Hung, drawn, &amp; quartered&amp;nbsp;... Hung in diamonds, drawn in a coach and four, and quartered in the best house in the land.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Forbes, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage to Prince Albert==
{{main|Wedding of Prince Albert, Duke of York, and Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon}}
[[File:Philip Alexius de Laszlo - Duchess of York (nee Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon, later Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother), 1925.jpg|thumb|left|Detail of &quot;The Duchess of York&quot; by [[Philip de László]], 1925.]]

[[George VI|Prince Albert, Duke of York]] – &quot;Bertie&quot; to the family – was the second son of [[George V]]. He initially proposed to Elizabeth in 1921, but she turned him down, being &quot;afraid never, never again to be free to think, speak and act as I feel I really ought to&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ezard&quot;&gt;{{citation|last=Ezard|first=John|title=A life of legend, duty and devotion |newspaper=The Guardian|date=1 April 2002|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he declared he would marry no other, his mother, [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]], visited Glamis to see for herself the girl who had stolen her son's heart. She became convinced that Elizabeth was &quot;the one girl who could make Bertie happy&quot;, but nevertheless refused to interfere.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Airlie |first=Mabell |authorlink=Mabell Ogilvy, Countess of Airlie |title=Thatched with Gold |publisher=Hutchinson |location=London |year=1962 |page=167}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, Elizabeth was courted by [[James Stuart, 1st Viscount Stuart of Findhorn|James Stuart]], Albert's [[equerry]], until he left the prince's service for a better paid job in the American oil business.&lt;ref&gt;Shawcross, pp. 133–135&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1922, Elizabeth was a bridesmaid at the wedding of Albert's sister, [[Mary, Princess Royal and Countess of Harewood|Princess Mary]], to [[Henry Lascelles, 6th Earl of Harewood|Viscount Lascelles]].&lt;ref&gt;Shawcross, pp. 135–136&lt;/ref&gt; The following month, Albert proposed again, but she refused him once more.&lt;ref&gt;Shawcross, p. 136&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, in January 1923, Elizabeth agreed to marry Albert, despite her misgivings about royal life.&lt;ref&gt;Longford, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; Albert's freedom in choosing Elizabeth, legally a [[Commoners in the United Kingdom|commoner]] though the daughter of a peer, was considered a gesture in favour of political modernisation; previously, princes were expected to marry princesses from other royal families.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, pp. 57–58; Shawcross, p. 113&lt;/ref&gt; They married on 26 April 1923, at [[Westminster Abbey]]. Unexpectedly,&lt;ref&gt;Shawcross, p. 177&lt;/ref&gt; Elizabeth laid her bouquet at the Tomb of [[the Unknown Warrior]] on her way into the Abbey;&lt;ref&gt;Vickers, p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; a gesture that every royal bride since has copied, though subsequent brides have chosen to do this after the ceremony rather than before. She became styled ''[[Her Royal Highness]] The [[Duchess of York]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Shawcross, p. 168&lt;/ref&gt; Following a wedding breakfast at [[Buckingham Palace]] prepared by chef [[Gabriel Tschumi]], they honeymooned at [[Polesden Lacey]], a manor house in [[Surrey]], and then went to Scotland, where she caught &quot;unromantic&quot; [[whooping cough]].&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Albert to Queen Mary, 25 May 1923, quoted in Shawcross, p. 185&lt;/ref&gt;

==Duchess of York==
After a successful visit to [[Northern Ireland]] in July 1924, the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government agreed that Albert and Elizabeth could tour East Africa from December 1924 to April 1925.&lt;ref&gt;Shawcross, pp. 218–219&lt;/ref&gt; The Labour government was defeated by the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] in a [[United Kingdom general election, 1924|general election]] in November (which Elizabeth described as &quot;marvellous&quot; to her mother)&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Elizabeth to Lady Strathmore, 1 November 1924, quoted in Shawcross, p. 217&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Governor-General]] of [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan]], Sir [[Lee Stack]], was assassinated three weeks later. Despite this, the tour went ahead, and they visited [[Aden Protectorate|Aden]], [[Kenya Colony|Kenya]], [[Uganda Protectorate|Uganda]], and Sudan, but Egypt was avoided because of political tensions.&lt;ref&gt;Shawcross, pp. 221–240&lt;/ref&gt;

Albert had a stammer, which affected his ability to deliver speeches, and after October 1925, Elizabeth assisted in helping him through the therapy devised by [[Lionel Logue]], an episode portrayed in the 2010 film ''[[The King's Speech]]''. In 1926, the couple had their first child, Princess Elizabeth – &quot;Lilibet&quot; to the family – who would later become [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]]. Another daughter, [[Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon|Margaret Rose]], was born four years later. Albert and Elizabeth, without their child, [[Royal visits to Australia|travelled to Australia]] to open [[Old Parliament House, Canberra|Parliament House]] in [[Canberra]] in 1927.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url= http://www.royal.gov.uk/HistoryoftheMonarchy/The%20House%20of%20Windsor%20from%201952/QueenElizabethTheQueenMother/Royaltours.aspx |title=Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother &gt; Royal tours |publisher=Official web site of the British monarchy |accessdate=1 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was, in her own words, &quot;very miserable at leaving the baby&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth's diary, 6 January 1927, quoted in Shawcross, p. 264&lt;/ref&gt; Their journey by sea took them via Jamaica, the Panama Canal and the Pacific; Elizabeth fretted constantly over her baby back in Britain, but their journey was a public relations success.&lt;ref&gt;Shawcross, pp. 266–296&lt;/ref&gt; She charmed the public in Fiji when shaking hands with a long line of official guests, as a stray dog walked in on the ceremony and she shook its paw as well.&lt;ref&gt;Shawcross, p. 277&lt;/ref&gt; In New Zealand she fell ill with a cold, and missed some engagements, but enjoyed the local fishing.&lt;ref&gt;Shawcross, pp. 281–282&lt;/ref&gt; On the return journey, via Mauritius, the Suez Canal, Malta and Gibraltar, their transport, [[HMS Renown (1916)|HMS ''Renown'']], caught fire and they prepared to abandon ship before the fire was brought under control.&lt;ref&gt;Shawcross, pp. 294–296&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accession and abdication of Edward VIII==
{{main|Edward VIII abdication crisis}}
On 20 January 1936, [[George V|King George V]] died and Albert's brother, Edward, Prince of Wales, became King [[Edward VIII]]. George had expressed private reservations about his successor, saying, &quot;I pray God that my eldest son will never marry and that nothing will come between Bertie and Lilibet and the throne.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Ziegler |first=Philip |authorlink=Philip Ziegler |title=King Edward VIII: The Official Biography |location=London |publisher=Collins |year=1990 |page=199|isbn=0-00-215741-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Just months into his reign, Edward forced a [[Edward VIII abdication crisis|constitutional crisis]] by insisting on marrying the American divorcée Mrs [[Wallis Simpson]]. Although legally Edward could have married Mrs Simpson, as king he was also head of the [[Church of England]], which at that time did not allow divorced people to remarry. Edward's ministers believed that the people would never accept Mrs Simpson as queen and advised against the marriage. As a [[Constitutional monarchy|constitutional monarch]], Edward was obliged to accept ministerial advice.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Beaverbrook|first=Lord|authorlink=Max Aitken, Baron Beaverbook|title=The Abdication of King Edward VIII|publisher=Hamish Hamilton|location=London|coauthors=Edited by [[A. J. P. Taylor]]|year=1966|page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than abandon his plans to marry Mrs Simpson, he chose to abdicate in favour of Albert,&lt;ref&gt;The Duke of Windsor (1951). ''A King's Story''. London: Cassell and Co., p. 387&lt;/ref&gt; who reluctantly became king in his place on 11 December 1936 under the [[regnal name]] of George VI. George VI and Elizabeth were [[Coronation of the British monarch|crowned]] King and Queen of Great Britain, Ireland and the [[Dominion|British Dominions]], and [[Emperor of India|Emperor and Empress]] of [[British Raj|India]] on 12 May 1937, the date already nominated for the coronation of Edward VIII. [[Crown of Queen Elizabeth|Elizabeth's crown]] was made of platinum and was set with the [[Koh-i-Noor]] diamond.&lt;ref&gt;Shawcross, p. 397&lt;/ref&gt;

Edward and Mrs Simpson married and became the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, but while Edward was a Royal Highness, George VI withheld the style from the Duchess, a decision that Elizabeth supported.&lt;ref&gt;Letter from George VI to Winston Churchill in which the King says his family shared his view, quoted by Howarth, p. 143&lt;/ref&gt; Elizabeth was later quoted as referring to the Duchess as &quot;that woman&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Michie, Alan A. (17 March 1941) ''[[Life (magazine)|Life Magazine]]'', quoted by Vickers, p. 224&lt;/ref&gt;

==Queen consort==
===State visits and royal tour===
[[File:RoyalVisitSenate.jpg|thumb|right|George VI grants [[Royal Assent]] to laws in the [[Senate of Canada|Canadian Senate]], 19 May 1939. His consort, Queen Elizabeth, is to the right.]]
In summer 1938, a state visit to France by the King and Queen was postponed for three weeks because of the death of the Queen's mother, Lady Strathmore. In two weeks, [[Norman Hartnell]] created an all-white trousseau for the Queen, who could not wear colours as she was still in [[Mourning#White mourning|mourning]].&lt;ref&gt;Shawcross, pp. 430–433&lt;/ref&gt; The visit was designed to bolster Anglo-French solidarity in the face of aggression from [[Nazi Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;Shawcross, p. 430&lt;/ref&gt; The French press praised the demeanour and charm of the royal couple during the delayed but successful visit, augmented by Hartnell's wardrobe.&lt;ref&gt;Shawcross, pp. 434–436&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, Nazi aggression continued, and the government prepared for war. After the [[Munich Agreement]] of 1938 appeared to forestall the advent of armed conflict, the British Prime Minister [[Neville Chamberlain]] was invited onto the balcony of [[Buckingham Palace]] with the King and Queen to receive acclamation from a crowd of well-wishers.&lt;ref&gt;Shawcross, pp. 438–443&lt;/ref&gt; While broadly popular among the general public, [[Appeasement|Chamberlain's policy towards Hitler]] was the subject of some opposition in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]], which led historian [[John Grigg (writer)|John Grigg]] to describe the King's behaviour in associating himself so prominently with a politician as &quot;the most unconstitutional act by a British sovereign in the present century&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher Hitchens|Hitchens, Christopher]] (1 April 2002), [http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2002/apr/01/queenmother.monarchy9 &quot;Mourning will be brief&quot;], ''The Guardian'', retrieved on 1 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt; However, historians have also argued that the King only ever followed ministerial advice and acted as he was constitutionally bound to do.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Sinclair|first=David|title=Two Georges: the Making of the Modern Monarchy|publisher=Hodder and Staughton|year=1988|page=230|isbn=0-340-33240-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1939, Elizabeth and her husband [[1939 royal tour of Canada|toured Canada]] from coast to coast and back, and visited the United States, spending time with [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|President Roosevelt]] at the [[White House]] and his [[Hudson Valley]] [[Home of Franklin D.

===World War II===
[[File:Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait of the Queen by Sir [[Gerald Kelly]].]]
During World War II, the King and Queen became symbols of the fight against fascism.&lt;ref&gt;Shawcross, p. 515&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after the declaration of war, ''[[The Queen's Book of the Red Cross]]'' was conceived. Fifty authors and artists contributed to the book, which was fronted by [[Cecil Beaton]]'s portrait of the Queen and was sold in aid of the [[Red Cross]].&lt;ref&gt;Vickers, p. 205&lt;/ref&gt; Elizabeth publicly refused to leave London or send the children to Canada, even during [[the Blitz]], when she was advised by [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|the Cabinet]] to do so. She declared, &quot;The children won't go without me. I won't leave the King. And the King will never leave.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/HistoryoftheMonarchy/The%20House%20of%20Windsor%20from%201952/QueenElizabethTheQueenMother/ActivitiesasQueen.aspx |title=Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother &gt; Activities as Queen|publisher=Official web site of the British monarchy |accessdate=1 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She visited troops, hospitals, factories, and parts of Britain that were targeted by the [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[Luftwaffe]], in particular the [[East End of London|East End]], near [[London Docklands|London's docks]].

She explained that if the public came to see her they would wear their best clothes, so she should reciprocate in kind; [[Norman Hartnell]] dressed her in gentle colours and avoided black to represent &quot;the rainbow of hope&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Hartnell, Norman (1955), ''Silver and Gold'', Evans Bros., pp. 101–102, quoted in Shawcross, p. 526 and Vickers, p. 219&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Buckingham Palace]] itself took several hits during the height of the bombing, Elizabeth was able to say, &quot;I'm glad we've been bombed.

[[File:09-2361a.jpg|270px|thumb|right|[[Eleanor Roosevelt]] (centre), King George VI and Queen Elizabeth in London, 23 October 1942]]
Though the King and Queen spent the working day at Buckingham Palace, partly for security and family reasons they stayed at night at [[Windsor Castle]] about {{convert|20|mi}} west of central London with the Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret. The Palace had lost much of its staff to the [[British Army|army]], and most of the rooms were shut.&lt;ref&gt;Vickers, p. 229&lt;/ref&gt; The windows were shattered by bomb blasts, and had to be boarded up.&lt;ref&gt;Shawcross, p. 528&lt;/ref&gt; During the &quot;[[Phoney War]]&quot; the Queen was given revolver training because of fears of imminent invasion.&lt;ref&gt;Bradford, p. 321; Shawcross, p. 516&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Adolf Hitler]] is said to have called her &quot;the most dangerous woman in Europe&quot; because of her effect on British morale.&lt;ref name=&quot;rml&quot;/&gt; However, before the war both she and her husband, like most of [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] and the British public, had supported [[appeasement]] and Prime Minister [[Neville Chamberlain]], believing after the experience of the First World War that war had to be avoided at all costs. After the resignation of Chamberlain, the King asked [[Winston Churchill]] to form a government. Although the King was initially suspicious of his character and motives, in due course both the King and Queen came to respect and admire him.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=H. C. G. |last=Matthew |authorlink=Colin Matthew|title=George VI (1895–1952) |journal=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vickers, pp. 210–211&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the war in 1945, Churchill was invited onto the balcony in a similar gesture to that given to Chamberlain.

===Post-war years===
In the [[United Kingdom general election, 1945|1945 British general election]], Churchill's [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] party was soundly defeated by the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] party of [[Clement Attlee]]. Elizabeth's political views were rarely disclosed,&lt;ref&gt;Shawcross, p. 412&lt;/ref&gt; but a letter she wrote in 1947 described Attlee's &quot;high hopes of a socialist heaven on earth&quot; as fading and presumably describes those who voted for him as &quot;poor people, so many half-educated and bemused. I do love them.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Andrew|last=Pierce|title=What Queen Mother really thought of Attlee's socialist 'heaven on earth'|journal=The Times|date=13 May 2006|url= http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article717201.ece |accessdate=1 May 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Woodrow Wyatt]] thought her &quot;much more pro-Conservative&quot; than other members of the royal family,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Wyatt, Woodrow|authorlink=Woodrow Wyatt|coauthors=Edited by Sarah Curtis|title=The Journals of Woodrow Wyatt: Volume I|year=1998|publisher=Macmillan|location=London|page=255|isbn=0-333-74166-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; but she later told him, &quot;I like the dear old Labour Party.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Wyatt, ''Volume I'' p. 309&lt;/ref&gt; She also told the [[Fortune FitzRoy, Duchess of Grafton|Duchess of Grafton]], &quot;I love communists&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Hogg and Mortimer, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; After six years in office, Attlee was defeated in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1951|1951 British general election]] and Churchill returned to power.

During the 1947 royal tour of [[Union of South Africa|South Africa]], Elizabeth's serene public behaviour was broken, exceptionally, when she rose from the royal car to strike an admirer with her umbrella because she had mistaken his enthusiasm for hostility.&lt;ref&gt;Bradford, p. 391; Shawcross, p. 618&lt;/ref&gt; The 1948 royal tour of Australia and New Zealand was postponed because of the King's increasing ill health. In March 1949, he had a successful operation to improve the circulation in his right leg.&lt;ref&gt;Shawcross, pp. 637–640&lt;/ref&gt; In summer 1951, Queen Elizabeth and her daughters fulfilled the King's public engagements in his place.&lt;ref&gt;Shawcross, pp. 645–646&lt;/ref&gt; In September, he was diagnosed with lung cancer.&lt;ref&gt;Shawcross, p. 647&lt;/ref&gt; After a lung resection, he appeared to recover, but the delayed trip to Australia and New Zealand was altered so that [[Elizabeth II|Princess Elizabeth]] and her husband, the [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Duke of Edinburgh]], went in the King and Queen's place, in January 1952.&lt;ref&gt;Shawcross, p. 651&lt;/ref&gt; The King died while Princess Elizabeth and the Duke were in Kenya en route to the southern hemisphere, and they returned immediately to London as the new Queen and consort. They would not finally visit Australia and New Zealand until 1954.

==Queen Mother==
===Widowhood===
King George VI died peacefully in his sleep on 6 February 1952. Shortly afterward, Elizabeth began to be styled ''Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother''. This style was adopted because the normal style for the widow of a king, &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;, would have been too similar to the style of her elder daughter, now [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|publisher=CBC News|last=McCluskey|first=Peter|title=Elizabeth: The Queen Mother|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/obit/queenmother/|accessdate=1 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Popularly, she became the &quot;Queen Mother&quot; or the &quot;Queen Mum&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1002170,00.html ELIZABETH, QUEEN CONSORT, 1900-2002: A Mum for All Seasons: - TIME]&lt;/ref&gt;

She was devastated by the King's death and retired to Scotland. However, after a meeting with the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, she broke her retirement and resumed her public duties.&lt;ref&gt;Hogg and Mortimer, p. 161&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually she became just as busy as Queen Mother as she had been as Queen. In July 1953, she undertook her first overseas visit since the funeral when she visited the [[Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland]] with Princess Margaret. She laid the [[foundation stone]] of the [[University of Zimbabwe|University College of Rhodesia and Nyasaland – the current University of Zimbabwe]].&lt;ref&gt;Shawcross, pp. 686–688; Vickers, p. 324&lt;/ref&gt; On her return to the region in 1957, she was inaugurated as the College's President, and attended other events that were deliberately designed to be multi-racial.&lt;ref&gt;Shawcross, pp. 710–713&lt;/ref&gt; During her daughter's extensive tour of the Commonwealth over 1953–54, Elizabeth acted as a [[Counsellor of State]] and looked after her grandchildren, [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Charles]] and [[Anne, Princess Royal|Anne]].&lt;ref&gt;Shawcross, pp. 689–690&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:H.M. The Queen Mother Allan Warren.jpg|thumb|left|The Queen Mother at [[Dover Castle]], by [[Allan Warren]].]]

The widowed queen oversaw the restoration of the remote [[Castle of Mey]] on the [[Caithness]] coast of Scotland, which she used to &quot;get away from everything&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Vickers, p. 314&lt;/ref&gt; for three weeks in August and ten days in October each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.castleofmey.org.uk/castle-ownership.html|title=The Queen Elizabeth Castle Of Mey Trust|accessdate=1 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inspired by the amateur jockey [[Anthony Bingham Mildmay, 2nd Baron Mildmay of Flete|Lord Mildmay]], she developed an interest in horse racing, particularly steeplechasing, that continued for the rest of her life.&lt;ref&gt;Shawcross, pp. 703–704&lt;/ref&gt; She owned the winners of approximately 500 races. Her distinctive colours of blue with buff stripes were carried by horses such as Special Cargo, the winner of the 1984 [[Bet365 Gold Cup|Whitbread Gold Cup]], and [[Devon Loch]], which spectacularly halted just short of the winning post at the 1956 [[Grand National]]&lt;ref&gt;Shawcross, p. 790&lt;/ref&gt; and whose jockey [[Dick Francis]] later had a successful career as the writer of racing-themed [[detective stories]]. Although (contrary to rumour) she never placed bets, she did have the racing commentaries piped direct to her London residence, [[Clarence House]], so she could follow the races.&lt;ref&gt;Vickers, p. 458&lt;/ref&gt;  As an art collector, she purchased works by [[Claude Monet]], [[Augustus John]] and [[Peter Carl Fabergé]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.royalcollection.org.uk/collection/the-collectors/queen-elizabeth|title=Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|publisher=The Royal Collection|accessdate=31 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1964, she had an emergency appendectomy, which led to the postponement of a planned tour of Australia, New Zealand and Fiji until 1966.&lt;ref&gt;Shawcross, p. 806&lt;/ref&gt; She recuperated during a Caribbean cruise aboard the royal yacht, [[HMY Britannia|''Britannia'']].&lt;ref&gt;Shawcross, p. 807&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1966, she underwent an operation to remove a tumour after she was diagnosed with colon cancer. Contrary to rumours, she did not have a [[colostomy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/8259474.stm|title=Queen Mother 'had colon cancer'|date=17 September 2009|accessdate=22 September 2009|publisher=BBC }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shawcross, p. 817&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982, she was rushed to hospital when a fish bone stuck in her throat, and had an operation to remove it. Being a keen [[angling|angler]], she calmly joked afterwards, &quot;The salmon have got their own back.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;straits&quot;&gt;{{citation |title=Queen of Quips |journal=The Straits Times (Singapore) |date=7 August 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984, she had a second operation for cancer, when a lump was removed from her breast,&lt;ref&gt;Shawcross, p. 875&lt;/ref&gt; and a second gastric obstruction in 1986 cleared without the need for an operation, but she was hospitalised overnight.&lt;ref&gt;Shawcross, p. 878&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975, she visited Iran at the invitation of Shah [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|Reza Pahlavi]]. The British ambassador and his wife, Anthony and Sheila Parsons, noted how the Iranians were bemused by her habit of speaking to everyone regardless of status or importance, and hoped the Shah's entourage would learn from the visit to pay more attention to ordinary people.&lt;ref&gt;Shawcross, pp. 822–823&lt;/ref&gt; Four years later, the Shah was [[Iranian Revolution|deposed]]. Between 1976 and 1984, she made annual summer visits to France,&lt;ref&gt;Shawcross, pp. 827–831&lt;/ref&gt; which were among 22 private trips to continental Europe between 1963 and 1992.&lt;ref&gt;Shawcross, p. 835&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the marriage of [[Diana, Princess of Wales|Lady Diana Spencer]] to her grandson [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]], and after Diana's death, Queen Elizabeth – known for her personal and public charm – was by far the most popular member of the [[British Royal Family|royal family]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ezard&quot; /&gt; Her signature dress of large upturned hat with netting and dresses with draped panels of fabric became a distinctive personal style.

===Centenarian===
In her later years, the Queen Mother became known for her longevity. Her 90th birthday—4 August 1990—was celebrated by a parade on 27 June that involved many of the 300 organisations of which she was patron.&lt;ref&gt;Shawcross, pp. 732, 882&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, she attended events commemorating the end of the war fifty years before, and had two operations: one to remove a cataract in her left eye, and one to replace her right hip.&lt;ref&gt;Shawcross, pp. 903–904&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, her left hip was replaced after it was broken when she slipped and fell during a visit to [[Sandringham House|Sandringham]] stables.&lt;ref&gt;Shawcross, p. 912&lt;/ref&gt; Her 100th birthday was celebrated in a number of ways: a parade that celebrated the highlights of her life included contributions from [[Norman Wisdom]] and [[John Mills]];&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|publisher=BBC |title=Birthday pageant for Queen Mother|date=19 July 2000|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/841740.stm|accessdate=1 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; her image appeared on a special commemorative £20 note issued by the [[Royal Bank of Scotland]];&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.rampantscotland.com/SCM/qetqm100.htm|title=Commemorative Bank Note for 100th Birthday of Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother|publisher=Rampant Scotland|accessdate=1 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and she attended a lunch at the [[Guildhall, London]], at which [[George Carey]], the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], accidentally attempted to drink her glass of wine. Her quick admonition of &quot;That's mine!&quot; caused widespread amusement.&lt;ref&gt;Vickers, p. 490&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2000, she broke her collar bone in a fall that kept her recuperating at home over Christmas and the New Year.&lt;ref&gt;Shawcross, p. 925&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2001, aged 101, the Queen Mother had a fall in which she fractured her [[human pelvis|pelvis]]. Even so, she insisted on standing for the National Anthem during the memorial service for her husband on 6 February the following year.&lt;ref&gt;Vickers, p. 495&lt;/ref&gt; Just three days later, her second daughter Princess Margaret died. On 13 February 2002, the Queen Mother fell and cut her arm at [[Sandringham House]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc&quot;&gt;{{citation|publisher=BBC |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1818165.stm|title=Queen Mother hurt in minor fall|date=13 February 2002|accessdate=1 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this fall, she was still determined to attend Margaret's funeral at [[St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle]], two days later on Friday of that week.&lt;ref&gt;Shawcross, p. 930; Vickers, pp. 497–498&lt;/ref&gt; The Queen and the rest of the royal family were greatly concerned about the journey the Queen Mother would face to get from Norfolk to Windsor.&lt;ref name=&quot;fall&quot;&gt;Vickers, pp. 497–498&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, she made the journey and insisted that she be shielded from the press, so that no photographs of her in a wheelchair could be taken.&lt;ref name=&quot;fall&quot; /&gt;

On 30 March 2002, at 3:15&amp;nbsp;pm, the Queen Mother died in her sleep at the [[Royal Lodge]], [[Windsor Great Park]], with her surviving daughter, [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]], at her bedside. She had been suffering from a cold for the last four months of her life.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc&quot; /&gt; She was 101&amp;nbsp;years old, and at the time of her death was the longest-lived member of the royal family in British history. This record was broken on 24 July 2003, by her last surviving sister-in-law [[Princess Alice, Duchess of Gloucester]], who died aged 102 on 29 October 2004.

Elizabeth grew [[camellia]]s in every one of her gardens, and as her body was taken from Windsor to [[Lying in state|lie in state]] at [[Westminster Hall]], camellias from her own gardens were placed on top of the flag-draped coffin.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2002/apr/03/queenmother.monarchy5|journal=The Guardian|first=Stephen|last=Bates|accessdate=1 May 2009|date=3 April 2002|title=Piper's farewell for Queen Mother}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 200,000 people over three days filed past as she lay in state in Westminster Hall at the [[Palace of Westminster]]. Members of the household cavalry and other branches of the armed forces stood guard at the four corners of the [[catafalque]]. At one point, her four grandsons [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]], [[Prince Andrew, Duke of York|Prince Andrew]], [[Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex|Prince Edward]] and [[David Armstrong-Jones, Viscount Linley|Viscount Linley]] mounted the guard as a mark of respect known as the [[Vigil of the Princes]]—an honour only bestowed once before, at [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]]'s [[lying in state]].

On the day of her funeral, 9 April, the [[Governor General of Canada]] issued a proclamation asking Canadians to honour her memory that day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://publications.gc.ca/site/eng/110091/publication.html| last=Government of Canada Publications| title=Publication Information &gt; Proclamation Requesting that the People of Canada Set Aside April&amp;nbsp;9, 2002, as the Day on Which They Honour the Memory of Our Dearly Beloved Mother, Her Late Majesty Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother, Who Passed Away on March&amp;nbsp;30, 2002| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| accessdate=4 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Australia, the [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]] read the lesson at a memorial service held in [[St Andrew's Cathedral, Sydney]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|publisher=Sydney Anglicans|title=Memorial Service for HM Queen Elizabeth, The Queen Mother|url=http://www.sydneyanglicans.net/mediareleases/23a/ |accessdate=2 March 2011|date=9 April 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; In London, more than a million people filled the area outside [[Westminster Abbey]] and along the {{convert|23|mi|km|sing=on}} route from central London to her final resting place beside her husband and younger daughter in [[St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|publisher=CNN|title=Queues at Queen Mother vault |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/europe/04/10/uk.queenmum/index.html |accessdate=1 May 2009|date=10 April 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; At her request, after her funeral the [[wreath]] that had lain atop her coffin was placed on the Tomb of [[the Unknown Warrior]], in a gesture that echoed her wedding-day tribute 79 years before.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1920360.stm |publisher=BBC |date=10 April 2002|accessdate=1 May 2009|title=Mourners visit Queen Mother's vault}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public perception==
Despite being regarded as one of the most popular members of the [[British Royal Family|royal family]] in recent times who helped to stabilise the popularity of the [[British monarchy|monarchy]] as a whole,&lt;ref name=&quot;lawrence&quot;&gt;[[Lawrence Goldman|Goldman, Lawrence]] (May 2006) [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/76927 &quot;Elizabeth (1900–2002)&quot;], ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, [[doi:10.1093/ref:odnb/76927]], retrieved 1 May 2009 (Subscription required)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shawcross, p. 942&lt;/ref&gt; Elizabeth was subject to various degrees of criticism during her life.

[[Kitty Kelley]] alleged that during World War II Elizabeth did not abide by the [[Rationing in the United Kingdom|rationing regulations]].&lt;ref name=&quot;kelley&quot;&gt;{{citation|first=Kitty|last=Kelley|authorlink=Kitty Kelley|title=The Royals|publisher=Time Warner|location=New York|year=1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Picknett|first=Lynn|authorlink=Lynn Picknett|coauthors=Prince, Clive; Prior, Stephen; &amp; Brydon, Robert|title=War of the Windsors: A Century of Unconstitutional Monarchy|publisher=Mainstream Publishing|year=2002|isbn=1-84018-631-3 |page=161}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is contradicted by the official records,&lt;ref&gt;The memoirs of the [[Frederick Marquis, 1st Earl of Woolton|Rt.

Further allegations that Elizabeth used racist slurs to refer to black people&lt;ref name=&quot;kelley&quot; /&gt; were strongly denied by Major Colin Burgess.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Major Colin|last=Burgess|title=Behind Palace Doors: My Service as the Queen Mother's Equerry|publisher=John Blake Publishing|year=2006|page=233}}&lt;/ref&gt; Major Burgess was the husband of Elizabeth Burgess, a mixed-race secretary who accused members of the Prince of Wales's Household of racial abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1697526.stm|title=Royal secretary loses race bias case|publisher=BBC |date=7 December 2001|accessdate=1 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Queen Elizabeth made no public comments on race, but according to [[Robert Rhodes James]] in private she &quot;abhorred racial discrimination&quot; and decried [[apartheid]] as &quot;dreadful&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Robert|last=Rhodes James|authorlink=Robert Rhodes James|year=1998|title=A Spirit Undaunted: The Political Role of George VI|location=London|publisher=Little, Brown and Co|isbn=0-316-64765-9|page=296}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Woodrow Wyatt]] records in his diary that when he expressed the view that non-white countries have nothing in common with &quot;us&quot;, she told him, &quot;I am very keen on the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]].

In 1987, she was criticised when it emerged that two of her nieces, [[John_Herbert_Bowes-Lyon#Nerissa_and_Katherine_Bowes-Lyon|Katherine Bowes-Lyon and Nerissa Bowes-Lyon]], had both been committed to a [[psychiatric hospital]] because they were severely handicapped. However, [[Burke's Peerage]] had listed the sisters as dead, apparently because their mother, Fenella (the Queen Mother's sister-in-law), &quot;was 'extremely vague' when it came to filling in forms and might not have completed the paperwork for the family entry correctly&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-9988709.html |first=Neil |last=MacKay |title=Nieces abandoned in state-run mental asylum and declared dead to avoid public shame |journal=The Sunday Herald |date=7 April 2002 |accessdate=13 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Nerissa had died the year before, her grave was originally marked with a plastic tag and a serial number.

==Legacy==
[[File:queen mother statue.jpg|thumb|right| Bronze Statue of Queen Elizabeth on The Mall, London, overlooked by the statue of her husband King George VI]]
Sir [[Hugh Casson]] said she was like &quot;a wave breaking on a rock, because although she is sweet and pretty and charming, she also has a basic streak of toughness and tenacity.&amp;nbsp;... when a wave breaks on a rock, it showers and sparkles with a brilliant play of foam and droplets in the sun, yet beneath is really hard, tough rock, fused, in her case, from strong principles, physical courage and a sense of duty.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hogg and Mortimer, p. 122&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Ustinov]] described her during a student demonstration at the [[University of Dundee]] in 1968, &quot;As we arrived in a solemn procession the students pelted us with toilet rolls. They kept hold of one end, like streamers at a ball, and threw the other end. The Queen Mother stopped and picked these up as though somebody had misplaced them. [Returning them to the students she said,] 'Was this yours? Oh, could you take it?' And it was her sang-froid and her absolute refusal to be shocked by this, which immediately silenced all the students. She knows instinctively what to do on those occasions. She doesn't rise to being heckled at all; she just pretends it must be an oversight on the part of the people doing it. The way she reacted not only showed her presence of mind, but was so charming and so disarming, even to the most rabid element, that she brought peace to troubled waters.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hogg and Mortimer, pp. 212–213&lt;/ref&gt;

She was well known for her dry witticisms. On hearing that [[Edwina Mountbatten, Countess Mountbatten of Burma|Edwina Mountbatten]] was buried at sea, she said: &quot;Dear Edwina, she always liked to make a splash.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;straits&quot; /&gt; Accompanied by the gay writer Sir [[Noël Coward]] at a gala, she mounted a staircase lined with Guards.

Her habits were often parodied (with relative affection) by the satirical 1980s [[British television|television]] programme ''[[Spitting Image]]'' – which portrayed her with a [[Brummie|Birmingham accent]] (modelled on actress [[Beryl Reid]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/features/interviews/spitting-image.html|title=Spitting Image |accessdate=15 February 2009|date=9 December 2005|publisher=[[British Film Institute]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and an ever-present copy of the ''[[Racing Post]]''. She was portrayed in the 2002 television film ''[[Bertie and Elizabeth]]'' by [[Juliet Aubrey]], the 2006 film [[The Queen (film)|''The Queen'']] by [[Sylvia Syms]] and in the 2010 film [[The King's Speech (film)|''The King's Speech'']] by [[Helena Bonham Carter]], who was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] and won a [[BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role]] for her portrayal.

She left her entire estate to her daughter, Elizabeth II, except for some bequests to members of her staff. Her estate was estimated to be worth £70&amp;nbsp;million, including paintings, [[Fabergé egg]]s, jewellery, and horses. Eight years before her death, she had reportedly placed two-thirds of her money into [[trust law|trusts]], for the benefit of her great-grandchildren. Her most important pieces of art were transferred to the [[Royal Collection]] by Elizabeth II.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1993665.stm|title=Queen Inherits Queen Mother's Estate|publisher=BBC News |date=17 May 2002|accessdate=1 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A statue of Queen Elizabeth by sculptor Philip Jackson at the George VI Memorial, off [[The Mall, London]], was unveiled on 24 February 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7906986.stm|title=Queen Mother statue is unveiled|date=24 February 2009|publisher=BBC |accessdate=1 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Cunard Line|Cunard White Star Line's]] [[RMS Queen Elizabeth|RMS ''Queen Elizabeth'']] was named after her. She launched the ship on 27 September 1938 in Clydebank, Scotland. Supposedly, the liner started to slide into the water before Elizabeth could officially launch her, and acting sharply, she managed to smash a bottle of Australian red over the liner's bow just before it slid out of reach.&lt;ref&gt;Hutchings, David F.

In March 2011, her eclectic musical taste was revealed when details of her small record collection kept at at the Castle of Mey were made public.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/theroyalfamily/8379979/The-Queen-Mothers-regal-taste-in-music.html The Queen Mother's regal taste in music at telegraph.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; She had a taste for [[ska music]] and her records included artists such as the yodeller [[Montana Slim]], [[Tony Hancock]], [[The Goons]] and [[Noël Coward]]. Other music included local folk, Scottish reels and the musicals ''[[Oklahoma!]]'' and ''[[The King and I]]''.

===Titles and styles===
{{See|List of titles and honours of Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon}}
Elizabeth held a number of different titles and styles throughout her life, as the daughter of an earl and through her husband. As consort, she was commonly ''The Queen''. In conversation, the practice was to initially address her as ''Your Majesty'' and thereafter as ''Ma'am''.
