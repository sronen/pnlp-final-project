'''Attalus I''' ({{lang-el|{{lang|grc|Ἄτταλος}}}}), surnamed '''''Soter''''' ({{lang-el|{{lang|grc|Σωτὴρ}}}}, &quot;Savior&quot;; 269&amp;nbsp;BC &amp;ndash; 197&amp;nbsp;BC)&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, p. 26. Livy, [http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/txt/ah/Livy/Livy33.html 33.21–22], says that Attalus died in the consulship of Cornelius and Minucius (197&amp;nbsp;BC) at the age of 72, having reigned 44 years. Polybius, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plb.+18.41 18.41], also says that he died at 72 and reigned 44 years. Strabo, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Strab.+13.4.2 13.4.2], says that he reigned 43 years.&lt;/ref&gt; ruled [[Pergamon]], an Ionian Greek [[polis]] (what is now [[Bergama]], [[Turkey]]), first as [[dynast]], later as king, from 241&amp;nbsp;BC to 197&amp;nbsp;BC. He was the second cousin and the adoptive son of [[Eumenes I]],&lt;ref&gt;Strabo, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Strab.+13.4.2 13.4.2], says that he was the cousin of Eumenes. Pausanias, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Paus.+1.8.1 1.8.1], probably following Strabo, says the same. But modern writers have concluded that Strabo had skipped a generation; see Hansen, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; whom he succeeded, and was the first of the [[Attalid dynasty]] to assume the title of king in 238&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref&gt;Strabo, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Strab.+13.4.2 13.4.2]; Polybius, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plb.+18.41 18.41]; Hansen, p. 28; Austin, p. 396; Kosmetatou, p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt; He was the son of Attalus and his wife Antiochis.

Attalus won an important victory over the [[Galatia]]ns, newly arrived [[Celt]]ic tribes from [[Thrace]], who had been, for more than a generation, plundering and exacting tribute throughout most of [[Asia Minor]] without any serious check. This victory, celebrated by the triumphal monument at Pergamon (famous for its [[The Dying Gaul|Dying Gaul]]) and the liberation from the Gallic &quot;terror&quot; which it represented, earned for Attalus the name of &quot;Soter&quot;, and the title of &quot;[[basileus|king]]&quot;. A courageous and capable general and loyal ally of [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], he played a significant role in the first and second [[Macedonian Wars]], waged against [[Philip V of Macedon]]. He conducted numerous naval operations, harassing Macedonian interests throughout the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]], winning honors, collecting spoils, and gaining for Pergamon possession of the Greek islands of [[Aegina]] during the first war, and [[Andros]] during the second, twice narrowly escaping capture at the hands of Philip.

Attalus was a protector of the Greek cities of [[Anatolia]]&lt;ref&gt;Grolier, p. 314: &quot;Attalus was both a strong protector of the Greek cities of Anatolia and an opportunist in trying to expand Pergamum’s territory and power.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; and viewed himself as the champion of [[Greek people|Greeks]] against [[barbarians]].&lt;ref&gt;Bradford, p. 121: &quot;Attalus ... commissioned a series of sculptures that depicted the defeat of the Gauls and glorified himself as the champion of Greeks against barbarians&quot;; Wilson, p. 593: &quot;By means of lavish sculpted dedications, Attalus depicted his victories as important achievements, and himself as the champion of Greek freedom against a renewed barbarian threat.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; During his reign he established Pergamon as a considerable power in the [[Greek East]].&lt;ref&gt;Bradford, p. 121: &quot;Attalus established Pergamum as a power in the Greek East, but it was to reach its greatest power and prosperity by its alliance with Rome&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; He died in 197&amp;nbsp;BC, shortly before the end of the second war, at the age of 72, having suffered an apparent [[stroke]] while addressing a [[Boeotia]]n war council some months before. He enjoyed a famously happy domestic life, shared with his wife and four sons. He was succeeded as king by his son [[Eumenes II]].

==Early life==
[[Image:Attalos I tetradrachm -241 76003063.jpg|thumb|left|Coin struck during the reign of Attalus I, depicting Attalus' great uncle, Philetaerus. Reverse shows Greek inscription ΦΙΛΕΤΑΙΡΟΥ, &quot;(coin) of Philetaerus&quot;, and [[Athena]].&lt;ref&gt;Renée; Schraudolph, p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Little is known about Attalus' early life. He was born a [[Greek people|Greek]],&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, p. 254: &quot;... he was a Greek and devoted to the Greek culture, ...&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; the son of Attalus, and Antiochis.&lt;ref name = &quot;Strabo_tuftuss&quot;&gt;Strabo, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Strab.+13.4.2 13.4.2]; Hansen, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; The elder Attalus was the son of a brother (also called Attalus) of both [[Philetaerus]], the founder of the [[Attalid dynasty]], and Eumenes, the father of [[Eumenes I]], Philetaerus' successor; he is mentioned, along with his uncles, as a benefactor of [[Delphi]],&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, p. 19; Austin, p. 400,&lt;/ref&gt; won fame as a charioteer, winning at [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]], and was honored with a monument at Pergamon.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Attalus was a young child when his father died, sometime before 241&amp;nbsp;BC, after which he was adopted by Eumenes I, the incumbent dynast. Attalus' mother, [[Antiochis]], was related to the [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucid]] royal family (being a granddaughter of [[Seleucus I Nicator]]) with her marriage to Attalus' father likely arranged by Philetaerus to solidify his power. This would be consistent with the conjecture that Attalus' father had been Philetaerus' heir designate, but was succeeded by Eumenes, since Attalus I was too young when his father died.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, pp. 27&amp;ndash;28.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Defeat of the Galatians==
[[Image:Dying gaul.jpg|thumb|The ''[[Dying Gaul]]''  representing the defeat of the [[Galatia]]ns by Attalus]]

According to the 2nd century AD Greek writer [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], &quot;the greatest of his achievements&quot; was the defeat of the &quot;[[Gauls]]&quot; ({{lang|grc|Γαλάται}}).&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Paus.+1.8.1 1.8.1].&lt;/ref&gt; Pausanias was referring to the Galatians, immigrant [[Celts]] from [[Thrace]], who had recently settled in [[Galatia]] in central [[Asia Minor]], and whom the Romans and Greeks called Gauls, associating them with the Celts of what is now France, Switzerland, and northern Italy. Since the time of Philetaerus, the first Attalid ruler, the Galatians had posed a problem for Pergamon, indeed for all of Asia Minor, by exacting tributes to avoid war or other repercussions. Eumenes I had (probably), along with other rulers, dealt with the Galatians by paying these tributes. Attalus however refused to pay them, being the first such ruler to do so.&lt;ref&gt;Livy, [http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/txt/ah/Livy/Livy38.html 38.16]; Hansen, pp. 28&amp;ndash;31.&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence, the Galatians set out to attack Pergamon. Attalus met them near the sources of the river Caïcus&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, p. 31. An Inscription from the Gaul Monument located in the Athena Sanctuary on the acropolis at Pergamon reads: &quot;King Attalos having conquered in battle the Tolistoagii Gauls around the springs of the river Kaikos [set up this] thank-offering to Athena&quot; ([http://www.arches.uga.edu/~fvankeur/classical/ancient/ancient.html source], see also Austin, p. 405). Such inscriptions are the main source of information on Attalus' war with the Galatians, see Mitchell, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; and won a decisive victory, after which, following the example of [[Antiochus I]], Attalus took the name of Soter, which means &quot;savior&quot;, and claimed the title of king.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, p. 31; Mitchell, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; The victory brought Attalus legendary fame. A story arose, related by Pausanias, of an oracle who had foretold these events a generation earlier:

:''Then verily, having crossed the narrow strait of the [[Hellespont]],''
:''The devastating host of the Gauls shall pipe; and lawlessly''
:''They shall ravage Asia; and much worse shall God do''
:''To those who dwell by the shores of the sea''
:''For a short while. For right soon the son of [[Cronus|Cronos]]''
:''Shall raise a helper, the dear son of a bull reared by [[Zeus]]''
:''Who on all the Gauls shall bring a day of destruction.''

Pausanias adds that by &quot;son of a bull&quot; the oracle &quot;meant Attalus, king of Pergamon, who was styled bull-horned&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Paus.+10.15.2 10.15.2,3].&lt;/ref&gt; On the acropolis of Pergamon was erected a triumphal monument, which included the famous sculpture the ''[[Dying Gaul]]'', commemorating this battle.

==Conquests in Seleucid Asia Minor==
Several years after the first victory over the Gauls, Pergamon was again attacked by the Gauls together with their ally [[Antiochus Hierax]], the younger brother of [[Seleucus II Callinicus]], and ruler of Seleucid Asia Minor from his capital at [[Sardis]]. Attalus defeated the Gauls and Antiochus at the battle of Aphrodisium and again at a second battle in the east. Subsequent battles were fought and won against Antiochus alone: in Hellespontine [[Phrygia]], where Antiochus was perhaps seeking refuge with his father-in law, [[Ziaelas]] the king of [[Bithynia]]; near Sardis in the spring of 228&amp;nbsp;BC; and, in the final battle of the campaign, further south in [[Caria]] on the banks of the Harpasus, a tributary of the [[Büyük Menderes River|Maeander]].&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, pp. 34&amp;ndash;35; Green, p. 264&amp;ndash;265.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of these victories, Attalus gained control over all of Seleucid Asia Minor north of the [[Taurus Mountains]].&lt;ref&gt;Polybius, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plb.+4.48 4.48]; Hansen, p. 36; Kosmetatou, p. 162; Green, p. 264.&lt;/ref&gt; He was able to hold onto these gains in the face of repeated attempts by [[Seleucus III Ceraunus]], eldest son and successor of Seleucus II, to recover the lost territory, culminating in Seleucus III himself crossing the Taurus, only to be assassinated by members of his army in 223&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, p. 36; Green, p. 265.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Achaeus (general)|Achaeus]], who had accompanied Seleucus III, assumed control of the army. He was offered and refused the kingship in favor of Seleucus III's younger brother [[Antiochus III the Great]], who then made Achaeus governor of Seleucid Asia Minor north of the Taurus. Within two years Achaeus had recovered all the lost Seleucid territories, &quot;shut up Attalus within the walls of Pergamon&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Polybius, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plb.+4.48 4.48].&lt;/ref&gt; and assumed the title of king.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, p. 39; Green, p. 265.&lt;/ref&gt;

After a period of peace, in 218&amp;nbsp;BC, while Achaeus was involved in an expedition to [[Selge]] south of the Taurus, Attalus, with some Thracian Gauls, recaptured his former territories.&lt;ref&gt;Polybius, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plb.+5.77 5.77]; Hansen, pp. 41&amp;ndash;43. According to Heinen, p. 432, after the expedition of 218, Attalus' kingdom was again the most powerful state in Asia Minor.&lt;/ref&gt; However Achaeus returned from victory in Selge in 217&amp;nbsp;BC and resumed hostilities with Attalus.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, pp. 42&amp;ndash;43.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under a treaty of alliance with Attalus, Antiochus crossed the Taurus in 216&amp;nbsp;BC, attacked Achaeus and besieged Sardis, and in 214&amp;nbsp;BC, the second year of the siege, was able to take the city. However the citadel remained under Achaeus' control. Under the pretense of a rescue, Achaeus was finally captured and put to death, and the citadel surrendered. By 213&amp;nbsp;BC, Antiochus had regained control of all of his Asiatic provinces.&lt;ref&gt;Polybius, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plb.+5.107 5.107],  [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plb.+7.15 7.15–18], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plb.+8.17 8.17–23]; Hansen, p. 43; Heinen, p. 440.&lt;/ref&gt;

==First Macedonian War==
[[File:218BCMAPMEDITERRANEAN.jpg|right|thumb|Mediterranean at 218 BC]]
Thwarted in the east, Attalus now turned his attention westward. Perhaps because of concern for the ambitions of [[Philip V of Macedon]], Attalus had sometime before 219&amp;nbsp;BC become allied with Philip's enemies the [[Aetolian League]], a union of Greek states in [[Aetolia]] in central Greece, having funded the fortification of Elaeus, an Aetolian stronghold in [[Calydon]]ia, near the mouth of the river [[Acheloos River|Acheloos]].&lt;ref&gt;Polybius, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plb.+4.65 4.65]; Hansen, p. 46; Gruen (1990), p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

Philip's alliance with [[Hannibal]] of [[Carthage]] in 215&amp;nbsp;BC also caused concern in [[Rome]], then involved in the [[Second Punic War]].&lt;ref&gt;Livy, [http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/txt/ah/Livy/Livy23.html 23.33–34, 38]; Hansen, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 211&amp;nbsp;BC, a treaty was signed between Rome and the Aetolian League, a provision of which allowed for the inclusion of certain allies of the League, Attalus being one of these.&lt;ref&gt;Livy, [http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/txt/ah/Livy/Livy26.html 26.24]; Hansen, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; Attalus was elected one of the two ''[[strategos|strategoi]]'' (generals) of the Aetolian League,&lt;ref&gt;Livy, [http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/txt/ah/Livy/Livy27.html 27.29]; Hansen, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 210&amp;nbsp;BC his troops probably participated in capturing the island of [[Aegina]], acquired by Attalus as his base of operations in Greece.&lt;ref&gt;Polybius, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plb.+9.42 9.42] and [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plb.+22.11 22.11]; Hansen, p. 47; Gruen (1990), p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the following spring (209&amp;nbsp;BC), Philip marched south into Greece. Under command of Pyrrhias, Attalus' colleague as strategos, the allies lost two battles at [[Lamia (city)|Lamia]].&lt;ref&gt;Livy, [http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/txt/ah/Livy/Livy27.html 27.30]; Hansen, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; Attalus himself went to Greece in July and was joined on Aegina by the Roman [[proconsul]] [[Publius Sulpicius Galba Maximus|P. Sulpicius Galba]] who wintered there.&lt;ref&gt;Livy, [http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/txt/ah/Livy/Livy27.html 27.33]; Hansen, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; The following summer (208&amp;nbsp;BC) the combined fleet of thirty-five Pergamene and twenty-five Roman ships failed to take [[Lemnos]], but occupied and plundered the countryside of the island of Peparethos ([[Skopelos]]), both Macedonian possessions. Attalus and Sulpicius then attended a meeting in [[Heraclea Trachinia]] of the Council of the Aetolians, at which the Roman argued against making peace with Philip.&lt;ref&gt;Livy, [http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/txt/ah/Livy/Livy28.html 28.5]; Polybius, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plb.+10.42 10.42]; Hansen, pp. 48&amp;ndash;49.&lt;/ref&gt;

When hostilities resumed, they sacked both [[Oreus]], on the northern coast of [[Euboea]] and [[Opus, Greece|Opus]], the chief city of eastern [[Locris]]. The spoils from Oreus had been reserved for Sulpicius, who returned there, while Attalus stayed to collect the spoils from Opus. With their forces divided, Philip attacked Opus. Attalus, caught by surprise, was barely able to escape to his ships.&lt;ref&gt;Livy, [http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/txt/ah/Livy/Livy28.html 28.5–7]; Polybius, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plb.+11.7 11.7]; Hansen, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

Attalus was now forced to return to Asia, for he had learned at Opus that, at the instigation of Philip, [[Prusias I of Bithynia|Prusias I]] king of Bithynia, related to Philip by marriage, was moving against Pergamon. Soon after, the Romans also abandoned Greece to concentrate their forces against Hannibal, their objective of preventing Philip from aiding Hannibal having been achieved. In 206&amp;nbsp;BC the Aetolians sued for peace on conditions imposed by Philip. A treaty was drawn up at Phoenice in 205&amp;nbsp;BC, formally ending the [[First Macedonian War]]. Attalus was included as an ''adscriptus'' on the side of Rome. He retained Aegina, but had accomplished little else. Since Prusias was also included in the treaty, the war between Attalus and Prusias must also have ended by that time.&lt;ref&gt;Livy, [http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/txt/ah/Livy/Livy29.html 29.12]; Hansen, p. 49&amp;ndash;50; Gruen (1990), p. 29&amp;ndash;30.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction of the cult of the Magna Mater to Rome==
In 205&amp;nbsp;BC, following the &quot;Peace of Phoenice&quot;, Rome turned to Attalus, as its only friend in Asia, for help concerning a religious matter. An unusual number of meteor showers caused concern in Rome, and an inspection was made of the [[Sibylline Books]], which discovered verses saying that if a foreigner were to make war on Italy, he could be defeated if the ''Magna Idaea'', the Mother Goddess, associated with [[Mount Ida]] in [[Phrygia]], were brought to Rome. Hoping to bring about a speedy conclusion to the war with Hannibal, a distinguished delegation, led by [[Marcus Valerius Laevinus|M. Valerius Laevinus]], was dispatched to Pergamon, to seek Attalus' aid. According to [[Livy]], Attalus received the delegation warmly, and  &quot;handed over to them the sacred stone which the natives declared to be 'the Mother of the Gods', and bade them carry it to Rome.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Livy, [http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/txt/ah/Livy/Livy29.html 29.10, 11]. The poet [[Ovid]] (''[[Fasti]]'', [http://poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Latin/OvidFastiBkFour.htm#_Toc69367847 IV 326]) portrays Attalus as initially refusing to give up the goddess, only to relent after &quot;the earth shook&quot; and the goddess herself spoke, see Erskine, p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt; In Rome the goddess became known as the [[Magna Mater deorum Idaea|Magna Mater]].&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, pp. 50&amp;ndash;52; Gruen (1990), pp. 5&amp;ndash;33; Erskine, pp. 205&amp;ndash;224; Kosmetatou, p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Macedonian hostilities of 201 BC==
Prevented by the treaty of Phoenice from expansion in the east, Philip set out to extend his power in the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] and in Asia Minor.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; In the spring of 201&amp;nbsp;BC he took [[Samos Island|Samos]] and the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] fleet stationed there. He then besieged [[Chios]] to the north. These events caused Attalus, allied with [[Rhodes]], [[Byzantium]] and [[Cyzicus]], to enter the war.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, p. 53; Errington p. 252.&lt;/ref&gt; A large naval battle occurred in the strait between Chios and the mainland, just southwest of [[Erythrae]]. According to [[Polybius]], fifty-three decked warships and over one hundred and fifty smaller warships, took part on the Macedonian side, with sixty-five decked warships and a number of smaller warships on the allied side.&lt;ref&gt;Polybius, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plb.+16.2 16.2]; Hansen; p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; During the battle Attalus, having become isolated from his fleet and pursued by Philip, was forced to run his three ships ashore, narrowly escaping by spreading various royal treasures on the decks of the grounded ships, causing his pursuers to abandon the pursuit in favor of plunder.&lt;ref&gt;Polybius, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plb.+16.6 16.6]; Hansen, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

The same year, Philip invaded Pergamon; although unable to take the easily defended city, in part due to precautions taken by Attalus to provide for additional fortifications, he demolished the surrounding temples and altars.
Meanwhile, Attalus and Rhodes sent envoys to Rome, to register their complaints against Philip.&lt;ref&gt;Livy, [http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/txt/ah/Livy/Livy31.html 31.2]; Polybius, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plb.+16.1 16.1]; Hansen, pp. 55&amp;ndash;57; Errington, p. 253&amp;ndash;257.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second Macedonian War==

In 200&amp;nbsp;BC, Attalus became involved in the [[Second Macedonian War]]. [[Acarnania]]ns with Macedonian support invaded [[Attica]], causing [[Athens]], which had previously maintained its neutrality, to seek help from the enemies of Philip. Attalus, with his fleet at Aegina, received an embassy from Athens, to come to the city for consultations.&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Paus.+1.36.5 1.36.5–6]; Livy, [http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/txt/ah/Livy/Livy31.html 31.9, 14]; Hansen; p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; A few days later, he learned that Roman ambassadors were also at Athens, and decided to go there at once. His reception at Athens was extraordinary.&lt;ref&gt;Livy, [http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/txt/ah/Livy/Livy31.html 31.14]; Hansen, pp. 58&amp;ndash;59; Errington, p. 258; Hurwit, pp. 269&amp;ndash;271.&lt;/ref&gt; Polybius writes:

{{quote|… in company with the Romans and the Athenian magistrates, he began his progress to the city in great state. For he was met, not only by all the magistrates and the knights, but by all the citizens with their children and wives. And when the two processions met, the warmth of the welcome given by the populace to the Romans, and still more to Attalus, could not have been exceeded. At his entrance into the city by the gate Dipylum the priests and priestesses lined the street on both sides: all the temples were then thrown open; victims were placed ready at all the altars; and the king was requested to offer sacrifice. Finally they voted him such high honors as they had never without great hesitation voted to any of their former benefactors: for, in addition to other compliments, they named a tribe after Attalus, and classed him among their eponymous heroes.&lt;ref&gt;Polybius, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plb.+16.25 16.25].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Sulpicius Galba, now [[consul]], convinced Rome to declare war on Philip&lt;ref&gt;Livy, [http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/txt/ah/Livy/Livy31.html 31.5–8]; Hansen, pp. 58, 60;  Errington, pp. 255, 261.&lt;/ref&gt; and asked Attalus to meet up with the Roman fleet and again conduct a naval campaign, harassing Macedonian possessions in the Aegean.&lt;ref&gt;Livy, [http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/txt/ah/Livy/Livy31.html 31.28]; Hansen, p. 61; Grainger, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; In the spring of 199&amp;nbsp;BC, the combined Pergamon and Roman fleets took [[Andros]] in the [[Cyclades]], the spoils going to the Romans and the island to Attalus.  From Andros they sailed south, made a fruitless attack on another Cycladic island, [[Kithnos]], turned back north, scavenged the fields of [[Skiathos]] off the coast of [[Magnesia Prefecture|Magnesia]], for food, and continued north to [[Mende (Greece)|Mende]], where the fleets were wracked by storm. On land they were repulsed at [[Cassandrea]], suffering heavy loss. They continued northeast along the Macedonian coast to [[Acanthus (Greece)|Acanthus]], which they sacked, after which they returned to Euboea, their vessels laden with spoils.&lt;ref&gt;Livy, [http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/txt/ah/Livy/Livy31.html 31.45]; Hansen, pp. 61&amp;ndash;62; Grainger, pp. 33&amp;ndash;36.&lt;/ref&gt; On their return, the two leaders went to Heraclea to meet with the Aetolians, who under the terms of their treaty, had asked Attalus for a thousand soldiers. He refused, citing the Aetolians' own refusal to honor Attalus' request to attack Macedonia during Philip's attack on Pergamon two years earlier. Resuming operations, Attalus and the Romans attacked but failed to take Oreus and, deciding to leave a small force to invest it, attacked across the straight in [[Thessaly]]. When they returned to Oreus, they again attacked, this time successfully, the Romans taking the captives, Attalus the city. The campaigning season now over, Attalus attended the [[Eleusinian Mysteries]] and then returned to Pergamon having been away for over two years.&lt;ref&gt;Livy, [http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/txt/ah/Livy/Livy31.html 31.46&amp;ndash;47]; Hansen, p. 62; Warrior, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the spring of 198&amp;nbsp;BC, Attalus returned to Greece with twenty-three [[quinquereme]]s joining a fleet of twenty  Rhodian decked warships at Andros, to complete the conquest of Euboea begun the previous year. Soon joined by the Romans, the combined fleets took [[Eretria]] and later [[Carystus]]. Thus, the allies controlled all of Euboea except for [[Chalcis]].&lt;ref&gt;Livy, [http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/txt/ah/Livy/Livy32.html 32.16,17]; Hansen, pp. 63&amp;ndash;64.&lt;/ref&gt; The allied fleet then sailed for [[Cenchreae]] in preparation for an attack on [[Corinth]]. Meanwhile, the new Roman consul for that year, [[Titus Quinctius Flamininus]], had learned that the [[Achaean League]], allies of Macedon, had had a change in leadership which favored Rome. With the hope of inducing the Achaeans to abandon Philip and join the allies, envoys were sent, including Attalus himself, to [[Sicyon]], where they offered the incorporation of Corinth into the Achaean League. Attalus apparently so impressed the Sicyonians, that they erected a colossal statue of him in their market place and instituted sacrifices in his honor. A meeting of the League was convened and after a heated debate and the withdrawal of some of delegates the rest agreed to join the alliance. Attalus led his army from Cenchreae (now controlled by the allies) through the Isthmus and attached Corinth from the north, controlling the access to [[Lechaeum]], the Corinthian port on the Gulf of Corinth, the Romans attacked from the east controlling the approaches to Cenchreae, with the Achaeans attacking from the west controlling the access to the city via the Sicyonian gate. However the city held, and when Macedonian reinforcements arrived, the siege was abandoned. The Achaeans were dismissed, the Romans left for [[Corcyra]], while Attalus sailed for [[Piraeus]].&lt;ref&gt;Livy, [http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/txt/ah/Livy/Livy32.html 32.19&amp;ndash;23]; Polybius, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plb.+18.16 18.16]; Hansen, p. 64. Gruen (1986), pp. 179, 181.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early in 197&amp;nbsp;BC, Flamininus, summoned Attalus to join him at [[Elateia]] (now in Roman hands) and from there they traveled together to attend a [[Boeotia]]n council in [[Thebes (Greece)|Thebes]] to discuss which side Boeotia would take in the war.&lt;ref&gt;Livy, [http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/txt/ah/Livy/Livy33.html 33.1], Hansen, p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; At the council Attalus spoke first, reminding the Boeotians of the many things he and his ancestors had done for them, but during his address he stopped talking and collapsed, with one side of his body paralyzed.&lt;ref&gt;Livy, [http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/txt/ah/Livy/Livy33.html 33.2]; Hansen, p. 67; Kosmetatou, p. 163. Inscriptions document Pergamene benefactions to the Greeks in general and the Boeotians in particular, see Hansen, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Attalus was taken back to Pergamon, where he died around the time of the [[Battle of Cynoscephalae]], which brought about the end of the Second Macedonian War.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, p. 67, says he did not die &quot;until the beginning of autumn&quot; citing manumission records dated to August or September 197 BC, and speculates that &quot;he may have heard of the great Roman victory at  Cynoscephalae&quot;. However Kosmetatou, p. 163, asserts that he died &quot;probably shortly before&quot; the battle.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
Attalus married Apollonis, from [[Cyzicus]]. They had four sons, [[Eumenes II|Eumenes]], [[Attalus II|Attalus]], Philetaerus and Athenaeus (after Apollonis' father).&lt;ref name = &quot;Strabo_tuftus&quot;&gt;Strabo, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Strab.+13.4.2 13.4.2]; Hansen, pp. 44&amp;ndash;45; Hurwit, p. 271.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Polybius]] describes Apollonis as &quot;a woman who for many reasons deserves to be remembered, and with honor. Her claims upon a favourable recollection are that, though born of a private family, she became a queen, and retained that exalted rank to the end of her life, not by the use of meretricious fascinations, but by the virtue and integrity of her conduct in private and public life alike. Above all, she was the mother of four sons with whom she kept on terms of the most perfect affection and motherly love to the last day of her life.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Polybius, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plb.+22.20 22.20].&lt;/ref&gt;

The filial &quot;affection&quot; of the brothers as well as their upbringing is remarked on by several ancient sources. A decree of [[Antiochus IV]] praises &quot;king Attalus and queen Apollonis … because of their virtue and goodness, which they preserved for their sons, managing their education in this way wisely and well.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; An inscription at Pergamon represents Apollonis as saying that &quot;she always considered herself blessed and gave thanks to the gods, not for wealth or empire, but because she saw her three sons guarding the eldest and him reigning without fear among those who were armed.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, p. 45; Austin, pp. 370&amp;ndash;371.&lt;/ref&gt; When Attalus died in 197&amp;nbsp;BC at the age of 72, he was succeeded by his eldest son Eumenes II. Polybius, describing Attalus' life says &quot;and what is more remarkable than all, though he left four grown-up sons, he so well settled the question of succession, that the crown was handed down to his children's children without a single dispute.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Polybius, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plb.+18.41 18.41].&lt;/ref&gt;
