'''Rachel Chiesley''', usually known as '''Lady Grange''' (1679–1745), was the wife of [[James Erskine, Lord Grange]], a [[Scottish people|Scottish]] lawyer with [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] sympathies. After 25&amp;nbsp;years of marriage and nine children, the Granges separated acrimoniously. When Lady Grange produced letters that  she claimed were evidence of his [[treason]]able plottings against the [[House of Hanover|Hanoverian]] government in London, her husband had her kidnapped in 1732. She was incarcerated in various remote locations on the western seaboard of Scotland, including the [[Monach Isles]], [[Skye]] and the distant islands of [[St Kilda, Scotland|St Kilda]].

Lady Grange's father was convicted of murder and she is known to have had a violent temper; initially her absence seems to have caused little comment. News of her plight eventually reached her home town of [[Edinburgh]] however, and an unsuccessful rescue attempt was undertaken by her lawyer, Thomas Hope of Rankeillor. She died in captivity,  after being in effect imprisoned for 13 years. Her life has been remembered in poetry, prose and a play.

== Early years ==
Rachel Chiesley was one of ten children born to John Chiesley of [[Dalry, Edinburgh|Dalry]] and Margaret Nicholson. The marriage was unhappy and Margaret took her husband to court for [[alimony]]. She was awarded 1,700 [[Merk (coin)|merks]] by [[George Lockhart (advocate)|Sir George Lockhart of Carnwath]], the [[Lord President of the Court of Session]]. Furious with the result,  John Chiesley shot Lockhart dead on the [[Royal Mile]] in [[Edinburgh]] as he walked home from church on [[Easter Sunday]], 31 March 1689.&lt;ref&gt;Macauley (2009) pp. 23–24&lt;/ref&gt; The assailant made no attempt to escape and confessed at his trial, held before the [[Lord Provost]] the next day. Two days later he was taken from the [[Heart of Midlothian (Royal Mile)|Tolbooth]] to the Mercat Cross on the High Street. His right hand was cut off before he was hanged, and the pistol he had used for the murder was placed round his neck.&lt;ref&gt;Macauley (2009) pp. 29–30&lt;/ref&gt; Rachel Chiesley's birthday is unknown but she was baptised on 4 February 1679 and was probably born shortly before then, making her about ten years old at the time of her father's execution.&lt;ref name=&quot;Macauley 2009 p. 19&quot;&gt;Macauley (2009) p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

The young Lady Grange has been described as a &quot;wild beauty&quot;, and it is likely the marriage only took place after she became [[pregnant]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archaeologydaily.com/news/200906061392/Uncovered-the-lost-manor-of-Lady-Grange-Scotland-39s-18th-century-it-girl.html &quot;Uncovered: the lost manor of Lady Grange, Scotland's 18th century it girl&quot;].

In addition, Lady Grange [[miscarriage|miscarried]] twice and one of the above children is known to have died in 1721.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mac169&quot; /&gt;

== Acrimony and separation ==
There was evidently an element of discord in the marriage that eventually became public knowledge. In late 1717 or early 1718, Erskine received warnings from a friend that he had enemies in the government.  At about the same time one of the children's tutors recorded in his diary that Lady Grange was &quot;imperious with an unreasonable temper&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Extract from James Erksine's diary recorded by James Maidment in 1843, quoted by Macauley (2009) p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; Her outbursts were evidently also capable of frightening her younger daughters and after Lady Grange's kidnapping, no action was ever taken on her behalf by any of her children, the eldest of whom would have been in their early twenties when she was abducted.  Macauley writes that &quot;[t]he calm acceptance by the family of their mother's disappearance would persuade many that it need not be a matter of concern to them either&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Macauley41&quot;&gt;Macauley (2009) p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=Note|Macauley also poignantly notes  that &quot;no hue and cry was ever raised on behalf of Lady Grange by the daughter [Mary] she had called her angel&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Macauley41&quot; /&gt;}} This restraint may have been influenced by the fact their mother had previously disinherited all of them when the youngest were still infants, an outcome described as &quot;unnatural&quot; by the [[Sobieski Stuarts]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Macauley41&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Macauley (2009) p. 161&lt;/ref&gt;(two English brothers who claimed descent from Prince Charles Edward Stuart).{{refn|group=Note|Although taken seriously by [[Lord Lovat]], the Sobieski Stuarts' claims were eventually exposed and the ''[[Collins Encyclopaedia of Scotland]]'' states that their publication on the history of clan [[tartan]]s, ''Vestiarium Scoticum'' &quot;is as bogus as its author's descent&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Keay &amp; Keay (1994) p. 889&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As the Erskines' marriage trouble increased, Lady Grange's behaviour became increasingly unpredictable. In 1730, the factorship of the Preston estate was removed from her, further increasing her angst. Her discovery of an affair her husband was conducting with coffeehouse owner Fanny Lindsay can only have made matters worse. In April of that year, she threatened suicide and to run naked through the streets of Edinburgh. She may have kept a razor under her pillow and attempted to intimidate her husband by reminding him whose daughter she was. On 27 July, she signed a formal letter of separation from James Erskine but things did not improve.&lt;ref&gt;Macauley (2009) pp. 33, 41, 45, 47, 49&lt;/ref&gt; For example, she [[wikt:jeer|barracked]] her husband in the street and in church and he and one of their children were forced to hide from her in a tavern for two hours or more on one occasion. She intercepted one of his letters and took it to the authorities alleging it was evidence of treason. She is also said to have stood outside the house in Niddry's Wynd, waving the letter and shouting obscenities on at least two occasions. In January 1732 she booked a [[stagecoach]] to London and James Erskine and his friends, afraid her presence there would cause them further trouble, decided it was time to take decisive action.&lt;ref&gt;Macauley (2009) pp. 54–55, 57, 64&lt;/ref&gt;

== Kidnap ==
[[File:Simon Fraser, 11th Lord Lovat - Project Gutenberg eText transparent.png|thumb|upright|[[Simon Fraser, 11th Lord Lovat]], one of the organisers of Lady Grange's kidnapping]]
Lady Grange was abducted from her home on the night of 22 January by two [[Scottish Highlands|Highland]] noblemen, Roderick MacLeod of [[Berneray, North Uist|Berneray]] and Macdonald of [[Morar]] and several of their men. After a bloody struggle, she was taken out of the city in a [[litter (vehicle)|sedan chair]] and then on horseback to Wester Polmaise near [[Falkirk]], where she was held until 15 August on the ground floor of an uninhabited tower.&lt;ref&gt;Macauley (2009) pp. 65–70&lt;/ref&gt; She was by now over fifty years old.

From there she was taken west by Peter Fraser (a page of [[Simon Fraser, 11th Lord Lovat|Lord Lovat]]) and his men through Perthshire. At [[Balquhidder]], according to [[Clan Gregor|MacGregor]] tradition, she was entertained in the great hall, provided with a meal of venison, and slept on a heather bed covered with deerskins.&lt;ref&gt;Macauley (2009) pp. 73, 77&lt;/ref&gt;  The existence of [[Fillan|St Fillan's]] Pool on the River Fillan near [[Tyndrum]] would have provided useful cover for her captors: it was regularly used as a cure for insanity, which would have helped to explain her presence to the curious.&lt;ref&gt;Macauley (2009) p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; The details of the onward route from there are not clear but it is likely she was taken through [[Glen Coe]] to [[Loch Ness]] and then through Glen Garry to [[Loch Hourn]] on the west coast. After a short delay she was then put on board ship to the [[Monach Isles]]. The difficulty of her position must have quickly become evident. She was in the company of men whose loyalty was to clan chieftains rather than the law, and few of them spoke any English at all.  Their native [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]] would have been incomprehensible to her, although as her years of captivity wore on she slowly learned something of the language.&lt;ref&gt;Macauley (2009) pp. 78–83&lt;/ref&gt; She complained that young members of the local aristocracy visited her as she waited by the shores of Loch Hourn, but that &quot;they came with design to see me, but not to relieve me&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Macauley (2009) p. 83&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Monach Isles]], also known as Heisker, lie {{convert|8|km|mi}} west of [[North Uist]] in the [[Outer Hebrides]], an archipelago itself lying off the western coast of Scotland. The main islands are [[Ceann Ear]], [[Ceann Iar]] and [[Shivinish]], which are all linked at [[low tide]] and have a combined area of {{convert|357|ha|acre}}. The islands are low-lying and fertile, and their population in the 18th century may have been about 100.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith254&quot;&gt;Haswell-Smith (2004) pp. 254–56&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=Note|The islands were abandoned in 1810 because of overgrazing, but re-settled in 1839.

When she complained about her condition, she was told by her host that he had no orders to provide her with either clothes, or food other than the normal fare he and his wife were used to. She lived in isolation for two years, not even being told the name of the island where she was living, and it took her some time to find out who her landlord was. She was there until June 1734, when John and Norman MacLeod from North Uist arrived to move her on. They told her they were taking her to [[Orkney]], but instead set sail for the Atlantic outliers of St Kilda.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith254&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Macauley (2009) pp. 84–86&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Martin Martin]] visited the islands in 1697,&lt;ref name=&quot;Martin&quot;&gt;Martin, Martin (1703)&lt;/ref&gt; the only means of making the journey was by open longboat, which could take several days and nights of rowing and sailing across the open ocean and was next to impossible in autumn and winter. In all seasons, waves up to 12&amp;nbsp;metres (40&amp;nbsp;ft) high lash the beach of Village Bay, and even on calmer days landing on the slippery rocks can be hazardous. Cut off by distance and weather, the natives knew little of the rest of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Steel (1988) pp. 28–30&lt;/ref&gt;

Lady Grange's circumstances were correspondingly more uncomfortable and no-one on the island spoke any English.&lt;ref name=&quot;Maclean84&quot; /&gt; She described Hirta as &quot;a viled neasty,&lt;!--sic--&gt; stinking poor Isle&quot; and insisted that &quot;I was in great miserie in the Husker but I'm ten times worse and worse here&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Laing&quot;&gt;Laing (1874)&lt;/ref&gt;  Her lodgings were very primitive.

During her sojourn on Hirta she wrote two letters relating her story, which eventually reached Edinburgh. One, dated 20 January 1738, found its way to Thomas Hope of Rankeillor, her lawyer, in December 1740. Some sources state that the first letter had been hidden in some yarn that was collected as part of a rent payment and taken to Inverness and thence to Edinburgh.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mac85&quot; /&gt; The idea of the letter's concealment in yarn is also mentioned by [[James Boswell]] in his ''[[Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides]]'' (1785).

An expedition was launched, and in due course British soldiers were ferried ashore to Hirta. They found a deserted village, as the St Kildans, fearing pirates, had fled to caves to the west. When they were persuaded to come down, the soldiers discovered that the isolated natives knew nothing of the Prince and had never heard of [[George II of Great Britain|King George II]] either.&lt;ref&gt;Steel (1988) p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; Paradoxically, Lady Grange's letters and her resultant evacuation from the island may have prevented her being found by this expedition.{{refn|group=Note|Although she died in May 1745 the year before this expedition, her further travails and movements after she left St Kilda may have hastened her demise.&lt;ref&gt;Macauley (2009) p. 144&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Ruined church, Trumpan, Skye - geograph.org.uk - 43359.jpg|thumb|The ruins of [[Trumpan]] church, where Lady Grange is buried]]
By 1740 Lady Grange was 61 years old. Removed from St Kilda in haste, she was transported to various locations in the ''[[Gàidhealtachd]]'' including possibly [[Assynt]] in the far north west of mainland Scotland and the Outer Hebridean locations of [[Harris, Outer Hebrides|Harris]] and [[Uist]] before arriving at [[Waternish]] on Skye in 1742.{{refn|group=Note|According to a 19th-century source, she learned to [[Spinning (textiles)|spin]] there, in a repetition of the story relating to St Kilda, managed to smuggle a letter out in a ball of yarn, which then had the result of a government naval vessel being sent out to look for her, although there is no surviving evidence for any of these assertions. The source is Clerk (1845) and Macauley (2009) states that no letter referring to her life on Skye has ever been found, there is no record of any such sailing by a government vessel and that &quot;nor indeed does learning to spin sound quite like Lady Grange's style.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Macauley 2009 p. 142&quot;&gt;Macauley (2009) p. 142&lt;/ref&gt;}} Local folklore suggests she may have been kept for 18&amp;nbsp;months in a cave either at [[Uig, Skye|Idrigill]] on the [[Trotternish]] peninsula&lt;ref&gt;Macauley (2009) p. 143&lt;/ref&gt; or on the [[Duirinish, Skye|Duirinish]] coast near the [[stack (geology)|stacks]] known as a &quot;Macleod's Maidens&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Macleod (1906) p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; She was certainly later housed with Rory MacNeil at [[Trumpan]] in Waternish. She died there on 12&amp;nbsp;May 1745, and MacNeil had her &quot;decently interred&quot; the following week in the local churchyard. For reasons unknown a second funeral was held at nearby Duirinish some time thereafter, where a large crowd gathered to watch the burial of a coffin filled with turf and stones.&lt;ref&gt;Macauley (2009) pp. 146, 149&lt;/ref&gt;

It is sometimes stated that this was her third funeral, Lord Grange having conducted one in Edinburgh shortly after her kidnapping.&lt;ref&gt;Keay &amp; Keay (1994) p. 358&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Steel (1988) p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; However, this story first appears in writing in 1845 and no other evidence of its existence has emerged.&lt;ref name=&quot;Macauley 2009 p. 142&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clerk (1845)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Motivations ==
Lady Grange's story is a remarkable one{{refn|group=Note|Boswell (1785) wrote: &quot;The true story of this lady, which happened In this century, is as frightfully romantick as if it had been the fiction of a gloomy fancy.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Boswell&quot;&gt;Boswell (1785) &quot;Sunday 19th September&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;}} and various issues have been raised by Macauley (2009) as requiring explanation. These include: what drove James Erskine to these extraordinary lengths?;&lt;ref name=&quot;Macauley18&quot;&gt;Macauley (2009) p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; why were so many individuals willing to participate in this illegal and dangerous kidnapping of his wife?;&lt;ref name=&quot;Macauley17&quot;&gt;Macauley (2009) p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; and  how was she held for so long without rescue?&lt;ref name=&quot;Macauley18&quot; /&gt;

The first and second of these issues are related. Erskine's brother had already been exiled for his support of the Jacobites. Simon Fraser, Lord Lovat, a key figure in Lady Grange's abduction was himself executed for his part in the [[Jacobite Rising of 1745]].&lt;ref&gt;Furgol, Edward M. (2004) [http://www.oxforddnb.com/index/10/101010122/ &quot;Simon Fraser&quot;]. ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]''. Retrieved 5 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; No concrete evidence of Erskine's plotting against the crown or government has ever emerged, but any threat of such exposure, whether based in fact or fantasy would certainly have been taken very seriously by all concerned. It was thus relatively easy for Erskine to find accomplices amongst the Highland gentry. In addition to Simon Fraser and Alexander Macdonald of Sleat, the Sobieski Stuarts listed [[Norman MacLeod (The Wicked Man)|Norman MacLeod of Dunvegan]]&lt;ref&gt;Stiùbhart, Domhnall Uilleam (2004) [http://www.oxforddnb.com/index/64/101064086 &quot;Norman MacLeod of Dunvegan&quot;]. ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]''. Retrieved 5 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;—who became known as &quot;The Wicked Man&quot;—&lt;ref&gt;[[Alexander Mackenzie (historian)|Mackenzie, Alexander]] (1887) ''The Celtic Magazine'' '''12''' Inverness: A. &amp; W. Mackenzie pp. 119–22&lt;/ref&gt;as the senior accomplices.&lt;ref&gt;Macauley (2009) p. 89&lt;/ref&gt;
Erskine himself was a &quot;singular compound of good and bad qualities&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Macauley (2009) p. 155, possibly quoting the antiquarian David Laing.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to his legal career he was elected to Parliament in 1734 and he survived the vicissitudes of the Jacobite rebellions unscathed.&lt;ref name=&quot;judge&quot; /&gt; He was a philanderer and over-partial to [[claret]], whilst at the same time deeply religious.&lt;ref&gt;Macauley (2009) pp. 135–36, 139&lt;/ref&gt; This last quality would have been instrumental in any decision not to have his wife assassinated,&lt;ref&gt;Macauley (2009) p. 90&lt;/ref&gt; and he did not marry his long-term partner Fanny Lindsay until after he had heard of the first Lady Grange's death.&lt;ref&gt;Proceedings of the Society (11 June 1877)&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Blaeu - Atlas of Scotland 1654 - ÆBUDÆ INSULÆ - The Hebrides.jpg|thumb|[[Johan Blaeu]]'s 1654 map of &quot;Æbudæ Insulæ&quot; – [[The Hebrides]] – was the best available of the area in the mid-18th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bray&quot;&gt;Bray (1996) pp. 58–59&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The reason no successful rescue was ever effected lies in the remoteness of the [[Hebrides]] from the [[English-speaking world|anglophone]] world in the early 18th century. No reliable naval charts of the area became available until 1776.{{refn|group=Note|The failure of the British navy to capture [[Charles Edward Stuart|Bonnie Prince Charlie]] after the [[Battle of Culloden]] in 1745 was a major factor in the creation of a new [[Nautical chart|rutter]] by [[Murdoch Mackenzie (cartographer)|Murdoch Mackenzie]], Hydrographer to the Admiralty, called ''A Nautical Description'' researched from 1748 to 1757 and published in 1776. [[Johan Blaeu]]'s 1654 map was the best chart of the area at the time, but even this was not available to the Hanoverian government  and military at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bray&quot; /&gt;}} Without local assistance and knowledge, finding a captive in this wilderness would have required a significant expeditionary force. Nonetheless, the lack of action taken by Edinburgh society in general and her children in particular to retrieve one of their own is remarkable. The [[Church of Scotland|Kirk]] hierarchy, for example, made no attempt to contact her or convey news of her condition to the capital, yet they could easily have done so. Whatever the call of morality and natural justice may have suggested, John Chiesley's daughter evidently did not command a sympathetic audience in her home town.&lt;ref&gt;Macauley (2009) pp. 117–18&lt;/ref&gt;

In her account of the affair, Margaret Macauley explores 18th-century attitudes to women in general as a significant factor&lt;ref&gt;Macauley (2009) pp. 170–71&lt;/ref&gt; and notes that although numerous documents from the hands of Lord Grange's friends and supporters are still extant, not a single contemporary female view of the affair has survived, save that of Lady Grange herself.&lt;ref&gt;Macauley (2009) pp. 153–54&lt;/ref&gt; [[Divorce]]s were complex and divorced mothers were rarely given custody of children.&lt;ref name=&quot;Macauley170&quot;&gt;Macauley (2009) p. 170&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=Note|The [[Scots law|Scottish legal system]] of the day was &quot;fundamentally different&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Macauley170&quot; /&gt; from its [[English law|English equivalent]] in these matters. For example, Lady Grange could have sued for divorce in Scotland as husbands and wives were treated alike in this matter, although in England at the time &quot;adultery by the husband was generally regarded as a regrettable but understandable foible&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Macauley170&quot; /&gt;}} Furthermore, Lord Grange's powerful friends in both the church and the legal profession might have made this a risky endeavour.&lt;ref&gt;Macauley (2009) p. 171&lt;/ref&gt; Something of James Erskine's attitude to these matters may perhaps be gleaned from the fact that for his first speech in the [[House of Commons of Great Britain|House of Commons]] he chose to oppose the repeal of various laws relating to [[witchcraft]]. Even in his day this appeared unduly conservative and his perorations were met with laughter, which effectively ended his political career before it had begun.&lt;ref&gt;Macauley (2009) p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in the mid-19th century the Sobieski Stuarts told the tale from the perspective of the descendants of the Highland aristocrats who had been responsible for Chiesley's kidnap and imprisonment. They emphasise Lady Grange's personal shortcomings, although to modern sensibilities these hardly seem good reasons for a judge and [[Member of Parliament]] and his wealthy friends to organise an illegal kidnapping and life sentence.&lt;ref&gt;Sobieski Stuart (1847)&lt;/ref&gt;

As for Lady Grange herself, her vituperative outbursts and indulgence in alcohol were clearly important factors in her undoing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Macauley154&quot;&gt;Macauley (2009) p. 154&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alexander Carlyle]] described her  as &quot;stormy and outrageous&quot;, whilst noting that it was in her husband's interests to exaggerate the nature of her violent emotions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Macauley154&quot; /&gt; Macauley (2009) takes the view that the ultimate cause of her troubles was her reaction to her husband's infidelity. In an attempt to end his relationship with Mrs Lindsay, (who owned a coffee house in [[Haymarket, Edinburgh]]), Rachel threatened to expose him as a Jacobite sympathiser. Perhaps she did not understand the magnitude of this accusation and the danger it posed to her husband and his friends, or how ruthless their instincts of self-preservation were likely to be.&lt;ref&gt;Macauley (2009) p. 137&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Macauley (2009) pp. 156–57&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James Boswell|Boswell]] and [[Samuel Johnson|Johnson]] discussed the subject during their 1773 tour of the Hebrides. Boswell wrote: &quot;After dinner to-day, we talked of the extraordinary fact of Lady Grange's being sent to St Kilda, and confined there for several years, without any means of relief. Dr Johnson said, if M'Leod would let it be known that he had such a place for naughty ladies, he might make it a very profitable island.&quot;{{refn|group=Note|In an additional note Boswell added: &quot; She was the wife of one of the Lords of Session in Scotland, a man of the very first blood of his country. For some mysterious reasons, which have never been discovered, she was seized and carried off in the dark, she knew not by whom, and by nightly journies was conveyed to the Highland shores, from whence she was transported by sea to the remote rock of St Kilda, where she remained, amongst its few wild inhabitants, a forlorn prisoner, but had a constant supply of provisions, and a woman to wait on her. No inquiry was made after her, till she at last found means to convey a letter to a confidential friend, by the daughter of a Catechist who concealed it in a clue of yarn. Information being thus obtained at Edinburgh, a ship was sent to bring her off; but intelligence of this being received, she was conveyed to M'Leod's island of Herries, where she died.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Boswell&quot; /&gt;}}

There are portraits of both James Erskine and Rachel Chiesley in the [[Scottish National Portrait Gallery]] in Edinburgh, by [[William Aikman (painter)|William Aikman]] and [[John Baptist Medina|Sir John Baptiste de Medina]] respectively. When the writer Margaret Macauley sought them out she discovered they had been placed together in the same cold store.&lt;ref name=&quot;Macauley 2009 p. 19&quot; /&gt;
