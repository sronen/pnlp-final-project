'''Alexander Cameron Rutherford''' (February 2, 1857 – June 11, 1941) was a Canadian lawyer and politician who served as the [[List of Premiers of Alberta|first]] Premier of [[Alberta]] from 1905 to 1910. Born in [[Ormond, Ontario|Ormond]], [[Ontario]], he studied and practised law in [[Ottawa]] before moving with his family to the [[Northwest Territories]] in 1895.  Here he began his political career, winning in his third attempt  a seat in the [[Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories]].  In keeping with the territorial custom Rutherford ran as an [[independent (politician)|independent]], though he generally supported the territorial administration of Premier [[Frederick W. A. G. Haultain]]. At the federal level, however, Rutherford was a [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]].

In 1905, Alberta Lieutenant Governor [[George Bulyea]] asked Rutherford to form the new province's first government. As Premier, his first task was to win a workable majority in the [[Legislative Assembly of Alberta]], which he did in the [[Alberta general election, 1905|1905 provincial election]]. His second was to provide the apparatus of provincial government: his government established everything from [[speed limit]]s to a provincial court system. The legislature also controversially, and with Rutherford's support, selected [[Edmonton]] over rival [[Calgary]] as the provincial capital. Calgarians' bruised feelings were not salved when the government located the [[University of Alberta]], a project dear to the Premier's heart, in his hometown of Strathcona, just across the [[North Saskatchewan River]] from Edmonton.

The government was faced with labour unrest in the [[coal mining]] industry, which it resolved by establishing a commission to examine the problem. It also set up a provincial government telephone network—[[Alberta Government Telephones]]—at great expense, and tried to encourage the development of new railways.  It was in pursuit of this last objective that the Rutherford government found itself embroiled in scandal. Early in 1910, [[William Henry Cushing]]'s resignation as Minister of Public Works precipitated the [[Alberta and Great Waterways Railway scandal]], which turned many of Rutherford's Liberals against his government. Eventually, pressure from many party figures forced Rutherford to resign.  He kept his seat in the legislature after resigning as premier, but was defeated in the [[Alberta general election, 1913|1913 election]] by [[Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta|Conservative]] [[Herbert Crawford]].

After leaving politics, Rutherford continued his law practice and his involvement with a wide range of community groups. Most importantly, he became chancellor of the University of Alberta, whose earlier founding had been a personal project. He died of a heart attack June 11, 1941. A University of Alberta library, an Edmonton elementary school, and [[Jasper National Park]]'s [[Mount Rutherford]] are named in his honour. Additionally, his home, [[Rutherford House]], was opened as a museum in 1973.

==Early life==
[[File:Rutherford articling.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Rutherford as an articled clerk, ''c.'' 1883]]Alexander Rutherford was born February 2, 1857, near [[Ormond, Ontario|Ormond]], [[Ontario]] on his family's dairy farm.&lt;ref name=&quot;Babcock 1&quot;&gt;Babcock 1&lt;/ref&gt; His parents, James (1817&amp;ndash;1891) and Elspet&lt;ref name=&quot;pc205&quot; /&gt; &quot;Elizabeth&quot; (1818&amp;ndash;1901) Cameron Rutherford,&lt;ref name=&quot;pc205&quot;&gt;Perry, Craig 2006, pg. 205&lt;/ref&gt; had immigrated from [[Scotland]] two years previous.&lt;ref name=&quot;Babcock 1&quot;/&gt; They joined the [[Baptist Church]], and his father joined the [[Liberal Party of Canada]] and served for a time on the [[Osgoode, Ontario|Osgoode]] village council.&lt;ref name=&quot;Babcock 1&quot;/&gt; Rutherford attended public school locally and, after rejecting dairy farming as a vocation, enrolled in a [[Metcalfe, Ontario|Metcalfe]] high school.&lt;ref name=&quot;Babcock 1&quot;/&gt; After graduating in 1874, he attended the [[Canadian Literary Institute]], a Baptist college in [[Woodstock, Ontario|Woodstock]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Babcock 1&quot;/&gt; He graduated from there in 1876, and taught for a year in Osgoode before going to [[Montreal]] to study arts and [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] at [[McGill University]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Roome 4&quot;&gt;Roome 4&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded degrees in both in 1881, and joined the [[Ottawa]] law firm of Scott, McTavish and McCracken where he was [[articled clerk|articled]] for four years under the tutelage of [[Richard William Scott]].&lt;ref&gt;Babcock 1–4&lt;/ref&gt; Called to the Ontario bar in 1885, he became a junior partner in the firm of Hodgins, Kidd and Rutherford with responsibility for its [[Kemptville, Ontario|Kemptville]] office for ten years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Babcock 4&quot;&gt;Babcock 4&lt;/ref&gt; He also established a moneylending business there.&lt;ref name=&quot;Babcock 5&quot;&gt;Babcock 5&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, his social circle grew to include [[William Cameron Edwards]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Babcock 4&quot;/&gt; Through Edwards, Rutherford was introduced to the Birkett family, which included former [[Member of Parliament]] [[Thomas Birkett]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Babcock 4&quot;/&gt; Rutherford married Birkett's niece, Mattie Birkett, in December 1888.&lt;ref name=&quot;Babcock 4&quot;/&gt; The couple had three children: Cecil (born in 1890), Hazel (born in 1893),&lt;ref name=&quot;Babcock 4&quot;/&gt; and Marjorie (born in 1903, but died sixteen months later).&lt;ref&gt;Babcock 21–22&lt;/ref&gt; Rutherford had a traditional view of gender roles, and was happy to leave most child-rearing responsibilities to his wife.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roome 6&quot;&gt;Roome 6&lt;/ref&gt;

===Move west===
In November 1886 Rutherford visited the Canadian west for the first time when he travelled to [[British Columbia]] to investigate the disappearance of his cousin.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roome 5&quot;&gt;Roome 5&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Rocky Mountains]] left a great impression on him, as did the coastal climate which he found &quot;very agreeable&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roome 5&quot;/&gt; He visited again in the summer of 1894, when he took the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] across the prairies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Babcock 4&quot;/&gt; Upon arriving in [[Strathcona, Alberta|South Edmonton]], he was excited by the its growth potential and pleased to find that the dry air relieved his [[bronchitis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Babcock 4&quot;/&gt; He resolved to settle there, and did so one year later, bringing his reluctant wife and his children,&lt;ref name=&quot;Roome 5&quot;/&gt; who arrived by train June 10, 1895.&lt;ref name=&quot;Babcock 5&quot;/&gt; Within ten days of their arrival, Rutherford had opened a law office, purchased four lots of land, and contracted local builder Hugh McCurdy to build him a house.&lt;ref name=&quot;Babcock 8&quot;&gt;Babcock 8&lt;/ref&gt; In July they moved into their new home, a four-room house built on a single storey.&lt;ref name=&quot;Babcock 8&quot;/&gt; In 1896 Rutherford became the town's only lawyer, as his only competition, Mervyn Mackenzie, moved to [[Toronto]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Babcock 5&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Alexander Rutherford 1895.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Rutherford around the time of his move west]]Rutherford quickly became deeply involved in the community. Among the roles he acquired during his first three years in Alberta were President of the newly formed South Edmonton Football Club, secretary-treasurer of the South Edmonton School Board, president of the South Edmonton Athletic Association, vice president of the South Edmonton Literary Institute, auditor of the South Edmonton Agricultural Society, and worthy master of the Acacia Lodge, Ancient Free and Accepted [[freemasonry|Masons]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Babcock 10&quot;&gt;Babcock 10&lt;/ref&gt; He later added to this the title of secretary of the Edmonton District Butter and Cheese Manufacturing Association.&lt;ref name=&quot;Babcock 10&quot;/&gt; He was an early advocate for the incorporation of South Edmonton, hitherto an [[unincorporated community]], and when incorporation came in 1899—as the Town of [[Strathcona, Alberta|Strathcona]]—Rutherford became the new town's secretary-treasurer (after acting as returning officer in its first election).&lt;ref name=&quot;Babcock 10&quot;/&gt;

Throughout this period, he practised law, from 1899 with future [[Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta|Conservative]] [[Legislative Assembly of Alberta|MLA]] [[Frederick C. Jamieson]] as his partner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Babcock 15&quot;&gt;Babcock 15&lt;/ref&gt; He employed single women as secretaries in an era when clerical workers were predominantly male, and defended a [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|native Canadian]] accused of murder at a time when most lawyers refused such cases.&lt;ref name=&quot;Babcock 15&quot;/&gt; As their practice grew, he and Jamieson also engaged in [[credit (finance)|moneylending]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Babcock 21&quot;&gt;Babcock 21&lt;/ref&gt; Besides his law practice, Rutherford was a successful [[real estate]] investor, and also owned an interest in [[gold mining]] equipment situated on the [[North Saskatchewan River]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Babcock 16&quot;&gt;Babcock 16&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early political career===
In 1896, [[Frank Oliver (politician)|Frank Oliver]], who had represented [[Edmonton (N.W.T. electoral district)|Edmonton]] in the [[Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories]] since 1888, resigned to pursue a career in federal politics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Babcock 10&quot;/&gt; Several Strathcona residents urged Rutherford to run for Oliver's old seat in the ensuing [[by-election]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Babcock 10&quot;/&gt; Though he was originally reluctant, he agreed to stand after a three hundred signature [[petition]] urging his candidacy was presented to him.&lt;ref name=&quot;Babcock 10&quot;/&gt; His only opponent was former [[Mayor of Edmonton|Edmonton mayor]] [[Matthew McCauley (politician)|Matthew McCauley]] who, like Rutherford, ran as an [[independent (politician)|independent]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Babcock 10&quot;/&gt; Rutherford campaigned on a platform of improved roads, resource development, simplification of territorial ordinances, and—in what would become a theme of his political career—increased educational funding.&lt;ref name=&quot;Babcock 10&quot;/&gt; McCauley won the election, but Rutherford received more than forty percent of the vote.&lt;ref name=&quot;Babcock 10&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Rutherford family.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The Rutherford family in 1898]]During the [[Northwest Territories general election, 1898|1898 territorial election]], Rutherford again challenged the now-incumbent McCauley.&lt;ref name=&quot;Babcock 10&quot;/&gt; His defeat of two years previous still fresh in his mind, his platform this time included a call for a [[redistribution (election)|redrawing]] of the territory's electoral boundaries; he felt that the current Edmonton [[electoral district (Canada)|riding]] was [[gerrymander]]ed in McCauley's favour.&lt;ref name=&quot;Babcock 11&quot;&gt;Babcock 11&lt;/ref&gt; He also repeated his past calls for improved roads and advocated increased taxation on the railroads.&lt;ref name=&quot;Babcock 11&quot;/&gt; He pledged &quot;independent support&quot; for the non-partisan administration of Premier [[Frederick Haultain]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Babcock 10&quot;/&gt; and supported that administration's call for the creation of a [[Province of Buffalo|single province]] from the territories following the 1901 [[census]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Babcock 11&quot;/&gt; Rutherford also criticized McCauley's past record, accusing him of silence on issues that were of concern to his constituents.&lt;ref name=&quot;Babcock 11&quot;/&gt; Despite this, McCauley won again, albeit by a reduced margin.&lt;ref name=&quot;Babcock 11&quot;/&gt;

Rutherford was at last successful in the [[Northwest Territories general election, 1902|1902 election]], when he ran in the newly created riding of [[Strathcona (N.W.T. electoral district)|Strathcona]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Babcock 19&quot;&gt;Babcock 19&lt;/ref&gt; His 1902 platform was similar to his 1898 platform and supported Haultain, though this time he supported a two province integration of the [[Northwest Territories]] into [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]], rather than Haultain's preferred one province approach, on the grounds that a single province would be so large as to be ungovernable.&lt;ref name=&quot;Babcock 19&quot;/&gt;  It at first looked as though he would run unopposed; however, at the last minute local lawyer Nelson D. Mills publicly accused Rutherford of being not a true independent, but a dyed-in-the-wool Haultain supporter, and announced that he would run against him.&lt;ref name=&quot;Babcock 19&quot;/&gt; Nevertheless, Rutherford was supported by most of Strathcona's most prominent residents, including his law partner Jamieson and his future rival [[John R. Boyle]], and won an easy victory.&lt;ref name=&quot;Babcock 19&quot;/&gt;

Rutherford served in the [[Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories]] until Alberta became a province in 1905. During his tenure, he was elected deputy [[speaker (politics)|speaker]] and sat on standing committees for libraries, municipal law, and education.&lt;ref name=&quot;Babcock 19&quot;/&gt; His legislative efforts included successful attempts to extend the boundaries of the Town of Strathcona and to empower it to borrow for construction of public works.&lt;ref name=&quot;Babcock 19&quot;/&gt; He was considered a possible member of Haultain's [[Executive Council (Canada)|executive council]], likely in the post of Commissioner of Public Works, but the post instead went to [[George Bulyea]].&lt;ref&gt;Babcock 19–20&lt;/ref&gt; He joined many of his fellow [[Member of the Legislative Assembly|MLA]]s in continuing to advocate for provincial status, finding that the limitations on a territory's means to raise revenue prevented the Northwest Territories from meeting its obligations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roome 7&quot;&gt;Roome 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Though Rutherford supported Haultain's vision of non-partisan territorial administration, federally he was an avowed [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]]. In 1900, he was elected president of the Strathcona Liberal association, and was a delegate to the convention that nominated Oliver as the party's candidate in [[Alberta (Provisional District)|Alberta]] for the [[Canadian federal election, 1900|1900 federal election]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Babcock 16&quot;/&gt; He subsequently campaigned for Oliver in his successful re-election attempt.&lt;ref name=&quot;Babcock 16&quot;/&gt; When the new federal constituency of [[Strathcona (electoral district)|Strathcona]] was formed in advance of the [[Canadian federal election, 1904|1904 election]],&lt;ref&gt;Not to be confused with the territorial constituency of the same name, which Rutherford was then representing, or the provincial district, which he would later represent&lt;/ref&gt; Rutherford was urged to accept the Liberal nomination, but demurred.&lt;ref name=&quot;Babcock 20&quot;&gt;Babcock 20&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Talbot (politician)|Peter Talbot]] was selected instead and, supported by Rutherford, was elected.&lt;ref name=&quot;Babcock 20&quot;/&gt;

===Selection as Premier===
[[File:1905albertacabinet.jpg|thumb|right|Rutherford and his cabinet]]
In February 1905, the federal government of [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] Sir [[Wilfrid Laurier]] introduced legislation to create two new provinces—[[Alberta]] and [[Saskatchewan]]—from the Northwest Territories.&lt;ref name=&quot;Babcock 22&quot;&gt;Babcock 22&lt;/ref&gt; Though Haultain wanted the new provinces to be governed on the same non-partisan basis as the Territories had been, it was expected that the Liberal Laurier would recommend a Liberal to serve as [[Lieutenant-Governor (Canada)|Lieutenant-Governor]], and it was further assumed that the Lieutenant-Governor would call on a Liberal to form the new province's first government.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 15&quot;&gt;Thomas 15&lt;/ref&gt; Oliver was the province's most prominent Liberal, but had just been named federal Minister of the Interior, and was not interested in leaving Ottawa.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 16&quot;&gt;Thomas 16&lt;/ref&gt; Talbot was Laurier's preferred candidate, but he expected to be appointed to the [[Canadian Senate|Senate]] and found the prospect more congenial than serving as Premier of Alberta.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 16&quot;/&gt; Both men supported Rutherford, though neither was enthusiastic about doing so.&lt;ref name=&quot;Babcock 23&quot;&gt;Babcock 23&lt;/ref&gt; In August, Bulyea was appointed Alberta's first Lieutenant-Governor and later that month the [[Liberal Party of Alberta|Alberta Liberals]] selected Rutherford as their first leader.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas 17–18&lt;/ref&gt; A final barrier was removed a few days later when Haultain, who was a [[Conservative Party of Canada (historical)|Conservative]] federally but who was thought to be a potential leader of a [[coalition government]], announced that he would stay in [[Regina, Saskatchewan|Regina]] to lead the Saskatchewan Conservatives.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 18&quot;&gt;Thomas 18&lt;/ref&gt; On September 2, Bulyea asked Rutherford to form the first government of Alberta.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 19&quot;&gt;Thomas 19&lt;/ref&gt;

After accepting the position of premier, Rutherford selected a geographically diverse cabinet on September 6: [[Edmonton]]'s [[Charles Wilson Cross]] as Attorney-General, [[Calgary]]'s [[William Henry Cushing]] as Minister of Public Works, [[Medicine Hat]]'s [[William Finlay]] as Minister of Agriculture and Provincial Secretary, and [[Lethbridge]]'s [[Leverett DeVeber|George DeVeber]] as Minister without Portfolio.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas 21–22&lt;/ref&gt; Rutherford kept for himself the positions of Provincial Treasurer and Minister of Education.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 21&quot;&gt;Thomas 21&lt;/ref&gt;

==Premier==
===1905 election===
{{main|Alberta general election, 1905}}
Rutherford was Premier, but had not yet faced the people in an election and did not yet have a legislature to which he could propose legislation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Babcock 27&quot;&gt;Babcock 27&lt;/ref&gt; Elections for the first [[Legislative Assembly of Alberta]] were accordingly fixed for November 9.&lt;ref name=&quot;Babcock 27&quot;/&gt; The [[Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta|Conservatives]], the young province's only other political party, had already selected [[R. B. Bennett]] as their leader.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 18&quot;/&gt; Bennett attacked the terms under which Alberta had been made a province, especially the clauses that left control of its lands and natural resources in the hands of the federal government and required the continued provincial funding of [[separate school]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 24&quot;&gt;Thomas 24&lt;/ref&gt; He pointed out that Canada's older provinces had control of their own natural resources and that education was a provincial responsibility under the [[British North America Act]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Babcock 27&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 24&quot;/&gt; The Liberals responded to these criticisms by highlighting the financial compensation the province received from the federal government in exchange for control of its natural resources, which amounted to $375,000 per year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Babcock 27&quot;/&gt; They further suggested that Conservative concern for control of lands was due to their desire to make favourable land concessions to the unpopular [[Canadian Pacific Railway]], which had historically been friendly with the Conservatives, and for whom Bennett had acted as solicitor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 26&quot;&gt;Thomas 26&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Young R. B. Bennett.JPG|thumb|upright|left|Conservative leader [[R. B. Bennett]] was Rutherford's opponent in the 1905 election.]]
Besides the Conservatives' ties to the CPR, Rutherford's Liberals enjoyed the incumbent's advantage of controlling the levers of [[patronage]], and the election's result was never really in doubt.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas 29–30&lt;/ref&gt; Before the election, Talbot predicted that the government would win 18 of the province's 25 seats.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 28&quot;&gt;Thomas 28&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately after the election it appeared that the Liberals had won 21; when all the votes had been counted they had won 23 seats to the Conservatives' two.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 28&quot;/&gt; Bennett himself was defeated in his [[Calgary (provincial electoral district)|Calgary riding]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 28&quot;/&gt; When the outcome was clear, the people of Strathcona feted Rutherford with a torchlight procession and bonfire.&lt;ref name=&quot;Babcock 28&quot;&gt;Babcock 28&lt;/ref&gt;

===First legislature and regional tensions===
One of the most contentious issues facing the newly elected government was the decision of the province's capital city. The federal legislation creating the province had fixed [[Edmonton]] as the provisional capital, much to the chagrin of [[Calgary]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 13&quot;&gt;Thomas 13&lt;/ref&gt; Neither party had taken a position on the divisive question during the campaign,&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 24&quot;/&gt; but selecting a permanent capital was high on the list of the new legislature's orders of business.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 38&quot;/&gt; Calgary's case was made most enthusiastically by Minister of Public Works Cushing, Edmonton's by Attorney-General Cross.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 38&quot;/&gt; [[Banff, Alberta|Banff]] and [[Red Deer, Alberta|Red Deer]] were also possibilities, but motions to select each failed to find seconders.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 38&quot;/&gt; In the end, Edmonton was designated by a vote of sixteen members—including Rutherford—to eight.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 38&quot;&gt;Thomas 38&lt;/ref&gt;

A personal priority of Rutherford had been the establishment of a university.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 39&quot;/&gt; Though the ''[[Edmonton Bulletin]]'' opined that it would be unfair &quot;that the people of the Province should be taxed for the special benefit of four per cent that they may be able to attach the cognomen of B.A. or M.A. to their names and flaunt the vanity of such over the taxpayer, who has to pay for it&quot;, Rutherford proceeded quickly.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 39&quot;/&gt;  He was concerned that delay might result in the creation of denominational colleges, striking a blow to his dream of a high quality non-sectarian system of post-secondary education.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 40&quot;&gt;Thomas 40&lt;/ref&gt; A bill establishing the University was passed by the legislature, but left the government to decide the location.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 50&quot;/&gt; Calgary felt that, having lost the fight to be provincial capital, it could expect the university to be established there,&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 39&quot;&gt;Thomas 39&lt;/ref&gt; and was not pleased a year later when the government announced the founding of the [[University of Alberta]] in Rutherford's hometown of Strathcona.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 50&quot;&gt;Thomas 50&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Premier Rutherford.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Rutherford as Premier]]While these regionally charged issues attracted much attention, they were far from the government's only initiatives during the legislature's first session. In 1906 it passed a series of acts dealing with the organization and administration of the new provincial government and incorporated the cities of [[Lethbridge]], [[Medicine Hat]], and [[Wetaskiwin]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 41&quot;&gt;Thomas 41&lt;/ref&gt; It also established a [[speed limit]] of {{convert|20|mph|km/h}} for motorized vehicles and set up a regime for mine inspection.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas 40–41&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps most significantly, it set up a court system,&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 36&quot;&gt;Thomas 36&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Arthur Lewis Sifton]] as the province's first Chief Justice.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 48&quot;&gt;Thomas 48&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the founding of the University of Alberta was the centrepiece of Rutherford's educational policy, his activity as Minister of Education extended well beyond it. In the first year of Alberta's existence, 140 new schools were established, and a [[normal school]] was set up in Calgary to train teachers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 41&quot;/&gt; Rutherford put great emphasis on the creation of English-language schools in the large portions of the province occupied primarily by central- and eastern-European immigrants.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 41&quot;/&gt; The immigrants themselves were often unable to speak English, and the provision of these schools for their children was a major factor in their rapid assimilation into Albertan society.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 42&quot;&gt;Thomas 42&lt;/ref&gt; They were also in lieu of separate religious schools for groups such as [[Mennonites]]; while the continued existence of [[Roman Catholic]] separate schools was mandated by the terms of Alberta's admission into Confederation, the government's policy was otherwise to encourage a unified and secular public school system.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 42&quot;/&gt; Rutherford also introduced free school texts in the province, though he was criticized for commissioning the texts from a [[Toronto]] publisher (which printed them in [[New York (state)|New York]]) rather than locally.&lt;ref name=&quot;Babcock 35&quot;&gt;Babcock 35&lt;/ref&gt;

===Labour unrest===
The winter of 1906–07 was the coldest in Alberta history; this was exacerbated by a shortage of coal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 46&quot;&gt;Thomas 46&lt;/ref&gt; One cause of this shortage was the strained relationship between coal miners and mine operators in the province.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 46&quot;/&gt; At the beginning of April 1907 the Canada West Coal and Coke Company [[lockout (industry)|locked out]] the miners from its mine near [[Taber, Alberta (town)|Taber]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 47&quot;&gt;Thomas 47&lt;/ref&gt; The same company was also facing a work stoppage at its mine in the [[Crow's Nest Pass]], where miners were refusing to sign a new contract.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 47&quot;/&gt; The problem spread, until by April 22 all 3,400 miners working for member-companies of the Western Coal Operators' Association were off work.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 47&quot;/&gt; Miners' demands included increased wages,&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 47&quot;/&gt; a reduction in working hours to eight per day (from ten), the posting of mine inspection reports, the isolated storage of explosives, the use of non-freezing explosives, and semi-monthly rather than monthly pay; the mine operators objected to this last point on the basis that many miners did not report to work the day after payday, and it was thus desirable to keep paydays to a minimum.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 48&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Arthur Sifton2.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Arthur Sifton]] chaired the commission inquiring into conditions in Alberta's coal mines, and later succeeded Rutherford as Premier.]]Rutherford's government appointed a commission in February, but it was not until May that it met.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 48&quot;/&gt; It consisted of Chief Justice Sifton, mining executive Lewis Stockett, and miners' union executive William Haysom.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 48&quot;/&gt; It began taking evidence in July.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 48&quot;/&gt; In the meantime, a May agreement saw most miners return to work at increased rates of pay; coal supply promptly increased, as did its price.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 48&quot;/&gt; In August, the commission released its recommendations, which included a prohibition on children under 16 working in mines, the posting of inspectors' reports, mandatory bath houses at mine sites, and improved ventilation inspection. It also recommended that Albertans keep a supply of coal on hand during the summer for winter use.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 48&quot;/&gt; The commission was silent on wages, other than to say that these should not be fixed by legislation, the operation of [[company store]]s (a sore point among the miners), and the [[Incorporation (business)|incorporation]] of mine unions which was recommended by mines but opposed by the unions.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas 48–49&lt;/ref&gt; It also made no recommendation about working hours, but Rutherford's government legislated an eight hour day anyway.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 49&quot;&gt;Thomas 49&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from coal mining issues, the government also passed [[workers' compensation]] legislation designed to make such compensation automatic, rather than requiring the injured worker to sue his employer.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas 56–57&lt;/ref&gt; Labour representatives criticized the bill for failing to impose fines on negligent employers and for limiting construction workers' eligibility under the program to injuries sustained while working on buildings more than {{convert|40|ft|m}} in height, as well as for its exemption of casual labourers. It also viewed the maximum payout of $1,500 as inadequate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 57&quot;&gt;Thomas 57&lt;/ref&gt; In response to these concerns, the maximum was increased to $1,800 and the minimum building height reduced to {{convert|30|ft|m}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 57&quot;/&gt; In response to farmers' concerns, farm labourers were exempt from the bill entirely.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 57&quot;/&gt;

Rutherford's relationship with organized labour was never easy. Historian L.G. Thomas argued that there was little indication that Rutherford had any interest in courting the labour vote.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 49&quot;/&gt; In 1908, [[Labour parties and candidates in Canada|Labour]] candidate [[Donald McNabb]] was elected in a [[Lethbridge (provincial electoral district)|Lethbridge]] by-election; the riding had previously been held by a Liberal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 49&quot;/&gt; McNabb was the first Labour MLA elected in Alberta, though he was defeated in his 1909 re-election bid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Finkel |first=Alvin |year=1985 |month=Fall |title=The Rise and Fall of the Labour Party in Alberta, 1917–42 |journal=Labour/Le Travail (Journal of Canadian Labour Studies) |volume=16 |page=63 |url=http://www.lltjournal.ca/index.php/llt/article/viewPDFInterstitial/2472/2875 |accessdate=2008-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public works===
Rutherford's Liberals self-identified as the party of free enterprise, in contrast to the public ownership-supporting Conservatives.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 23&quot;&gt;Thomas 23&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, they made a limited number of large-scale forays into government operation of utilities, the most notable of which was the creation of [[Alberta Government Telephones]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 50&quot;/&gt; In 1906, Alberta's municipalities legislation was passed and included a provision authorizing municipalities to operate telephone companies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 52&quot;&gt;Thomas 52&lt;/ref&gt; Several, including Edmonton, did so, alongside private companies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 52&quot;/&gt; The largest of this latter group was the [[Bell Canada|Bell Telephone Company]], which held a [[monopoly]] over service in Calgary.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 52&quot;/&gt; Such monopolies and the private firms' refusal to extend their services into sparsely populated and unprofitable rural areas aroused demand for provincial entry into the market, which was effected in 1907.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 51&quot;&gt;Thomas 51&lt;/ref&gt; The government constructed a number of lines, beginning with one between Calgary and Banff, and also purchased Bell's lines for $675,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 53&quot;&gt;Thomas 53&lt;/ref&gt;

Alberta's public telephone system was financed by debt, which was unusual for a government like Rutherford's that was generally committed to the principle of &quot;[[PAYGO|pay as you go]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas 52–53&lt;/ref&gt; Rutherford's stated rationale was that the cost of such a large capital project shouldn't be borne by a single generation and that incurring debt to finance a corresponding asset was, in contrast to operating [[Government budget deficit|deficit]]s, acceptable.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 53&quot;/&gt; Though the move was popular at the time, it would prove not to be a financially astute one: by focusing on areas neglected by existing companies, the government was entering into the most expensive and least profitable fields of telecommunication.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 52&quot;/&gt; These problems would not come to fruition until Rutherford had left office, however; in the short-term, the government's involvement in the telephone business helped it to a sweeping victory in the [[Alberta general election, 1909|1909 election]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 64&quot;&gt;Thomas 64&lt;/ref&gt; in which the Liberals won 37 of 41 seats in the newly expanded legislature.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 69&quot;&gt;Thomas 69&lt;/ref&gt;

Of equal profile was Rutherford's government's management of the province's railways. Alberta's early years were optimistic ones, which manifested itself in a pronounced enthusiasm for the construction of new railway lines.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 59&quot;&gt;Thomas 59&lt;/ref&gt; Every town wanted to be a railway centre, and the government had great confidence in the ability of the free market to provide low freight rates to the province's farmers provided sufficient charters were issued to competing companies.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas 43–44&lt;/ref&gt; The legislature passed government-sponsored legislation setting out a framework for new railways in 1907, but interest from private firms in actually building the lines was limited.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas 58–59&lt;/ref&gt; In the face of public demand and support by legislators of all parties for as rapid as possible an expansion of the province's lines, the government offered [[loan guarantees]] to several companies in exchange for commitments to build lines.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 62&quot;&gt;Thomas 62&lt;/ref&gt; Rutherford justified this in part by his conviction that railways needed to expand along with population, rather than having railway expansion follow population growth as would be the case without government intervention.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 62&quot;/&gt; The Conservatives argued that this strategy didn't go far enough, and called for direct government ownership.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 59&quot;/&gt;
[[File:Alexander Rutherford.jpg|thumb|left|Rutherford's official portrait.]]
While most public works issues were handled by Public Works Minister Cushing, following the 1909 election Rutherford named himself as the province's first Minister of Railways.&lt;ref&gt;Babcock 57&lt;/ref&gt;

===Railway scandal===
{{main|Alberta and Great Waterways Railway scandal}}
[[File:John R. Boyle, lawyer.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[John R. Boyle]] led the dissident Liberals during the railway scandal.]]
When the legislature met for the first time after the 1909 election, things seemed to be going well for Rutherford and his government.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 69&quot;/&gt; He controlled a huge majority, albeit slightly reduced from the 1905 election, and enjoyed widespread popularity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 69&quot;/&gt; His government had achieved significant success in setting up a new province, and this success looked poised to continue.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 64&quot;/&gt; Early in this new legislative session, however, two signs of trouble appeared: Liberal backbencher [[John R. Boyle]] began to ask questions about the agreement between the government and the Alberta and Great Waterways Railway Company, and Cushing resigned from cabinet over his views of this same agreement.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas 70–71&lt;/ref&gt;

The Alberta and Great Waterways Railway was one of several companies that had been granted charters and assistance by the legislature to build new railways in the province.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 62&quot;/&gt; The government support that it received was more generous than that received by more established railways, such as the [[Grand Trunk Pacific Railway]] and the [[Canadian Northern Railway]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 62&quot;/&gt; Boyle, Cushing, and Bennett alleged favouritism or ineptitude by Rutherford and his government, and pointed to the sale of government-guaranteed bonds in support of the company as further evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas 72–79&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the high interest rate they paid, the bonds were sold at above [[par value]], but the government only received par for them, leaving the company to pocket the difference.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas 77–78&lt;/ref&gt;

Boyle sponsored a [[motion of non-confidence]] against the government.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 72&quot;&gt;Thomas 72&lt;/ref&gt; Despite enjoying the support of twelve Liberals, including Cushing, the motion was defeated and the government upheld.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 80&quot;&gt;Thomas 80&lt;/ref&gt; Rutherford attempted to quell the controversy by calling a [[royal commission]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 84&quot;&gt;Thomas 84&lt;/ref&gt; but pressure from many Liberals, including Bulyea, led him to resign May 26, 1910; he was replaced by [[Arthur Sifton]], hitherto the province's chief judge.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas 87–90&lt;/ref&gt; In November, the royal commission issued its report.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 97&quot;&gt;Thomas 97&lt;/ref&gt; It found that the evidence did not show a [[conflict of interest]] on Rutherford's part, but the majority report was nevertheless highly critical of the former Premier.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas 97–104&lt;/ref&gt; A minority report was much kinder, avowing perfect satisfaction with Rutherford's version of events.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas 104–105&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
===Later political career===
After resigning as Premier, Rutherford continued to sit as a Liberal MLA.&lt;ref name=&quot;Babcock 69&quot;&gt;Babcock 69&lt;/ref&gt; He commanded the loyalty of many Liberals who had supported his government through the Alberta and Great Waterways issue,&lt;ref name=&quot;Babcock 67&quot;&gt;Babcock 67&lt;/ref&gt; though this faction began increasingly to see Cross as its real leader.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 108&quot;&gt;Thomas 108&lt;/ref&gt; Rutherford opposed the Sifton government's decision to confiscate the Alberta and Great Waterways bond money and revoke its charter,&lt;ref name=&quot;Babcock 67&quot;/&gt; and in 1913 was one of only two Liberals to support a non-confidence motion against the government&lt;ref name=&quot;Babcock 70&quot;&gt;Babcock 70&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; (Cross had by this time joined the Sifton cabinet, which placated most members of the Cross-Rutherford faction).&lt;ref name=&quot;Babcock 69&quot;/&gt; In the [[Alberta general election, 1913|1913 election]], Rutherford was again nominated as the Liberal candidate in [[Edmonton South (provincial electoral district)|Edmonton South]] (Strathcona had been amalgamated into Edmonton in 1912),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=A1ARTA0002525 |publisher=The Canadian Encyclopedia |title=Edmonton |accessdate=2008-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite pledging opposition to the Sifton government and offering to campaign around the province for the Conservatives if they agreed not to run a candidate against him.&lt;ref name=&quot;Babcock 71&quot;&gt;Babcock 71&lt;/ref&gt; At the nomination meeting, he stated that he was &quot;not running as a Sifton candidate&quot; and was &quot;a good independent candidate&amp;nbsp;... and a good Liberal too&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Babcock 72&quot;&gt;Babcock 72&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his opposition to the government, the Conservatives declined his offer of support and nominated [[Herbert Crawford]] to run against him.&lt;ref name=&quot;Babcock 71&quot;/&gt; After a vigorous campaign, Crawford defeated Rutherford by fewer than 250 votes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Babcock 72&quot;/&gt; Cross lobbied Prime Minister Laurier unsuccessfully for Rutherford to be appointed to the [[Senate of Canada|Senate]], though he was made [[King's Counsel]] shortly after his electoral defeat.&lt;ref name=&quot;Babcock 68&quot;&gt;Babcock 68&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1913 election was not the first time Rutherford had dissented from his own party during an election, nor would it be the last. Before the [[Canadian federal election, 1911|1911 federal election]], several local Liberals opposed to Frank Oliver had asked Rutherford to run against him in [[Strathcona (electoral district)|Strathcona]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Babcock 69&quot;/&gt; Relations between Oliver and Rutherford had always been chilly—Oliver was implacably opposed to Cross, who he viewed as a rival for dominance of the Liberal party in Alberta,&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 132&quot;&gt;Thomas 132&lt;/ref&gt; and his Edmonton Bulletin had taken the side of the dissidents during the railway scandal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Babcock 69&quot;/&gt; A nominating meeting unanimously nominated Rutherford as Liberal candidate, though Oliver refused to accept its legitimacy and awaited a later meeting.&lt;ref name=&quot;Babcock 69&quot;/&gt; Before this meeting came to pass, however, Rutherford abruptly withdrew.&lt;ref name=&quot;Babcock 69-70&quot;&gt;Babcock 69–70&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Douglas Babcock has suggested that this was due to the Conservatives' nomination of [[William Antrobus Griesbach]], dashing Rutherford's hopes that his popularity among Conservatives would preclude their opposing him.&lt;ref name=&quot;Babcock 70&quot;/&gt; Rumours at the time alleged that Rutherford had been asked to make a personal contribution of $15,000 to his campaign fund, and had balked.&lt;ref name=&quot;Babcock 69-70&quot;/&gt; Rutherford himself cited a desire to avoid [[vote splitting|splitting the vote]] on [[Reciprocity (Canadian politics)|reciprocity]], which he and Oliver both favoured but Griesbach opposed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Babcock 70&quot;/&gt; Whatever the reason, Oliver went on to be nominated as Liberal candidate and was re-elected.&lt;ref name=&quot;Babcock 70&quot;/&gt;

After his defeat in 1913, Rutherford was not active in politics until 1921. In [[Alberta general election, 1921|that year's provincial election]], he campaigned actively for the Conservatives, including for Crawford, the man who had defeated him eight years earlier.&lt;ref name=&quot;Babcock 73&quot;&gt;Babcock 73&lt;/ref&gt; Rutherford continued to call himself a Liberal, but criticized the incumbent administration for the growth of the provincial debt and for letting the party fall into disarray.&lt;ref name=&quot;Babcock 73&quot;/&gt; Calling the [[Charles Stewart (Canadian politician)|Charles Stewart]]-led government &quot;rotten&quot;, he offered voters the slogan &quot;get rid of the barnacles and the [[John R. Boyle|Boyle]]s&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Babcock 73&quot;/&gt; The Liberals were defeated, but the landslide win by the [[United Farmers of Alberta]] left the Conservatives with only one seat.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 204&quot;&gt;Thomas 204&lt;/ref&gt;

===Professional career===
Once out of politics, Rutherford returned to his law practice. His partnership with Jamieson saw partners come and go.&lt;ref name=&quot;Babcock 75&quot;/&gt; Rutherford divided his time between the original Strathcona office and the Edmonton office he opened in 1910; his practice focussed on [[contract]]s, [[real estate]], [[will (law)|wills]] and [[estate (law)|estates]], and [[incorporation (business)|incorporation]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Babcock 75&quot;&gt;Babcock 75&lt;/ref&gt; In 1923, Rutherford's son Cecil joined the firm along with Stanley Harwood McCuaig, who in 1919 would marry Rutherford's daughter Hazel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Babcock 88&quot;/&gt; In 1925, Jamieson left the partnership to establish his own firm.&lt;ref name=&quot;Babcock 88&quot;/&gt; In 1939, McCuaig did the same.&lt;ref name=&quot;Babcock 88&quot;/&gt; Cecil's partnership with his father continued until the latter's death.&lt;ref name=&quot;Babcock 89&quot;&gt;Babcock 89&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rutherford in law office.jpg|thumb|left|Rutherford in his law office, 1911]]Besides his work as a lawyer, Alexander Rutherford was involved in a number of business enterprises.&lt;ref name=&quot;Babcock 88&quot;/&gt; He was President of the Edmonton Mortgage Corporation, and Vice President and solicitor of the Great Western Garment Company.&lt;ref name=&quot;Babcock 88&quot;/&gt; This latter enterprise, which Rutherford co-founded, was a great success: established in 1911 with eight seamstresses, it had quadrupled in size within a year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Babcock 88&quot;/&gt; During the [[Second World War]], the Great Western Garment Company made military uniforms and was reputed to be the largest garment operation in the British Empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.albertasource.ca/homefront/feature_articles/gwg_factory.html |first=Catherine C. |last=Cole |title=Clothing the Armed Forces: The Great Western Garment Company during WWII |publisher=Alberta Online Encyclopedia |accessdate=2008-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was acquired by [[Levi Strauss &amp; Co.]] in 1961, but continued to manufacture garments in Edmonton until 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fenwick |first=Tara |year=2007 |month=March |title=Learning on the line: voices of garment workers at Great Western Garment |journal=Labour/Le Travail (Journal of Canadian Labour Studies) |volume=59 |pages=215–240 |url=http://www.lltjournal.ca/index.php/llt/article/view/5500/6364 |accessdate=2008-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rutherford also acted as director of the Canada National Fire Insurance Company, the Imperial Canadian Trust Company, the Great West Permanent Loan Company, and the Monarch Life Assurance Company.&lt;ref name=&quot;Babcock 88&quot;&gt;Babcock 88&lt;/ref&gt;

===University of Alberta===
Education was a personal priority of Rutherford's, as evidenced by his retention of the office of Education Minister for his entire time as Premier and by his enthusiastic work in founding the [[University of Alberta]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Roome 9&quot;&gt;Roome 9&lt;/ref&gt; In 1911 he was elected by Alberta's university graduates to the University of Alberta Senate, responsible for the institution's academic affairs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Babcock 69&quot;/&gt; In 1912 he established the Rutherford Gold Medal in English for the senior year honours English student with the highest standing;&lt;ref&gt;Babcock 78. This was not the first time that Rutherford had made such a donation: in 1903 and 1904 he donated $20 prizes to the top high school graduates in Strathcona.&lt;/ref&gt; the prize still exists today as the Rutherford Memorial Medal in English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.registrar.ualberta.ca/ro.cfm?id=531 |title=List of English nomination scholarships |publisher=University of Alberta |accessdate=2008-12-13}} Not to be confused with the [[Rutherford Memorial Medal]], an award bestowed by the [[Royal Society of Canada]] on an outstanding researcher in [[chemistry]] and named in honour of [[Ernest Rutherford]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1912, with the University's first graduating class, Rutherford instituted a tradition of inviting convocating students to his house for tea; this tradition would last for twenty-six years.&lt;ref&gt;Babcock 78–82&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chancellor Rutherford.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Rutherford in his Chancellor's robes]]Convocation was not the only reason that students visited Rutherford's home: he had a wealth of both knowledge and books on Canadian subjects, and welcomed students to consult his private library.&lt;ref name=&quot;Babcock 87&quot;&gt;Babcock 87&lt;/ref&gt; This library eventually expanded beyond the room in his mansion devoted to it, to encompass the house's den, maid's sitting room, and garage as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;Babcock 87&quot;/&gt; After his death, the collection was donated and sold to the University's library system; it was described in 1967 as &quot;still the most important rare collection in the library&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Babcock 87–88&lt;/ref&gt;

Rutherford remained on the university senate until 1927, when he was elected Chancellor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Babcock 82&quot;&gt;Babcock 82&lt;/ref&gt; The position was the titular head of the university, and its primary duty was presiding over convocations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Babcock 82&quot;/&gt; According to Rutherford biographer Douglas Babcock, this was the honour that Rutherford prized most.&lt;ref name=&quot;Babcock 82&quot;/&gt; He was acclaimed to the position every four years until his death.&lt;ref name=&quot;Babcock 82&quot;/&gt; It has been estimated that he awarded degrees to more than five thousand students.&lt;ref name=&quot;Babcock 82&quot;/&gt; His final convocation, however, was marred by controversy: in 1941, a committee of the university senate recommended awarding an [[honorary degree]] to Premier [[William Aberhart]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Babcock 90&quot;&gt;Babcock 90&lt;/ref&gt; Aberhart was pleased, and happily accepted University President [[William Alexander Robb Kerr]]'s invitation to deliver the commencement address at convocation.&lt;ref&gt;Elliot and Miller 299–300&lt;/ref&gt; However, a week prior to convocation the full senate—responsible for all university academic affairs—met, and voted against awarding Aberhart a degree.&lt;ref&gt;Babcock 90–91&lt;/ref&gt; Aberhart rescinded his acceptance of the Kerr's invitation (and later removed the senate's authority—except, ironically, the authority to award honorary degrees)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ualbertacentennial.ca/history/wwii/governance.html |title=Governance |publisher=University of Alberta |accessdate=2008-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Kerr resigned in protest.&lt;ref name=&quot;Babcock 91&quot;/&gt; Rutherford was mortified, but presided over convocation nonetheless.&lt;ref name=&quot;Babcock 91&quot;&gt;Babcock 91&lt;/ref&gt;

===Community involvement and family life===
Rutherford remained active in a wide range of community organizations well after his departure from politics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Babcock 89&quot;/&gt; He was a [[deacon]] in his church until well into his dotage, was a member of the [[World YWCA|Young Women's Christian Association]] advisory board from 1913 until his death, was Edmonton's first exalted ruler of the [[Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks]] and spent three years as the grand exalted ruler of the Elk Order of Canada.&lt;ref name=&quot;Babcock 89&quot;/&gt;  During [[World War I]] he was Alberta director of the National Service Commission, which oversaw [[conscription]] from 1916 until 1918, and in 1916 was appointed Honorary Colonel of the 194th Highland Battalion of the [[Canadian Expeditionary Force]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Babcock 89&quot;/&gt;  Rutherford served on the Loan Advisory Committee of the Soldier Settlement Board after the war, was President of the Alberta Historical Society (which had been created by his government) from 1919 until his death, was elected President of the McGill University Alumni Association of Alberta in 1922, and spent the last years of his life as honorary president of the Canadian Authors Association.&lt;ref name=&quot;Babcock 89&quot;/&gt; He was also a member of the Northern Alberta Pioneers and Old-Timers Association, the British Association for the Advancement of Science, the Royal Colonial Institute of London, and the [[freemasonry|Masons]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Babcock 89&quot;/&gt; He continued to [[curling|curl]] and played [[tennis]] into his late fifties, and took up [[golf]] at the age of sixty-four, becoming a charter member of the Mayfair Golf and Country Club.&lt;ref name=&quot;Babcock 90&quot;/&gt; He received honorary doctorates of laws from four universities: McGill, the University of Alberta, [[McMaster University]], and the [[University of Toronto]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Alberta's Rutherford&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Alberta's Rutherford |url=http://www.ualberta.ca/ALUMNI/history/peoplep-z/55fallruth.htm |first=Eugenie L. |last=Myles |publisher=University of Alberta |accessdate=2008-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Rutherford anniversary.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Rutherford and wife on their fiftieth wedding anniversary, December 19, 1938]]

In 1911, the Rutherfords built a new house adjacent to the University of Alberta campus.&lt;ref name=&quot;Babcock 97&quot;&gt;Babcock 97&lt;/ref&gt; Rutherford named it &quot;Archnacarry&quot;, after his [[Achnacarry, Scotland|ancestral homeland]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Roome 14&quot;&gt;Roome 14&lt;/ref&gt; It is now known as [[Rutherford House]], and serves as a museum.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roome 15&quot;&gt;Roome 15&lt;/ref&gt; He made several trips to the [[United Kingdom]], and was invited to attend the [[coronation]] of [[George VI of the United Kingdom|George VI]], but had to return to Canada before the event.&lt;ref name=&quot;Babcock 78&quot;&gt;Babcock 78&lt;/ref&gt; On December 19, 1938, the Rutherfords celebrated their fiftieth [[wedding anniversary]]; tributes and well-wishes arrived from across Canada.&lt;ref name=&quot;Babcock 90&quot;/&gt;

===Death and legacy===
Besides his [[bronchitis]], Rutherford developed [[diabetes]] in later years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Babcock 90&quot;/&gt; His wife monitored his sugar intake, though when they were apart Rutherford sometimes took less care than she would have liked him to.&lt;ref name=&quot;Babcock 90&quot;/&gt; In 1938, possibly as a result of diabetes, he suffered a [[stroke]] that left him paralyzed and mute.&lt;ref name=&quot;Babcock 90&quot;/&gt; He learned to walk again and with the help of a grade one reader got his speech back.&lt;ref name=&quot;Babcock 90&quot;/&gt; September 13, 1940, Mattie Rutherford died of cancer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Babcock 90&quot;/&gt; Less than a year later, June 11, 1941, Rutherford suffered a fatal [[heart attack]] while in hospital for [[insulin]] treatment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Babcock 90&quot;/&gt; He was 84 years old.&lt;ref name=&quot;Babcock 90&quot;/&gt; Alexander Rutherford was buried in Mount Pleasant Cemetery in Edmonton, alongside his family.&lt;ref name=&quot;Babcock 90&quot;/&gt;  His name was attached to many institutions both during his life and after: Rutherford Elementary School in Edmonton was established in 1911&lt;ref name=&quot;Babcock 69&quot;/&gt; and the University of Alberta's Rutherford Library in 1951.&lt;ref&gt;Roome 14–15&lt;/ref&gt; In 1954, a mountain in [[Jasper National Park]] was named [[Mount Rutherford]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Babcock 130&quot;&gt;Babcock 130&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1980, the government of Alberta created the Alexander Rutherford Scholarship, which awards more than $20 million annually to high school students selected on the basis of academic excellence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www2.canada.com/edmontonjournal/news/cityplus/story.html?id=92d46884-eec2-4701-b2df-3238509b1a2a |title=Requirements eased for Rutherford scholarships |work=Edmonton Journal |date=May 7, 2008 |accessdate=2009-03-05 |first=Clara |last=Ho}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rutherford House University of Alberta Edmonton Alberta Canada 03.jpg|thumb|right|[[Rutherford House]] as it exists today, as a museum]]Rutherford's policy legacy is mixed. L. G. Thomas concludes that he was a weak leader, unable to dominate the ambitions of his lieutenants and with very little skill at debate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roome 15&quot;/&gt; Despite this, he recognizes the Rutherford government's legacy of province building.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 64&quot;/&gt; Douglas Babcock suggests that Rutherford, while himself honourable, left himself at the mercy of unscrupulous men who ultimately ruined his political career.&lt;ref name=&quot;Babcock 65&quot;&gt;Babcock 65&lt;/ref&gt; Bennett, Rutherford's rival and later Prime Minister, concurred with this assessment, calling Rutherford &quot;a gentleman of the old school&amp;nbsp;... not equipped by experience or temperament for the rough and tumble of western politics&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Babcock 64&quot;&gt;Babcock 64&lt;/ref&gt; There is general agreement that Rutherford's greatest legacy, and the one in which he took the most pride, lies in his contributions to Alberta's education. As [[Mount Royal College]] historian Patricia Roome concluded her chapter on Rutherford in a book about Alberta's first twelve premiers, &quot;Rutherford's educational contribution remains his ultimate legacy to Albertans.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Roome 16&quot;&gt;Roome 16&lt;/ref&gt;
