'''James Terry Sanford''' (August 20, 1917 – April 18, 1998) was a United States politician and educator from [[North Carolina]]. A member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], Sanford was the [[List of Governors of North Carolina|65th]] [[Governor of North Carolina]] (1961–1965), a two-time [[President of the United States|U.S. Presidential candidate]] in the 1970s and a [[United States Senator|U.S. Senator]] (1986–1993). Sanford was a strong proponent of public education and introduced a number of reforms and new programs in North Carolina's schools and institutions of [[higher education]] as the state's governor, increasing funding for education and establishing the [[North Carolina Fund]]. From 1969 to 1985, Sanford was President of [[Duke University]].

An [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]] as a youth, Sanford became an [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] [[special agent|agent]] after graduating from the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] in 1939. During [[World War&amp;nbsp;II]], he saw combat in the [[European Theatre of World War II|European Theatre]] and received a [[battlefield commission]]. Following his return to civilian life after World War&amp;nbsp;II, Sanford attended and graduated from the [[University of North Carolina School of Law]] and began a legal career in the late 1940s, soon becoming involved in politics. A lifelong Democrat, he was noted for his progressive leadership in [[civil rights]] and education; although his opponents criticized him as a &quot;[[tax and spend|tax-and-spend]]&quot; [[liberalism|liberal]], Sanford is remembered as a major public figure of the South after World War&amp;nbsp;II.&lt;ref name=&quot;ClintonFoundation&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clintonfoundation.org/legacy/041898-presidential-statement-on-the-death-of-terry-sanford.htm|title=Presidential Statement on the Death of Terry Sanford|last=Clinton|first=Bill|date=1998-04-18|publisher=William J.

== Early life ==
Sanford was born in [[Laurinburg, North Carolina|Laurinburg]], [[North Carolina]], in 1917 to Cecil and Elizabeth Sanford, both of [[English American|English]] descent. He became an Eagle Scout in Laurinburg's [[Troop#Troops in civilian organizations|Troop 20]] of the [[Boy Scouts of America]] (BSA). Shortly before he died, Sanford related his [[Scouting]] experience to journalist [[David Gergen]] and said that it &quot;probably saved my life in the war. Boys who had been [[Boy Scout|Scouts]] or had been in the [[Civilian Conservation Corps|CCC]] knew how to look after themselves in the woods.&amp;nbsp;... What I learned in Scouts sustained me all my life; it helped me make decisions about what was best.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;honor&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Townley |first=Alvin |url=http://www.thomasdunnebooks.com/TD_TitleDetail.aspx?ISBN=0312366531|title=Legacy of Honor: The Values and Influence of America's Eagle Scouts |publisher=St. Martin's Press|location=New York |pages=30–31|isbn=0-312-36653-1 |accessdate=2006-12-29 |year=2007 |origyear= 2006-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BSA recognized him with their [[Distinguished Eagle Scout Award]].&lt;ref name=&quot;desalista&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.scouting.org/filestore/pdf/02-529.pdf |title = Distinguished Eagle Scouts |publisher = Scouting.org|accessdate = 2010-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sanford graduated from the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] in 1939 and then served as a [[special agent]] in the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] for two years.&lt;ref name=&quot;TooLiberal&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B02EFDB103CF93AA25757C0A96E958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all|title=Terry Sanford, Pace-Setting Governor in 60's, Dies at 80|last=Stout|first=David|date=1998-04-18|work=The New York Times|accessdate=2008-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;UNC TV&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unctv.org/biocon/tsanford/timeline.html|title=Biographical Conversations with Terry Sanford - Timeline|publisher=UNC TV|accessdate=2008-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; He married Margaret Rose Knight on July 4, 1942, and later had two children with her, Terry Jr. and Elizabeth.&lt;ref name=&quot;obit&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pubpol.duke.edu/about/Terry_Sanford/nando/sanfordat80.php|title=Terry Sanford dead at 80, April 19, 1998|last=Christensen|first=Rob|date=April 18, 1998|work=Terry Sanford Institute of Public Policy, Duke University|publisher=Raleigh News &amp; Observer|accessdate=2008-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; During [[World War&amp;nbsp;II]], he enlisted as a private in the [[United States Army|US Army]] and later attained the rank of [[First Lieutenant#United States|First Lieutenant]]. He [[Paratrooper|parachuted]] into France with the [[517th Parachute Infantry Regiment (United States)|517th Parachute Infantry Regiment]] and subsequently fought in the [[Battle of the Bulge]]. He was awarded the [[Bronze Star Medal|Bronze Star]] and [[Purple Heart]] for his bravery and wounds, respectively. Sanford was [[military discharge#Honorable|honorably discharged]] in 1946.&lt;ref name=&quot;UNC TV&quot;/&gt; Sanford later served as a [[company commander]] with the rank of [[Captain (U.S. Army)|captain]] in Company K of 119th Infantry Regiment of the [[North Carolina Army National Guard]] from 1948 to 1960.&lt;ref name=&quot;CovingtonEllis&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Covington|first=Howard E., Jr|coauthors=Ellis, Marion A.|title=Terry Sanford: Politics, Progress, and Outrageous Ambitions|publisher=Duke University Press|location=Durham, NC|year=1999|page=99|isbn=0-822-32356-7|url=http://books.google.com/?id=QN93ENX3_3sC&amp;pg=PA23&amp;lpg=PA23&amp;dq=terry+sanford+eagle|accessdate=2008-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the war, Sanford earned a [[law degree]] from the [[University of North Carolina School of Law]] and served as President of the Young Democratic Clubs of North Carolina, now known as the [[Young Democrats of North Carolina]].

== Gubernatorial career ==
Sanford was an assistant director of the Institute of Government of the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] from 1946 until 1948, then began a private practice of law in [[Fayetteville, North Carolina|Fayetteville]]. As a Democrat, Sanford served one term as a [[North Carolina Senate|state senator]] (1953–55), and chose not to run for a second term. He ran for governor of North Carolina in 1960, defeating [[I. Beverly Lake, Sr.]], [[Malcolm Buie Seawell]], and [[John D. Larkins]] in the Democratic primary, and Robert Gavin in the general election. Elected to a single term (as North Carolina governors could not at that time be elected for more than one term), Sanford served from January 1961 through January 1965.&lt;ref name=&quot;CongessBio&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=S000055|title=Sanford, (James) Terry, (1917 - 1998)|work=Biographical Directory of the United States Congress|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=2008-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Driven by his belief that a person could accomplish anything with a good education,&lt;ref name=&quot;CovingtonEllis&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|157, 194, 247, 257–258}}&lt;ref name=&quot;GovTerryTax&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,875678-1,00.html|title=State of Learning|date=1964-01-24|publisher=''Time Magazine''|accessdate=2008-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sanford nearly doubled North Carolina's expenditures on public schools. He began consolidating the [[University of North Carolina|University of North Carolina system]] to ensure its solvency and strength and oversaw the creation of the [[North Carolina Community College System]]. He conceived the idea for the [[Governor's School of North Carolina]],&lt;ref name=&quot;GovTerryTax&quot;/&gt; a publicly funded six-week residential summer program for gifted high school students in the state.&lt;ref name=&quot;GovSchool&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncgovschool.org/overview/|title=Governor's School of North Carolina|publisher=Governor's School of North Carolina|accessdate=2008-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; He established the North Carolina School of the Arts (now [[University of North Carolina School of the Arts]]) to keep talented students &quot;in the fields of music, drama, the dance and allied performing arts, at both the high school and college levels of instruction&quot; in their home state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.uncsa.edu/home/archives/history|title=Semans Library: UNCSA History|publisher=University of North Carolina School of the Arts|accessdate=2011-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; He fought for [[Race (classification of human beings)|racial]] [[desegregation]], and even sent his son to a desegregated [[Public school (government funded)|public school]] at a time when such a position was politically unpopular and possibly dangerous. He also established the [[North Carolina Fund]] under the leadership of [[George Esser]] to fight [[poverty]] and promote racial equality across the state.&lt;ref name=&quot;NCFundUNCLib&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lib.unc.edu/ncc/ref/nchistory/jul2005/index.html|title=July 1963 – The North Carolina Fund|year=1963|month=July|work=This Month in North Carolina History|publisher=UNC University Libraries|accessdate=2008-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Controversial tax increases were made to finance these educational programs. One such tax, on food, roused much opposition and was decried as regressive by many, including by some of the governor's most loyal supporters. The food tax, nicknamed &quot;Terry's Tax&quot;, and other taxes implemented by Sanford diminished his popularity and were heavily criticized by his political opponents.&lt;ref name=&quot;GovTerryTax&quot;/&gt;

Governor Sanford was a close political ally of [[President of the United States|President]] [[John F. Kennedy]], a fact that disturbed some North Carolina Democrats who were suspicious of Kennedy's Catholicism.&lt;ref name=&quot;JFKties&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsobserver.com/2004/08/15/73575/old-ties-bind-nc-to-mass.html|title=Old ties bind N.C. to Mass.|last=Christensen|first=Rob|year=2004|publisher=Raleigh News &amp; Observer|accessdate=2011-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to President Kennedy's personal secretary [[Evelyn Lincoln]], Sanford would have been Kennedy's choice for vice president on the [[U.S. presidential election, 1964|1964 Democratic ticket]], had Kennedy lived. In her 1968 book ''Kennedy and Johnson'' she reported that President Kennedy told her that [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] would be replaced as Vice President. Lincoln wrote of that November 19, 1963, conversation just three days before [[John F. Kennedy assassination|Kennedy's assassination]]:&lt;ref name=&quot;TooLiberal&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;LincolnBio&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Lincoln|first=Evelyn|authorlink=Evelyn Lincoln|title=Kennedy and Johnson|publisher=Holt, Rinehart and Winston |location=Austin, TX|year=1968|edition=1st|pages=204–205}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|As Mr. Kennedy sat in the rocker in my office, his head resting on its back he placed his left leg across his right knee. He rocked slightly as he talked. In a slow pensive voice he said to me, 'You know if I am re-elected in sixty-four, I am going to spend more and more time toward making government service an honorable career. I would like to tailor the executive and legislative branches of government so that they can keep up with the tremendous strides and progress being made in other fields&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;I am going to advocate changing some of the outmoded rules and regulations in the Congress, such as the seniority rule. To do this I will need as a running mate in sixty-four a man who believes as I do.'&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;I was fascinated by this conversation and wrote it down verbatim in my diary. Now I asked,&amp;nbsp;... 'Who is your choice as a running-mate?' He looked straight ahead, and without hesitating he replied, 'At this time I am thinking about Governor Terry Sanford of North Carolina. But it will not be Lyndon.'}}

Additionally, Sanford used his leverage with the White House to further expand the [[Research Triangle Park]] (RTP), which sparked an economic surge in the state, eventually luring [[IBM]] and the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] to the Triangle area.&lt;ref name=&quot;JFKties&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BassDeVries&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Bass|first=Jack|coauthors=De Vries, Walter|title=The Transformation of Southern Politics:Social Change and Political Consequence Since 1945|publisher=University of Georgia Press|location=Athens, GA|year=1976|page=230|isbn=0452004705|url=http://books.google.com/?id=FiRbQYoZtv0C&amp;pg=PA230&amp;lpg=PA230&amp;dq=%22terry+sanford%22+%22research+triangle+park%22+white+house|accessdate=2008-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ElonRTP&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://facstaff.elon.edu/festle/hst361/papers/rtp.doc|title=What was behind the main idea of behind &quot;research triangle park&quot;|last=McConville|first=Elizabeth |date=2005-12-02|publisher=Elon College|format=doc|accessdate=2008-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sanford was also a staunch opponent of [[Capital punishment in the United States|capital punishment]]. His &quot;numerous statements against capital punishment were so well known that prisoners on North Carolina’s death row pointedly referred to them in their clemency appeals.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Gottschalk, Marie (2011-03-16) [http://www.tnr.com/book/review/peculiar-institution-david-garland Is Death Different?], ''[[The New Republic]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

After his term in office ended, Sanford opened a law firm. He had agreed to serve as Lyndon Johnson's campaign manager in 1968 just before Johnson's withdrawal on March 31, but later took over as the campaign manager for the Democratic nominee [[Hubert Humphrey]] in his race against Republican [[Richard Nixon]] for the presidency.&lt;ref name=&quot;obit&quot;/&gt; President Johnson wanted Humphrey to pick Sanford as his running mate. On one occasion, the Humphrey campaign asked Sanford if he wanted to be the vice presidential candidate. Sanford declined and Humphrey ultimately picked Senator [[Edmund Muskie]] of Maine. Though Sanford received a number of legal and business offers from the private sector during this period, he was interested in a position that would allow him to keep his political prospects open.&lt;ref name=&quot;CovingtonEllis&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|367–385}}

== President of Duke University ==
[[Image:Sanfordpubpol.jpg|thumb|right|Terry Sanford Institute of Public Policy at Duke University]]
In 1969, Sanford became president of Duke University, a position he held for the next sixteen years.&lt;ref name=&quot;UNCmanu&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lib.unc.edu/mss/inv/s/Sanford,Terry.html#d0e104|title=Inventory of the Terry Sanford Papers, 1946–1993|work=Collection Number 3531|publisher=Manuscript Department, University Library, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|accessdate=2008-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; While involved in nearly every aspect of the university, Sanford primarily focused on fund-raising, athletics, and relations with university trustees.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} He also maintained a policy of accessibility to the students that helped defuse racial tensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsobserver.com/2006/10/14/87888/unity-concept-nothing-new-to-duke.html|title=Unity concept nothing new to Duke, N.C.

Addressing the protests with a mixture of tolerance and determination to maintain control of the campus, he met with students and successfully avoided the campus shutdowns that plagued many of the nation's other college campuses at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;CovingtonEllis&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|259}}

Perhaps the greatest controversy of Sanford's presidency was his effort to establish the [[Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum|presidential library]] of former U.S. President [[Richard Nixon]] at Duke. Sanford raised the subject with Nixon during a visit to the former president at Nixon's New York City office on July 28, 1981. Sanford continued to seek Nixon's advice on multiple issues within the months that followed. The library proposal became public in mid-August, creating considerable controversy at the university. Though Sanford enjoyed some support for his effort, most of the faculty were against the proposal, the largest concern being that the facility would be a monument to Nixon rather than a center of study. Sanford tried to engineer a compromise, but the proposal by the Duke Academic Council of a library only one-third the size of that which Nixon wanted and their rejection of a Nixon museum to accompany it, ultimately led Nixon to decline Sanford's offer and instead site his library in the city of his birth, [[Yorba Linda, California]], where it was dedicated in 1990.&lt;ref name=&quot;CovingtonEllis&quot;&gt;369–396, 417–432&lt;/ref&gt;

== Campaigns for the Democratic presidential nomination ==
Though Sanford enjoyed his time as Duke's president, he still harbored political ambitions. As the 1972 presidential primary season began, he was approached by several people who felt that the field of Democratic candidates was weak. He was particularly keen to challenge Alabama governor [[George Wallace]] in an effort to show that Wallace's segregationist views did not represent Southern opinion. Announcing his candidacy on March 8, he faced long odds in a crowded field. Knowing that he could not win a majority of delegates in the primary, he hoped to secure enough to emerge as a compromise candidate in a deadlocked convention. Even in the North Carolina primary, however, Wallace beat Sanford by 100,000 votes, and Sanford managed only a fifth-place finish at the [[1972 Democratic National Convention]] with 77.5 votes, behind [[George McGovern]] (1,864.95), [[Henry Jackson]] (525), Wallace (381.7), and [[Shirley Chisholm]] (151.95).&lt;ref name=&quot;1972convention&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,906135-7,00.html|title=Introducing... the McGovern Machine|date=1972-07-24|publisher=''Time Magazine''|accessdate=2008-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Holland|first=Keating|url=http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1996/conventions/san.diego/facts/weird.facts/votes.shtml.orig|title=All The Votes&amp;nbsp;... Really|year=1996|publisher=[[CNN.com]]|accessdate=2008-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Undeterred, Sanford began preparations two years later for a run for the 1976 Democratic presidential nomination.&lt;ref name=&quot;CovingtonEllis&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|396–400}} Announcing his candidacy on June 1, 1975, he juggled campaign appearances with his obligations as president of Duke. While he developed a following among educators, he did not have a satisfactory campaign theme by the new year. Then, while campaigning in Massachusetts in January, he suffered sharp pains and was diagnosed with a [[heart murmur]]. On January 25, Sanford withdrew from the primaries, the first Democrat to do so that year.&lt;ref name=&quot;CovingtonEllis&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|396–416}}

== Senate career ==
After retiring as president of Duke University in 1985, Sanford remained active in party politics. He made an unsuccessful run for chairman of the [[Democratic National Committee]] in 1985, in which he was supported by future House Speaker [[Nancy Pelosi]]. Sanford lost to [[Paul G. Kirk]] by a vote of 203–150.&lt;ref name=&quot;pelosi&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1985-02-02/news/mn-8979_1_democratic-national-committee|title=Democrats Elect Paul Kirk Chairman in Bitter Contest|last=Shogan|first=Robert|date=February 2, 1985 |work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=2009-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After failing to find a Democrat willing to run for the Senate seat being vacated by Republican [[John P. East]],&lt;ref name=&quot;CongessBioEast&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=E000017|title=East, John Porter, (1931 - 1986)|work=Biographical Directory of the United States Congress|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=2008-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sanford announced his own candidacy for the nomination. His opponent was [[United States House of Representatives|Congressman]] [[Jim Broyhill]]. After East committed suicide on June 29, 1986, Broyhill was temporarily appointed to the seat on July 3, until a special election could be held on November 4.&lt;ref name=&quot;CongessBioBroyhill&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=B000966|title=Broyhill, James Thomas, (1927 –)|work=Biographical Directory of the United States Congress|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=2008-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being attacked as a liberal, Sanford defeated Broyhill by three percentage points in the November election. Critics of Sanford primarily focused on three areas: his promotion of opportunities for minorities, &quot;tax-and-spend&quot; education funding, and his anti-poverty campaign.&lt;ref name=&quot;TooLiberal&quot;/&gt; He took office on November 5, the day after the special election, to serve out the last two months of East's term and the subsequent six-year term.&lt;ref name=&quot;CongessBio&quot;/&gt;

Sanford found his years in the Senate frustrating. He was concerned about the runaway deficit spending of the era, and he pursued economic development for Central America as an alternative to Republican-driven military policies. He led the Duke-based [[International Commission for Central American Recovery and Development]], a task force of scholars and leaders that published ''Poverty, Conflict, and Hope:  A Turning Point in Central America'' (also known as the Sanford Commission Report since he was &quot;the principal catalyst of the commission's work&quot;) in 1989 with the principles for promoting peace, democracy and equitable [[International development|development]] in [[Central America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Zuvekas |first=Clarence, Jr. |title=Alternative Perspectives on Central American Economic Recovery and Development |journal=Latin American Research Review|publisher=The Latin American Studies Association |location=Pittsburgh, PA |year=1992|volume=27|issue=1|page=128| issn = 0023-8791 |jstor=2503721 |pages=125–150}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sanford served on multiple Senate committees: [[United States Senate Select Committee on Ethics|Select Committee on Ethics]] (Chair); [[United States Senate Special Committee on Aging|Special Committee on Aging]]; [[United States Senate Committee on the Budget|Budget]]; [[United States Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs|Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs]] including the [[United States Senate Banking Subcommittee on Security and International Trade and Finance|Subcommittee on International Finance and Monetary Policy]] and [[United States Senate Banking Subcommittee on Securities, Insurance, and Investment|Subcommittee on Securities]]; and [[United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations|Foreign Relations]] including [[United States Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on Near Eastern and South and Central Asian Affairs|Subcommittee on Near Eastern and South Asian Affairs]] (Chair), [[United States Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on African Affairs|Subcommittee on African Affairs]], and [[United States Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on Western Hemisphere, Peace Corps and Narcotics Affairs|Subcommittee on Western Hemisphere and Peace Corps Affairs]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DukePapers&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.duke.edu/digitalcollections/rbmscl/sanford/inv/|title=Guide to the Terry Sanford Papers, 1926–1996|year=2007|publisher=Duke University Libraries|accessdate=2008-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had a liberal voting record in comparison to his Democratic colleagues from the South, and he campaigned successfully against the passage of a [[constitutional amendment]] prohibiting [[Flag Desecration Amendment|flag-burning]] with a counter-campaign promoting the [[United States Bill of Rights]]. Yet Sanford thought his accomplishments in the Senate paled against those he made as governor, and he seriously contemplated retiring and pursuing other projects before deciding to run for reelection.&lt;ref name=&quot;CovingtonEllis&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|447–480}}

Sanford's opponent in the 1992 election was [[Lauch Faircloth]], a former Democrat turned Republican who had served as state Highway Commissioner in Sanford's gubernatorial administration. Enjoying substantial backing from Sanford's Senate colleague, [[Jesse Helms]], Faircloth accused Sanford of being a tax-and-spend liberal bound to special interests. While initial polls showed that Sanford had a comfortable lead over his rival, he lost supporters after an operation for an infected [[heart valve]] kept him from campaigning for much of October and raised doubts as to whether he was capable of serving another term.

Sanford wrote several books, including: ''But What About the People?'', where he describes his efforts during the 1960s to establish a system of quality public education in North Carolina; ''Storm Over the States'', where he lays forth a new groundwork for state government and the federal system by recommending a &quot;creative federalism&quot;; and ''Outlive Your Enemies: Grow Old Gracefully'', where he describes actions that will slow the aging process and rules for prolonging healthy life.&lt;ref name=&quot;GenAssemb&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ftp.legislature.state.nc.us/EnactedLegislation/Resolutions/HTML/1999-2000/Res1999-4.html|title=A Joint Resolution Honoring The Life And Memory Of Terry Sanford, One Of North Carolina's Most Distinguished Citizens|date=1999-03-23|publisher=General Assembly of North Carolina|accessdate=2008-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also taught classes in law and political science at Duke University and campaigned for the construction of a major performing arts center in the [[Research Triangle]] area that would provide a permanent home for the [[American Dance Festival]], the [[North Carolina Symphony]] and the Carolina Ballet.&lt;ref name=&quot;RTPDuke&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pubpol.duke.edu/about/Terry_Sanford/|title=Terry Sanford: August 20, 1917 – April 18, 1998|work=Terry Sanford Institute of Public Policy|publisher=Duke University|accessdate=2008-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sanford announced in late December 1997 that he had been diagnosed with inoperable [[esophageal cancer]] and that his doctors said he had a few months to live. After his release from the hospital, his condition slowly deteriorated. He died in his sleep while surrounded by his family at his Durham home. He was 80&amp;nbsp;years old. At his funeral, he was eulogized by a childhood friend who said Sanford &quot;took [the Boy Scout] oath when he was twelve years old and kept it. It started out, 'On my honor, I will do my best to do my duty to God and my country,' and included such things as 'help other people at all times.' He believed it. He was the eternal Boy Scout.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;honor&quot; /&gt; Sanford is entombed in the crypt of [[Duke Chapel|Duke University Chapel]].&lt;ref name=&quot;obit&quot;/&gt;
