'''John LaRue Helm''' (July 4, 1802 – September 8, 1867) was the [[List of Governors of Kentucky|18th and 24th]] [[governor of Kentucky|governor]] of the U.S. state of [[Kentucky]], although his service in that office totaled less than fourteen months. He also represented [[Hardin County, Kentucky|Hardin County]] in both houses of the [[Kentucky General Assembly]] and was chosen to be the [[Speaker of the Kentucky House of Representatives]] four times. In 1838 his sole bid for federal office ended in defeat when his opponent, [[Willis Green]], was elected to the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]].

Helm was first elected to the [[Kentucky House of Representatives]] in 1826; between 1826 and 1843 he served eleven one-year terms in the state house. In 1844 he was elected to the [[Kentucky Senate|state senate]], where he served continuously until he was chosen as the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] nominee for [[Lieutenant Governor of Kentucky|lieutenant governor]] on a ticket with [[John J. Crittenden]], famous for the [[Crittenden Compromise]]. The Whigs won the general election and Helm was elevated to governor on July 31, 1850, when Crittenden resigned to accept an appointment as [[United States Attorney General]] in [[President of the United States|President]] [[Millard Fillmore]]'s cabinet. After his service as governor Helm became president of the struggling [[Louisville and Nashville Railroad]]. He invested thousands of dollars of his own money in the project and convinced residents along the line's main route to buy stock in the company. In 1859 the line was completed, but the next year Helm resigned over of differences with the board of directors regarding a proposed branch that would extend the line to [[Memphis, Tennessee]].

Although he openly opposed [[Secession in the United States|secession]] during the [[American Civil War]], federal military forces labeled Helm a [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] sympathizer. In September 1862, he was arrested for this alleged sympathy, but Governor [[James F. Robinson]] recognized him as he was being transported to a prison in [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]] and had him released. After the war Helm identified with the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], and in 1865 Hardin County voters returned him to the state senate. In 1867 he was the state's Democratic candidate for governor. Despite his failing health, Helm made a vigorous canvass of the state and won the general election. He was too weak to travel to [[Frankfort, Kentucky|Frankfort]] for his inauguration, so state officials administered the oath of office at his home on September 3, 1867. He died five days later.

==Early life==
In 1780 Helm's grandfather, Thomas Helm, emigrated to Kentucky from [[Prince William County, Virginia]] and founded the settlement of Helm Station near [[Elizabethtown, Kentucky]] in Hardin County, where John L. Helm was born on July 4, 1802.&lt;ref name=powell46&gt;Powell, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=allen107&gt;Allen, p. 107&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nga&gt;NGA Bio&lt;/ref&gt; He was the eldest of nine children born to George B. Helm, a farmer and politician, and Rebecca LaRue Helm, a descendant of a prominent local pioneer family.&lt;ref name=allen107 /&gt;&lt;ref name=owen68&gt;Owen, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt;

Helm attended the area's public schools and studied with noted educator [[Duff Green]].&lt;ref&gt;''Biographical Sketch'', pp. 16–17&lt;/ref&gt; When Helm was 14 his father fell on hard financial times and Helm returned to work on the family farm.&lt;ref name=biosketch18&gt;''Biographical Sketch'', p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; In 1818 he took a better-paying job in the office of Samuel Haycraft, the [[circuit court]] clerk of Hardin County.&lt;ref name=biosketch18 /&gt; While there he [[reading law|read law]] with Haycraft, then entered the law office of Ben Tobin in 1821.&lt;ref name=powell46 /&gt; 

At about this time Helm's father traveled to Texas to enter into business and rebuild his finances, but he died there in 1822,&lt;ref&gt;''Biographical Sketch'', pp. 15–16&lt;/ref&gt; leaving Helm responsible for his mother and siblings.&lt;ref name=allen108&gt;Allen, p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; He was admitted to the [[bar (law)|bar]] in 1823, the same year [[Meade County, Kentucky]] was formed.&lt;ref name=nga /&gt;&lt;ref name=johnson929&gt;Johnson, p. 929&lt;/ref&gt; There were no lawyers in the county yet, so although Helm continued living in Hardin County he was made Meade's [[county attorney]].&lt;ref name=allen108 /&gt; His practice grew rapidly and he was soon able to pay off his father's debts and purchase the Helm homestead.&lt;ref name=powell46 /&gt; Between 1832 and 1840 he built  &quot;Helm Place&quot; on this land and it remained his home for the rest of his life.&lt;ref name=powell46 /&gt;&lt;ref name=coleman51&gt;Coleman, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1823 Helm called on [[United States House of Representatives|Representative]] [[Benjamin Hardin]].&lt;ref name=alexander18&gt;Alexander, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; While Hardin and Helm discussed business, Hardin's 14-year-old daughter, Lucinda, entered the room to show her father a map she had drawn.&lt;ref name=alexander18 /&gt; Helm later claimed it was [[love at first sight]], and began to pursue Lucinda's affections.&lt;ref name=alexander18 /&gt; They [[courtship|courted]] for seven years, married in 1830 and had six daughters and five sons together.&lt;ref name=owen68 /&gt;&lt;ref name=biosketch23 /&gt; One of his sons, [[Benjamin Hardin Helm]], was a [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] general in the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] and was killed at the [[Battle of Chickamauga]].&lt;ref name=powell46 /&gt;

==Political career==
[[File:John larue Helm.jpg|thumb|left|An engraving of Helm.]]
The major political issue in Kentucky during Helm's legal training was the [[Old Court-New Court controversy]]. Reeling from the  [[panic of 1819]], Kentuckians had demanded debt relief. In response, the [[Kentucky General Assembly]] passed an act that granted debtors a grace period of two years in repaying their debts unless their creditors would accept payment in the devalued notes of the Bank of the Commonwealth. The [[Kentucky Court of Appeals]] struck down the law, claiming it was in violation of the [[Contract Clause]] of the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]]. The angered legislature attempted to [[impeachment|impeach]] the justices on the Court of Appeals, but lacked the necessary [[two-thirds majority]]. Instead, they abolished the Court of Appeals and replaced it with a new court, which was stocked with more sympathetic justices by pro-relief governor [[John Adair]]. Both courts claimed to be Kentucky's court of last resort.&lt;ref&gt;''Biographical Sketch'', pp. 21–23&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout 1825 Helm made speeches and distributed pamphlets in Hardin and surrounding counties, espousing the Old Court position.&lt;ref name=biosketch23&gt;''Biographical Sketch'', p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; In 1826 he campaigned as a [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] for a seat in the [[Kentucky House of Representatives]].&lt;ref name=owen69&gt;Owen, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; Helm won the election, and at the age of twenty-four became one of the youngest members to serve in the Kentucky General Assembly.&lt;ref name=johnson929 /&gt; An Old Court majority was elected to [[bicameral legislature|both houses]] of the General Assembly in 1826, which then passed legislation abolishing the New Court.&lt;ref&gt;''Biographical Sketch'', pp. 23–24&lt;/ref&gt;

Helm was re-elected to the state House in 1827 and 1830, and was re-elected every year from 1833 to 1837.&lt;ref name=nga /&gt; He served as [[Speaker of the Kentucky House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] in 1835 and 1836.&lt;ref name=nga /&gt; In 1837 there was a three-way race for speaker between Helm, [[James Turner Morehead (Kentucky)|James Turner Morehead]] and [[Robert P. Letcher]].&lt;ref name=owen56&gt;Owen, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; After nine ballots Helm withdrew, and Letcher was elected speaker.&lt;ref name=owen56 /&gt; 

Helm made his only run for federal office in 1838 and was defeated by [[Willis Green]] for a seat in the [[United States House of Representatives]].&lt;ref name=powell46 /&gt; He returned to the Kentucky House in 1839 and was re-elected in 1842 and 1843, serving as Speaker of the House both years.&lt;ref name=nga /&gt; In 1843, the Kentucky General Assembly proposed to create a new county from part of Hardin County and name it Helm County in honor of John L. Helm.&lt;ref name=nrhp10&gt;NRHP nomination form, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the few dissenting votes on this question, Helm declined the honor and proposed instead that the county be called [[Larue County, Kentucky|Larue County]] after his mother's family, many of whom still lived in the proposed county. Helm's suggestion was unanimously adopted.&lt;ref name=nrhp10 /&gt;

===Lieutenant governor and governor===
[[File:John J Crittenden.jpg|thumb|right|John J. Crittenden, who Helm succeeded as governor on July 31, 1850, as painted by Ferdinand G. Walke in 1909]]
In 1844 Helm was elected to the [[Kentucky Senate]], where he served until 1848.&lt;ref name=nga /&gt; That year he was the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] candidate for [[Lieutenant Governor of Kentucky|lieutenant governor]] on a ticket with [[John J. Crittenden]].&lt;ref name=powell46 /&gt; Helm defeated [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[John Preston Martin]] in the general election.&lt;ref name=harrison422&gt;Harrison, p. 422&lt;/ref&gt; The major political question in the state during Helm's time as lieutenant governor was whether to adopt a new state constitution.&lt;ref name=nrhp10 /&gt; As a state senator in 1848, Helm had voted to allow the state's citizens to decide the matter in a referendum, but after seeing the document produced by the constitutional convention, he opposed its ratification.&lt;ref name=nrhp10 /&gt; In an address to the state senate in 1850 he declared, &quot;I was for reform, and not for revolution. I was for amending the Constitution, and not for obliterating every vital principle in contained.&quot;&lt;ref name=biosketch34&gt;''Biographical Sketch'', p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; He especially opposed creating an elective judiciary.&lt;ref name=green217&gt;Green, p. 217&lt;/ref&gt; His antagonism to the constitution put him at odds with his father-in-law, Benjamin Hardin.&lt;ref name=biosketch34 /&gt; The two did not reconcile until 1852, as Hardin lay on his deathbed.&lt;ref name=biosketch34 /&gt; The new constitution was adopted in 1850, and in June of that year Helm encouraged the people to accept it.&lt;ref name=nrhp11&gt;NRHP nomination form, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

Governor Crittenden resigned on July 31, 1850 to accept [[President of the United States|President]] [[Millard Fillmore]]'s appointment as [[United States Attorney General|attorney general]], and Helm ascended to the governorship.&lt;ref name=powell46 /&gt; As governor, Helm vetoed a legislative plan to cover deficits in the public school fund by drawing money from the state's [[sinking fund]], but the General Assembly overrode the veto.&lt;ref name=owen69 /&gt; He urged the legislature to fund a survey of the state's mineral reserves and a census of the state's agricultural and manufacturing resources.&lt;ref name=owen69 /&gt; He called for spending on [[internal improvements]] and for raising judges' salaries to attract more qualified jurists to the bench.&lt;ref name=owen69 /&gt;&lt;ref name=harrison422 /&gt; He also sought a ban on the carrying of concealed deadly weapons.&lt;ref name=owen69 /&gt; The legislature did not act on any of these proposed reforms.&lt;ref name=owen69 /&gt; The only part of Helm's agenda that did progress through the General Assembly was election reform.&lt;ref name=owen69 /&gt;

==President of the Louisville and Nashville Railroad==
Helm was a [[United States Electoral College|presidential elector]] for [[Winfield Scott]] in the [[United States presidential election, 1852|1852 presidential election]].&lt;ref name=powell46 /&gt; After this he took twelve years off from politics.&lt;ref name=powell46 /&gt; As early as 1836, Helm had advocated the construction of the [[Louisville and Nashville Railroad]].&lt;ref&gt;NRHP nomination form, pp. 11–12&lt;/ref&gt; On October 2, 1854, he became the railroad's second president.&lt;ref name=klein9&gt;Klein, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; The previous president had been forced out of that position after a disagreement with Louisville's board of [[Alderman|aldermen]], and construction of the line had almost been abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, pp. 8–9&lt;/ref&gt; 

Helm worked diligently to convince residents along the line's main route of the economic benefits it would bring.&lt;ref name=klein11&gt;Klein, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; He persuaded many of them to help clear and grade land for the line and accept company stock as payment, and succeeded in selling stock subscriptions to people in the same area.&lt;ref name=owen69 /&gt;&lt;ref name=klein11 /&gt; Rising labor costs and troubles transporting materials raised expenses far above the projected budget, and at one point Helm personally redeemed $20,000 (${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|20000|1856|r=-4}}|0}} as of {{CURRENTISOYEAR}}) of the company's bonds.&lt;ref name=klein12&gt;Klein, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, some observers accused Helm of mismanaging the company.&lt;ref name=klein12 /&gt; The company's fortunes improved in 1857 when the city of Louisville provided $300,000 (${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|300000|1857|r=-4}}|0}} as of {{CURRENTISOYEAR}}) in financial aid and the line was completed on October 18, 1859.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, pp. 12, 14&lt;/ref&gt; Due to Helm's influence, the railroad's charter required all trains traveling through Elizabethtown to stop there.&lt;ref name=nrhp12&gt;NRHP nomination form, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; 

By the time the line was finished there were public calls from inside and outside the company for Helm to resign, mostly because of his support for a proposed [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] branch of the railroad.&lt;ref&gt;Herr, pp. 23, 26&lt;/ref&gt; To complete the branch, the Louisville and Nashville would have to complete a line from [[Bowling Green, Kentucky|Bowling Green]] to [[Guthrie, Kentucky]].&lt;ref name=klein20&gt;Klein, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; There it would join a line owned by the Memphis and Ohio Railroad that began across the state line at [[Clarksville, Tennessee]] and extended to Memphis.&lt;ref name=klein20 /&gt; Supporters believed the branch would economically help both Louisville and Memphis and would lessen their dependence on trade along the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] and [[Ohio River|Ohio]] Rivers.&lt;ref name=klein18&gt;Klein, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents argued that the project was simply a ploy to whip up new support for the struggling railroad.&lt;ref name=klein18 /&gt; Helm endorsed the Memphis branch in his annual report in 1857.&lt;ref name=klein20 /&gt;  

On February 4, 1860, two members of the company's board of directors wrote a letter requesting Helm's resignation; they claimed they had voted for his re-election as president of the company with the understanding that he would resign when the main line between Louisville and Nashville was finished.&lt;ref name=herr26&gt;Herr, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; Helm maintained that he felt an obligation to the citizens of [[Logan County, Kentucky|Logan County]] – many of whom he had personally sold stock to – to remain president until the Memphis branch through their county was built.&lt;ref name=herr26 /&gt; The rift between Helm and the directors continued to widen, however. Helm resigned on February 21, 1860, and was replaced by [[James Guthrie (American politician)|James Guthrie]].&lt;ref name=herr26 /&gt; The Memphis branch was completed on September 24, 1860.&lt;ref name=klein22&gt;Klein, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

==Civil War and second term as governor==
[[File:John Larue Helm 2.jpg|thumb|right|Engraving of Helm in later life.]]
On January 8, 1861 Helm chaired a meeting in [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]] that advocated for Kentucky's neutrality in the Civil War.&lt;ref name=powell46 /&gt;&lt;ref name=johnson929 /&gt; Helm was an outspoken opponent of secession, but also denounced the election of [[Abraham Lincoln]] and his use of military force to subdue the southern states.&lt;ref name=johnson929 /&gt; Because Helm did not condemn his son, Benjamin, for joining the Confederate Army, federal authorities classified him as a southern sympathizer.&lt;ref name=biosketch73&gt;''Biographical Sketch'', p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; 

After learning of the arrest of former governor [[Charles S. Morehead]] by federal authorities, Helm fled to Bowling Green, fearing his own arrest. Through the intervention of [[Warner Underwood]] he was able to return home on the condition that he swear an oath of allegiance to the Constitution. Nevertheless, federal soldiers repeatedly entered his home, encouraging his slaves to abandon him, and consuming or destroying his crops. Because the state's courts were closed on account of the war, he was unable to earn a living by practicing law. In short order his once-substantial fortune was expended, and he resorted to borrowing money to support his family.&lt;ref&gt;''Biographical Sketch'', pp. 73–75&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1862 Helm and several other citizens from Hardin County were arrested by Colonel Knox. After several days of confinement in Elizabethtown the prisoners were conducted to Louisville. By chance, Kentucky governor [[James F. Robinson]] recognized Helm in the group and negotiated with General [[Jeremiah Boyle]] to get him released. Shortly after returning home Helm learned of Benjamin's death at the Battle of Chickamauga.&lt;ref&gt;''Biographical Sketch'', pp. 75–77&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war Helm identified with the Democratic Party, and he returned to the state senate in 1865.&lt;ref name=nga /&gt; During his tenure he chaired the Committee on Federal Relations and fought against punitive and restrictive laws against ex-Confederates.&lt;ref name=owen69 /&gt; On January 22, 1866 he presented to the state senate a protest against the actions of the [[United States Congress]] during the Civil War.&lt;ref name=biosketch79&gt;''Biographical Sketch'', p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; It denounced the [[Reconstruction Amendments]] on the grounds that they granted powers to the federal government that were reserved for the states, and that they were passed while many southern states were not represented in Congress.&lt;ref&gt;''Biographical Sketch'', pp. 79–80&lt;/ref&gt; He also decried the creation and operation of the [[Freedman's Bureau]].&lt;ref name=biosketch82&gt;''Biographical Sketch'', p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; On January 29, 1867, Helm introduced legislation to organize a meeting in Louisville to rally support for President [[Andrew Johnson]] and his efforts to restore the Union.&lt;ref name=biosketch84&gt;''Biographical Sketch'', p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;

The state Democratic Convention met on February 22, 1867 in [[Frankfort, Kentucky|Frankfort]] and chose Helm and [[John W. Stevenson]] as the party's candidates for governor and lieutenant governor, respectively.&lt;ref name=biosketch84 /&gt; Helm resigned his seat in the state senate to accept the nomination.&lt;ref name=harrison422 /&gt; Though his health was frail, he determined to canvass the entire state.&lt;ref name=biosketch86&gt;''Biographical Sketch'', p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; He continued his call for an end to Civil War bitterness and [[proscription]]s against those who had sided with the Confederacy.&lt;ref name=harrison422 /&gt; He won the general election over [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Sidney Barnes and a third party candidate, Judge William B. Kinkead.&lt;ref name=harrison422 /&gt; 

The strenuous campaign took a decisive toll on Helm's already weakened body. He was too weak to travel to Frankfort for his inauguration, so the oath of office was administered at his home on September 3, 1867.&lt;ref name=allen107 /&gt; Helm's [[Kentucky Secretary of State|secretary of state]] read the governor's inaugural address at the Hardin County Courthouse.&lt;ref name=owen69 /&gt; In it Helm repeated his intent to remove political disabilities from ex-Confederates.&lt;ref name=owen70&gt;Owen, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; He also charged that Congress was meddling in the affairs of the states.&lt;ref name=owen70 /&gt; Though he promised protections for blacks, he opposed the idea of black [[suffrage]].&lt;ref name=owen70 /&gt; 

Helm died on September 8, 1867, just five days after his inauguration.&lt;ref name=nga /&gt; He was buried in a family graveyard at Helm Place.&lt;ref name=nga /&gt; Helm Place was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] on November 9, 1976.&lt;ref name=nrhp1&gt;NRHP nomination form, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;
