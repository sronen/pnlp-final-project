'''William Henry Harrison''' (February 9, 1773{{spaced ndash}}April 4, 1841) was the [[List of Presidents of the United States|ninth]] [[President of the United States]] (1841), an [[Military history of the United States|American military officer]] and [[Politics of the United States|politician]], and the first president to die in office. He was 68 years, 23 days old when elected, the oldest president elected until [[Ronald Reagan]] in 1981, and last President to be born before the [[United States Declaration of Independence]]. Harrison died on his 32nd day in office{{efn|Harrison served as President for 30 days, 12 hours and 32 minutes, but this was spread over 32 different calendar days; part of a day upon inauguration, 30 full days, then part of the day on which he died.}} of complications from [[pneumonia]], serving the shortest tenure in United States presidential history. His death sparked a brief [[constitutional crisis]], but that crisis ultimately resolved many questions about [[United States presidential line of succession#Acting President and President|presidential succession]] left unanswered by the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] until passage of the [[Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|25th Amendment]].

Before election as president, Harrison served as the first [[Delegate (United States Congress)|territorial congressional delegate]] from the [[Northwest Territory]], [[Governor of Indiana Territory|governor]] of the [[Indiana Territory]] and later as a [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. representative]] and [[United States Senate|senator]] from [[Ohio]]. He originally gained national fame for leading U.S. forces against [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]] at the [[Battle of Tippecanoe]] in 1811,&lt;ref name=&quot;Buescher&quot; /&gt; where he earned the [[nickname]] &quot;Tippecanoe&quot; (or &quot;Old Tippecanoe&quot;). As a [[General officer|general]] in the subsequent [[War of 1812]], his most notable contribution was a victory at the [[Battle of the Thames]] in 1813, which brought an end to hostilities in his region.

After the war, Harrison moved to Ohio, where he was elected to the [[14th United States Congress|United States Congress]], and in 1824 he became a member of the [[United States Senate|Senate]]. There he served a truncated term before being appointed as [[Minister Plenipotentiary]] to [[Gran Colombia|Colombia]] in May 1828. In Colombia, he spoke with [[Simón Bolívar]] urging his nation to adopt American-style democracy, before returning to his farm in Ohio, where he lived in relative retirement until he was nominated for the presidency in 1836. Defeated, he retired again to his farm before being elected president in 1840, and died of [[pneumonia]] in April 1841, a month after taking office.

== Early life ==
=== Early life and education ===
William Henry Harrison was born February 9, 1773, the youngest of [[Benjamin Harrison V]] and Elizabeth (Bassett)'s seven children. They were [[Harrison family of Virginia|a prominent political family]] who lived on [[Berkeley Plantation]] in [[Charles City County, Virginia|Charles City County]], [[Virginia]].&lt;ref name= wh/&gt; He was the last president born as a British subject before [[American Independence]]. His father was a planter and a delegate to the [[Continental Congress]] (1774–1777) who signed the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]]. He was [[governor of Virginia]] between 1781 and 1784.{{sfn|Owens|2007|p=3}} William's older brother [[Carter Bassett Harrison]] was elected a representative of Virginia in the [[United States House of Representatives]].&lt;ref name=&quot;wh&quot; /&gt;

In 1787, at the age of 14, Harrison entered the [[Presbyterian]] [[Hampden-Sydney College]].&lt;ref name=&quot;miller-childhood&quot; /&gt; He attended the school until 1790, becoming well-versed in Latin and basic French. He was removed by his [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalian]] father, possibly because of a religious revival occurring at the school. He then briefly attended an academy in [[Southampton County, Virginia|Southampton County]]. He allegedly became involved with the antislavery [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]] and [[Methodism|Methodists]] at the school.

Angered, his pro-slavery father had him transfer to [[Philadelphia]], where he boarded with [[Robert Morris (financier)|Robert Morris]], probably because of medical training available there. Harrison entered the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in 1790, where he continued to study medicine under Dr. [[Benjamin Rush]].{{sfn|Owens|2007|p=14}} As Harrison explained to his biographer, he did not enjoy the subject. Shortly after he had arrived in Philadelphia in 1791, his father died, leaving him without funds for further schooling. Eighteen years old, he was left in the guardianship of Morris.{{sfn|Langguth|2007|p=160}}

=== Early military career ===
[[Henry Lee III|Governor Henry Lee]] of [[Virginia]], a friend of Harrison's father, learned of Harrison's impoverished situation after his father's death and persuaded him to join the army. Within 24&amp;nbsp;hours of meeting Lee, Harrison was commissioned as an [[Ensign (rank)|ensign]] in the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]], [[Legion of the United States|11th U.S. Regt. of Infantry]] at the age of 18. He was first assigned to [[Cincinnati, Ohio|Cincinnati]] in the [[Northwest Territory]] where the army was engaged in the ongoing [[Northwest Indian War]].{{sfn|Owens|2007|pp=14, 22}}

[[General (United States)|General]] [[Anthony Wayne|&quot;Mad Anthony&quot; Wayne]] took command of the western army in 1792 following a disastrous defeat by its previous commander, Arthur St. Clair. Harrison was promoted to lieutenant that summer because of his strict attention to discipline, and the following year he was promoted to serve as [[aide-de-camp]]. It was from Wayne that Harrison learned how to successfully command an army on the [[American frontier]]. Harrison participated in Wayne's decisive victory at the [[Battle of Fallen Timbers]] in 1794, which brought the [[Northwest Indian War]] to a successful close for the United States.{{sfn|Owens|2007|p=27}} After the war, Lieutenant Harrison was one of the signatories of the [[Treaty of Greenville]] in 1795, which opened much of present-day Ohio to settlement by European Americans.&lt;ref name=&quot;wh&quot; /&gt;{{sfn|Langguth|2007|p=160}}{{sfn|Owens|2007|pp=21, 27–29}}

After the death of his mother in 1793, Harrison inherited a portion of the family's estate, including about {{convert|3000|acre|km2}} of land and several slaves. Still in the army at the time, Harrison sold his land to his brother.{{sfn|Owens|2007|p=39}}

=== Marriage and family ===
In 1795 Harrison met [[Anna Harrison|Anna Symmes]], of [[North Bend, Ohio]]. She was the daughter of Judge [[John Cleves Symmes]], a prominent figure in the state, and former representative to the [[Congress of the Confederation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;wh&quot; /&gt; When Harrison asked the judge for permission to marry Anna, he was refused. Harrison waited until Symmes left on business, then he and Anna [[Elopement (marriage)|eloped]] and married on November 25, 1795.{{sfn|Owens|2007|pp=38–39}} Afterward, concerned about Harrison's ability to provide for Anna, Symmes sold the young couple {{convert|160|acre|ha}} of land in North Bend.{{sfn|Owens|2007|p=40}}

Together they had 10 children. Nine lived into adulthood and one died in infancy. Anna was frequently in poor health during the marriage, primarily due to her many pregnancies.{{sfn|Owens|2007|p=56}} Nevertheless, she outlived William by 23&amp;nbsp;years, dying at age 88 on February 25, 1864.

Harrison is also believed to have had six children with one of his female slaves, Dilsia. When he ran for president he did not want &quot;bastard slave children&quot; around, so he gave four of his children to his brother, who sold them to a Georgia planter. Through this family line, Harrison is the great-grandfather of famous black civil rights activist [[Walter Francis White]]. White was the president of the NAACP from 1931–1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Janken|first=Kenneth Robert|title=Walter White: Mr. NAACP|year=2006|publisher=UNC Press|location=Chapel Hill|pages=3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political career ==
Harrison resigned from the army in 1797 and began campaigning among his friends and family for a post in the Northwest Territorial government. With the aid of his close friend, [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Timothy Pickering]], he was recommended to replace the outgoing Secretary of the [[Northwest Territory]]. He was appointed to the position, during which time he [[Acting governor|acted as governor]] during the frequent absences of Governor [[Arthur St. Clair]].&lt;ref name=&quot;wh&quot; /&gt;{{sfn|Langguth|2007|p=160}}{{sfn|Owens|2007|p=41}}{{sfn|Green|2007|p=9}}

=== Member of Congress ===

Harrison had many friends in the elite eastern social circles, and quickly gained a reputation among them as a frontier leader.{{sfn|Owens|2007|p=41}} Harrison ran a successful horse-breeding enterprise that won him acclaim throughout the Northwest Territory.{{sfn|Owens|2007|p=43}} He championed for lower land prices, the northwesterners' primary concern at the time. The US Congress had legislated a territorial land policy that led to high land costs, a policy disliked by many of the territory's citizens. When Harrison ran for Congress, he campaigned on working to alter the situation to encourage migration to the territory.{{sfn|Owens|2007|pp=44–45}} In 1799, at age 26, Harrison defeated the son of Arthur St. Clair and was elected as the first [[Delegate (United States Congress)|delegate]] representing the Northwest Territory in the [[Sixth United States Congress]]. He served from March 4, 1799, to May 14, 1800.&lt;ref name=&quot;wh&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cb&quot; /&gt; As a delegate from a territory, not a state, he had no authority to vote on bills but was permitted to serve on a committee, submit legislation, and debate.{{sfn|Owens|2007|pp=45–46}}

As delegate, Harrison successfully promoted the passage of the [[Harrison Land Act]]. This made it easier for the average settler to buy land in the Northwest Territory by allowing land to be sold in small [[tract (land)|tracts]]. The availability of inexpensive land was an important factor in the rapid population growth of the Northwest Territory.{{sfn|Langguth|2007|p=161}} Harrison also served on the committee that decided how to divide the Northwest Territory. The committee recommended splitting the territory into two segments, creating the Ohio Territory and the [[Indiana Territory]]. The bill, {{USStat|2|58}}, passed and the two new territories were established in 1800.{{sfn|Owens|2007|pp=47–48}}

Without informing Harrison, [[President of the United States|President]] [[John Adams]] nominated him to become governor of the new territory, based on his ties to &quot;the west&quot; and seemingly neutral political stances. Harrison was confirmed by the Senate the following day.{{sfn|Owens|2007|p=50}} Caught unaware, Harrison accepted the position only after receiving assurances from the [[Democratic-Republican Party|Jeffersonians]] that he would not be removed from office after they gained power in the upcoming elections.{{sfn|Owens|2007|p=51}} He then resigned from Congress.{{sfn|Owens|2007|p=53}} The Indiana Territory consisted of the future states of [[Indiana]], [[Illinois]], [[Michigan]], [[Wisconsin]] and the eastern portion of [[Minnesota]].{{sfn|Owens|2007|pp=49, 50, 54}}

=== Governor ===
{{see also|History of slavery in Indiana|Indiana Territory}}
Harrison moved to [[Vincennes, Indiana|Vincennes]], the capital of the newly established [[Indiana Territory]], on January 10, 1801.{{sfn|Owens|2007|p=53}} While in Vincennes, Harrison built a plantation style home he named [[Grouseland]] for its many birds. It was one of the first brick structures in the territory. The home, which has been restored and has become a popular modern tourist attraction, served as the center of social and political life in the territory.{{sfn|Owens|2007|p=56}} He also built a second home near [[Corydon, Indiana|Corydon]], the second capital, at [[Harrison Spring|Harrison Valley]].{{sfn|Funk|1969|p=167}}

As governor, Harrison had wide ranging powers in the new territory, including the authority to appoint all territorial officials, and the territorial legislature, and to control the division of the territory into political districts. A primary responsibility was to obtain title to [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] lands. This would allow European-American settlement to expand and increase U.S. population to enable the region to gain statehood.&lt;ref name=&quot;wh&quot; /&gt; Harrison was eager to expand the territory for personal reasons as well, as his political fortunes were tied to Indiana's rise to statehood. In 1803 [[United States President|President]] [[Thomas Jefferson]] granted Harrison authority to negotiate and conclude treaties with the Indians.

Harrison supervised the development of 13 treaties, through which the territory bought more than {{convert|60000000|acre|km2}} of land from Native American leaders, including much of present-day southern [[Indiana]]. The 1804 Treaty of St. Louis with [[Quashquame]] led to the surrender by the [[Sauk]] and [[Meskwaki]] of much of western Illinois and parts of [[Missouri]]. This treaty and loss of lands were greatly resented by many of the Sauk, especially [[Black Hawk (chief)|Black Hawk]]. It was the primary reason the Sauk sided with Great Britain during the [[War of 1812]]. Harrison thought the [[Treaty of Grouseland]] in 1805 appeased some of the issues for Native Americans, but tensions remained high on the frontier.

The 1809 [[Treaty of Fort Wayne (1809)|Treaty of Fort Wayne]] raised new tensions. Harrison purchased from the [[Miami tribe]], who claimed ownership of the land, more than 2,500,000&amp;nbsp;acres (10,000&amp;nbsp;km²) of land inhabited by [[Shawnee]], [[Kickapoo people|Kickapoo]], [[Wea]], and [[Piankeshaw]] peoples. Harrison rushed the process by offering large subsidies to the tribes and their leaders so that he could have the treaty in place before President Jefferson left office and the administration changed.{{sfn|Funk|1969|p=167}}{{sfn|Owens|2007|pp=65–66, 79, 80, 92}} The tribes living on the lands were furious and sought to have the treaty overturned but were unsuccessful.

In 1803 Harrison lobbied Congress to repeal Article 6 of the [[Northwest Ordinance]], in order to permit [[slavery]] in the Indiana Territory. He claimed it was necessary to make the region more appealing to settlers and would make the territory economically viable.{{sfn|Owens|2007|pp=68–69}} Congress suspended the article for 10 years, during which time the territories covered by the ordinance were granted the right to decide for themselves whether to permit slavery. That year Harrison had the appointed territorial legislature authorize [[indenture|indenturing]].{{sfn|Owens|2007|pp=69–72}} He attempted to have slavery legalized outright, in both 1805 and 1807. This caused a significant stir in the territory. When in 1809 the legislature was popularly elected for the first time, Harrison found himself at odds with them as the [[Abolitionism|abolitionist]] party came to power. They immediately blocked his plans for slavery and repealed the indenturing laws he had passed in 1803.{{sfn|Gresham|1919|p=21}}{{sfn|Owens|2007|pp=179–180}}

President [[Thomas Jefferson]], the primary author of the [[Northwest Ordinance]], had made a secret compact with [[James Lemen]] to defeat the pro-slavery movement led by Harrison. Although a slaveholder, he did not want slavery to expand into the Northwest Territory, as he believed the institution should end. Under the &quot;Jefferson-Lemen compact&quot;, Jefferson donated money to Lemen to found churches in Illinois and Indiana to stop the pro-slavery movement. In [[Indiana]] the founding of an anti-slavery church led to citizens' signing a petition and organizing politically to defeat Harrison's efforts to legalize slavery. Jefferson and Lemen were both instrumental in defeating Harrison's attempts in 1805 and 1807 to secure approval of slavery in the territory.&lt;ref name=&quot;Peck 1851&quot; /&gt;

== Army general ==
=== Tecumseh and Tippecanoe ===

{{main|Tecumseh's War|Battle of Tippecanoe}}

An Indian resistance movement against U.S. expansion had been growing through the leadership of the [[Shawnee]] brothers, [[Tecumseh]] and [[Tenskwatawa]] (The Prophet). The conflict became known as [[Tecumseh's War]]. Tenskwatawa convinced the native tribes that they would be protected by the [[Great Spirit]] and no harm could befall them if they would rise up against the white settlers. He encouraged resistance by telling the tribes to pay white traders only half of what they owed and to give up all the white man's ways, including their clothing, muskets, and especially whiskey, which was becoming known as evil for American Indians.{{sfn|Langguth|2007|pp=158–160}}

In August 1810, Tecumseh led 400 armed warriors down the [[Wabash River]] to meet with Harrison in Vincennes. As the warriors were dressed in war paint, their sudden appearance at first frightened the soldiers at Vincennes. The leaders of the group were escorted to Grouseland where they met Harrison. Tecumseh insisted that the Fort Wayne Treaty was illegitimate. He argued that no one tribe could sell land without the approval of the other tribes; he asked Harrison to nullify it and warned that Americans should not attempt to settle the lands sold in the treaty. Tecumseh informed Harrison that he had threatened to kill the chiefs who signed the treaty if they carried out its terms, and that his confederation of tribes was growing rapidly.{{sfn|Langguth|2007|p=164}} Harrison said the Miami were the owners of the land and could sell it if they so chose. He rejected Tecumseh's claim that all the Indians formed one nation. He said each tribe could have separate relations with the United States if they chose to. Harrison argued that the Great Spirit would have made all the tribes speak one language if they were to be one nation.{{sfn|Langguth|2007|p=165}}

Tecumseh launched an &quot;impassioned rebuttal,&quot; but Harrison was unable to understand his language.{{sfn|Langguth|2007|p=165}} A Shawnee friendly to Harrison cocked his pistol from the sidelines to alert Harrison that Tecumseh's speech was leading to trouble. Some witnesses reported that Tecumseh was encouraging the warriors to kill Harrison. Many of the warriors began to pull their weapons and Harrison pulled his sword. Since the entire town's population was only 1,000, Tecumseh's warriors could have defeated the entire town. Once the few officers pulled their guns to defend Harrison, the warriors backed down.{{sfn|Langguth|2007|p=165}} [[Winamac|Chief Winnemac]], who was friendly to Harrison, countered Tecumseh's arguments and told the warriors that since they had come in peace, they should return home in peace. Before leaving, Tecumseh informed Harrison that unless the treaty was nullified, he would seek an alliance with the British.{{sfn|Langguth|2007|p=166}} After the meeting, Tecumseh journeyed to meet with many of the tribes in the region, hoping to create a [[Tecumseh's Confederacy|confederation]] to battle the United States.{{sfn|Langguth|2007|pp=164–169}}

[[File:Tecumseh02.jpg|thumb|upright|A depiction of Tecumseh in 1848]]
In 1811, while Tecumseh was traveling, Harrison was authorized by [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[William Eustis]] to march against the nascent confederation as a show of force. Harrison led an army of more than 1,000 men north to try to intimidate the Shawnee into making peace. Instead, the tribes launched a surprise attack on Harrison's army early on the morning of November 6, in what became known as the [[Battle of Tippecanoe]]. Harrison defeated the tribal forces at [[Prophetstown State Park|Prophetstown]], next to the [[Wabash River|Wabash]] and [[Tippecanoe River]]s. Harrison was hailed as a national hero and the battle became famous. His troops had greatly outnumbered the attackers, and suffered many more casualties during the battle.{{sfn|Langguth|2007|pp=167–169}}

When reporting to Secretary Eustis, Harrison informed him the battle occurred near the Tippecanoe River (which led to its naming), and he feared an imminent reprisal attack. The first dispatch did not make clear which side had won the conflict, and the secretary at first interpreted it as a defeat. The follow-up dispatch made the US victory clear. When no second attack came, the defeat of the Shawnee was more certain. Eustis demanded to know why Harrison had not taken adequate precautions in fortifying his camp against attacks. Harrison countered by saying he had considered the position strong enough. The dispute was the catalyst of a disagreement between Harrison and the [[United States Department of War|Department of War]] that continued into the War of 1812.{{sfn|Owens|2007|pp=219–220}}

The press did not cover the battle at first, and one Ohio paper misinterpreted Harrison's dispatch to Eustis to mean he was defeated.{{sfn|Owens|2007|p=220}} By December, as most major American papers carried stories on the battle, public outrage over the Shawnee attack grew. At a time of high tensions with Great Britain, many Americans blamed the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] for inciting the tribes to violence and supplying them with firearms. In response, Congress passed resolutions condemning the British for interfering in American domestic affairs. A few months later, the U.S. declared war against Great Britain.{{sfn|Owens|2007|pp=221, 223}}

=== War of 1812 ===
[[File:William H. Harrison.jpg|thumb|upright|This [[portrait]] of Harrison originally showed him in [[civilian]] clothes as the [[Sixth United States Congress|congressional delegate]] from the [[Northwest Territory]] in 1800, but the uniform was added after he became famous in the War of 1812.]]

The outbreak of [[War of 1812|war with the British in 1812]] led to continued conflict with Native Americans in the Old Northwest, and Harrison was kept in command of the army in Indiana. After the loss of [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]], General [[James Winchester]] became the commander of the [[Army of the Northwest (United States)|Army of the Northwest]]. He offered Harrison the rank of [[brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]], which he refused, as he wanted sole command of the army. [[President of the United States|President]] [[James Madison]] removed Winchester and made Harrison the commander on September 17, 1812. Harrison inherited an army of fresh recruits, which he endeavored to drill. Initially he was greatly outnumbered by the British with their Indian allies. In the winter of 1812–13, Harrison constructed a defensive position at the rapids on the [[Maumee River]] in northwest Ohio. He named it [[Fort Meigs]] in honor of the Ohio governor, [[Return J. Meigs, Jr.]]

After receiving reinforcements in 1813, Harrison took the offensive. He led the army north to battle the Shawnee and their new [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] allies. He won victories in [[Indiana]] and [[Ohio]] and recaptured [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]], before invading Canada. He defeated the British at the [[Battle of the Thames]], in which Tecumseh was killed.{{sfn|Langguth|2007|pp=268–270}}

Secretary of War [[John Armstrong, Jr.|John Armstrong]] divided the command of the army, assigning Harrison to a &quot;backwater&quot; post and giving control of the front to one of Harrison's subordinates. Armstrong and Harrison had disagreed over the lack of coordination and effectiveness in the invasion of Canada. When Harrison was reassigned, he promptly resigned from the army. His resignation was accepted in the summer of 1814.{{sfn|Langguth|2007|pp=291–292}}

After the war ended, Congress investigated Harrison's resignation. It determined that he had been mistreated by the Secretary of War during his campaign and that his resignation was justified. They awarded Harrison a gold medal for his services during the War of 1812. The Battle of the Thames was considered one of the great American victories in the war, second only to the [[Battle of New Orleans]].{{sfn|Langguth|2007|pp=268–270}}{{sfn|Langguth|2007|pp=291–292}}

== Postwar life ==
=== Public office ===
After the war, Harrison was appointed by President [[James Madison]] to serve as a commissioner to negotiate two treaties with the Indian tribes in the Northwest. Both treaties were advantageous to the United States as the tribes ceded a large tract of land in the west. It provided more land for European-American purchase and settlement.&lt;ref name=&quot;cb&quot; /&gt;

Harrison was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives to finish the term of [[John McLean]] of Ohio, serving from October 8, 1816, to March 4, 1819. He was elected to and served in the [[Ohio State Senate]] from 1819 to 1821, having lost the election for [[governor of Ohio|Ohio governor]] in 1820. In 1822 he ran for the U.S. House but lost by only 500 votes to [[James W. Gazlay]]. In 1824 he was elected again to the U.S. Senate, where he served until May 20, 1828. Fellow westerners in Congress called Harrison a &quot;Buckeye&quot;, a term of affection related to the native [[Aesculus glabra|Ohio Buckeye]] tree.&lt;ref name=&quot;cb&quot; /&gt; Ohio [[Presidential elector]] in 1820 for [[James Monroe]].{{sfn|Taylor|Taylor|1899|p=102}} Ohio [[Presidential elector]] in 1824 for [[Henry Clay]].{{sfn|Taylor|Taylor|1899|p=145}}

Appointed as [[minister plenipotentiary]] to [[Gran Colombia]], Harrison resigned from Congress and served in his new post until March 8, 1829.&lt;ref name=&quot;cb&quot; /&gt; He arrived in [[Bogotá]] on December 22, 1828. He found the condition of Colombia saddening. Harrison reported to the Secretary of State that the country was on the edge of anarchy and he thought [[Simón Bolívar]] was about to become a [[military dictator]]. While minister in Colombia, Harrison wrote a rebuke to Bolívar, stating &quot;...&amp;nbsp;the strongest of all governments is that which is most free.&quot; He called on Bolívar to encourage the development of a democracy. In response, Bolívar wrote, &quot;The United States ... seem destined by Providence to plague America with torments in the name of freedom&quot;, a sentiment that achieved fame in Latin America.{{sfn|Bolívar|1951|p=732}} When the new administration of President [[Andrew Jackson]] took office in March 1829, Harrison was recalled so they could make their own appointment to the position. He returned to the United States in June.{{sfn|Hall|1836|pp=301–309}}

After Harrison returned to the United States in 1829, he settled on his farm in [[North Bend, Ohio]], his adopted home state. There, he lived in relative retirement after nearly 40&amp;nbsp;years of continuous government service. Having accumulated no substantial wealth during his lifetime, he subsisted on his savings, a small pension, and the income produced by his farm. Harrison cultivated corn and established a [[distillation|distillery]] to produce [[whiskey]]. After a brief time in the liquor business, he became disturbed by the effects of alcohol on its consumers, and closed the distillery. In a later address to the [[Hamilton County, Ohio|Hamilton County]] Agricultural Board in 1831, Harrison said he had sinned in making whiskey, and hoped that others would learn from his mistake and stop the production of liquors.{{sfn|Burr|1840|p=258}}

In these early years, Harrison also earned money from his contributions to a biography written by James Hall, entitled ''A Memoir of the Public Services of William Henry Harrison'', published in 1836. That year he made an unsuccessful run for the presidency as a [[United States Whig Party|Whig]] candidate.{{sfn|Burr|1840|p=258}} Between 1836 and 1840, Harrison served as [[Clerk of Courts]] for [[Hamilton County, Ohio|Hamilton County]]. This was his job when he was elected president in 1840.&lt;ref name=&quot;courtclerk&quot; /&gt; By 1840, when Harrison campaigned for president a second time, more than 12 books had been published on his life. In many, he was hailed as a national hero.{{sfn|Burr|1840|p=257}}

=== 1836 presidential campaign ===
{{main|United States presidential election, 1836}}
[[File:WmHHarrison-campaign poster.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Chromolithography|Chromolithograph]] campaign poster for William Henry Harrison]]
Harrison was the Northern Whig candidate for president in 1836, the only time in American history when a major political party intentionally ran more than one presidential candidate. [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Martin Van Buren]], the Democratic Candidate, was popular and deemed likely to win the election against an individual Whig candidate. The Whig plan was to elect popular Whigs regionally, deny Van Buren the 148 electoral votes needed for election, and force the House of Representatives to decide the election. They hoped the Whigs would control the House after the general elections. (This strategy would have failed as the Democrats retained a majority in the House following the election.)&lt;ref name=&quot;1836cong&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;shp&quot; /&gt;

Harrison ran in all the free states except Massachusetts, and the slave states of Delaware, Maryland, and Kentucky. [[Hugh L. White]] ran in the remaining slave states except for South Carolina. [[Daniel Webster]] ran in Massachusetts, and [[Willie P. Mangum]] in South Carolina.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lorant 1953&quot; /&gt; The plan narrowly failed as Van Buren won the election with 170 electoral votes. A swing of just over 4,000 votes in Pennsylvania would have given that state's 30 electoral votes to Harrison, and the election would have been decided in the House of Representatives.&lt;ref name=&quot;1836cong&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;shp&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Historical Election Results 1836&quot; /&gt;

=== 1840 presidential campaign ===
{{main|United States presidential election, 1840}}
[[File:WmHHarrison-poster.jpg|thumb|left|210px|upright|Poster of Harrison's accomplishments]]
Harrison was the Whig candidate (and again faced Van Buren, now the incumbent president) in the [[U.S. presidential election, 1840|1840 election]]. The Whig party unified behind a single candidate, and Harrison was chosen over more controversial members of the party, such as Clay and Webster. Harrison based his campaign on his heroic military record and on the weak U.S. economy, caused by the [[Panic of 1837]]. In a ploy to blame Van Buren for the depressed economy, the Whigs nicknamed him &quot;Van Ruin&quot;.{{sfn|Carnes|Mieczkowski|2001|p=39}}

[[File:PresidentialCounty1840.gif|thumb|400px|Results by county explicitly indicating the percentage of the winning candidate in each county. Shades of yellow are for Harrison (Whig) and shades of blue are for Van Buren (Democrat).]]
The Democrats ridiculed Harrison by calling him &quot;Granny Harrison, the petticoat general,&quot; because he resigned from the army before the [[War of 1812]] ended. When asking voters whether Harrison should be elected, they asked them what his name backwards was, which happens to be &quot;No Sirrah.&quot; Democrats cast Harrison as a provincial, out-of-touch old man who would rather &quot;[[log cabin campaign|sit in his log cabin drinking hard cider]]&quot; than attend to the administration of the country. This strategy backfired by Harrison and his vice presidential running-mate, [[John Tyler]]'s adopting the log cabin and hard cider as campaign symbols. They used the images in banners and posters, and created bottles of hard cider that were shaped like log cabins, all to connect to the &quot;common man&quot;.{{sfn|Carnes|Mieczkowski|2001|pp=39–40}}

Although Harrison had come from a wealthy, slaveholding Virginia family, in this campaign he was promoted as a humble frontiersman in the style of the popular [[Andrew Jackson]]. A memorable example was the [[Gold Spoon Oration]], delivered by a Whig representative. Van Buren, by contrast, was presented as a wealthy elitist.{{sfn|Carnes|Mieczkowski|2001|p=40}}

A Whig chant from the time of the election exhibited the difference between candidates:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''Old Tip he wore a homespun coat, he had no ruffled shirt: wirt-wirt,'' &lt;br /&gt;
''But Matt he has the golden plate, and he's a little squirt: wirt-wirt!''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

People singing the chant would spit tobacco juice while singing &quot;wirt-wirt&quot;.{{sfn|Carnes|Mieczkowski|2001|p=41}}

The Whigs boasted of Harrison's military record and reputation as the hero of the Battle of Tippecanoe. Their campaign slogan, &quot;[[Tippecanoe and Tyler too]]&quot;, became among the most famous in American politics.{{sfn|Carnes|Mieczkowski|2001|p=41}} On election day, Harrison won a [[landslide victory#United States|landslide electoral college victory]], though the popular vote was much closer, at 53% to 47%.{{sfn|Carnes|Mieczkowski|2001|p=41}}

=== Shortest presidency ===
[[File:Bass Otis (American, 1784-1861) - Portrait of William Henry Harrison.jpg|thumb|upright|William Henry Harrison ([[Bass Otis]], 1841)]]
When Harrison came to Washington, he wanted to show that he was still the steadfast hero of [[Battle of Tippecanoe|Tippecanoe]]. He [[Inauguration of William Henry Harrison|took the oath of office]] on March 4, 1841, a cold and wet day. He wore neither an overcoat nor hat, and delivered the longest [[inaugural address]] in American history. It took him nearly two hours to read, although his friend and fellow Whig [[Daniel Webster]] had edited it for length. Harrison rode through the streets in the inaugural parade.&lt;ref name=&quot;loc&quot; /&gt;

The inaugural address was a detailed statement of the Whig agenda, essentially a repudiation of [[Andrew Jackson|Jackson]] and [[Martin Van Buren|Van Buren's]] policies. Harrison promised to reestablish the [[Second Bank of the United States|Bank of the United States]] and extend its capacity for credit by issuing paper currency ([[Henry Clay]]'s [[American System (economic plan)|American System]]); to defer to the judgment of Congress on legislative matters, with sparing use of his veto power; and to reverse Jackson's [[spoils system]] of executive patronage. He promised to use patronage to create a qualified staff, not to enhance his own standing in government.&lt;ref name=&quot;standing&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;inagloc&quot; /&gt;

As leader of the Whigs and a powerful legislator (as well as a frustrated Presidential candidate in his own right), Clay expected to have substantial influence in the Harrison administration. He ignored his own platform plank of overturning the &quot;Spoils&quot; system. Clay attempted to influence Harrison's actions before and during his brief presidency, especially in putting forth his own preferences for Cabinet offices and other presidential appointments. Harrison rebuffed his aggression, saying &quot;Mr. Clay, you forget that ''I'' am the President.&quot;{{sfn|Borneman|2005|p=56}} The dispute intensified when Harrison named [[Daniel Webster]], Clay's arch-rival for control of the Whig Party, as his Secretary of State, and appeared to give Webster's supporters some highly coveted patronage positions. Harrison's sole concession to Clay was to name his protegé [[John J. Crittenden]] to the post of [[Attorney General]]. When Clay pressed Harrison on the appointments, the president told him not to visit the White House again, but to address him only in writing.&lt;ref name=&quot;voanews&quot; /&gt; Despite this, the dispute continued until the president's death.

Clay was not the only one who hoped to benefit from Harrison's election. Hordes of office applicants came to the [[White House]], which was then open to all comers who wanted a meeting with the President. Most of Harrison's business during his month-long presidency involved extensive social obligations—an inevitable part of his high position and arrival in Washington—and receiving visitors at the White House. They awaited him at all hours and filled the Executive Mansion.&lt;ref name=&quot;loc&quot; /&gt; As he had with Clay, Harrison resisted pressure from other Whigs over patronage. When a group arrived in his office on March 16 to demand the removal of all Democrats from any appointed office, Harrison proclaimed, &quot;So help me God, I will resign my office before I can be guilty of such an iniquity.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;May p60&quot; /&gt;{{citation not found|date=March 2012}}

Harrison's only official act of consequence was to call Congress into a special session. He and Henry Clay had disagreed over the necessity of such a session, and when on March 11 Harrison's cabinet proved evenly divided, the president vetoed the idea. A few days later, however, Treasury Secretary [[Thomas Ewing]] reported to Harrison that federal funds were in such trouble that the government could not continue to operate until Congress' regularly scheduled session in December; Harrison thus relented, and on March 17 proclaimed the special session in the interests of &quot;the condition of the revenue and finance of the country.&quot; The session was scheduled to begin on May 31.&lt;ref name=&quot;brinkley-dyer&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;proc&quot; /&gt;

[[File:Harrison tomb.JPG|thumb|upright|[[William Henry Harrison Tomb State Memorial|Harrison's tomb]] and memorial in [[North Bend, Ohio]]]]
On March 26, Harrison became ill with a [[common cold|cold]]. According to the prevailing medical misconception of that time, it was believed that his illness was directly caused by the bad weather at his inauguration; however, Harrison's illness did not arise until more than three weeks after the event.{{sfn|Cleaves|1939|p=152}}

The cold worsened, rapidly turning to [[pneumonia]] and [[pleurisy]].{{sfn|Cleaves|1939|p=152}} He sought to rest in the White House, but could not find a quiet room because of the steady crowd of office seekers. His extremely busy social schedule made any rest time scarce.&lt;ref name=&quot;loc&quot; /&gt;

Harrison's doctors tried cures, applying [[opium]], [[castor oil]], [[leeches]], and Virginia [[Rauwolfia serpentina|snakeweed]]. But the treatments only made Harrison worse, and he became delirious. He died nine days after becoming ill,{{sfn|Cleaves|1939|p=160}} at 12:30&amp;nbsp;am on April 4, 1841, of right lower lobe [[pneumonia]], [[jaundice]], and overwhelming [[septicemia]]. He was the first United States president to die in office. His last words were to his doctor, but assumed to be directed at John Tyler, &quot;Sir, I wish you to understand the true principles of the government. I wish them carried out. I ask nothing more.&quot; Harrison served the shortest term of any American president: March 4&amp;nbsp;– April 4, 1841, 30 days, 12 hours, and 30 minutes.&lt;ref name=&quot;dyingstmt&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Diamond 1976&quot; /&gt;

Harrison's funeral took place in the [[Wesley Chapel (Cincinnati)|Wesley Chapel]] in [[Cincinnati]], Ohio, on April 7, 1841.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whha.org/whha_shows/presidential_funerals/presidential_funerals.html Presidential Funerals]&lt;/ref&gt; His original interment was in the public vault of the [[Congressional Cemetery]] in Washington, D.C. He was later buried in [[North Bend, Ohio]]. The [[William Henry Harrison Tomb State Memorial]] was erected in his honor.&lt;ref name=&quot;ohiohistory tomb&quot; /&gt;

=== Impact of death ===
[[File:Cincinnati-harrison-statue.jpg|thumb|left|Statue of Harrison [[Equestrian statue|on horseback]] in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]]]]
The untimely death of Harrison was a disappointment to [[Whig Party (United States)|Whigs]], who hoped to pass a revenue tariff and enact measures to support [[Henry Clay|Henry Clay's]] [[American System (economic plan)|American System]]. [[John Tyler]], Harrison's successor and a former Democrat, abandoned the Whig agenda, effectively cutting himself off from the party.&lt;ref name=&quot;tyler&quot; /&gt;

Due to the death of Harrison, three presidents served within a single calendar year ([[Martin Van Buren]], Harrison, Tyler). This has happened on only one other occasion, in 1881, when [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] was succeeded by [[James A. Garfield]], who was assassinated later in that year. With the death of Garfield, [[Chester A. Arthur]] stepped into the presidency.&lt;ref name=&quot;americanhistory.about.com&quot; /&gt;

Harrison's death revealed the flaws in the constitution's clauses on presidential succession.&lt;ref name=&quot;art2&quot; /&gt; [[Article Two of the United States Constitution#Clause 6: Vacancy and disability|Article II of the Constitution]] states that &quot;In case of the removal of the President from office, or of his death, resignation, or inability to discharge the powers and duties of the said office, the same shall devolve on the Vice President, ... and [the Vice President] shall act accordingly, until the disability be removed, or a President shall be elected&quot;. Scholars at the time disagreed whether the vice president would become President or merely Acting President. Further, the Constitution did not stipulate whether the vice president could serve the remainder of the president's term, until the next election, or if emergency elections should be held.

Harrison's cabinet insisted that Tyler was &quot;Vice President acting as President.&quot; After the cabinet consulted with the [[Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[Roger Taney]] they decided that if Tyler took the presidential [[Oath of Office]] he would assume the office of President. Tyler obliged and was sworn in on April 6. In May, Congress convened. After a short period of debate in both houses, it passed a resolution that confirmed Tyler in the presidency for the remainder of Harrison's term. Once established, this precedent of presidential succession remained in effect until the [[Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-fifth Amendment]] was ratified in 1967.&lt;ref name=&quot;tyler&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;2admend&quot; /&gt; Following the assassination of John F. Kennedy and the succession of Lyndon B. Johnson to the presidency in 1963, the Twenty-fifth Amendment dealt with the finer points of succession. It defined in what situations the vice president was acting president, and in what situation the vice president could become president.

As the shortest-serving president, Harrison was the only one not to appoint a single federal judge at any level.{{sfn|Abraham|1999|p=35}} No states were admitted to the union during his term.&lt;ref name=&quot;StateOrder&quot; /&gt;

Harrison was the first sitting president to have his photograph taken. The original [[daguerreotype]], made in Washington on his Inauguration Day, has been lost—although at least one copy exists in the archives of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].&lt;ref name=&quot;metmuseum&quot; /&gt; His chief presidential legacy lies in his campaigning methods, which laid the foundation for the modern presidential campaign tactics.{{sfn|Green|2007|p=100}} Harrison died nearly penniless. Congress voted to give his wife a Presidential [[widow's pension]], a payment of $25,000,&lt;ref name=&quot;Damon 1974-06&quot; /&gt; one year of Harrison's salary.
