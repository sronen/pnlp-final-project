The '''Pixies''' are an American [[alternative rock]] band formed in [[Boston]], Massachusetts in 1986. The group consists of [[Black Francis ]] (vocals, rhythm guitar), [[Joey Santiago]] (lead guitar), [[Kim Deal]] (bass, vocals), and [[David Lovering]] (drums). The Pixies found only modest commercial success in their home country, but were significantly more successful in the United Kingdom and mainland Europe. The group disbanded in 1993 under acrimonious circumstances, but reunited in 2004.

The band's style of music contains a range of elements, including [[indie rock]] and [[surf music|surf rock]]. Black Francis is the Pixies' primary songwriter and singer. He has written about a number of offbeat subjects in the band's songs, such as extraterrestrials, surrealism, incest, and biblical violence.

The group is credited as being a big influence on the alternative rock boom of the 1990s. [[Kurt Cobain]] acknowledged the debt his band [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] owed the Pixies, and stated that &quot;[[Smells Like Teen Spirit]]&quot; was his attempt at trying to &quot;rip off the Pixies&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;theysaid&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://aleceiffel.free.fr/misc_said.html | title=They Said About the Pixies... | accessdate=2012-04-11 | author=Biel, Jean-Michel; Gourraud, Christophe}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pixies' legacy and popularity grew in the years following their break-up, leading to sold-out world tours following their reunion in 2004.

== History ==
=== Formation ===
Joey Santiago and Black Francis (born Charles Thompson IV) first met when they lived next to each other in a suite while attending the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]].&lt;ref name=&quot;SPIN Life Pixies&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|title=Life to the Pixies|author=Spitz, Marc|work=Spin|date=September 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Santiago was worried about distractions, he noticed Francis played music and the pair began to jam together.&lt;ref&gt;Frank, Josh; Ganz, Caryn. ''[[Fool the World: The Oral History of a Band Called Pixies]]''. (2006). ISBN 0-312-34007-9. p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Francis then embarked on a student exchange trip to [[Puerto Rico]] to study Spanish.&lt;ref name=&quot;SPIN Life Pixies&quot; /&gt; After six months, he returned to Amherst and dropped out of the university.&lt;ref&gt;Sisario, Ben. ''Doolittle 33⅓''. Continuum, 2005. ISBN 0-8264-1774-4. pp. 12–13&lt;/ref&gt; Francis and Santiago spent 1984 working in a warehouse, with Francis composing songs on his acoustic guitar and writing lyrics on the subway train.&lt;ref&gt;Frank, Ganz, 2005... p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

The pair formed a band in January 1986.&lt;ref name=&quot;allmusic-bio&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p5149/biography|pure_url=yes}} | title=Pixies: Biography | accessdate=September 10, 2006 | author=Erlewine, Stephen Thomas | work=Allmusic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bass player Kim Deal joined Santiago and Francis two weeks later after responding to a classified advertisement Francis had placed, seeking a female bass player who liked both [[folk music]] icons [[Peter, Paul and Mary]] and the band [[Hüsker Dü]].&lt;ref&gt;Frank, Ganz, 2005. pp. 13–14&lt;/ref&gt; Deal was the only person to respond, but arrived at the audition without a [[Bass guitar|bass]] as she had never played the instrument before.&lt;ref&gt;Frank, Ganz, 2005. p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sisario, 2006. p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; She later obtained one, and the trio started rehearsing in Deal's apartment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Frank, Ganz, 2005. p. 20&quot;&gt;Frank, Ganz, 2005. p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

After recruiting Deal, the band tried unsuccessfully to get her sister, [[Kelley Deal]], to join as its drummer.&lt;ref&gt;Frank, Ganz, 2005. p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; Kim's husband suggested they hire drummer David Lovering, whom Kim had met at her wedding reception.&lt;ref&gt;Frank, Ganz, 2005. p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sisario, 2006. pp. 8–9&lt;/ref&gt; The group arrived at a name after Santiago selected the word &quot;pixies&quot; randomly from a dictionary and took a liking to how it looked and its definition as &quot;mischievous little [[elves]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;SPIN Life Pixies&quot; /&gt; Once the band had settled on a name and stable line-up, they moved rehearsals to Lovering's parents' garage in mid-1986.&lt;ref name=&quot;Frank, Ganz, 2005. p. 20&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sisario, 2006. p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; They began to play shows at bars in and around the Boston area.&lt;ref name=&quot;SPIN Life Pixies&quot; /&gt;

=== Record contract and ''Come On Pilgrim'' ===
While the Pixies were playing a concert with [[Throwing Muses]], they were noticed by producer [[Gary Smith (record producer)|Gary Smith]], manager of [[Fort Apache Studios]].&lt;ref name=&quot;allmusic-bio&quot;/&gt; He told the band he &quot;could not sleep until you guys are world famous.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;officialprofile&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.4ad.com/artists/pixies | title=Pixies Profile | accessdate=July 6, 2011 | publisher=4AD}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band produced a 17-track demo at Fort Apache soon afterwards, known to fans as &quot;[[Pixies (EP)|The Purple Tape]]&quot; because of the tape cover's purple background. Funded by Francis' father at the cost of $1000, the recording session was completed in three days.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sisario, 2006. p. 16&quot;&gt;Sisario, 2006. p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; Local promoter Ken Goes became the band's manager, and he passed the demo to [[Ivo Watts-Russell]] of the independent record label [[4AD]].&lt;ref name=&quot;SPIN Life Pixies&quot; /&gt; Watts-Russell nearly passed on the band, finding them too normal, &quot;too rock 'n' roll&quot;, but signed them at the persuasion of his girlfriend.&lt;ref&gt;Sisario, 2006. p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon signing with 4AD, eight tracks from the Purple Tape were selected for the ''[[Come On Pilgrim]]'' EP, the band's first release.&lt;ref name=&quot;allmusic-bio&quot;/&gt; On the EP, Francis drew upon his experiences in Puerto Rico, mostly in the songs &quot;Vamos&quot; and &quot;Isla de Encanta&quot;; the album included lyrics describing the poverty in Puerto Rico.&lt;ref name=&quot;officialprofile&quot;/&gt; The religious lyrics in ''Come On Pilgrim'' and later albums came from his parents' [[born-again Christian]] days in the Pentecostal Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;officialprofile&quot;/&gt; Critic Heather Phares sees themes such as sexual frustration (&quot;I've Been Tired&quot;) and incest (&quot;Nimrod's Son&quot; and &quot;The Holiday Song&quot;) on the EP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allmusic.com/album/come-on-pilgrim-ep-r15331/review|title=Come on Pilgrim [EP]|author=Phares, Heather|work=Allmusic|accessdate=January 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Surfer Rosa'' and ''Doolittle'' ===
''Come On Pilgrim'' was followed by the band's first full-length album, ''[[Surfer Rosa]]''. The album was recorded by [[Steve Albini]] (who was hired by Watts-Russell on the advice of a 4AD colleague),&lt;ref&gt;Frank, Ganz, 2005. p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; completed in two weeks, and released in early 1988.&lt;ref name=&quot;officialprofile&quot;/&gt; ''Surfer Rosa'' gained the Pixies acclaim in Europe; both ''[[Melody Maker]]'' and ''[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]'' gave ''Surfer Rosa'' their &quot;Album of the Year&quot; award. American critical response was also positive yet more muted, a reaction that persisted for much of the band's career.&lt;ref&gt;Sisario, 2006. p. 19–20&lt;/ref&gt; The album was eventually certified Gold in the U.S. in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.riaa.com/newsitem.php?id=A1F76606-1591-CBA1-239D-359ECDBFFA66&amp;searchterms=Pixies&amp;terminclude=&amp;termexact= |title=50 Cent Cashes In| work=Recording Industry Association of America|accessdate=January 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the album was released, the band arrived in England to support Throwing Muses on the European &quot;Sex and Death&quot; tour—beginning at the [[Mean Fiddler]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;Frank, Ganz, 2005. p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; The tour became notable for the band's [[in-joke]]s, such as playing their entire [[set list]] in alphabetical order.&lt;ref name=&quot;allmusic-bio&quot;/&gt;

Meanwhile, the Pixies signed an American distribution deal with major record label [[Elektra Records|Elektra]].&lt;ref name=&quot;allmusic-bio&quot;/&gt; Around this time, the Pixies struck up a relationship with the British producer [[Gil Norton]]. Norton produced their second full album, ''[[Doolittle (album)|Doolittle]]'',&lt;ref name=carew/&gt; which was recorded in the last six weeks of 1988 and seen as a departure from the raw sound of ''Come On Pilgrim'' and ''Surfer Rosa''. ''Doolittle'' had a much cleaner sound, largely due to Norton and the production budget of [[United States dollar|US$]]40,000, which was quadruple that of ''Surfer Rosa''.&lt;ref&gt;Sisario, 2006. p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; ''Doolittle'' featured the single &quot;[[Here Comes Your Man]]&quot;, which biographers Josh Frank and Caryn Ganz describe as an unusually jaunty and pop-like song for the band.&lt;ref&gt;Frank, Ganz, 2005. p. 118–9&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;[[Monkey Gone to Heaven]]&quot; was a Top 10 [[modern rock]] radio hit in the U.S.,&lt;ref name=&quot;billboard albums&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/pixies-p5149/charts-awards/billboard-albums|title=Pixies: Billboard Albums|work=Allmusic|accessdate=January 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reached the Top 100 in the U.K.&lt;ref name=&quot;uk singles&quot;&gt;{{cite book|editor=Martin Roach|title=[[The Virgin Book of British Hit Singles]]|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|year=2008|page=320|isbn=978-0-7535-1537-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like ''Surfer Rosa'', ''Doolittle'' was acclaimed by fans and [[music critic]]s alike.&lt;ref name=carew&gt;{{cite web|last=Carew|first=Anthony|title=The Pixies&amp;nbsp;— Artist Profile|url=http://altmusic.about.com/od/artists/a/thepixies.htm|work=[[About.com]]|accessdate=May 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hiatus ===
After ''Doolittle'' tensions between Deal and Francis came to a head (for example, Francis threw a guitar at Deal during a concert in [[Stuttgart]]),&lt;ref&gt;Frank, Ganz, 2005. p. 132&lt;/ref&gt; and Deal was almost fired from the band when she refused to play at a concert in [[Frankfurt]].&lt;ref name=aston&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rocksbackpages.com/article.html?ArticleID=7981|title=Hello Goodbye: Joey Santiago &amp; The Pixies (subscription needed)|author=Aston, Martin|work=Rock'sbackpageslibrary|date=December 1997|accessdate=January 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Santiago, in an interview with ''[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]'', described Deal as being &quot;headstrong and want[ing] to include her own songs, to explore her own world&quot; on the band's albums; eventually she accepted that Francis was the singer and had musical control of the band, but after the Frankfurt incident, &quot;they kinda stopped talking&quot;.&lt;ref name=aston/&gt; The band became increasingly tired during the post-''Doolittle'' &quot;Fuck or Fight&quot; tour of the United States and fighting among members continued.&lt;ref name=carew/&gt; After the tour's final date in [[New York City|New York]], the band was too exhausted to attend the end-of-tour party the following night and soon announced a hiatus.&lt;ref name=&quot;allmusic-bio&quot;/&gt;

During this time, Santiago and Lovering went on vacation,&lt;ref name=carew/&gt; while Francis performed a short solo tour,&lt;ref name=&quot;allmusic-bio&quot;/&gt; made up of a number of concerts to generate gas money as he traveled across the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;SPIN Life Pixies&quot; /&gt; Deal formed a new band, [[The Breeders]], with [[Tanya Donelly]] of [[Throwing Muses]] and bass player [[Josephine Wiggs]] of Perfect Disaster.&lt;ref name=breedersbiography&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allmusic.com/artist/the-breeders-p3770/biography|title=The Breeders: Biography|author=Erlewine, Stephen Thomas|work=Allmusic|accessdate=January 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their debut album, ''[[Pod (The Breeders album)|Pod]]'', was released in 1990.&lt;ref name=breedersbiography/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allmusic.com/album/pod-r2627|title=Pod|author=Phares, Heather|work=Allmusic|accessdate=January 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Bossanova'', ''Trompe le Monde'', and break-up ===
In 1990, all members of the group except for Deal moved to Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;Frank, Ganz, 2005. p. 172&lt;/ref&gt; Lovering stated that he, Santiago, and Francis moved there &quot;because the recording studio was there&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Frank, Ganz, 2005. p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike previous recordings, the band had little time to practice beforehand, and Black Francis wrote much of the album in the studio.&lt;ref&gt;Frank, Ganz, 2005. pp. 175–76&lt;/ref&gt; Featuring the singles &quot;[[Velouria]]&quot; and &quot;[[Dig for Fire]]&quot;, ''[[Bossanova]]'' reached number 70 in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;billboard albums&quot;/&gt; In contrast, the album peaked at number three in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name=&quot;uk albums&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=The Virgin Book of British Hit Albums|editor=Martin Roach|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|year=2009|page=216|isbn=978-0-7535-1700-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1990, the Pixies released a cover of the [[Paul Butterfield|Paul Butterfield Blues Band's]] &quot;Born in Chicago&quot; on the compilation album ''[[Rubáiyát: Elektra's 40th Anniversary]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allmusic.com/album/rubaiyat-elektras-40th-anniversary-r17032|title=Rubaiyat: Elektra's 40th Anniversary|author=Heilman, Dan|work=Allmusic|accessdate=January 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The band continued to tour and released ''[[Trompe le Monde]]'' in 1991, their final album before their break-up. The album included &quot;U-Mass&quot;, which has been described as being about college apathy,&lt;ref name=magnet&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.magnetmagazine.com/2001/04/15/frank-black-odd-ball/|title=Frank Black: Odd Ball|author=Fritch, Matthew|work=Magnet|date=April 15, 2001|accessdate=January 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and whose guitar riff was written years before at the University of Massachusetts before Francis and Santiago dropped out.&lt;ref name=magnet/&gt; The album also featured a cover of &quot;Head On&quot; by [[The Jesus and Mary Chain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allmusic.com/album/trompe-le-monde-r15335|title=Trompe le Monde|author=Phares, Heather|work=Allmusic|accessdate=January 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also that year, the band contributed a cover of &quot;I Can't Forget&quot; to the [[Leonard Cohen]] [[tribute album]] ''[[I'm Your Fan]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/im-your-fan-the-songs-of-leonard-cohen-by-r71917|title=I'm Your Fan: The Songs of Leonard Cohen|author=Erlewine, Stephen Thomas|work=Allmusic|accessdate=January 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and began an international tour on which they played stadiums in Europe and smaller venues in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;allmusic-bio&quot;/&gt; They then embarked on an uncomfortable tour supporting [[U2]] on their [[Zoo TV]] tour in 1992.&lt;ref name=barton&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2005/aug/20/popandrock.pixies|title=Misfits that fit|author=Barton, Laura|work=The Guardian|date=August 20, 2005|accessdate=January 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tensions rose between band members, and, at the end of the year, the Pixies went on sabbatical and focused on separate projects.&lt;ref name=barton/&gt;

In early 1993, Francis announced in an interview to [[BBC Radio 5 (former)|BBC Radio 5]] that the band was finished and offered no explanation at the time, unbeknownst to the other members of the band.&lt;ref name=&quot;allmusic-bio&quot;/&gt; He later called Santiago and subsequently notified Deal and Lovering via [[fax]], in January 1993.&lt;ref&gt;Sisario, 2006. p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; After the break-up, the four members embarked on separate projects. Black Francis renamed himself [[Frank Black]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allmusic.com/artist/frank-black-p27207/biography|title=Frank Black: Biography|author=Erlewine, Stephen Thomas|work=Allmuisc|accessdate=January 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he released several solo albums, including a string of releases with [[Frank Black and the Catholics]].&lt;ref name=fbatcr&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cookingvinyl.com/artists/frank-black-and-the-catholics/#2|title=Frank Black and the Catholics: Releases|work=Cookingvinyl.com|accessdate=January 23, 2011}} {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deal returned to The Breeders, who scored a hit with &quot;[[Cannonball (Breeders song)|Cannonball]]&quot; from that group's platinum-selling ''[[Last Splash]]'' in 1993, and released two more albums several years later.&lt;ref name=breedersbiography/&gt; She also formed and released one album with [[The Amps]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nudeasthenews.com/reviews/460 | title=The Amps: Pacer |author=Carpenter, Troy|work=Nudeasthenews.com|accessdate=September 19, 2006 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060812225456/http://www.nudeasthenews.com/reviews/460 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = August 12, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2002-05-28/music/cool-as-kim-deal/ | title=Cool as Kim Deal | date=May 28, 2002|accessdate=February 28, 2007 | author=Grose, Jessica | work=The Village Voice}}&lt;/ref&gt; Santiago played lead guitar on multiple Frank Black albums,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allmusic.com/album/frank-black-r77989/credits|title=Frank Black: Credits|work=Allmusic|accessdate=February 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allmusic.com/album/teenager-of-the-year-r202231/credits|title=Teenager of the Year|work=Allmusic|accessdate=February 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allmusic.com/album/show-me-your-tears-r652547/credits|title=Show Me Your Tears: Credits|work=Allmusic|accessdate=February 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as on other artists' albums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allmusic.com/album/stuff-r315235/credits|title=Stuff: Credits|work=Allmusic|accessdate=February 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allmusic.com/album/in-pursuit-of-your-happiness-r733108/credits|title=In Pursuit of Your Happiness: Credits|work=Allmusic|accessdate=February 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote theme music for the show ''[[Undeclared]]'' on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] television and for ''[[Crime and Punishment in Suburbia]]''.&lt;ref name=pharesmartinis&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allmusic.com/artist/the-martinis-p653505/biography|title=The Martinis: Biography|author=Phares, Heather|work=Allmusic|accessdate=February 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He formed a band called [[The Martinis]] with his wife, [[Linda Mallari]], who released an album in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.themartinis.com/ | title=The Martinis | accessdate=September 13, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lovering went on to become a magician and made occasional appearances as &quot;The Scientific Phenomenalist&quot;, performing experiments on stage and occasionally opening for Frank Black and The Breeders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nipp.com/artists/detail/david-loveringscientific-phenomenalist | title=David Lovering—Scientific Phenomenalist | work=Nipp.com|accessdate=September 13, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lovering continued to do some drumming, playing with the band [[Cracker (band)|Cracker]],&lt;ref name=pharesmartinis/&gt; as well as on one of [[Tanya Donelly]]'s solo albums,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allmusic.com/album/lovesongs-for-underdogs-r312747/credits|title=Lovesongs for Underdogs: Credits|work=Allmusic|accessdate=February 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on the Martinis' song &quot;Free&quot;, which appeared on the ''[[Empire Records]]'' soundtrack.&lt;ref name=pharesmartinis/&gt;

=== Reunion ===

== Musical style ==
The Pixies' musical style has been described as &quot;an unorthodox marriage of surf music and punk rock, ... characterized by Black's bristling lyrics and hackle-raising caterwaul, Kim Deal's whispered harmonies and waspy basslines, Joey Santiago's fragile guitar, and the persistent flush of David Lovering's drums.&quot;&lt;ref name=barton/&gt; The band's music incorporates extreme dynamic shifts; Francis explained in 1991, &quot;Those are the two basic components of rock music [. . .] the dreamy side and the rockin' side. It's always been either sweaty or laid back and cool. We do try to be dynamic, but it's dumbo dynamics, because we don't know how to do anything else. We can play loud or quiet—that's it&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guitar Player&quot;&gt;Gore, Joe. &quot;The Pixies: Gods of Almost Pop. ''Guitar Player''. April 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Influences ===
The Pixies draw influence from a range of artists and genres; each member came from a different musical background. When he first started writing songs for the Pixies, Francis says he was listening to nothing but [[Hüsker Dü]], [[Captain Beefheart]], and [[Iggy Pop]];&lt;ref&gt;Sisario, 2006, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; Other influences associated with Francis include [[The Gun Club]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen|title=Pixies|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/pixies-p5149|work=Pixies|publisher=allmusic.com|accessdate=2011-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[The Cars]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailypage.com/isthmus/article.php?article=26366|title=Why Black Francis didn't go into real estate|author=Steinhoff, Jessica|work=The Daily Page|date=October 7, 2009|accessdate=January 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/14/arts/recordings-view-black-francis-frank-black-it-s-still-charles-thompson.html?src=pm|title=Recordings View; Black Francis?

Santiago listened to 1970s and 1980s punk (including [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]]) and [[David Bowie]].&lt;ref name=&quot;officialprofile&quot; /&gt; Guitarists who influenced him include [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[Les Paul]], [[Wes Montgomery]], and [[George Harrison]].&lt;ref&gt;Sisario, 2006, pp. 12, 49&lt;/ref&gt; Deal's musical background was folk music and [[country music|country]]; she had formed a country-folk band with her sister in her teenage years, and played covers of artists such as [[The Everly Brothers]] and [[Hank Williams]].&lt;ref name=barton/&gt; Other artists they listened to included [[XTC]], [[Gang of Four (band)|Gang of Four]] and [[Elvis Costello]].&lt;ref name=rogers&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2009/may/03/breeders-interview-pixies-kim-deal|title='It used to be about music.

Other media such as film has had an impact on the Pixies; Francis cites surrealist films ''[[Eraserhead]]'' and ''[[Un chien andalou]]'' (as mentioned in &quot;Debaser&quot;) as influences.&lt;ref name=&quot;officialprofile&quot;/&gt; He has commented on these influences, saying he &quot;didn't have the patience to sit around reading Surrealist novels&quot;, but found it easier to watch twenty-minute films.&lt;ref&gt;Sisario, 2006. p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Songwriting and vocals ===
Most of the Pixies songs were composed and sung by Francis. Critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine has described Francis's writing as containing &quot;bizarre, fragmented lyrics about space, religion, sex, mutilation, and pop culture&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;allmusic-bio&quot;/&gt; Biblical violence is a theme of ''Doolittle''{{'}}s &quot;Dead&quot; and &quot;Gouge Away&quot;;&lt;ref name=&quot;SPIN Life Pixies&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sisario, 2006. pp. 94, 119—120&lt;/ref&gt; Francis told a ''Melody Maker'' interviewer, &quot;It's all those characters in the [[Old Testament]]. I'm obsessed with them. Why it comes out so much I don't know.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Sisario, 2006. p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; He has described ''Come on Pilgrim{{'}}s'' &quot;Caribou&quot; as being about reincarnation,&lt;ref name=&quot;SPIN Life Pixies&quot; /&gt; and extraterrestrial themes appear in a number of songs on ''Bossanova''.&lt;ref name=&quot;SPIN Life Pixies&quot; /&gt;

== Legacy ==
Although the Pixies produced relatively few albums, whose sales were modest, they had a significant influence on the alternative rock boom of the 1990s.&lt;ref name=rollingstone&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/pixies/biography|title=Pixies: Biography|work=Rolling Stone|accessdate=February 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=egan&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/music/a-gigantic-influence-on-pop-music-1891561.html|title=A gigantic influence on pop music|author=Egan, Barry|work=Independent.ie|date=September 20, 2009|accessdate=January 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gary Smith, who produced the Pixies' first recording, ''Come On Pilgrim'', commented on the band's influence on alternative rock and their legacy in 1997:&lt;ref name=egan/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I've heard it said about [[The Velvet Underground]] that while not a lot of people bought their albums, everyone who did started a band. I think this is largely true about the Pixies as well. Charles' secret weapon turned out to be not so secret and, sooner or later, all sorts of bands were exploiting the same strategy of wide dynamics. It became a kind of new pop formula and, within a short while, &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; was charging up the charts and even the members of Nirvana said later that it sounded for all the world like a Pixies song.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sonically, the Pixies are credited with popularizing the extreme dynamics and stop-start timing that would become widespread in alternative rock; Pixies songs typically feature hushed, restrained verses, and explosive, wailing choruses.&lt;ref name=magnet/&gt; Artists including [[David Bowie]], [[Radiohead]], [[PJ Harvey]], [[U2]], [[The Strokes]], [[Weezer]], and [[Pavement (band)|Pavement]] have cited admiration of or influence by the Pixies.&lt;ref name=carew/&gt;&lt;ref name=carew/&gt;&lt;ref name=rhino&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rhinomedia.com/rzine/pressrelease.lasso?PRID=330 | title=The reunion tour of the year has come to DVD | work=Rhino Magazine|date=July 25, 2005|accessdate=September 9, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=allmusic&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/weezer-p44726| title=Weezer | work=Allmusic |year=2011|accessdate=June 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bono]] of U2 has called the Pixies &quot;one of America's greatest bands ever&quot;,&lt;ref name=rhino/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,695242,00.html | work=EW Weekly | title=Pixie Dusted | date=2004-09-17 | accessdate=2012-02-03 | first1=Tom | last1=Sinclair}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Radiohead's [[Thom Yorke]] has said that, while at school, &quot;the Pixies had changed my life&quot;.&lt;ref name=egan/&gt; Bowie, whose own music had inspired Francis and Santiago while they were at university, has said that the Pixies made &quot;just about the most compelling music of the entire 80s&quot;.&lt;ref name=rhino/&gt;

One notable citation as an influence was by Kurt Cobain, on influencing Nirvana's &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot;, which he admitted was a conscious attempt to co-opt the Pixies' style. In a January 1994 interview with ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', he said, &quot;I was trying to write the ultimate pop song. I was basically trying to rip off the Pixies. I have to admit it [smiles]. When I heard the Pixies for the first time, I connected with that band so heavily I should have been in that band—or at least in a Pixies cover band. We used their sense of dynamics, being soft and quiet and then loud and hard.&quot;&lt;ref name=egan/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3729933.stm | title=The Pixies: Rock's comeback kings | accessdate=August 11, 2006 | date=June 2, 2004 | work=BBC News | first=Stephen | last=Dowling}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cobain cited ''Surfer Rosa'' as one of his main musical influences, and particularly admired the album's natural and powerful drum sounds—a result of Steve Albini's influence on the record. Albini later produced Nirvana's 1993 ''[[In Utero (album)|In Utero]]'' at the request of Cobain.&lt;ref&gt;Azerrad, Michael. ''Come As You Are: The Story of Nirvana''. Doubleday, 1993. ISBN 0-385-47199-8, p. 313&lt;/ref&gt;

== Music videos and DVDs ==
No music videos were released from ''Come on Pilgrim'' or ''Surfer Rosa'', but from ''Doolittle'' onwards, the following videos were made: &quot;Monkey Gone To Heaven&quot;, &quot;Here Comes Your Man&quot;, &quot;Velouria&quot;, &quot;Dig For Fire&quot;, &quot;Allison&quot;, &quot;Alec Eiffel&quot;, &quot;Head On&quot;, and &quot;Debaser&quot;;&lt;ref name=jawetz&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/11535/pixies/|title=Pixies|author=Jawetz, Gil|work=DVD Talk|date=April 27, 2004|accessdate=January 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; these were later released on the 2004 DVD ''Pixies''.&lt;ref name=jawetz/&gt; The videos for &quot;Here Come Your Man&quot; and &quot;Allison&quot; were also released on ''The Complete 'B' Sides''.&lt;ref name=b-sides/&gt;

By ''Bossanova'', the band had developed a severe aversion to recording music videos, and Francis refused to [[lip-sync]] to them.&lt;ref name=&quot;pg140&quot;&gt;Frank, Ganz, 2005. p. 140&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the &quot;Here Comes Your Man&quot; video, both Black and Deal open their mouths wide instead of mouthing their lyrics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popbunker.net/2009/11/weekly-song-addiction-pixies-man/|title=Weekly Song Addiction: The Pixies—&quot;Here Comes Your Man&quot;|author=Rudder, Jack|work=Pop Bunker|date=November 9, 2009|accessdate=January 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the record label this became one of the reasons that the Pixies never achieved major coverage on [[MTV]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pg140&quot; /&gt;

With ''Bossanova''{{'}}s release, 4AD hoped to get the Pixies chosen to perform their single &quot;Velouria&quot; on the BBC music program ''[[Top of the Pops]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Mendelssohn, 2005, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; To this end, the band was pressured into producing a video for the song, and they made one cheaply with the band members filmed running down a quarry, shown in slow motion.&lt;ref name=&quot;pg140&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=barding&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.playlouder.com/feature/+pixies4/ | title=The Pixies And Me | accessdate=January 23, 2011 | author=Barding, Andy|work=Playlouder.com | date=June 7, 2004|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061124134746/http://www.playlouder.com/feature/+pixies4/ |archivedate = November 24, 2006|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group was ultimately not given a spot on the show.&lt;ref name=barding/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mendelssohn, 2005, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;

A 90-minute documentary called ''loudQUIETloud: a film about The Pixies'' directed by [[Steven Cantor]] and [[Matthew Galkin]] was released in 2006. The film documents their 2004 reunion and tour, and covers the years after the break-up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://loudquietloud.com/|year=2006|title=loudQUIETloud: a film about the Pixies|work=loudQuietloud.com|accessdate= November 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to ''Pixies'' and ''LoudQUIETloud'', four other Pixies' DVDs were released between 2004 and 2006, all featuring concert performances: ''Live at the Town and Country Club 1988'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.allmusic.com/album/live-at-the-town-and-country-club-1988-r819259|title=Live at the Town and Country Club 1988|work=Allmusic|accessdate=February 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Pixies—Sell Out'',&lt;ref name=rhino/&gt; ''The Pixies Acoustic: Live in Newport'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/23602/pixies-acoustic-live-in-newport-the/|title=The Pixies Acoustic: Live in Newport|author=Cornelius, David|work=DVD Talk|date=August 22, 2006| accessdate=February 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Pixies Club Date: Live at the Paradise in Boston''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/24436/pixies-club-date-live-at-the-paradise-in-boston-the/|title=The Pixies Club Date: Live at the Paradise in Boston|author=Wallis, John|work=DVD Talk|date=October 3, 2006| accessdate=February 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
