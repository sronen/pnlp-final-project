'''Slayer'''  is an American [[thrash metal]] band formed in [[Huntington Park, California]], in 1981 by guitarists [[Jeff Hanneman]] and [[Kerry King]].&lt;ref name=&quot;An exclusive oral history of Slayer&quot;/&gt; Slayer rose to fame with their 1986 release, ''[[Reign in Blood]]'',&lt;ref name=&quot;Kerrang!

Their album ''Reign in Blood'' is considered to be the foundation and inspiration of [[death metal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lee|first=Cosmo|title=Get Thrashed: The Story of Thrash Metal|url=http://www.stylusmagazine.com/articles/movie_review/get-thrashed-the-story-of-thrash-metal.htm|work=Stylus|date=7 May 2007|accessdate=16 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Slayer's musical traits involve fast [[tremolo picking]], [[double bass drumming]], and shouted (or chanted) vocals. Hanneman, King, and bassist/lead vocalist [[Tom Araya]], contribute to the band's lyrics. King and Hanneman create and arrange the music with additional arrangement from drummer [[Dave Lombardo]] and sometimes Araya.&lt;ref name=&quot;An exclusive oral history of Slayer&quot;/&gt; The band's lyrics and album art, which cover topics such as [[serial killers]], [[Satanism]], [[religion]] and [[war]]fare, have generated album bans, delays, lawsuits and strong criticism from religious groups and the public.

Since their [[Show No Mercy (Slayer album)|debut album]] in 1983, the band has released two [[live album]]s, one [[box set]], six [[music video|videos]], two [[extended play]]s, and eleven [[studio album]]s, four (''Reign in Blood'', ''[[South of Heaven]]'', ''[[Seasons in the Abyss]]'', and ''[[Divine Intervention (album)|Divine Intervention]]'' in 1986, 1988, 1990, and 1994 respectively) of which have received gold [[RIAA certification|certification]] in the United States. The band has received five [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] nominations, winning two of them; one in 2007 for the song &quot;[[Eyes of the Insane]]&quot;, and one in 2008 for the song &quot;Final Six&quot; (both from 2006's ''[[Christ Illusion]]''). Slayer has played music festivals worldwide, including [[The Unholy Alliance Tour|Unholy Alliance]], [[Download Festival|Download]], and [[Ozzfest]]. As of November 2011, Slayer has begun writing their next album.

==History==
===Early days (1981)===
Slayer was founded in 1981, when guitarist [[Kerry King]] met [[Jeff Hanneman]] while auditioning for a band.&lt;ref name=&quot;Knac.com interview with Jeff Hanneman&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title = Knac.com interview with Jeff Hanneman|author = Davis, Brian |publisher = Knac.com|url = http://www.knac.com/article.asp?ArticleID=3153|accessdate = 13 December 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They recruited Chilean bassist and vocalist [[Tom Araya]], who had played with King before in the band Quits (previously known as Tradewinds). Drummer [[Dave Lombardo]] was recruited when he met King while delivering a pizza.&lt;ref name=&quot;Drummerworld - Dave Lombardo&quot;/&gt; The band played [[cover version]]s of [[Iron Maiden]] and [[Judas Priest]] songs at clubs and parties in [[Southern California]]. Early shows relied on a [[Satanism|Satanic]] image, which featured [[pentagram]]s, make-up, spikes, and inverted crosses.&lt;ref name=&quot;Allmusic Biography of Slayer&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title = Allmusic Biography of Slayer| author = Huey, Steve | publisher = Allmusicguide.com| date = | url = {{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p5453/biography|pure_url=yes}}| accessdate = 10 December 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rumors that the band was originally known as Dragonslayer, after the 1981 movie of the same [[Dragonslayer|name]], were denied by King, as he stated, &quot;We never were; it's a myth to this day.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kerry King about the Dragonslayer myth, Christ Illusion, previous albums and experimenting&quot;&gt;{{cite web

The band was invited to open for [[Bitch (band)|Bitch]] at the Woodstock Club in [[Los Angeles]], performing eight songs — six being covers. While playing Iron Maiden's &quot;[[Phantom of the Opera (song)|Phantom of the Opera]]&quot; the band was spotted by [[Brian Slagel]], a former [[music journalist]] who had, at the time, recently founded the label [[Metal Blade Records]]. Impressed with Slayer's performance, Slagel met with the band backstage and asked them to record an original song, &quot;Aggressive Perfector&quot; ({{Audio|Aggressive Perfector clip.ogg|sample}}), for his upcoming ''[[Metal Massacre#Metal Massacre III – 1983|Metal Massacre III]]'' compilation. The band agreed and the song created underground &quot;buzz&quot;, which led to Slagel offering the band a [[recording contract]] with Metal Blade.&lt;ref name=&quot;INTERVIEW WITH BRIAN SLAGEL&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title = Interview with Brian Slagel|author = German, Eric|publisher = Metalupdate.com|url = http://www.metalupdate.com/interviewmetalblade.html|accessdate = 4 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Show No Mercy'', ''Haunting the Chapel'' and ''Hell Awaits'' (1983–1986)===
Without a recording budget, the band was forced to self-finance its debut album. Combining the savings of Araya, who was employed as a [[respiratory therapy|respiratory therapist]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Live Chat with Tom Araya of Slayer&quot;&gt;{{cite web

The album was rushed into release, hitting shelves three weeks after tracks were completed. ''[[Show No Mercy (Slayer album)|Show No Mercy]]'', released in December 1983 by Metal Blade Records, generated underground popularity for the band, and the group began its first national club tour in 1984 to promote the album traveling in Tom Araya's [[Camaro]] towing a [[U-Haul]] trailer.&lt;ref name=&quot;An exclusive oral history of Slayer&quot;/&gt; The tour gave the band additional popularity; sales of ''Show No Mercy'' reached more than 20,000 in the US and another 20,000 worldwide.&lt;ref name=&quot;INTERVIEW WITH BRIAN SLAGEL&quot;/&gt;

In August 1984, Slayer released a three song [[extended play|EP]] titled ''[[Haunting the Chapel]]''. The EP featured a darker, more [[thrash metal|thrash]]-oriented style than its predecessor, and laid the groundwork for the future direction of the band.&lt;ref name=&quot;Slayer : Haunting the Chapel&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Slayer:Haunting the Chapel|author=Rivadavia, Eduardo|publisher=Allmusic|url = http://www.artistdirect.com/nad/store/artist/album/0,,164341,00.html|accessdate=1 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opening track, &quot;Chemical Warfare&quot;, has become a live staple, played at nearly every show since 1984.

Slayer released its first live [[home video]] in 1985, dubbed ''Combat Tour: The Ultimate Revenge''. The video featured live footage filmed at [[New York]]'s [[Studio 54]] club, on the band's 1984 tour with Venom and Exodus. By early 1985, ''Show No Mercy'' had sold over 40,000 copies,&lt;ref name=&quot;INTERVIEW WITH BRIAN SLAGEL&quot;/&gt; which led to the band returning to the studio to record a second full length album. Metal Blade financed a recording budget, which allowed the band to hire producer [[Ron Fair]].&lt;ref name=&quot;An exclusive oral history of Slayer&quot;/&gt;

Released in September 1985, Slayer's second full length release ''[[Hell Awaits]]'' expanded on the darkness of ''Haunting the Chapel'', with [[hell]] and [[Satan]] as common song subjects. The album was the band's most [[progressive rock|progressive]] offering, featuring longer and more complex song structures.&lt;ref name=&quot;An exclusive oral history of Slayer&quot;/&gt; The intro of the title track is a [[Backmasking|backwards recording]] of a demonic-sounding voice repeating &quot;Join us&quot;, ending with &quot;Welcome back&quot; before the track begins. The album was a hit, with fans choosing Slayer for best band, best live band, ''Hell Awaits'' as 1985's best album, and Dave Lombardo as best drummer in the British magazine ''[[Metal Forces]]''' 1985 Readers Poll.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rockdetector Biography - Years 85 to 86&quot;&gt;{{cite web

===''Reign in Blood'' (1986–1987)===
Following the success of ''Hell Awaits'', Slayer was offered a recording contract with [[Russell Simmons]] and [[Rick Rubin]]'s newly founded [[Def Jam Recordings|Def Jam Records]], a largely [[hip hop music|hip hop]]-based label.&lt;ref name=&quot;An exclusive oral history of Slayer&quot;/&gt; The band accepted and with an experienced producer and [[major label]] recording budget, the band underwent a sonic makeover resulting in shorter, faster songs with clearer production. Gone were the complex arrangements and long songs featured on ''Hell Awaits'', ditched in favor of stripped down, [[thrash metal]] influenced song structures.&lt;ref name=&quot;An exclusive oral history of Slayer&quot;/&gt;

Def Jam's distributor, [[Columbia Records]], refused to release the album ''[[Reign in Blood]]'' due to its graphic cover art and themes.&lt;ref name=&quot;An exclusive oral history of Slayer&quot;/&gt; For example, &quot;[[Angel of Death (song)|Angel of Death]]&quot; detailed [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] [[concentration camp]]s and the [[human experiments]] conducted by Nazi physician [[Josef Mengele]]. The album was distributed by [[Geffen Records]] on October 7, 1986. However, due to the controversy, ''Reign in Blood'' did not appear on Geffen Records’ release schedule.&lt;ref name=&quot;An exclusive oral history of Slayer&quot;/&gt; Although the album received virtually no radio airplay, it became the band's first to enter the [[Billboard 200]], debuting at #94,&lt;ref name=&quot;Billboard&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Slayer's album chart history|publisher= Billboard.com|url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/retrieve_chart_history.do?model.chartFormatGroupName=Albums&amp;model.vnuArtistId=5692&amp;model.vnuAlbumId=789249|accessdate=1 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the band's first album certified gold in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;RIAA&quot;/&gt;

In October 1986, Slayer embarked on the ''Reign in Pain'' world tour, with [[Overkill (band)|Overkill]] in the US, and [[Malice (metal band)|Malice]] in Europe. The band was added as the opening act on [[W.A.S.P.]]'s US tour, but just one month in, drummer Lombardo left the band: &quot;I wasn't making any money. I figured if we were gonna be doing this professionally, on a major label, I wanted my rent and utilities paid.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;An exclusive oral history of Slayer&quot;/&gt; To continue with the tour, Slayer enlisted [[Tony Scaglione]] of [[Whiplash (band)|Whiplash]]. However, Lombardo's wife convinced Dave to return in 1987.&lt;ref name=&quot;An exclusive oral history of Slayer&quot;/&gt; At the insistence of Rubin, Slayer recorded a [[cover version]] of [[Iron Butterfly]]'s &quot;[[In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida]]&quot; for the film ''[[Less Than Zero (film)|Less Than Zero]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;An exclusive oral history of Slayer&quot;/&gt; Although the band was not happy with the final product, Hanneman deeming it &quot;a poor representation of Slayer&quot; and King labeling it &quot;a hunk of shit&quot;, it was one of their first songs to garner [[radio airplay]].&lt;ref name=&quot;An exclusive oral history of Slayer&quot;/&gt;

===''South of Heaven'' and ''Seasons in the Abyss'' (1988–1993)===
Slayer returned to the studio to record their fourth studio album. To contrast the speed of ''Reign in Blood'', the band consciously decided to slow down the [[tempo]]s, and incorporate more melodic singing. According to Hanneman, &quot;We knew we couldn’t top ''Reign in Blood'', so we had to slow down. We knew whatever we did was gonna be compared to that album, and I remember we actually discussed slowing down. It was weird—we’ve never done that on an album, before or since.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;An exclusive oral history of Slayer&quot;/&gt;

1988's ''[[South of Heaven]]'' received mixed responses from both fans and critics, although it was Slayer's most commercially successful release at the time, debuting at #57 on the [[Billboard 200]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Billboard&quot;&gt;{{cite web

King said &quot;that album was my most lackluster performance&quot;, although Araya called it a &quot;late bloomer&quot; which eventually grew on people.&lt;ref name=&quot;An exclusive oral history of Slayer&quot;/&gt;

Slayer returned to the studio with co-producer [[Andy Wallace (producer)|Andy Wallace]] in 1989, to record their fifth studio album.

The album debuted at #44 on the Billboard 200,&lt;ref name=&quot;Billboard&quot; /&gt; and was certified gold in 1992.&lt;ref name=&quot;RIAA&quot;/&gt; The title track spawned Slayer's first music video, which was filmed in front of the [[Giza pyramid complex|Giza pyramids]] in Egypt prior to the [[Gulf War]].

Slayer returned as a live act in September 1990 to co-headline the European [[Clash of the Titans tour|''Clash of the Titans'' tour]] with [[Megadeth]], [[Suicidal Tendencies]], and [[Testament (band)|Testament]]. During the sold out European leg of this tour tickets fetched up to 1,000 Deutschmark ($680 USD) on the black market. With the popularity of American thrash at its peak, the tour was extended to the US beginning in May 1991, with Megadeth, [[Anthrax (band)|Anthrax]] and opening act [[Alice in Chains]]. The band released a double live album, ''[[Decade of Aggression]]'' in 1991, to celebrate ten years. The compilation debuted at #55 on the Billboard 200.&lt;ref name=&quot;Billboard&quot;/&gt;

In May 1992, Lombardo quit the band due to conflicts with other members, as well as arguments over his wish to bring his wife on tour.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meet the new Slayer, same as the old Slayer'l&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Meet the new Slayer, same as the old Slayer|author=Patrizio, Andy|publisher= IGN|date=14 August 2006|url=http://au.music.ign.com/articles/725/725459p1.html|accessdate =1 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lombardo formed his own band [[Grip Inc]], with [[Voodoocult]] guitarist [[Waldemar Sorychta]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Waldemar Sorychta interview&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title = Waldemar Sorychta interview| publisher=antenna.nu|url=http://www.antenna.nu/gripinc/interview1.php|accessdate =10 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Slayer recruited former [[Forbidden (band)|Forbidden]] drummer [[Paul Bostaph]] to fill his place.
Slayer made its debut appearance with Bostaph at the 1992 [[Monsters of Rock#1992|Monsters of Rock]] festival at [[Castle Donington]]. Bostaph's first studio effort was a medley of three [[The Exploited|Exploited]] songs, &quot;War&quot;, &quot;UK '82&quot;, and &quot;Disorder&quot;, with rapper [[Ice T]], for the ''[[Judgment Night (film)|Judgment Night]]'' movie soundtrack in 1993.&lt;ref name=&quot;Legendary rapper and longtime metal advocate moves on with the Body Count&quot;&gt;{{cite web

The album received a mixed critical reception and was criticized for adopting characteristics of [[nu metal]] music such as tuned down guitars, murky chord structures, and churning beats. ''Blabbermouth.net'' reviewer Borijov Krgin described the album as &quot;a feeble attempt at incorporating updated elements into the group's sound, the presence of which elevated the band's efforts somewhat and offered hope that Slayer could refrain from endlessly rehashing their previous material for their future output&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Blabbermouth Review&quot;&gt;{{cite web

Slayer toured playing ''[[Reign in Blood]]'' in its entirety throughout the fall of 2003, under the tour banner &quot;Still Reigning&quot;. Their playing of the final song &quot;[[Raining Blood]]&quot; culminated with the band drenched in a rain of stage blood. Live footage of this was recorded at the Augusta Civic Center in [[Augusta, Maine]], on July 11, 2004 and released on the 2004 DVD ''[[Still Reigning]]''. The band also released ''[[War at the Warfield]]'' and a box set, ''[[Soundtrack to the Apocalypse]]'' featuring rarities, live CD and DVD performances and various Slayer paraphernalia.

From 2002 to 2004 the band performed over 250 tour dates, headlining major music festivals including H82k2, Summer tour, [[Ozzfest#2000-2006: Commercial success|Ozzfest 2004]] and a European tour with [[Slipknot (band)|Slipknot]].

It was the first performance of that bands played as a part of Sonisphere Festival series, one of the following ([[Sofia]], [[Bulgaria]], June 22, 2010) was sent via satellite in HD to cinemas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Metallica |url=http://www.billboard.com/news/metallica-heading-to-cinemas-1004097367.story#/news/metallica-heading-to-cinemas-1004097367.story |title=Metallica Heading To Cinemas |publisher=Billboard.com |date=2009-09-14 |accessdate=2010-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also went on to play in [[Switzerland]] (June 18, 2010), [[Milovice Airport]], [[Czech Republic]] (June 19, 2010), [[Bucharest]], [[Romania]] (June 26, 2010) and then in [[Istanbul]], [[Turkey]] (June 27, 2010) also as part of the Sonisphere Festival.

In early 2011, Hanneman contracted [[necrotizing fasciitis]]. According to the band, doctors say that it likely originated from a spider bite. In light of this situation and Slayer's participation in the Australian Soundwave Festival tour set to kick off on February 26, the band made the tough decision to play the dates without Hanneman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=153855|title=SLAYER's HANNEMAN Contracts Acute Infection; Band To Bring In Guest Guitarist|publisher=Blabbermouth}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gary Holt (musician)|Gary Holt]] of [[Exodus (band)|Exodus]] was announced as Jeff's temporary replacement.&lt;ref name=&quot;blab-garyholt&quot;&gt;

===Next album and current events (2011–present)===
In a May 2011 interview with Geeks of Doom, Dave Lombardo was asked if Slayer was going to make another album. He replied: &quot;Yes absolutely; Although there's nothing written but there is definitely plans. Of course. We have to. Why not? I'm not retiring and I don't think Kerry [King] is retiring either so... I like longevity and a true musician never abandons his art.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=158701|title=Slayer Drummer Says He 'Wasn't A Fan' Of Band's Albums He Didn't Play On|publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to Tom Araya, Slayer will not begin writing a new album until Jeff Hanneman's condition improves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Graff| first = Gary| title = Slayer to 'Hold Off' on Recording While Ailing Bassist Recovers| work = [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]| date = 2011-05-21| url = http://www.billboard.com/news/slayer-to-hold-off-on-recording-while-ailing-1005206572.story#/news/slayer-to-hold-off-on-recording-while-ailing-1005206572.story| accessdate = 2011-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked about Hanneman's condition in July 2011, Araya told Linnéa Olsson of [[Sveriges Television]] (SVT): &quot;Jeff was seriously ill.

On November 21, 2011, ''[[Guitar World]]'' posted an announcement that Dave Lombardo [[Twitter|tweeted]] that the band had started to write new music. The tweet read: &quot;SLAYER is writing a new record and PHILM is about to start mixing their debut record.

When you hit it in the same place right after that you kinda get a 'slapback' from the bass drum head hitting the other pedal. You're not letting them breathe.&quot; When playing the double bass Lombardo uses the [[Bass drum#Techniques|&quot;heel-up&quot; technique]].&lt;ref&gt;Dave Lombardo Modern Drummer Festival 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

Hanneman, King and Araya contribute to the band's lyrics, and King and Hanneman create and arrange the music with additional arrangement from Lombardo and sometimes Araya. ''Final Six'' (from ''[[Christ Illusion]]'') is the only song by Slayer which Araya co-wrote the music for, whereas Lombardo has not received any writing credits in Slayer's history at all. Araya has formed a lyric writing partnership with Hanneman, which can overshadow the creative input of King.&lt;ref name=&quot;An exclusive oral history of Slayer&quot;/&gt; Hanneman states writing lyrics and music is a &quot;free for all&quot;; &quot;It's all just whoever comes up with what. Sometimes I'll be more on a roll and I'll have more stuff, same with Kerry— it's whoever's hot, really.

When writing new material, the band writes the music before incorporating lyrics. King or Hanneman will use a [[Multitrack recording|24-track]] and [[drum machine]] to show band members the riff they have created, and to get their opinion. Either King, Hanneman or Lombardo will mention if any alterations can be made. The band will play the riff to get the basic song structure, and figure out where the lyrics and solos will be placed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Knac.com interview with Jeff Hanneman&quot;/&gt; Hanneman, King and Araya tend to have different lyrical influences. Hanneman's lyrics deal with Nazis, religion, warfare and similar topics. King's lyrics are generally just very anti-religious. Araya's lyrics usually deal with less controversial topics than Hanneman's and King's, such as serial killers and warfare.

Slayer's cover of [[Minor Threat|Minor Threat's]] &quot;Guilty of Being White&quot; raised questions about a possible message of [[white supremacy]] in the band's music.

This incensed Minor Threat frontman [[Ian MacKaye]], who stated &quot;that is so offensive to me.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Blush, Steven ''American Hardcore: A Tribal History by Steven Blush'' (New York: Feral House, 2001), &quot;Guilty of Being White,&quot; in an interview with Ian MacKaye, 30–31.&lt;/ref&gt; King said it was changed for &quot;tongue-in-cheek&quot; humor as he thought the allegation of racism at the time was &quot;ridiculous&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Alpha69 Productions, Perceptive Minds, SERANO |url=http://www.toazted.com/interview/100/Slayer.html |title=Slayer interviews (audio, mp3, video) |publisher=Toazted.com |date= |accessdate=10 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2004 interview with Araya, when asked, &quot;Did critics realize you were wallowing in parody?&quot;, Araya replied, &quot;No. People thought we were serious!...back then you had that [[Parents Music Resource Center|PMRC]], who literally took everything to heart, when in actuality you're trying to create an image.

[[File:Slayer at The Fields of Rock festival.jpg|thumb|Due to its controversial artwork, all Indian stocks of ''[[Christ Illusion]]'' (pictured in background) were recalled and destroyed]]

Seventeen bus benches promoting the album in [[Fullerton, California]] were deemed offensive by city officials. They felt the Antichrist and skull were inappropriate, and felt the name &quot;Slayer&quot; pertains to a murderer.

In India, the album was recalled by [[EMI]] India after protests with [[Christian]] religious groups due to the nature of the graphic artwork. The album cover was designed by Slayer's longtime collaborator [[Larry Carroll (artist)|Larry Carroll]] and features Christ in a &quot;sea of despair&quot;, while having amputated arms, missing an eye, while standing in a sea of blood with severed heads.&lt;ref name=&quot;EMI&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6039976.stm|title=India bans 'offensive' rock album|date=11 October 2006|accessdate=11 October 2006|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joseph Dias of the Mumbai Christian group ''Catholic Secular Forum'' in India took &quot;strong exception&quot; to the original album artwork, and issued a memorandum to Mumbai's police commissioner in protest.&lt;ref name=&quot;IllusionRecalled&quot;&gt;{{cite web
