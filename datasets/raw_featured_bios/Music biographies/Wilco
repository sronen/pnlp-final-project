'''Wilco''' is an American [[alternative rock]] band based in Chicago, [[Illinois]]. The band was formed in 1994 by the remaining members of [[alternative country]] group [[Uncle Tupelo]] following singer [[Jay Farrar]]'s departure. Wilco's lineup has changed frequently, with only singer [[Jeff Tweedy]] and bassist [[John Stirratt]] remaining from the original incarnation. Since early 2004, the other current members are guitarist [[Nels Cline]], multi-instrumentalists [[Pat Sansone]] and [[Mikael Jorgensen]], and drummer [[Glenn Kotche]]. Wilco has released eight studio albums, a live double album, and three collaborations: two with [[Billy Bragg]], and one with [[The Minus 5]].

Wilco's music has been inspired by a wide variety of artists and styles, including [[Bill Fay]] and [[Television (band)|Television]], and has in turn influenced music by a number of modern alternative rock acts. The band continued in the alternative country of Uncle Tupelo on its debut album ''[[A.M. (album)|A.M.]]'' (1995), but has since introduced more [[experimental music|experimental]] aspects to their music, including elements of alternative rock and classic pop.

Wilco garnered media attention for its fourth album, ''[[Yankee Hotel Foxtrot]]'' (2002), and the controversy surrounding it. After the recording sessions were complete, [[Reprise Records]] rejected the album and dismissed Wilco from the label. As part of a buy-out deal, Reprise gave Wilco the rights to the album for free. After streaming ''Foxtrot'' on its website, Wilco sold the album to [[Nonesuch Records]] in 2002. Both record labels are subsidiaries of [[Warner Music Group]], leading one critic to say the album showed &quot;how screwed up the music business is in the early twenty-first century.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fricke|first=David|authorlink=David Fricke|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/wilco/albums/album/322307/review/5946403/yankee_hotel_foxtrot|title=Yankee Hotel Foxtrot (review)|publisher=Rolling Stone|date=May 9, 2002|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070912001355/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/wilco/albums/album/322307/review/5946403/yankee_hotel_foxtrot |archivedate = September 12, 2007|deadurl=yes}} Last accessed July 18, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Yankee Hotel Foxtrot'' is Wilco's most successful release to date, selling over 670,000 copies. Wilco won two [[Grammy Award]]s for their fifth studio album, 2004's ''[[A Ghost Is Born]]'', including [[Best Alternative Music Album]]. Wilco's most recent studio album, ''[[The Whole Love]]'', was released on September 27, 2011.

== History ==
=== Formation ===
{{Main|Uncle Tupelo}}
Wilco was formed following the breakup of the influential alternative country music group [[Uncle Tupelo]]. Singer [[Jay Farrar]] quit the band in 1994 supposedly because of a soured relationship with co-singer [[Jeff Tweedy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Blackstock|first=Peter|url=http://www.nodepression.net/issues/nd01/sonvolt.html|title=Jay Farrar Traces a Path Away from Uncle Tupelo|publisher=''[[No Depression (periodical)|No Depression]]''|date=Fall 1995|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070928002617/http://www.nodepression.net/issues/nd01/sonvolt.html |archivedate = September 28, 2007|deadurl=yes}} Last accessed July 9, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Both Tweedy and Farrar sought to form bands immediately after the breakup. Tweedy was able to keep the entire Uncle Tupelo lineup sans Farrar, including [[bassist]] John Stirratt, [[drummer]] [[Ken Coomer]], and multi-instrumentalist [[Max Johnston]]. He even enlisted Uncle Tupelo guest guitarist [[Brian Henneman]] of [[the Bottle Rockets]], who performed on many of the tracks for Wilco's debut album, ''[[A.M. (album)|A.M.]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;undertowmusic.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.undertowmusic.com/messageboards/viewtopic.php?f=20&amp;t=3926&amp;p=26462#p26462 Undertownmusic.com]{{dead link|date=October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band was tempted to keep the Uncle Tupelo name, but ultimately decided to rename the band.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sheridan|first=Phil|title=Roger, Wilco|publisher=''[[Magnet (magazine)|Magnet]]''|date=February 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group named itself &quot;Wilco&quot; after the [[military and commercial aviation radio voice acronym]] for &quot;Will Comply&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Kot 2004&quot;&gt;Kot 2004. p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; a choice which Tweedy has called &quot;fairly ironic for a rock band to name themselves.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;CBS News Sunday Morning&quot;&gt;Cynthia Bowers (August 23, 2009). &quot;A Summer Song&quot;, [[CBS News Sunday Morning]]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''A.M.'' and ''Being There'' ===
After collaborating with [[Syd Straw]] on a cover version of the [[Ernest Tubb]] song &quot;The T.B. is Whipping Me&quot; (released in September 1994 on the ''[[Red Hot + Country]]'' compilation produced by the [[Red Hot Organization]]), Wilco began [http://www.undertowmusic.com/messageboards/viewtopic.php?f=20&amp;t=3926&amp;p=26462#p26462 recording tracks] for ''[[A.M. (album)|A.M.]]'', their first studio album, at Easley studio in June 1994.&lt;ref name=&quot;undertowmusic.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kot 2004&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dawne|first=Vanessa|title=Wilco (interview)|publisher=Pop Culture Press|year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; A demo tape from these recordings was sent to executives at [[Reprise Records]], a subsidiary of [[Warner Brothers]], and the label signed Tweedy to a contract. Although Tweedy stated that he wanted a more collaborative project than Uncle Tupelo, only his name appeared on the Reprise contract.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kot1&quot;&gt;Kot 2004. p. 92&lt;/ref&gt; Tweedy requested songwriting submissions from other members, but only one submission—John Stirratt's &quot;It's Just That Simple&quot;—appeared on ''A.M.''. It was the last song Wilco ever released that was lyrically solely written by a member besides Tweedy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kot1&quot;/&gt;

Stylistically similar to Uncle Tupelo, the music on ''A.M.'' was considered to be straightforward alternative country rock in what Tweedy later described as &quot;trying to tread some water with a perceived audience.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cameron|first=Keith|title=Last Twang in Town|publisher=Vox|date=May 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''A.M.'' peaked at number twenty-seven on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Top Heatseekers|Heatseekers]] chart, considerably lower than the debut album of Jay Farrar's new band, [[Son Volt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Heatseekers|publisher=''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''|date=April 15, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The ''Billboard'' 200|publisher=Billboard|date=October 7, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album was met with modest reviews though it would rank thirty-fourth in the ''[[Village Voice]]'''s 1995 [[Pazz &amp; Jop]] critics poll.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=George-Warren|first=Holly|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/wilco/albums/album/230153/review/5942185/am|title=Wilco: ''A.M.''

{{Listen|filename=I Must Be High.ogg|title=&quot;I Must Be High&quot;|description=Sample from &quot;I Must Be High&quot;, the first track from ''A.M.''. The song is an example of the straightforward alternative country music described by Tweedy as &quot;trying to tread some water with a perceived audience.&quot;|format=[[Ogg]]}}

Wilco made its live debut on November 17, 1994 to a capacity crowd at Cicero's Basement Bar in [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]] (the band was billed for the occasion as &quot;[[Black Shampoo]]&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kuelker|first=Michael|title=New Wilco Satisfies Tupelo Fans|publisher=St. Louis Dispatch|date=November 19, 1994}} Last accessed September 2, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the two hundred-date tour supporting ''A.M.'', Tweedy began to write songs for a second album. The lyrical theme of the songs reflected a relationship between musical artist and a listener; Tweedy chose this topic because he sought to eschew the alternative country fan base. Ken Coomer elaborated:&lt;ref&gt;Kot 2004. p. 110–1&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The whole ''[[No Depression (periodical)|No Depression]]'' thing was funny to us because people seemed to forget that Jeff was a bigger punk-rock fan than a country fan. It led to things like us all switching instruments on &quot;Misunderstood,&quot; where I'm playing guitar.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A number of songs were recorded with this theme, including &quot;Sunken Treasure&quot; and &quot;Hotel Arizona&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Kot 2004. p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; however, Wilco also recorded a number of songs in the style of ''A.M.''&lt;ref name=&quot;ND&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Blackstock|first=Peter|url=http://www.nodepression.net/issues/nd05/wilco.html|title=Being There, Doing That|publisher=No Depression|date=September 1996|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070507025218/http://www.nodepression.net/issues/nd05/wilco.html |archivedate = May 7, 2007|deadurl=yes}} Last accessed July 11, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Wilco named the album ''[[Being There (album)|Being There]]'' after a [[Peter Sellers]] [[Being There|film of the same name]]. The band went through some personnel changes during the recording sessions. Max Johnston left the band because he felt that his role in the band had diminished in favor of Bennett; he had also been replaced by violinist Jesse Greene on one track because the band felt that Johnston was unable to play the part. Bob Egan of [[Freakwater]] briefly joined the band in the studio, playing [[pedal steel guitar]] on &quot;Far, Far Away&quot; and &quot;Dreamer in My Dreams&quot;, and then became an official member in September 1996.&lt;ref&gt;Kot 2004. p. 115&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kot 2004. p. 119&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the ''A.M.'' recording sessions, the band had no vocation for producing a hit song from their second effort.&lt;ref&gt;Kot 2004. p. 114&lt;/ref&gt; The recording sessions produced nineteen songs, too many for a single album release. Tweedy was concerned about the high retail price that a [[double album]] would be sold for (at least $30), so he asked Reprise Records to release it as a double album at a single album price ($17.98 or less). Reprise agreed to this on the terms that they received Wilco's share of the album royalties. It was estimated in 2003 that the band lost almost $600,000 on the deal, but Tweedy was satisfied.&lt;ref&gt;Kot 2004. p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; ''Being There'' was well-received by critics from several major media outlets, including ''[[Rolling Stone]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;ND&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ankeny|first=Jason|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r241294|pure_url=yes}}|title=Being There &gt; Overview|publisher=Allmusic}} Last accessed July 11, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kot|first=Greg|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/wilco/albums/album/240156/review/5946124/being_there|title=Being There (review)|publisher=Rolling Stone|date=October 24, 1996|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070619094452/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/wilco/albums/album/240156/review/5946124/being_there |archivedate = June 19, 2007|deadurl=yes}} Last accessed July 11, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The album reached #73 on the ''Billboard'' album charts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The ''Billboard'' 200|publisher=Billboard|date=November 16, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; a significant improvement from ''A.M.'', and placed fourteenth on the Pazz &amp; Jop Critics Poll for 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/pnj/pjres96.php|title=The 1996 Pazz &amp; Jop Critics Poll|publisher=The Village Voice}} Last accessed July 11, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Summerteeth'' and the ''Mermaid Avenue'' sessions ===
In November 1997, Wilco entered [[Willie Nelson]]'s recording studio in [[Spicewood]], [[Texas]] to record a third studio album.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kot-2004&quot;&gt;Kot 2004. p. 138&lt;/ref&gt; The album was lyrically inspired by the marital problems of Tweedy and his wife, as well as by twentieth-century [[literature]].&lt;ref&gt;Kot 2004. p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; Tweedy relied heavily on Bennett to provide music for the singer's &quot;bold, but depressing&quot; lyrics.&lt;ref&gt;Kot 2004. p. 140–1&lt;/ref&gt; Wilco recorded several songs, including &quot;Via Chicago&quot; and &quot;She's a Jar,&quot; but began working on another project before assembling the tracks into an album.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kot-2004&quot;/&gt;
[[Image:Woody Guthrie 2.jpg|left|thumb|The two ''Mermaid Avenue'' albums consisted of recordings of unreleased [[Woody Guthrie]] (''pictured'') songs.]]
[[Nora Guthrie]] contacted singer-songwriter [[Billy Bragg]] in spring 1995 about recording some unreleased songs by her father, folk singer [[Woody Guthrie]]. Most of the songs were written late in Guthrie's life when he was unable to record due to the motor impairments of [[Huntington's disease]]. By the 1990s, Woody Guthrie had become a &quot;relic&quot; to the [[MTV generation]], and Nora sought to establish a different legacy for the musician. To Nora, Bragg was &quot;the only singer I knew taking on the same issues as Woody.&quot; Bragg was concerned, however, that his fans would not realize that the songs were written by Guthrie when he performed them on tour, so he decided to record the album with another band.&lt;ref&gt;Kot 2004. p. 143&lt;/ref&gt;

Bragg contacted Tweedy and Bennett about co-recording the album while Wilco was on the European segment of their ''Being There'' tour. Bragg was particularly fond of ''Being There'' because their influences extended farther back than the 1950s. Although Tweedy was indifferent to the offer, Bennett was enthused about recording songs of one of his idols—Bennett's previous band [[Titanic Love Affair]] was named after a Billy Bragg lyric. A recording contract between Bragg and Wilco was signed after a show at [[Shepherd's Bush Empire]]. Bragg mostly recorded the politically charged lyrics, while Tweedy preferred to record lyrics that showcased Guthrie as a &quot;freak weirdo&quot;. The recording of ''[[Mermaid Avenue]]'' began on December 12, 1997, and was the topic of [[BBC]]'s ''[[Man in the Sand]]'' documentary film.&lt;ref&gt;Kot 2004. p. 144–5&lt;/ref&gt;

Tempers flared between Bragg and Wilco after the album was completed. Bennett believed that Bragg was overproducing his songs, a sharp contrast to Wilco's sparser contributions. Bennett called Bragg about the possibility of remixing Bragg's songs, to which Bragg responded &quot;you make your record, and I'll make mine, fucker.&quot; Eventually Bragg sent copies of his recordings to Chicago for Bennett to remix, but Bragg refused to use the new mixes on the album. The two parties were unable to establish a promotional tour and quarreled over royalties and guest musician fees.

Despite these conflicts, the album was released on June 23, 1998, and sold over 277,000 copies.&lt;ref&gt;Kot 2004. p. 151–3&lt;/ref&gt; The album received rave reviews from Robert Christgau and ''Rolling Stone'', and was nominated for a [[Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Folk Album]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Marcus|first=Greil|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/wilco/albums/album/225606/review/6213088/mermaid_avenue|title=Mermaid Avenue (review)|publisher=Rolling Stone|date=June 1, 1998|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071002102709/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/wilco/albums/album/225606/review/6213088/mermaid_avenue |archivedate = October 2, 2007|deadurl=yes}} Last accessed July 14, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Christgau|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Christgau|url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/get_artist.php?id=2579&amp;name=Billy+Bragg+%26+Wilco|title=CG: Billy Bragg &amp; Wilco|publisher=robertchristgau.com}} Last accessed July 14, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; It also placed fourth on the Pazz &amp; Jop critics poll for 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/pnj/pjres98.php|title=The 1998 Pazz &amp; Jop Critics Poll|publisher=The Village Voice}} Last accessed July 14, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; After the album was released, Bob Egan was replaced by multi-instrumentalist [[Leroy Bach]].&lt;ref&gt;Kot 2004. p. 169&lt;/ref&gt;

After the completion of the ''Mermaid Avenue'' sessions, Wilco returned to Spicewood to complete their third studio album, ''[[Summerteeth]]''. Unlike previous Wilco and Uncle Tupelo recordings, the album featured a lot of overdubbing with [[Pro Tools]].&lt;ref&gt;Kot 2004. p. 154–5&lt;/ref&gt; Stirratt and Coomer were concerned with the production, since it reduced their involvement in the music. According to Stirratt:&lt;ref&gt;Kot 2004. p. 158&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The story of ''Summerteeth'' is Jay bought a [[Mellotron]] and he was going to use it, no matter what. It was lovely, but it was overdone. Once they got going on the overdubs, they didn't stop. And nobody in the band stepped up to stop the madness ... It reminds me of ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'', where you knowingly extend the creative process for the purpose of exploration or redemption, or whatever it is you're looking for.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During 1999, Warner Brothers was looking to help repay a $16 billion debt acquired during the recent merger of parent company Warner Communications with [[Time Inc.]].&lt;ref&gt;Kot 2004. p. 161&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Warner's [[imprint]]s were under pressure to produce musical acts that would yield hit records. The head of Reprise, [[Howie Klein]], who had previously authorized the release of ''Being There'' as a double album, was willing to let Wilco produce ''Summerteeth'' without label input. When Klein played the album for Reprise's A&amp;R department, however, they demanded a radio single for the album. Wilco agreed to do this &quot;once and once only&quot; and recorded a radio-friendly version of &quot;Can't Stand It&quot; at the request of [[David Kahne]], the head of the A&amp;R department.&lt;ref&gt;Kot 2004. p. 162–5&lt;/ref&gt; The single version of &quot;Can't Stand It&quot; failed to cross over from [[Adult album alternative|Triple-A]] radio to alternative rock stations. Consequently, the album sold only 200,000 copies, significantly less than ''Being There''.&lt;ref&gt;Kot 2004. p. 167&lt;/ref&gt; This was despite critical acclaim; the album placed eighth on the Pazz &amp; Jop critics' poll for 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/pnj/pjres99.php|title=The 1999 Pazz &amp; Jop Critics Poll|publisher=The Village Voice}} Last accessed July 15, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the release of ''[[Summerteeth]]'', the band resumed the ''Mermaid Avenue'' sessions. Although they had recorded enough material for a second release in 1998, Wilco recorded a few new songs for ''[[Mermaid Avenue Vol. II]]''. &quot;Someday Some Morning Sometime,&quot; featuring a [[vibraphone]] filtered through a [[space echo]], was identified by Tweedy as being the &quot;piece to the puzzle&quot; towards the creation of their fourth studio album. The album was released on May 30, 2000, and was the last release from the sessions.&lt;ref&gt;Kot 2004. p. 175&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Yankee Hotel Foxtrot'' ===

{{Listen|filename=I Am Trying to Break Your Heart.ogg|title=&quot;I Am Trying to Break Your Heart&quot;|description=The first track from ''Yankee Hotel Foxtrot'', this song featured an intro on bells composed by Glenn Kotche.|format=[[Ogg]]}}
Shortly after the recording sessions for ''Mermaid Avenue Vol. II'', Wilco purchased a studio on Irving Park Road in Chicago, which they named the Wilco Loft.&lt;ref&gt;Kot 2004. p. 168&lt;/ref&gt; The band recorded some tracks in the studio in early 2000 for a fourth studio album. In May 2000, Jeff Tweedy requested to perform with [[Jim O'Rourke (musician)|Jim O'Rourke]] at a festival in Chicago; Tweedy was a fan of O'Rourke's ''[[Bad Timing (album)|Bad Timing]]''. O'Rourke introduced Tweedy to drummer [[Glenn Kotche]], and the trio enjoyed working together so much that they decided to record an album as a side project named [[Loose Fur]].&lt;ref&gt;Kot 2004. p. 177–9&lt;/ref&gt; Wilco had recorded an entire album of music at this point, but Tweedy was unhappy with the drum parts. He enjoyed Kotche's contributions to Loose Fur so much that Tweedy brought him into the studio to re-record some demos. Some believe that Tweedy sought to make Wilco sound like Loose Fur after officially replacing Ken Coomer with Kotche in January 2001.&lt;ref&gt;Kot 2004. p. 186–8&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Bennett sought to act as both mixer and engineer for ''[[Yankee Hotel Foxtrot]]'', Tweedy was unsure of Bennett's abilities against those of O'Rourke. Tweedy and Bennett frequently argued over whether the album should be accessible to a general listener, or attempt to cover new musical ground.&lt;ref&gt;Kot 2004. p. 195–6&lt;/ref&gt; Unbeknownst to Bennett, Tweedy invited O'Rourke to remix &quot;I Am Trying to Break Your Heart&quot;, and the results impressed the other band members—even Bennett. Tensions grew between Bennett and O'Rourke because Bennett wanted to mix every song on the album. O'Rourke cut the contributions of other members on several of the songs; some songs, such as &quot;Poor Places&quot;, only featured the Loose Fur trio.&lt;ref&gt;Kot 2004. p. 198–9&lt;/ref&gt; The album was completed in 2001, and Bennett was dismissed from the band immediately afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fricke|first=David|title=In from the Cold|publisher=''[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]''|date=May 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The recording of the album was documented by [[Sam Jones (filmmaker)|Sam Jones]] and released in 2002 as the film ''[[I Am Trying to Break Your Heart: A Film About Wilco]]''.

Time Warner, which owned Warner Bros. Records, merged with [[America Online]] in 2001, leading to more pressure on Warner's record labels to cut costs. Over 600 employees of Warner Music Group were fired, including Howie Klein, the president of Reprise Records. In absence of Klein, David Kahne became the interim head of Reprise.&lt;ref&gt;Kot 2004. p. 201&lt;/ref&gt; Kahne assigned Mio Vukovic to monitor the progress of ''Yankee Hotel Foxtrot'' and to offer suggestions. Music journalist Greg Kot claims that Vukovic disdained the album and was unhappy that Wilco ignored his suggestions.&lt;ref&gt;Kot 2004. p. 202&lt;/ref&gt; He brought the album to Kahne, who felt that there was no single on the album. In June 2001, the [[album]] was rejected by Reprise and Wilco was asked to leave the label.&lt;ref&gt;Kot 2004. p. 203&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilco managed to negotiate terms to a buy-out from Reprise.

While waiting for the commercial release of ''Yankee Hotel Foxtrot'', Wilco agreed to support [[R.E.M.]] collaborator [[Scott McCaughey]] for an album release by [[The Minus 5]].

[[Image:Wired Wilco.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Wilco at the [[Wired (magazine)|Wired Rave]] Awards in 2003]]
In November 2003, Wilco traveled to New York City to record their fifth album. The album was produced by Jim O'Rourke, who mixed ''Foxtrot'' and was a member of Wilco side project Loose Fur. Unlike ''Summerteeth'' and ''Yankee Hotel Foxtrot'', ''[[A Ghost Is Born]]'' featured songs that were created with Pro Tools before ever performing them live.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kot3&quot;&gt;Kot 2004. p. 240–1&lt;/ref&gt; The album featured the song &quot;Less Than You Think&quot;, which included a fifteen-minute track of electronic noises and synthesizers, which Tweedy called &quot;the track that everyone will hate&quot;. Tweedy justified the inclusion of the song:&lt;ref name=&quot;Kot3&quot;/&gt;

{{quote|I know ninety-nine percent of our fans won't like that song, they'll say it's a ridiculous indulgence. Even I don't want to listen to it every time I play through the album. But the times I do calm myself down and pay attention to it, I think it's valuable and moving and cathartic. I wouldn't have put it on the record if I didn't think it was great ... I wanted to make an album about identity, and within that is the idea of a higher power, the idea of randomness, and that anything can happen, and that we can't control it.}}

Leroy Bach left the band immediately after the album's completion to join a music theatre operation in Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pouncey|first=Edwin|title=Free the Spirit|publisher=''[[The Wire (magazine)|The Wire]]''|date=August 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like ''Yankee Hotel Foxtrot'', Wilco streamed the album online before its commercial release.

=== ''Sky Blue Sky'' ===
Wilco returned to their loft in Chicago to record a sixth studio album in 2006. Influenced by [[The Byrds]] and [[Fairport Convention]], the band considered ''[[Sky Blue Sky]]'' to be less experimental than previous releases.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cohen&quot;/&gt; Also unlike previous albums, the songs were created as collaborations.

Wilco streamed the album online on March 3, 2007, and offered the song &quot;What Light&quot; as a free MP3 download.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Crock|first=Jason|url=http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/feature/42415-interview-wilco|title=Interview: Wilco|publisher=Pitchfork Media|date=May 7, 2007}} Last accessed July 16, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; To further publicize the album, Wilco licensed several songs from the ''Sky Blue Sky'' recording sessions for use in a [[Volkswagen]] advertising campaign.

Reviewer James Brubaker states that Wilco &quot;shine[s] on a handful of the songs&quot; on ''Sky Blue Sky'', such as the &quot;light, and straightforward&quot; songs. While he calls the album &quot;great traditional rock and folk album at times&quot;, he states that &quot;once you get past the handful of masterful and lovely performances... the rest of the record comes off at times as dull, and forced.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.30music.com/rev.php?mode=revrec&amp;rev=2030 |title= &quot;Sky Blue Sky&quot; (CD) |last=Brubaker |first=James |date=May 15, 2007 |work=30music.com }} Last accessed February 28, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''allaboutjazz'' review also had mixed comments.

Pabs Hernandez, a reviewer for ''Lost at Sea'' praised the album's &quot;breezy atmosphere and pacing,&quot; and noted that it is not &quot;easily judged upon first listen.&quot; Overall, Hernandez stated that it &quot;may be no masterpiece, but at worst it's a more than worthy entry into Wilco's laudable catalogue.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lostatsea.net/review.phtml?id=12361925304652f9100a2f1 |title= Sky Blue Sky |last=Hernandez |first=Pablo |date=May 22, 2007 |work=Lost at Sea Magazine }} Last accessed February 28, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
Reviewer Greg Locke praised the record as &quot;one of the best albums of the year,&quot; calling it a &quot;timeless record, full of sweet, hopeful sophistication and class&quot; and &quot;a lean, mean, soulful album.&quot; Like Hernandez, Locke acknowledged that the album could not be properly judged just on the first listening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whatzup.com/Music/cd070507b.html |title= Sky Blue Sky Wilco |last=Locke |first=Greg |year=2007 |work=WhatzUp |publisher=Ad Media Inc. }} Last accessed February 28, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The NPR review also had a positive take on the record.

== Musical style and influence ==
[[Image:WilcoFIB.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Wilco performing in support of ''Sky Blue Sky'' at [[Festival Internacional de Benicàssim]] on July 20, 2007]]

Wilco's music is typically categorized as [[alternative rock]] and [[alternative country]]. Despite their career-long association with a major record label, they are generally associated with [[indie rock]].&lt;ref&gt;Ankeny, Jason &amp; Johnson, Zac. [{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p142015|pure_url=yes}} Wilco &gt; Overview]. Allmusic. Retrieved August 28, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Wilco draws influence from bands from a variety of musical genres, but primarily from music created between 1966 and 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Crock|first=Jason|url=http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/feature/42415-interview-wilco|title=Interview:Wilco|publisher=Pitchfork Media|date=May 7, 2007}} Last accessed July 23, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kot|first=Greg|url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/features/article/39168/back-to-basics-an-interview-with-wilco|title=Back to Basics: An Interview with Wilco|publisher=[[PopMatters]]|date=May 14, 2007}} Last accessed July 23, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Cale]]'s ''[[Paris 1919 (album)|Paris 1919]]'' was credited by the band as providing a musical parallel. According to Tweedy, &quot;It was eye-opening that I wasn't the only person that felt like these worlds had a lot more in common than they'd been given credit for—that experimentation and avant-garde theory was not directly opposed to beauty, y'know?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mulvey|first=John|title=Pet Sounds|publisher=''[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]]''|date=May 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other recording artists from that timespan appreciated by the band include [[John Lennon]], [[Neil Young]], and [[Brian Wilson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cashmere|first=Paul|url=http://www.undercover.com.au/idol/wilco2004.html|title=Wilco (interview)|publisher=undercover.com.au|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070622041454/http://www.undercover.com.au/idol/wilco2004.html |archivedate = June 22, 2007|deadurl=yes}} Last accessed July 23, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Green|first=Joshua|url=http://www.salon.com/ent/music/int/1999/03/17int.html|title=Been There|publisher=''[[Salon (magazine)|Salon]]''|date=March 17, 1999}} Last accessed July 23, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; For his thirty-fourth birthday, Tweedy received a private guitar lesson from [[Richard Lloyd (guitarist)|Richard Lloyd]] of [[Television (band)|Television]]; Tweedy was a big fan of the group and was particularly fond of the guitar work, which he wanted to incorporate into his music.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kot3&quot;/&gt; Uncle Tupelo was inspired by bands such as [[Jason &amp; the Scorchers]] and [[The Minutemen (band)|The Minutemen]], influencing the recording of Wilco's ''A.M.''.&lt;ref&gt;Kot 2004, p. 24–26&lt;/ref&gt; Tweedy and O'Rourke enjoyed [[free jazz]] artists such as [[Ornette Coleman]], [[Albert Ayler]], and [[Derek Bailey (guitarist)|Derek Bailey]]; they also listen to mainstream jazz by artists such as [[Miles Davis]] and [[John Coltrane]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kot|first=Greg|title=Pillar of Alt|publisher=[[Guitar World]] Acoustic|date=September 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Magnet&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Valania|first=Jonathan|title=Heroes and Villains|publisher=Magnet|date=June 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lyrical structure of Wilco's songs was dictated by classic literature and ''[[Exquisite corpse|cadavre exquis]]''—an exercise where band members take turns writing lines on a typewriter, but are only allowed to see the previously written line.&lt;ref name=&quot;Magnet&quot;/&gt; Among the books that the band has cited as being stylistically influential include [[William H.
