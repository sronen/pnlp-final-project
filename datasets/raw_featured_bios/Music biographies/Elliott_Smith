'''Steven Paul''' &quot;'''Elliott'''&quot; '''Smith''' (August 6, 1969&amp;nbsp;– October 21, 2003) was an American [[singer-songwriter]] and musician. Smith was born in [[Omaha, Nebraska|Omaha]], [[Nebraska]], raised primarily in [[Texas]], and resided for a significant portion of his life in [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], [[Oregon]], where he first gained popularity. His primary instrument was the guitar, but he was also proficient at piano, [[clarinet]], bass guitar, drums, and [[harmonica]]. Smith had a distinctive vocal style characterized by his &quot;whispery, spiderweb-thin delivery&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Huey, Steve | title= ''Elliott Smith'' review | publisher=[[Allmusic]] | url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r251314|pure_url=yes}} | accessdate=2009-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and use of [[Multitrack recording|multi-tracking]] to create vocal layers, textures, and [[harmony|harmonies]].

After playing in the [[rock music|rock]] band [[Heatmiser]] for several years, Smith began his solo career in 1994 with releases on the independent record labels [[Cavity Search Records|Cavity Search]] and [[Kill Rock Stars]]. In 1997 he signed a contract with [[DreamWorks Records]], for which he recorded two albums. Smith rose to mainstream prominence when his song &quot;[[Miss Misery (song)|Miss Misery]]&quot;—included in the soundtrack for the film ''[[Good Will Hunting]]''—was nominated for an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] in the [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]] category in 1998.

Smith suffered from [[clinical depression|depression]], [[alcoholism]], and [[drug addiction]], and these topics often appear in his lyrics. At age 34, he died in [[Los Angeles, California]] from two stab wounds to the chest.&lt;ref name=&quot;autopsy&quot;/&gt; The autopsy evidence was inconclusive as to whether the wounds were [[suicide|self-inflicted]].&lt;ref name=&quot;RSinconclusive&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author= Dansby, Andrew |title= Smith Autopsy Inconclusive&amp;nbsp;— Police keep investigation of singer-songwriter's death open | date=December 31, 2003 | publisher= Rolling Stone |url= http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/elliottsmith/articles/story/5936000/smith_autopsy_inconclusive |accessdate= 2007-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of his death, Smith was working on his sixth studio album, ''[[From a Basement on the Hill]]'', which was posthumously released.

==Early life==

Steven Paul Smith was born at the Clarkson Hospital in [[Omaha, Nebraska]], the only child to Gary Smith, a student at the [[University of Nebraska Medical Center]], and Bunny Kay Berryman, an elementary school music teacher. His parents divorced when he was six months old, and Smith moved with his mother to [[Duncanville, Texas]]. Much later in his life, Smith got a tattoo of a map of Texas on his upper arm and said, &quot;I didn't get it because I like Texas, kind of the opposite. But I won't forget about it, although I'm tempted to because I don't like it there.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Shuttp6&quot;&gt;Shutt, 2002. p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith endured a difficult childhood&lt;ref name = &quot;SPIN&quot;/&gt; and a troubled relationship with his stepfather Charlie Welch.&lt;ref name=&quot;ShuttP3&quot;/&gt; Later in life, Smith would come to believe that he had been [[child sexual abuse|sexually abused]] by Welch at a young age.&lt;ref name=&quot;spin2008&quot;&gt;''[[SPIN Magazine|SPIN]]'' article: &quot;[http://www.spin.com/blog/why-i-cant-listen-elliott-smiths-music Why I Can't Listen to Elliott Smith's Music]&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; He reflected the impact of this part of his life in the lyrics of &quot;Some Song&quot;: &quot;Charlie beat you up week after week, and when you grow up you're going to be a freak.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ShuttP3&quot;&gt;Shutt, 2002, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; The name &quot;Charlie&quot; also appeared in the lyrics for &quot;Flowers for Charlie&quot; and &quot;[[No Confidence Man]]&quot;. The family was a part of the [[Community of Christ]] through much of Smith's childhood,&lt;ref&gt;Nugent, Benjamin (2004). ''[[Elliott Smith and the Big Nothing]]''. Pages 12-14. Da Capo Press.&lt;/ref&gt; but eventually began attending services at a local [[Methodism|Methodist]] Church. Smith felt that going to church did little for him, except make him &quot;really scared of [[Hell]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Nugent, 2004, pp. 12–14&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2001 interview, he stated, &quot;I don't necessarily buy into any officially structured version of spirituality. But I have my own version of it&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;sweetadeline1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sweetadeline.net/bio2.html |title=sweet adeline &amp;#124; biography&amp;nbsp;— page 2 |publisher=Sweetadeline.net |date= |accessdate=2008-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the age of nine, Smith began playing the piano, and at 10 began learning guitar on a small [[Steel-string acoustic guitar|acoustic guitar]] bought for him by his father.&lt;ref name=&quot;UnderTheRadar2&quot;&gt;{{cite web | author= Kagler, Marcus and Redfern, Mark| year= 2003| title= Better Off Than Dead, Elliott Smith Comes Clean | publisher= ''[[Under the Radar (magazine)|Under the Radar]]'' | work= Bonus Material |url=http://www.undertheradarmag.com/issue4/elliottsmith.html | accessdate=2006-09-12 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060615125926/http://undertheradarmag.com/issue4/elliottsmith.html |archivedate = June 15, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this age he also composed an original piano piece, &quot;Fantasy&quot;, which won him a prize at an [[arts festival]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Shuttp2&quot;&gt;Shutt, 2002, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the people on his mother's side of the family were non-professional musicians; his grandfather was a [[Dixieland]] drummer and his grandmother sang in a [[glee club]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Shuttp2&quot;/&gt;

At 14, Smith moved from Texas to [[Portland, Oregon]], to live with his father, who was then working as a psychiatrist, along with his step-mother and two half sisters. It was around this time that Smith first began using drugs, including alcohol, with friends as well as experimenting with [[sound recording|recording]] for the first time, borrowing a [[Multitrack recording|four-track recorder]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Shuttp2&quot;/&gt; During high school, Smith played clarinet in the school band and also played guitar, piano and sang in the bands Stranger Than Fiction&lt;ref name=&quot;ShuttP3&quot;/&gt; and [[The Greenhouse (A Murder of Crows album)|A Murder of Crows]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = A Murder of Crows  | publisher = Sweet Adeline  | url =http://www.sweetadeline.net/amurderof.html | accessdate = 2007-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; billed as either Steven Smith or &quot;Johnny Panic&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;pushby&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author= Norvell, Forrest |title= Recorded Music: Elliott Smith, 1969-2003 |publisher= pushby.com |date= October 23, 2003 |url= http://www.pushby.com/forrest/arc/005521.html |accessdate= 2007-11-14 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061118211329/http://www.pushby.com/forrest/arc/005521.html |archivedate = November 18, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from [[Lincoln High School (Portland, Oregon)|Lincoln High School]] as a [[National Merit Scholarship Program|National Merit Scholar]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Shuttp4&quot;&gt;Shutt, 2002. p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduation, Smith began calling himself &quot;Elliott&quot;, saying that he thought &quot;Steve&quot; sounded too much like a &quot;[[jock (subculture)|jock]]&quot; name, and that &quot;Steven&quot; sounded &quot;too bookish&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shuttp4&quot;/&gt; According to friends, he had also used the pseudonym &quot;Elliott Stillwater-Rotter&quot; during his time in the band Murder of Crows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Peschek |first=David |title=Obituary: Elliott Smith |publisher=The Guardian |date=2003-10-24 |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/2003/oct/24/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries |accessdate=2008-12-14 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biographer S. R. Shutt speculates that it was either inspired by Elliott Avenue, a street that Smith had lived on in Portland, or that it was suggested by his then-girlfriend. A junior high acquaintance of Smith speculates that it was so as not to be confused with [[Steve Smith (musician)|Steve Smith]], the drummer of [[Journey (band)|Journey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |author= Pittman, Mark |title= Memory Lane: Remembering Elliott Smith |publisher= Being There |month= February | year= 2005 |url= http://www.beingtheremag.com/content/0502/smith.html |accessdate= 2007-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===1991–1993: Heatmiser===
{{main|Heatmiser}}

Smith graduated from [[Hampshire College]] in [[Amherst, Massachusetts]], in 1991 with a [[academic degree|degree]] in philosophy and political science. &quot;Went straight through in four years,&quot; he explained to ''Under the Radar'' in 2003. &quot;I guess it proved to myself that I could do something I really didn't want to for four years. Except I did like what I was studying. At the time it seemed like, 'This is your one and only chance to go to college and you had just better do it because some day you might wish that you did.' Plus, the whole reason I applied in the first place was because of my girlfriend, and I had gotten accepted already even though we had broken up before the first day.&quot; After he graduated he &quot;worked in a bakery back in Portland with a [[Bachelor of Arts|bachelor’s degree]] in philosophy and [[legal theory]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;UnderTheRadar2&quot;/&gt;

While at Hampshire, Smith formed the band [[Heatmiser]] with classmate [[Neil Gust]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ShuttP5&quot;&gt;Shutt, 2002, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; After graduating from Hampshire, the band added drummer [[Tony Lash]] and bassist [[Brandt Peterson]] and began performing around Portland in 1992. The group released the albums ''[[Dead Air (Heatmiser album)|Dead Air]]'' (1993) and ''[[Cop and Speeder]]'' (1994) as well as the ''[[Yellow No. 5 (Heatmiser E.P.)|Yellow No. 5]]'' EP (1994) on [[Frontier Records]], and were then signed to [[Virgin Records]] to release what became their final album, ''[[Mic City Sons]]'' (1996).

Around this time, Smith and Gust worked a number of odd jobs around Portland, including installing [[drywall]], spreading gravel, transplanting bamboo trees and painting the roof of a warehouse with heat reflective paint. The pair were also on unemployment, which they considered an &quot;artist grant&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;UnderTheRadar&quot;&gt;{{cite web | author= ''Under the Radar'' magazine | year= 2003| title=Better Off Than Dead, Elliott Smith Comes Clean | work= | url=http://www.undertheradarmag.com/es.html | accessdate=2006-04-18 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060408160745/http://undertheradarmag.com/es.html |archivedate = April 8, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith had begun his solo career while still in Heatmiser, and the success of his first two releases created distance and tension with his band.&lt;ref name=&quot;UnderTheRadar&quot;/&gt; Heatmiser disbanded prior to ''Mic City Sons''' release, prompting Virgin to put the album out inauspiciously through its independent arm, [[Caroline Records]]. A clause in Heatmiser's [[record contract]] with Virgin meant that Smith was still bound to it as an individual. The contract was later bought-out by DreamWorks prior to the release of his album, ''[[XO (album)|XO]]''.

===1994: ''Roman Candle''===

|format=[[Ogg]]}}
His first release, ''[[Roman Candle (album)|Roman Candle]]'' (1994), came about when Smith's girlfriend at the time convinced him to send a tape of &quot;the most recent eight songs that [he’d] recorded on borrowed [[Multitrack recording|four-tracks]] and borrowed guitar&quot; to [[Cavity Search Records]].&lt;ref name=&quot;UnderTheRadar&quot;/&gt; Owner Christopher Cooper immediately requested to release the entire album of songs, which surprised Smith, as he was only expecting a deal for a [[Gramophone record#Common formats|seven-inch record]].&lt;ref&gt;Shutt, 2002, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding the record, Smith said &quot;I thought my head would be chopped off immediately when it came out because at the time it was so opposite to the [[grunge]] thing that was popular... The thing is that album was really well-received, which was a total shock, and it immediately eclipsed [Heatmiser] unfortunately.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;UnderTheRadar&quot;/&gt;

Smith felt his solo songs were not representative of the music Heatmiser was making: &quot;The idea of playing [my music] for people didn't occur to me... because at the time it was the [[American Northwest|Northwest]]—[[Mudhoney]] and [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]—and going out to play an acoustic show was like crawling out on a limb and begging for it to be sawed off.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |author= Matthew Fritch |title= Down on the Upside |publisher= Magnet Magazine |date= September/October 1998 |url= http://www.sweetadeline.net/down.html  |accessdate= 2008-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The instrumentation of the recordings was primarily [[Steel-string acoustic guitar|acoustic guitar]], occasionally accompanied by brief electric guitar [[riff]]s or a small drum set played with [[Drum brush|brushes]]. Only the final track, an instrumental titled &quot;Kiwi Maddog 20/20&quot; (a reference to the [[low-end fortified wine]]), had full band instrumentation.

One of Smith's first solo performances was at the now-defunct Umbra Penumbra on September 17, 1994. Only three songs from ''Roman Candle'' were performed, with the majority of the ten-song set being [[B-side]]s, Heatmiser tunes, and unreleased tracks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=1994-09-17 - Umbra Penumbra&amp;nbsp;— Portland, Oregon |publisher= SomeSongs: An Elliott Smith live music resource |url= http://www.somesongs.net/showtemplate.php?1994-09-17 | accessdate=2006-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after this performance, he was asked to open for [[Mary Lou Lord]] on a week-long U.S. tour. Several more short tours followed, and Smith helped her record one of his songs &quot;I Figured You Out&quot;, which he once called &quot;a stupid pop song [written] in about a minute&quot; that he discarded for sounding &quot;like the fucking [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://youtube.com/watch?v=EbtzSEepz28 Live performance] (1997) at Stinkweeds in [[Tempe, Arizona]].&lt;/ref&gt;

|format=[[Ogg]]}}
In 1995, Smith's [[Elliott Smith (album)|self-titled album]] was released on [[Kill Rock Stars]]; the record featured a similar style of recording to ''Roman Candle'', but with hints of growth and experimentation. Though the majority of the album was recorded by Smith alone, friend and [[The Spinanes]] vocalist Rebecca Gates sang harmony vocals on &quot;St. Ides Heaven&quot;, and Heatmiser guitarist [[Neil Gust]] played guitar on &quot;Single File&quot;. Several songs made reference to drugs, but Smith explained that he used the theme of drugs as a vehicle for conveying dependence rather than the songs being about drugs specifically.&lt;ref name=&quot;ShuttP7&quot;&gt;Shutt, 2002, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; Looking back, Smith felt that the album's pervasive mood gave him &quot;a reputation for being a really dark, [[depression (mood)|depressed]] person,&quot; and said that he later made a conscious move toward more diverse moods in his music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= Peisner, David |title= Elliott Smith&amp;nbsp;— The Well Rounded Interview |url= http://www.well-rounded.com/music/reviews/elliottsmith_intv.html |publisher= Well Rounded Entertainment |accessdate= 2007-12-29 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071219020007/http://www.well-rounded.com/music/reviews/elliottsmith_intv.html |archivedate = December 19, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Elliott Smith live 1997.jpg|thumb|left|Elliott Smith performing live in New York City, 1997.]]
In 1996, filmmaker [[Jem Cohen]] recorded Smith playing acoustic songs for the short film ''[[Lucky Three|Lucky Three: An Elliott Smith Portrait]]''. Two of these songs would appear on his next album, ''[[Either/Or (album)|Either/Or]]'', which was another Kill Rock Stars release. ''Either/Or'' came out in 1997 to favorable reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.acclaimedmusic.net/Current/A1020.htm | title=Acclaimed Music: Either/Or. | accessdate=2007-12-29| publisher=Acclaimed Music}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The album found Smith venturing further into full instrumentation, with several songs containing [[bass guitar]], [[drum kit|drums]], [[keyboard instrument|keyboards]], and electric guitars, all played by Smith. The album title was derived from the two-volume [[Either/Or|book of the same name]] by [[Denmark|Danish]] philosopher [[Søren Kierkegaard]], whose works generally deal with themes such as [[existential despair]], [[angst]], death, and [[God]].

By this time, Smith's already-heavy drinking was now being compounded with use of [[anti-depressants]].&lt;ref name=&quot;mtv2003&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author= D'Angelo, Joe and Perez, Rodrigo |title= One Of Us Is On The Moon |publisher= [[MTV News]] |date= 2003-10-29 |url= http://www.mtv.com/bands/s/smith_elliott/news_feature_102903/ |accessdate= 2006-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the ''Either/Or'' tour, some of his close friends staged an [[intervention (counseling)|intervention]] in [[Chicago]],&lt;ref name=&quot;mtv2003&quot;/&gt; but it proved ineffective.&lt;ref name=&quot;SPIN&quot;/&gt; Shortly after, he relocated from Portland to [[Brooklyn]].&lt;ref name=phoenix /&gt;

===1997–1998: &quot;Miss Misery&quot; and the Oscars===
In 1996, Smith was tapped by director and fellow Portland resident [[Gus Van Sant]] to be a part of the soundtrack to his film, ''[[Good Will Hunting]]''. Smith recorded an orchestral version of &quot;Between the Bars&quot; with composer [[Danny Elfman]] for the movie. Smith also contributed a new song, &quot;Miss Misery,&quot; and three previously-released tracks (&quot;No Name #3&quot;, from ''[[Roman Candle (album)|Roman Candle]]'', and &quot;Angeles&quot; and &quot;Say Yes&quot;,  from ''[[Either/Or (album)|Either/Or]]''). The film was a commercial and critical success, and Smith was nominated for an [[Academy Award]] for &quot;Miss Misery&quot;. Not eager to step into the limelight, he only agreed to perform the song at the ceremony after the producers informed him that his song would be played live that night—either by him or another musician of their choosing.&lt;ref name=&quot;UnderTheRadar&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author= Kagler, Marcus and Redfern, Mark |year= 2003| title=Better Off Than Dead, Elliott Smith Comes Clean |publisher= ''[[Under the Radar (magazine)|Under the Radar]]'' | url=http://www.undertheradarmag.com/es.html | accessdate=2007-10-14 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071009021050/http://www.undertheradarmag.com/es.html |archivedate = October 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Elliottsmithoscars.jpg|thumb|right|Elliott Smith performing &quot;[[Miss Misery (song)|Miss Misery&quot;]] at the [[70th Academy Awards|1998 Academy Awards]].]]
On March 5, 1998, Smith made his [[network television]] debut on ''[[Late Night With Conan O'Brien]]'' performing &quot;Miss Misery&quot; solo on acoustic guitar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Late Night with Conan O'Brien&amp;nbsp;— Episode Guide| work=Season 5, Episode 903 - Credited as &quot;Elliot Smith&quot; | url=http://www.nbc.com/Late_Night_with_Conan_O'Brien/episode_guide/160.shtml | publisher= NBC.com |accessdate=2006-04-23}}{{dead link|date=April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few days later, wearing a white suit, he played an abridged version of the song at the Oscars, accompanied by the house [[orchestra]]. [[James Horner]] and [[Will Jennings]] won the award that night for best song with &quot;[[My Heart Will Go On]]&quot; (sung by [[Celine Dion]]) from the film ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]''. Smith did not voice disappointment about not winning the award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= Garcia, Gilberta |title= Back to Earth |date= October 12, 2000 |publisher= [[Phoenix New Times]] |url= http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/Issues/2000-10-12/music/music.html |accessdate= 2007-12-26 |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071013115832/http://phoenixnewtimes.com/Issues/2000-10-12/music/music.html &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt; |archivedate= 2007-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith commented on the [[surrealism]] of the [[Oscars]] experience: &quot;That's exactly what it was, surreal... I enjoy performing almost as much as I enjoy making up songs in the first place. But the Oscars was a very strange show, where the set was only one song cut down to less than two minutes, and the audience was a lot of people who didn't come to hear me play. I wouldn't want to live in that world, but it was fun to walk around on the moon for a day.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;bostonglobe&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last = Anderman | first = Joan | title = Tunesmith To The Miserable But Don't Mistake His Characters For Him, Says Elliott Smith | work = (Fee required) | publisher = The Boston Globe | date = March 26, 1999 | url = http://nl.newsbank.com/cgi-bin/ngate/BG?ext_docid=0EADDD9A00EC0029&amp;ext_hed=TUNESMITH%20TO%20THE%20MISERABLE%20BUT%20DON'T%20MISTAKE%20HIS%20CHARACTERS%20FOR%20HIM,%20SAYS%20ELLIOTT%20SMITH&amp;ext_theme=bg&amp;pubcode=BG | accessdate = 2007-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1998–2000: ''XO'' and ''Figure 8''===
In 1998, after the success of ''[[Either/Or (album)|Either/Or]]'' and &quot;Miss Misery&quot;, Smith signed to a bigger record label, [[DreamWorks Records]]. Around the same time, Smith fell into [[clinical depression|depression]], speaking openly of considering suicide,&lt;ref name=&quot;mtv2003&quot;/&gt; and on at least one occasion&lt;ref name=&quot;SPIN&quot;&gt;{{Cite news

He landed on a tree, which badly impaled him but broke his fall.&lt;ref name=&quot;SPIN&quot;/&gt; When questioned about his suicide attempt, he told an interviewer, &quot;Yeah, I jumped off a cliff, but let's talk about something else.&quot;&lt;ref name=phoenix&gt;''[[Phoenix New Times]]'' article: &quot;[http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/2003-10-30/music/xo-elliott/ XO, Elliott].&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Christopher Cooper, head of Cavity Search Records (which released ''Roman Candle''), said about this time in Smith's life: &quot;I talked him out of thinking that he wanted to kill himself numerous times when he was in [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]]. I kept telling him that he was a brilliant man, and that life was worth living, and that people loved him.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;mtv2003&quot;/&gt; Pete Krebs also agreed: &quot;In Portland we got the brunt of Elliott's initial depression... Lots of people have stories of their own experiences of staying up with Elliott 'til five in the morning, holding his hand, telling him not to kill himself.&quot;&lt;ref name=phoenix /&gt;

Smith's first release for DreamWorks was later that year. Titled ''[[XO (album)|XO]]'', it was conceived and developed while Smith wrote it out over the winter of 1998, night after night seated at the bar in Luna Lounge, it was produced by the team of [[Rob Schnapf]] and [[Tom Rothrock]]. ''XO'' also contained some instrumentation from Los Angeles musicians [[Joey Waronker]] and [[Jon Brion]]. It contained a more full-sounding, [[baroque pop]] sound than any of his previous efforts, with songs featuring a horn section, [[Chamberlin (music)|Chamberlin]]s, elaborate [[string instrument|string]] [[arrangement]]s, and even a [[Music loop|drum loop]] on the song &quot;Independence Day&quot;. His familiar double-tracked vocal and acoustic guitar style were still apparent while his somewhat personal lyrical style survived.  The song &quot;Waltz #2&quot; even touches upon the abusive tendencies of his stepfather toward himself and his mother with lines like &quot;XO, mom, it's ok, it's alright, nothing's wrong.&quot;The album went on to peak at number 104 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Elliott Smith - ''XO'' |publisher = ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' |url= http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/discography/index.jsp?pid=172041&amp;aid=319805 |accessdate= 2007-05-18 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070929204410/http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/discography/index.jsp?pid=172041&amp;aid=319805 |archivedate = September 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and number 123 on the [[UK Album Charts]],&lt;ref name=&quot;zobbel1994&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zobbel.de/cluk/CLUK_S.HTM |title=UK Album Chart History 1994-2006 |publisher=Zobbel.de |date= |accessdate=2008-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; while selling 400,000 copies&lt;ref name=&quot;mysteriousdeath&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title= The mysterious death of Mr Misery |publisher= The Guardian |date= March 19, 2004 |url= http://arts.guardian.co.uk/fridayreview/story/0,12102,1172275,00.html |accessdate= 2007-12-26 | location=London | first=Alexis | last=Petridis}}&lt;/ref&gt; (more than double that of each of his two Kill Rock Stars releases), becoming the best-selling release of his career.&lt;ref&gt;Nugent, 2004, p. 201&lt;/ref&gt; Smith's backing band during most of this period was the Portland-based group [[Quasi]], consisting of former bandmate Sam Coomes on bass guitar and Coomes's ex-wife [[Janet Weiss]] on drums.

[[List of Saturday Night Live hosts and musical guests#Season 24|On October 17, 1998]], Smith appeared on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' and performed &quot;Waltz #2.&quot; His backing band for this appearance was [[John Moen]], [[Jon Brion]], [[Rob Schnapf]], and Sam Coomes.

In response to whether the change to a bigger record label would influence his creative control, Smith said, &quot;[S]ometimes people look at major labels as simply money-making machines, they're actually composed of individuals who are real people, and there's a part of them that needs to feel that part of their job is to put out good music.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= Dansby, Andrew |title= Smith Comes Up Roses |date= April 22, 2000 | publisher=Rolling Stone |url= http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/elliottsmith/articles/story/5924200/smith_comes_up_roses |accessdate= 2007-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith also claimed in another interview that he never read his reviews for fear that they would interfere with his songwriting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= Allen, Jamie |title= Elliott Smith keeps moving |date= May 17, 2000 |publisher= CNN |url= http://archives.cnn.com/2000/SHOWBIZ/Music/05/17/elliott.smith/ |accessdate= 2007-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith relocated from Brooklyn to Los Angeles in 1999,&lt;ref name=phoenix /&gt; taking up residence at a cabin in the [[Silver Lake, Los Angeles, California|Silver Lake]] section of town.&lt;ref name=&quot;blenderdec03&quot;&gt;''[[Blender Magazine|Blender]]'' article: &quot;[http://www.blender.com/guide/67340/long-slow-death-elliott-smith.html The Long Slow Death of Elliott Smith]&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; That fall, his cover of [[The Beatles]]' &quot;Because&quot; was featured in the end credits of DreamWorks' Oscar-winning drama [[American Beauty (film)|''American Beauty'']], and also appeared on the film's soundtrack album.

The final album Smith completed in his lifetime, ''[[Figure 8 (album)|Figure 8]]'', was released on April 18, 2000. It featured the return of Rothrock, Schnapf, Brion, and Waronker, and was partially recorded at [[Abbey Road Studios]] in England, with an obvious Beatles influence in the songwriting and production. The album garnered very favorable reviews,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Elliott Smith: Figure 8 (2000): Reviews |publisher= [[Metacritic]] |work= &quot;Universal acclaim&quot; metascore of 81/100 |url= http://www.metacritic.com/music/artists/smithelliott/figure8?q=figure%208 |accessdate= 2007-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; peaking at number 99 on the ''Billboard'' 200&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Elliott Smith - ''Figure 8'' |publisher = ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' | url = http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/discography/index.jsp?pid=172041&amp;aid=418165 |accessdate = 2007-05-18 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070929160210/http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/discography/index.jsp?pid=172041&amp;aid=418165 |archivedate = September 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 37 on the UK Album Charts.&lt;ref name=&quot;zobbel1994&quot;/&gt; The album garnered praise for its [[power pop]] style and complex arrangements, described as creating a &quot;sweeping kaleidoscope of layered instruments and sonic textures.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;AMGfigure8&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author= Huey, Steve |title= ''Figure 8'' review |publisher= [[Allmusic]] |url= {{Allmusic|class=album|id=r471955|pure_url=yes}} |accessdate= 2006-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some reviewers felt that Smith's trademark dark and [[melancholy]] songwriting had lost some of its subtlety, with one reviewer likening some of the lyrics to &quot;the self-pitying complaints of an adolescent venting in his diary.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Smith, Ethan |date=April 17, 2000 |title= Möbius Smith |publisher= [[New York Magazine]] |url=http://nymag.com/nymetro/arts/music/pop/reviews/2847/ |accessdate=2007-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Album art and promotional pictures from the period showed Smith looking cleaned-up and put-together. An extensive tour in promotion of the record ensued, bookended by television appearances on ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'' and ''[[The Late Show with David Letterman]]''. However, Smith's condition began to deteriorate as he had become addicted to heroin either towards the end of or just after the ''Figure 8'' tour.&lt;ref name=&quot;SPIN&quot; /&gt;

===2001–2002: Addiction and scrapped recordings===
[[File:Elliott Smith live NYC.jpg|thumb|Smith performing in New York City in 2003]]
Around the time he began recording his final album, Smith began to display signs of [[paranoia]], often believing that a white van followed him wherever he went.&lt;ref&gt;Nugent, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; He would have friends drop him off for recording sessions almost a mile away from the studio, and to reach the location he would trudge through hundreds of yards of brush and cliffs. He started telling people that [[DreamWorks]] was out to get him: &quot;Not long ago my house was broken into, and songs were stolen off my computer which have wound up in the hands of certain people who work at a certain label. I've also been followed around for months at a time. I wouldn't even want to necessarily say it's the people from that label who are following me around, but it was probably them who broke into my house.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;UnderTheRadar&quot; /&gt; During this period, Smith hardly ate, subsisting primarily on ice cream. He would go for several days without sleeping, and then sleep for an entire day.

A follow-up to Smith's 2000 album was originally planned to happen with [[Rob Schnapf]], but their sessions were abandoned. Smith also began distancing himself from manager Margaret Mittleman, who had handled him since the ''Roman Candle'' days.&lt;ref name=&quot;SPIN&quot; /&gt; He finally began recording a new album with only himself and [[Jon Brion]] as producers sometime during 2001. The pair had recorded a substantial amount of music for the album, when Brion confronted Smith about his [[drug abuse|drug]] and [[alcoholism|alcohol abuse]].&lt;ref name=&quot;basement2&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author= Weaver, Jordan |title= Elliott Smith Lives Again! From a Basement on the Hill V.2 |url= http://www.confabulators.com/2005/elliott-smith-lives-again-from-a-basement-on-the-hill-v2 |publisher= The Confabulators |accessdate=2006-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their friendship promptly ended, and Smith scrapped all of their work up until that point. He later said: &quot;There was even a little more than half of a record done before this new one that I just scrapped because of a blown friendship with someone that made me so depressed I didn't want to hear any of those songs. He was just helping me record the songs and stuff, and then the friendship kind of fell apart all of a sudden one day. It just made it kind of awkward being alone in the car listening to the songs.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;UnderTheRadar&quot; /&gt;

When Brion sent a bill for the abandoned sessions to DreamWorks, executives [[Lenny Waronker]] and Luke Wood scheduled a meeting with Smith to determine what went wrong with the sessions. The singer voiced what he believed to be intrusion upon his personal life from the label, as well as poor promotion for the ''Figure 8'' album. The talks proved to be fruitless, and soon after, Smith sent a message to the executives, stating that if they did not release him from his contract, he would take his own life.&lt;ref name=&quot;SPIN&quot;/&gt; In May 2001, Smith set out to re-record the album, mostly on his own, but with some help from [[David McConnell]] of [[Goldenboy]]. McConnell told ''Spin'' that, during this time, Smith would smoke over $1,500 worth of heroin and [[crack cocaine|crack]] per day, would often talk about suicide, and on numerous occasions tried to give himself an overdose. [[Steven Drozd]] of [[The Flaming Lips]] and Scott McPherson played a few drum tracks, Sam Coomes contributed some bass guitar and backing vocals, but almost every other instrument was recorded by Smith.

One of the few highlights for Smith in 2001 was inclusion of his song &quot;[[Needle in the Hay]]&quot; in [[Wes Anderson]]'s dark comedy ''[[The Royal Tenenbaums]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[IMDB]] entry for ''[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0265666/ Royal Tenenbaums]&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;  The song plays during a [[suicide attempt]]. Smith was originally supposed to contribute a cover of The Beatles' &quot;[[Hey Jude]]&quot; for the film, but when he failed to do so in time, Anderson had to use [[Mutato Muzika|The Mutato Muzika Orchestra]]'s version of the track instead.&lt;ref name=&quot;www2004&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author= Miller, Nancy |title= &quot;Life Aquatic&quot; director reveals his muses |year= 2004 |publisher= [[Entertainment Weekly]] |url= http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1008489_2,00.html
 |accessdate= 2008-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anderson would later say that Smith &quot;was in a bad state&quot; at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;www2004&quot;/&gt;

Smith's live performances during 2001 and 2002 were infrequent, typically in the [[Pacific Northwest]] or Los Angeles. A review of his December 20, 2001, show at Portland's [[Crystal Ballroom (Portland, Oregon)|Crystal Ballroom]] stated concern over his appearance and performance: his hair was uncharacteristically greasy and long; his face was bearded and gaunt; and during his songs he exhibited alarming signs of &quot;memory-loss and butterfingers&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= WW Music Staff |title= Elliott Smith (1969–2003) |date= October 29, 2003 |publisher= [[Willamette Week]] |url= http://www.wweek.com/story.php?story=4489 |accessdate= 2007-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crowd would often have to shout out the lyrics (and in some cases, [[guitar chord]]s) when Smith could not think of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= Stoltz, Peter |title= Elliott Smith—San Francisco, CA  |date= December 17, 2001 |publisher= ''[[Magnet (magazine)|Magnet Magazine]]'' |url= http://www.magnetmagazine.com/live/livesmith.html |accessdate= 2007-12-26 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071013103320/http://magnetmagazine.com/live/livesmith.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first of only three concerts performed in 2002, Smith co-headlined [[Northwestern University]]'s A&amp;O Ball with [[Wilco]] on May 2 in [[Chicago]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= Murtaugh, Dan |title= A&amp;O Ball signs on a second headliner |date= May 2, 2002 |publisher= [[The Daily Northwestern]] |url= http://www.dailynorthwestern.com/media/storage/paper853/news/2002/05/02/Campus/Ao.Ball.Signs.On.A.Second.Headliner-1909814.shtml |accessdate= 2007-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was onstage for nearly an hour, but failed to complete a single song.&lt;ref name=&quot;spin2008&quot; /&gt; He claimed that his poor performance was due to his left [[Paresthesia|hand having fallen asleep]], and told the audience it felt &quot;like having stuff on your hand and you can't get it off.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;spin2008&quot; /&gt; Smith's performance was reviewed as &quot;undoubtedly one of the worst performances ever by a musician&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;NUcomment&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author= Winn, Luke |title= Did You Behave? |date= May 21, 2002 |publisher= NUcomment |url= http://www.nucomment.com/archive/issues/020521/features/wilco.html |accessdate= 2007-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an &quot;excruciating...nightmare&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= Dombal, Ryan |title= Shot in the arm |date= May 3, 2002 |publisher= [[The Daily Northwestern]] |url= http://www.dailynorthwestern.com/media/storage/paper853/news/2002/05/03/Campus/shot-In.The.Arm-1909849.shtml |accessdate= 2007-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; A reporter for the online magazine ''Glorious Noise'' made the statement, &quot;[I]t would not surprise me at all if Elliott Smith ends up dead within a year.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= Brown, Jake |title= Just Say Yes |date= May 3, 2002 |publisher= Glorious Noise |url= http://www.gloriousnoise.com/articles/2002/just_say_yes.php |accessdate= 2007-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 25, 2002, Smith was involved in a brawl with the [[Los Angeles Police Department]] at a Flaming Lips/[[Beck]] concert.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= Lang, Alison |title= Elliott Smith found dead at 34—Troubled musician struggled with fame and addiction |date= October 24, 2003 |publisher= [[The Queen's Journal]] |url= http://www.queensjournal.ca/articlephp/point-vol131/issue17/arts/story3 |accessdate= 2007-12-26 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071013142649/http://queensjournal.ca/articlephp/point-vol131/issue17/arts/story3 |archivedate = October 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith later said he was defending a man he thought the police were harassing. Assuming that Smith was [[homeless]], the officers allegedly beat and arrested him and his girlfriend, Jennifer Chiba. The two spent the night in jail. Smith's hand and back were injured in the incident, causing him to cancel a number of shows.&lt;ref name=&quot;UnderTheRadar&quot; /&gt; [[Wayne Coyne]], lead singer of The Flaming Lips and a friend of Smith's, stated concern over Smith's appearance and actions, saying that he &quot;saw a guy who had lost control of himself. He was needy, he was grumpy, he was everything you wouldn't want in a person. It's not like when you think of [[Keith Richards]] being pleasantly blissed out in the corner.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= Orshoski, Wes |title= Friends, Peers Mourn Elliott Smith |date= October 23, 2003 |publisher= ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' |url= http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=2008549 |accessdate= 2007-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2003: Reemergence and ''From a Basement on the Hill''===

Smith had attempted to go to [[Drug rehabilitation|rehab]] several times, but found that he was unable to relate to the popular treatments for addicts that use a [[Twelve-Step Program]] basis for treatment. &quot;I couldn't do the [[Twelve-step program|first step]]...I couldn't say what you were supposed to say and mean it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;UnderTheRadar&quot; /&gt; In 2002, Smith went to the Neurotransmitter Restoration Center in [[Beverly Hills]] to start a course of treatment for his [[drug addiction]]. In one of his final interviews, he spoke about the center, &quot;What they do is an [[intravenous drip|IV]] treatment where they put a [[Hypodermic needle|needle]] in your arm, and you're on a drip bag, but the only thing that's in the drip bag is [[amino acids]] and [[saline (medicine)|saline]] solution. I was coming off of a lot of psych meds and other things. I was even on an [[antipsychotic]], although I'm not [[psychotic]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;UnderTheRadar&quot; /&gt;

Two sold-out solo acoustic concerts at [[Hollywood]]'s Henry Fonda Theater, on January 31 and February 1, 2003 saw Smith attempting to reestablish his credibility as a live performer,&lt;ref name=&quot;mtvjan03&quot;&gt;[[MTV News]] article: &quot;[http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1459582/.jhtmlFor The Record: Quick News On Ashanti, Avril Lavigne, Nelly, JC Chasez, White Stripes, Biohazard &amp; More].&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; yielding mixed results. Before the show, Smith scrawled &quot;[[Kali|Kali&amp;nbsp;– The Destroyer]]&quot; (the [[Hindu]] goddess associated with time and change) in large block letters with [[permanent marker|permanent ink]] on his left arm, which was visible to the crowd during the performance.&lt;ref name=&quot;sajan03&quot;&gt;SweetAdeline.net article: &quot;[http://www.sweetadeline.net/jan03.html spaceland setlist, double album and info about 1.31.03 tickets].&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;sleepwalk1&quot;&gt;''[[LA Weekly]]'' article: &quot;[http://www.laweekly.com/2004-10-14/music/sleepwalker Sleepwalker - Elliott Smith’s unhappy dream life]&quot; - Page 1.&lt;/ref&gt; On several songs he was backed by a stripped-down drum kit played by Robin Peringer (of the band [[764-HERO]]), and on one track, members of opening band [[Rilo Kiley]] contributed backing vocals. Smith would play only one more concert in his adopted hometown, three months later at The Derby.

After his 34th birthday on August 6, 2003, he gave up alcohol, caffeine, red meat, refined sugar, and his longtime (sometimes abused) regimen of [[psychiatric medication]].&lt;ref name=&quot;SPIN&quot; /&gt; Director [[Mike Mills (director)|Mike Mills]] had been working with Smith during his final years and described Smith's troubles and apparent recovery: &quot;I gave the script to him, then he dropped off the face of the earth...he went through his whole crazy time, but by the time I was done with the film, he was making ''From a Basement on the Hill'' and I was shocked that he was actually making music.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Thumbsucker&quot;&gt;{{cite web | author=Perez, Rodrigo | year=2005| title= Elliott Smith, Polyphonics Bring Balance To 'Thumbsucker' Soundtrack |publisher= [[MTV News]] |url= http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1507697/20050816/smith_elliott.jhtml?headlines=true | accessdate=2006-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With things improving for Smith after several troubled years, he began experimenting with [[noise music]] and worked on his girlfriend Jennifer Chiba's [[iMac]] with the intent of learning how to record with computers, noting that it was the only method with which he was still unfamiliar.&lt;ref name=&quot;UnderTheRadar&quot;/&gt; Smith jokingly labeled his experimental way of recording &quot;The California Frown&quot; (a play on the [[Beach Boys]]' &quot;California Sound&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes&quot;&gt;{{cite news |author= Smith, RJ |title= Elliott Smith's Uneasy Afterlife | date=July 18, 2004 | publisher= The New York Times |url= http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&amp;res=9406E3DF163AF93BA25754C0A9629C8B63 |accessdate= 2006-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said of the songs, &quot;They're kind of more noisy with the [[pitch (music)|pitch]] all distorted. Some are more [[acoustic music|acoustic]], but there aren't too many like that. Lately I've just been making up a lot of noise.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;UnderTheRadar&quot;/&gt;

He was also in the process of recording songs for the [[Thumbsucker (soundtrack)|''Thumbsucker'' soundtrack]],&lt;ref&gt;The soundtrack was later completed by [[The Polyphonic Spree]].&lt;/ref&gt; including [[Big Star (band)|Big Star]]'s &quot;[[Thirteen (song)|Thirteen]]&quot;, and [[Cat Stevens]]' &quot;Trouble&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thumbsucker&quot;/&gt; In August 2003, [[Suicide Squeeze Records]] put out a limited-edition [[gramophone record|vinyl]] single for &quot;Pretty (Ugly Before)&quot;, a song that Smith had been playing since the ''Figure 8'' tour.

According to Chiba, the two were arguing,&lt;ref name=&quot;mysteriousdeath&quot;/&gt; and she locked herself in the bathroom to take a shower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogcritics.org/archives/2004/01/12/080503.php |title=Smith's Girlfriend Speaks |publisher=Blogcritics.org |date= |accessdate=2008-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chiba heard him scream, and upon opening the door, saw Smith standing with a knife in his chest. She pulled the knife out, after which he collapsed and she called [[9-1-1]]. Smith died in the hospital with the time of death listed as 1:36 p.m. A possible [[suicide note]], written on a [[Post-it note|Post-it]], read, &quot;I'm so sorry—love, Elliott. God forgive me.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;autopsy&quot;/&gt; The coroner's report had the name Elliott misspelled as &quot;Elliot,&quot; however &quot;a coroner's official told TSG that Smith's first name was misspelled in the report,&quot; not on the Post-it note.&lt;ref name=&quot;autopsy&quot;/&gt;

While Smith's death was originally reported as a [[suicide]], the official [[autopsy]] report released in December 2003 left open the question of possible [[homicide]].&lt;ref name=&quot;autopsy&quot;/&gt;

According to [[Pitchfork Media]], record producer [[Larry Crane (recording engineer)|Larry Crane]] reported on his Tape Op message board that he had planned to help Smith [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mix]] his album in mid-November. Crane wrote, &quot;I hadn't talked to Elliott in over a year. His girlfriend, Jennifer, called me [last week] and asked if I'd like to come to L.A. and help mix and finish [Smith's album].

[[File:Elliott Smith Memorial Wall.jpg|thumb|The memorial outside Solutions Audio in [[Los Angeles, California]] in August 2006.]]
Shortly after Smith's death, a fan memorial was initiated outside Solutions Audio (4334 [[Sunset Boulevard]], [[Los Angeles, California]]), the site at which the cover of the ''[[Figure 8 (album)|Figure 8]]'' album was shot. Farewell messages to Smith were written on the wall, and flowers, photos, candles, and empty bottles of alcohol mentioned in Smith's songs were left.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= Bryant, Will |title= Elliott Smith Dead At 34 |publisher = [[Pitchfork Media]] |date= October 2003 |url= http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/page/news/2003/10/22 |accessdate= 2007-02-03}}{{dead link|date=April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the wall has been repeatedly tagged by gang signs,&lt;ref&gt;LAist article: http://laist.com/2007/08/28/this_is_why_we.php This Is Why We Can't Have Nice Things.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[MySpace]] page: [http://www.myspace.com/repaintthewall THE ELLIOTT SMITH/SOLUTIONS WALL].&lt;/ref&gt; and, despite having been repainted to its original state in February 2008 and promises from Solutions' owner to maintain the site, the wall became largely covered by unrelated graffiti.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flickr.com/photos/evankarp/4145784013/ CJ Was Here on Flickr - Photo Sharing!&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flickr.com/photos/elephantparade/3930307571/ Elliott Smith, Figure 8 wall. on Flickr - Photo Sharing!&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.laweekly.com/westcoastsound/art-of-music/roger-waters-elliott-smith-mur/ Roger Waters promotional defacement.]&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2011, in honor of Smith's 42nd birthday, members of the music &amp; arts collective FMLY restored the mural, adding a black and white stencil of Smith resembling the photo on the ''Figure 8'' album cover.&lt;ref name=&quot;weekly8&quot;&gt;''[[LA Weekly]]'' article: &quot;[http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2011/08/silver-lakes-elliott-smith-wall-gets-a-very-homemade-touch-up.html Elliott Smith Memorial Wall Gets a New Face--Again].&lt;/ref&gt;

Memorial concerts were held in several cities in the United States and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes&quot;/&gt; A petition was soon put forth with intent to make part of the [[Silver Lake, Los Angeles, California|Silver Lake]] area a memorial park in Smith's honor.

==Posthumous releases==
''[[From a Basement on the Hill]]'', almost four years in production, was released on October 19, 2004, by [[ANTI- Records]] (a part of [[Epitaph Records]]). With Smith's family in control of his estate, they chose to bring in [[Rob Schnapf]] and Smith's ex-girlfriend [[Joanna Bolme]] to sort through the recordings and mix the album. Although Smith had voiced his desire for it to be a double album or a regular album with a bonus disc, it was not clear if it would have been possible for him to release it that way had he completed it.&lt;ref name=&quot;UnderTheRadar&quot; /&gt;  As completed by Schnapf and Bolme, it was released as a 15-track single album.  Many songs from the sessions (later leaked onto the Internet) were not included, such as &quot;True Love&quot;, &quot;Abused&quot;, &quot;Stickman&quot;, and &quot;Suicide Machine&quot; (a reworking of the ''Figure 8''-era unreleased instrumental, &quot;Tiny Time Machine&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;basement2&quot; /&gt; There has been unconfirmed speculation that Smith's family made the decision not to include some songs on the record.&lt;ref name=&quot;basement2&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=| year=| title=Metacritic: ''From a Basement on the Hill'' | work=The album holds a &quot;Universal acclaim&quot; metascore of 88 | url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/artists/smithelliott/fromabasementonthehill?q=From%20a%20Basement%20on%20the%20Hill | accessdate=2007-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Elliott Smith and the Big Nothing]]'', a biography by [[Benjamin Nugent]], was rushed to publication and hit stores shortly after ''From a Basement on the Hill'', barely beyond the first anniversary of the musician's death. Smith's family, as well as Joanna Bolme, Jennifer Chiba, Neil Gust, Sam Coomes, and Janet Weiss, all declined to be interviewed. It contained interviews with Rob Schnapf, David McConnell, and [[Pete Krebs]]. The book received mixed reviews, with ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' remarking that while &quot;Nugent manages to patch together the major beats of Smith's life, he can offer little meaningful insight.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= Bemis, Alec Hanley | title= ''Sleepwalker''| publisher= [[LA Weekly]] | url= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/product-description/0306813939 | accessdate= 2008-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 8, 2007, a posthumous two-disc [[compilation album]] entitled ''[[New Moon (Elliott Smith album)|New Moon]]'' was released by Kill Rock Stars. The album contained 24 songs recorded by Smith between 1994 and 1997 during his tenure with the label that were not included on albums, as well as a few early versions and previously released [[B-side]]s. In the United States, the album debuted at number 24 on the ''Billboard'' 200, selling about 24,000 copies in its first week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= Hasty, Katie |title= Buble Sidesteps Bone Thugs To Claim No. 1 |date= May 16, 2007 |publisher= ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' |url= http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003585672 |accessdate= 2007-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The record received favorable reviews&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Elliott Smith: New Moon (2007): Reviews |publisher= [[Metacritic]] |url= http://www.metacritic.com/music/artists/smithelliott/newmoon?q=new%20moon |accessdate= 2007-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was [[Metacritic]]'s 15th best-reviewed album of 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Metacritic: Best Albums of 2007 |url= http://www.metacritic.com/music/bests/2007.shtml |publisher= [[Metacritic]] |accessdate= 2007-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; A significant portion of the proceeds from album sales are to go to [[Outside In]], a social service agency for low-income adults and homeless youth in Portland, Oregon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= Walby, Sam |title= BBC Collective&amp;nbsp;— Elliott Smith&amp;nbsp;— New Moon |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/collective/A28826904 |publisher= BBC |date= 2007-11-09 |accessdate= 2007-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 25, 2007, a book titled ''[[Elliott Smith (book)|Elliott Smith]]'' was released by [[Autumn de Wilde]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= Ramirez, Charlie |title= Sweet Adeline News Archives for May 2007 |url= http://www.sweetadeline.net/may07.html | accessdate = 2007-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; which consists of photographs, handwritten lyrics and &quot;revealing talks with Smith's inner circle.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Amazon.com: Elliott Smith: Books | url= http://www.amazon.com/dp/0811857999 | accessdate = 2007-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; De Wilde was responsible for the ''Figure 8'' sleeve art, making a landmark and de facto Smith memorial of the Solutions Audio mural. A five-song CD featuring previously unreleased live recordings of Smith performing acoustically at [[Club Largo]] in Los Angeles was included in the release.

Following the singer's death, the Smith estate licensed his songs for use in a number of film and television projects, such as ''[[One Tree Hill (TV show)|One Tree Hill]]'', ''[[The Girl Next Door (2004 film)|The Girl Next Door]]'', ''[[Georgia Rule]]'', and ''[[Paranoid Park (film)|Paranoid Park]]''.

In a March 2009 interview, Larry Crane said that the estate of Elliott Smith was now &quot;defunct&quot; and all rights previously held by the singer are now in the control of &quot;his parents.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;glono&quot; /&gt; Crane went on to say that his parents own the rights to Smith's high school recordings, some of the Heatmiser material, all solo songs recorded up until his 1998 record deal with [[DreamWorks Records]] and ''From a Basement on the Hill.''&lt;ref name=&quot;glono&quot; /&gt;  DreamWorks Records was acquired by [[Universal Music Group]] in 2003, and [[Interscope Records]] currently &quot;owns all studio and live recording from Jan 1998 to his passing, except for the songs on ''From a Basement on the Hill''.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;glono&quot; /&gt;

In December 2009, Kill Rock Stars announced that it had obtained the rights to re-release ''Roman Candle'' and ''From a Basement on the Hill'', originally released by Cavity Search and Anti-, respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;reissues&quot;&gt;[[Pitchfork Media]] article: &quot;[http://pitchfork.com/news/37398-hear-an-unreleased-elliott-smith-song/ Hear an Unreleased Elliott Smith Song Plus Reissues on the way]&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Roman Candle'' will be remastered by Larry Crane.&lt;ref name=&quot;reissues&quot; /&gt; Along with the press release, Kill Rock Stars posted a previously unreleased track of Smith's, titled &quot;Cecilia/Amanda&quot;, as a free download.&lt;ref name=&quot;reissues&quot; /&gt; ''Roman Candle'' and ''From a Basement on the Hill'' were re-released on April 6, 2010 in the US.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.killrockstars.com/news/ Elliott Smith's Roman Candle and From a Basement on the Hill Out Today]&quot;. killrockstars.com, April 6, 2010. Retrieved on April 17, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

A compilation titled ''[[An Introduction to... Elliott Smith]]'' was released by Domino Records on November 1, 2010 in the UK and Kill Rock Stars on November 2 in the US.

There remain over a hundred unreleased tracks.  Many have leaked and appear on bootleg releases such as ''Elliott Smith Rarities'' and ''Grand Mal: Studio Rarities.''

''Untitled'' &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Modest Mouse]] documentary&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; Interview&lt;/ref&gt; Smith claimed to listen exclusively to selected albums (such as ''[[The Marble Index (album)|The Marble Index]]'' by [[Nico]]) for months.&lt;ref name=&quot;NMEchat&quot; /&gt; Sean Croghan, a former roommate of Smith's, said that the singer &quot;listened almost exclusively to [[slow jam]]s&quot; in his senior year at college.&lt;ref name=&quot;newmoon&quot; /&gt; Smith was also known to gain inspiration from novels, religion and philosophy. He liked classic literature, especially [[Samuel Beckett]], [[T. S. Eliot]], and [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]] (and other Russian novelists).&lt;ref name=&quot;NMEchat&quot; /&gt;

Smith mentioned his admiration for [[Bob Dylan]] in several interviews, citing him as an early musical influence. He once commented: &quot;My father taught me how to play &quot;[[Don't Think Twice, It's All Right]]&quot;. I love Dylan's words, but even more than that, I love the fact that he loves words.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;sweetadeline1&quot;/&gt; Smith covered Dylan's &quot;[[When I Paint My Masterpiece]]&quot; several times in concert. Smith has also been compared to folk legend [[Nick Drake]], due to his fingerpicking style and vocals. Darryl Cater of [[Allmusic]] called references to &quot;the definitive folk loner&quot; Drake, &quot;inevitable&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r247368|pure_url=yes}} |title=Allmusic ((( Roman Candle &gt; Overview ))) |publisher=[[Allmusic]] |author=Darryl Cater |date= |accessdate=2008-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Smith's lyrics have been compared to those in Drake's minimalist and haunting [[Pink Moon|final album]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r251314|pure_url=yes}} |title=Allmusic ((( Elliott Smith &gt; Overview ))) |publisher=[[Allmusic]] |author=Steve Huey |date= |accessdate=2008-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith was a dedicated fan of [[The Beatles]] (as well as their solo projects), once noting that he had been listening to them frequently since he was about &quot;four years old&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Smith said this when asked &quot;Have you been listening to a lot of Beatles lately?&quot; in ''[[Strange Parallel]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; and also claimed that hearing ''[[The Beatles (album)|The White Album]]'' was his original inspiration to become a musician.&lt;ref name=&quot;NMEchat&quot; /&gt; In 1998, Smith contributed a [[cover version|cover]] of the Beatles song &quot;[[Because (The Beatles song)|Because]]&quot; to the closing credits and [[American Beauty (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] of the film ''[[American Beauty (1999 film)|American Beauty]]''. Although this was the only Beatles song that Smith ever officially released, he is known to have recorded at least two others (&quot;[[Revolution (song)|Revolution]]&quot; and &quot;[[I'll Be Back (song)|I'll Be Back]]&quot;), and played many songs by both the band and the members' solo projects at live concerts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Multimedia |work= Live Covers |publisher= Sweet Adeline |url= http://www.sweetadeline.net/multimedia.htm |accessdate= 2007-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding his songwriting, Smith said:&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Songwriting with Elliott Smith&quot; [video interview], Musician.com&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|The way I think about it is... I don't really think about it in terms of language, I think about it more like shapes. That's an interesting thing to talk about but it's difficult.

Lyrics became more important to him as he became older, and more time was spent working on them.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;glono&quot; /&gt;
