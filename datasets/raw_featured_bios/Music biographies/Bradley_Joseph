'''Bradley Joseph''' (born 1965) is an American composer, arranger, and producer of contemporary  instrumental music. His compositions include works for orchestra, quartet, and solo piano, while his musical style ranges from &quot;quietly pensive mood music to a rich orchestration of classical depth and breadth&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;NaplesDailyNews&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Moore|first=Ken|title = ''Rapture'' — Bradley Joseph (Narada)|publisher = Naples Daily News ([[Naples, Florida]], U.S.)|date = 1997-04-25|accessdate =2007-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Active since 1983, Joseph has performed in front of more than a half million people around the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;st.croix&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Fredericksen|first=Jane|title = White Bear Lake pianist delivers 'suite' release|url=http://www.presspubs.com/articles/2009/08/13/st_croix_valley_press/entertainment/doc4a8446c4da23c753654626.txt  |publisher = St. Croix Valley Press (presspubs.com) ([[Minnesota]], U.S.)|date = 2009-08-13|accessdate =2009-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; He played various instruments in rock bands throughout the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] until 1989 when [[Greece|Greek]] composer [[Yanni]] hired him for his core band after hearing a tape of his original compositions. He was a featured concert keyboardist with Yanni through six major tours, most recently in 2003 for the 60-city ''[[Ethnicity (Yanni album)|Ethnicity]]'' tour.  He appears in the multi-platinum album and concert film, ''[[Yanni Live at the Acropolis]]''. Joseph also spent four years as [[musical director]] and lead keyboardist for [[Sheena Easton]], including a 1995 performance on the ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno (1992 TV series)|Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]''.

His solo career began when he independently released ''[[Hear the Masses]],'' featuring many of his Yanni bandmates. This debut was followed by ''[[Rapture (Bradley Joseph album)|Rapture]]'', an instrumental album recorded with a 50-piece orchestra in which Joseph wrote and conducted all of the scores. It was released on the [[Narada Productions|Narada]] label and reached New Age Voice (NAV)'s &quot;Airwaves Top 30&quot;. He has produced numerous CDs/DVDs and piano books under his own record label, Robbins Island Music. Two of these recordings, ''[[Christmas Around the World (Bradley Joseph album)|Christmas Around the World]]'' and  ''[[One Deep Breath]]'', also held positions on NAV's Top 100 radio chart. His music is included in multiple various-artist compilation albums including the 2008 release of ''[[The Weather Channel Presents: Smooth Jazz II]]''.

He played sax and guitar in some of these earlier bands but left them to concentrate on just the piano/keyboards.&lt;ref name=&quot;Indie Journal Interview&quot;/&gt; Later, he started performing with guitarist [[Dugan McNeill]], whose [[U2]]-like group was signed to Polygram.&lt;ref name=&quot;Official bio&quot;/&gt;  McNeill and [[Yanni]] had once played together in the technopop band [[Chameleon (American band)|Chameleon]] in the late 70s and early 80s.

===Yanni===
In 1989, Joseph recorded his first demo tape and sent it off to Greek composer [[Yanni]], who was looking for someone to replace keyboardist [[John Tesh]], as Tesh was launching his own solo career.&lt;ref name=&quot;Yanni in Words&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last = Yanni

If you listen to the original recordings he did and what we ended up with in our live recordings, you can really hear the musician's input.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Indie Journal Interview&quot;/&gt;  He readily credits Yanni's role in his professional development, and for five years of irreplaceable experiences and memories.&lt;ref name=&quot;AlbumNotesRapture&quot;&gt;{{cite album-notes |title= Rapture|albumlink=Rapture (Bradley Joseph album)|bandname=Bradley Joseph |year= 1997|format= CD liner|publisher= [[Narada Productions|Narada Equinox]]|publisherid=ND-63038}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Between tours, Joseph worked extensively in recording studios on music ranging from rock and pop to rhythm and blues and orchestration with numerous artists from [[RCA]], [[Epic Records|Epic]], [[Warner Brothers]], and [[Polygram Records]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Live, The Symphony Concerts 1994 - Official concert program&quot;&gt;Bio from: {{cite book|title = Yanni Live, The Symphony Concerts 1994 - Official concert program|publisher = [[Yanni]]

{{Rquote|right|Working with Easton was &quot;...a shock in musical styles but a welcome change.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Indie Journal Interview&quot;/&gt;}} Wheeler questioned how he got hooked up with Easton; Joseph answered that he was recommended by a former road manager. He was included in a try-out with four others, rehearsed with the band, they then cut it down to two, and rehearsed with Sheena for the final cut.&lt;ref name=&quot;Indie Journal Interview&quot;/&gt; Joseph anticipated they would ask him to do a solo on at least one of the songs he was asked to play during the audition, so he wrote a solo for all three songs, which was ultimately the reason he was hired for the job.&lt;ref name=&quot;WPSaward&quot;&gt;Speech: {{cite web

In a 1995 interview, he said that after five years of touring with Yanni and working on his own debut album, he needed a break.  Yanni was still building his career and maintained a hectic concert schedule.  Working with Easton, on the other hand, was &quot;the best of both worlds&quot;.  &quot;She just adopted a baby and is pretty settled in&quot;, said Joseph.&lt;ref name=&quot;Heeeeeeere's Bradley&quot;/&gt; Tour venues with her included Japan, Indonesia, Puerto Rico, and the United States,&lt;ref name=&quot;Official bio&quot;/&gt; as well as routine appearances in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] and [[Atlantic City]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Heeeeeeere's Bradley&quot;/&gt; In March 1995, he appeared with her on the ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno (1992 TV series)|Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]'' when she performed her new single at the time, &quot;My Cherie&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Joseph Tonight Show&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last = Miller|first = Gary|url=| title =''Joseph, Tonight Show''

===Solo career===
In 1994, between world tours, Joseph released his debut album, ''[[Hear the Masses]]'', a self-produced, self-published release under the More Core Records label consisting of 10 original compositions.  He invited most of the Yanni band to contribute.&lt;ref name=&quot;Indie Journal Interview&quot;/&gt;  They include [[Charlie Adams (drummer)|Charlie Adams]] (drums, percussion); [[Ric Fierabracci]] (fretless bass); [[Jeanette Clinger]] (vocals); and [[Grammy]]-winning violinist [[Charlie Bisharat]].  Other guest artists include Larry Preston (guitar); and Terry Brau — featured on numerous Bradley Joseph recordings — playing trumpet, saxophone, and [[fluegelhorn]].

The genres main labels &amp;ndash; Narada, Windham Music, and Higher Octave &amp;ndash; were beginning to explore worldly themes versus the warm, earthly, acoustic themes that prior artists had established.

Debbage writes, &quot;The magical world of movies has a knack for exploring sequels. There is the beauty and beast effect when taking this pathway. The creative beauty allows the viewers to see the continued growth of its characters. The beastly aspect of this exploration is the Hollywood exploitation of an almost guaranteed return on its investment with no regard for its creative progression that usually sees diminishing returns. Bradley Joseph has decided to walk this tightrope by following up with ''Solo Journey'' that was released back in 2000. I am glad to report that ''The Journey Continues'' is entrenched in beauty, holding up well to its predecessor.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Journey Continues at Wind and Wire Magazine-Debbage&quot;/&gt;

====Thoughts on success as an independent artist====
Having experienced both avenues of recording on a [[Major record labels|major label]] and later choosing to be an [[Independent music|independent artist]], a combination of musicianship with business know-how has helped give Joseph staying power in the notoriously competitive world of music.  He spends most of his time writing songs, composing arrangements, making recordings, and publishing and distributing his works. &quot;I’m my own boss. I can do what I want. I can change directions&quot;, he told [[West Central Tribune]]'s Anne Polta.&lt;ref name=&quot;Continuing Journey&quot;/&gt;    As an independent, business is a prime concern and can take over if not controlled, Joseph said.&lt;ref name=&quot;Indie Journal Interview&quot;/&gt;  &quot;A lot of musicians don’t learn the business. You just have to be well-rounded in both areas. You have to understand publishing. You have to understand how you make money, what’s in demand, what helps you make the most out of your talent.&quot;  &quot;I couldn’t license my music if it wasn’t mine&quot;, he said. &quot;It has allowed me to create CDs. It separates you from the million other great players.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Continuing Journey&quot;/&gt;  

In an interview with author Cicily Janus, Joseph commented that his perspective has changed a great deal from when he was younger.  He said, &quot;Everything I did was focused on making good music and being a great musician, not running a business. Yet it takes a businessperson to bring music to the masses.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;NFOJ&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author= Janus, Cicily|coauthors = Radinsky, Ned|url=http://newfaceofjazz.com/?page_id=594|title=New Faces of Jazz: Bradley Joseph|publisher = (newfaceofjazz.com)|accessdate=2010-08-01}} {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; But some artists just want to  be involved in the music and do not like the added problems or have the personality to work with both.  Joseph suggests newer artists read and study both courses and pick one that best suits their needs and wants.  He advises, &quot;...to keep your eyes and ears open all the time.  All the information you need is available to you to have a successful career in music, if you're paying attention, and not closed off to anything.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Indie Journal Interview&quot;/&gt;  He explains, &quot;Time and persistence has shown me that I can succeed at sharing my art with others as a musician while running my own music business.  And that kind of success is as good as I could have ever wished for.&quot;&lt;ref name=NFOJ/&gt;

When asked by Wheeler what brought him back to Minnesota after living in Los Angeles and traveling around the world, Joseph replied, &quot;The first thing business people say is 'First and foremost, if you want to be successful, live where you want to live'.&quot;  He grew  up there and family were important to him.  When he decided to become a solo artist he wanted to be comfortable in his environment and moved back.&lt;ref name=&quot;Indie Journal Interview&quot;/&gt;

==Musical style and composition==
Joseph believes that &quot;music allows a person to express their deepest thoughts, thoughts that cannot be expressed with just words.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;xtrememusic.org&quot;&gt;Interview:  {{cite web |author= St. Vincent, Justin |url=http://www.xtrememusic.org/world/joseph_bradley.pdf|title=The Spiritual Significance of Music'|format=pdf|publisher = [http://www.xtrememusic.org/index.html xtrememusic.org] ([http://www.xtrememusic.org/world.html World Edition])|date = 2009-02-24|accessdate=2009-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Debbage comments, &quot;One strength of Bradley Joseph as an artist has been his keen ability to write inspiring music with appropriately titled songs that express that thought non-verbally&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Journey Continues at Wind and Wire Magazine-Debbage&quot;/&gt;  In an interview with ''Indie Journal'', Joseph said that when writing music he prefers to concentrate on the melody first, stating, &quot;Basically, I write from a two-person standpoint.  First, I let the song take hold and I put down the idea as a raw emotional statement. Then I let it breathe and come back, approaching from more of an objective point of view. This allows me to rediscover the true meaning I intended in the beginning, shedding new light on how I can best represent that to the listener.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Indie Journal Interview&quot;/&gt; He explained to Janus that, &quot;Through instrumental music, I’m allowed to come up with musical ideas that allow the listener to create their own impression of my song. If you add lyrics about a girl in the song, the listener doesn’t have a choice of what the song is about, it’s told to them. My musical writings allow me to express anything.  It’s easier for me to tell a story of something I’ve encountered this way then to verbalize it.  And my feelings are explored more in my compositions compared to what I could ever say in a few sentences.&quot;&lt;ref name=NFOJ/&gt;

Joseph's musical style and direction have varied over time, having released more than two hundred original compositions and arrangements since 1994.  &quot;When I write it, it just kind of moves, because where I am in life is different&quot;, Joseph said. &quot;So as I get older, it kind of changes.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;WBL Composer Named Outstanding Young Minnesotan&quot;/&gt;  His recordings can offer full orchestrations such as in ''Hear the Masses'', or ''Rapture'' that combines smooth jazz with contemporary instrumental themes.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Journey Continues at Wind and Wire Magazine-Debbage&quot;/&gt; A review of ''Rapture'' from ''New Age Voice'' states Joseph &quot;paints romantic pictures in sound with voices and instruments that escalate from quiet, intimate passages to big, energetic movements&quot;.  &quot;The arrangements are structured so that the trumpet can lead a line out on 'Be Still' signaling an introspective sort of mood; yet the strings swell on 'The Passage' engulfing the listener in an ocean of sound.&quot;  &quot;Even cuts that start quiet, such as 'Healing the Hollow Man' or 'Blue Rock Road' ebb and flow between quiet moments and crescendos.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;New Age Voice Rapture&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title = New Age Voice review of ''Rapture''|publisher=New Age Voice, (currently newagereporter.com)|date=1997-07-25|accessdate=2007-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In contrast, later albums such as ''Solo Journey'' and ''The Journey Continues'' are considered to be &quot;stripped back and basic&quot; by Debbage, with the latter featuring &quot;Joseph and his piano with no additional clutter&quot;.  &quot;There is color in the songs via their understated melodies.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Journey Continues at Wind and Wire Magazine-Debbage&quot;/&gt;  As examples, Debbage describes Joseph as using a chord progression that translates into a strolling rhythm in the song &quot;The Road Ahead&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Journey Continues at Wind and Wire Magazine-Debbage&quot;/&gt;  ''Solo Piano Publications'' contributor, Kathy Parsons, writes, &quot;...'The Long, Last Mile' starts out with a bittersweet melody, and then builds in intensity and complexity with cello, winds, and ethereal sounds intertwining around the piano.

Joseph has also produced numerous CDs that include cover arrangements for piano and orchestra.  While discussing ''[[Classic Christmas (Bradley Joseph album)|Classic Christmas]]'', Gerry Grzyb, chairman of the University of Wisconsin–Oshkosh sociology department, states that Joseph's usual approach is to play the carol straight, and then add his own twists.  &quot;... he’s very effective at that—he doesn’t stray as far as a jazz or classical organ improviser might, but he does keep the interest up.&quot;    Grzyb says that the same applies to Joseph's earlier ''Christmas Around the World'' CD, which he found even more interesting because of the use of other instrumental sounds.&lt;ref name=&quot;northwestern&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Grzyb|first=Gerry|title = Dr. Christmas presents roundup of new Christmas CDs|publisher = The Northwestern (thenorthwestern.com),([[Oshkosh, Wisconsin]], U.S.)|url=|format=|date = 2008-12-16|accessdate =2008-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 2009 release of ''[[Suites &amp; Sweets]]'' features compositions by [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]], and other classical composers.  Joseph told Fredericksen that he, &quot;took the best parts and movements out of those classical songs … and made it soft and calm all the way through.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;st.croix&quot;/&gt;

Generally, Joseph's music gets airplay in the [[Adult_contemporary_music#Soft_adult_contemporary|adult contemporary]], [[smooth jazz]], [[easy listening]], and [[beautiful music]] radio formats, and while some is classified in the [[New age music|new age]] genre,  he considers [[Instrumental music|contemporary instrumental]] to fit his style of playing the best.&lt;ref name=&quot;Indie Journal Interview&quot;/&gt;  In discussing ''Rapture'', John Blake of ''[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution|The Atlanta Journal]]'' notes that often new age music sounds as if it should be played in a supermarket. The songs can sound like musical cotton candy — soft, airy and ultimately uninteresting. &quot;For the most part, Bradley's music doesn't make that mistake.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Atlanta&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Blake|first=John|title =Joseph's solo debut has range |publisher = [[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution|The Atlanta Journal]]  ([[Atlanta, Georgia]], U.S.)|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=AT&amp;p_theme=at&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EADA33238C305F1&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePMformat=fee|format=fee required|date = 1997-07-19|accessdate =2008-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  &quot;The music is cinematic, filled with introspective piano solos, swelling violins, and a hypnotic song pacing that allows the listener to daydream.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Atlanta&quot;/&gt; Janus remarks that, &quot;Although Bradley has been, at times, pigeon holed into an offshoot of jazz, his message through his music is universal in its appeal and soothing qualities.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;NFOJ&quot;/&gt;

Parsons goes on to say, &quot;The influence of years of touring with Yanni is apparent in the richness of Joseph’s sound, but his musical voice is his own.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;SPP-Kathy Parsons-ODB&quot;/&gt; Yanni once said, &quot;Bradley, your extreme sensitivity is your greatest gift&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;WPSaward&quot;/&gt;   Joseph later realized what Yanni meant was that he needed that as a composer, that it was a crucial component &quot;to be sensitive to what you see and to be able to apply that to music&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;WPSaward&quot;/&gt;  He believes that the spiritual aspect of creating is to &quot;find something deep within yourself that can only be created by you&quot;.  ...&quot;Your spiritual self cannot be copied and that’s why it’s so significant in life and music&quot;, he says.&lt;ref name=&quot;xtrememusic.org&quot;/&gt;  Musically, he tries to connect a common bridge between such exhilarating feelings as performing at the Acropolis, to the emotions each and everyone feels everyday.  &quot;In the end, a good melody will always stand the test of time&quot;, says Joseph.&lt;ref name=&quot;Indie Journal Interview&quot;/&gt;  {{Rquote|left|The piano is always true to me.
