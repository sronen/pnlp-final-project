'''Sir Georg Solti''', [[Order of the British Empire|KBE]], {{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|dʒ|ɔr|dʒ|_|ˈ|ʃ|ɒ|l|t|i}} (21 October 1912{{spaced ndash}}5 September 1997) was an orchestral and operatic [[Conducting|conductor]], best known for his appearances with opera companies in [[Munich]], [[Frankfurt]] and London, and as a long-serving music director of the [[Chicago Symphony Orchestra]]. Born in Hungary, he studied in [[Budapest]] with [[Béla Bartók]], [[Leo Weiner]] and [[Ernő Dohnányi]]. In the 1930s, he was a [[répétiteur]] at the [[Hungarian State Opera House|Hungarian State Opera]] and worked at the [[Salzburg Festival]] for [[Arturo Toscanini]]. His career was interrupted by the rise of the [[Nazis]], and because he was a Jew he fled the increasingly restrictive anti-semitic laws in 1938. After conducting a season of Russian ballet in London at the [[Royal Opera House]] he found refuge in Switzerland, where he remained during the Second World War.  Not permitted to conduct there, he earned a living as a pianist.

After the war Solti was appointed musical director of the [[Bavarian State Opera]] in Munich from 1946. In 1952 he moved to the [[Opern- und Schauspielhaus Frankfurt|Frankfurt Opera]], where he remained in charge for nine years. He took German citizenship in 1953. In 1961 he became musical director of the [[Royal Opera, London|Covent Garden Opera Company]] in London. During his ten-year tenure, he introduced changes that saw standards raised to the highest international levels. Under his musical directorship the status of the company was recognised with the grant of the title &quot;the Royal Opera&quot;. He became a British subject in 1972.

In 1969 Solti was appointed music director of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, a post he held for 22 years. He restored the orchestra's reputation after it had been in decline for most of the previous decade. He became the orchestra's music director laureate on his retirement in 1991. During his time with the Chicago orchestra, he also had shorter spells in charge of the [[Orchestre de Paris]] and the [[London Philharmonic Orchestra]].

Known in his early years for the intensity of his music making, Solti was widely considered to have mellowed as a conductor in later years. He recorded many works two or three times at various stages of his career, and was a prolific recording artist, making more than 250 recordings, including 45 complete opera sets. The most famous of his recordings is probably [[Decca Records|Decca]]'s complete set of [[Richard Wagner|Wagner's]] ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen]]'', made between 1958 and 1965. It has twice been voted the greatest recording ever made, in polls for ''[[Gramophone (magazine)|Gramophone]]'' magazine in 1999 and the [[BBC]]'s ''[[BBC Music Magazine|Music Magazine]]'' in 2012.

==Life and career==
===Early years===
Solti was born '''György Stern''' ({{lang-hu|Stern György}}) in Vérmező utca, in the [[Buda]] district of Budapest, the younger of the two children of Móricz (&quot;Mor&quot;) Stern and his wife Teréz, ''née'' Rosenbaum.&lt;ref name=dnb&gt;Follows, Stephen. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/68813 &quot;Solti, Sir Georg (1912–1997)&quot;], ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004; online edition, January 2011, accessed 22 February 2012 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the aftermath of the First World War it became the accepted practice in Hungary for citizens with Germanic surnames to adopt Hungarian ones. The right wing regime of [[Miklós Horthy|Admiral Horthy]] enacted a series of &quot;Hungarianisation&quot; laws, including a requirement that state employees with  foreign-sounding names must change them.&lt;ref name=fox/&gt; Mor Stern, a self-employed merchant, felt no need to change his surname, but thought it prudent to change that of his children.&lt;ref name=fox/&gt; He renamed them after [[Solt]], a small town in central Hungary.{{#tag:ref| The family had no connection with Solt, and Stern appears to have selected it at random.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;|group= n}} His son's given name, György, was acceptably Hungarian and was not changed.&lt;ref name=fox&gt;Fox, Sue. [http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:UKNB:LTIB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0F9247FFBB6DBA0F&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=102CDD40F14C6BDA &quot;Georg Solti&amp;nbsp;– A Childhood&quot;], ''The Times'', 1 July 1995&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Liszt Academy.jpg|thumb|left|alt=exterior shot of ornate nineteenth century building|[[Franz Liszt Academy of Music|Franz Liszt Academy]], Budapest]]
Solti described his father as &quot;a kind, sweet man who trusted everyone. He shouldn't have, but he did. Jews in Hungary were tremendously patriotic. In 1914, when war broke out, my father invested most of his money in a war loan to help the country. By the time the bonds matured, they were worthless.&quot;&lt;ref name=fox/&gt; Mor Stern was a religious man, but his son was less so. Late in life Solti recalled, &quot;I often upset him because I never stayed in the synagogue for longer than ten minutes.&quot;&lt;ref name=fox/&gt;  Teréz Stern was from a musical family, and encouraged her daughter Lilly, eight years the elder of the children, to sing, and György to accompany her at the piano. Solti remembered, &quot;I made so many mistakes, but it was invaluable experience for an opera conductor. I learnt to swim with her.&quot;&lt;ref name=fox/&gt; He was not a diligent student of the piano: &quot;My mother kept telling me to practise, but what ten-year-old wants to play the piano when he could be out playing football?&quot;&lt;ref name=fox/&gt;

Solti  enrolled at the Ernö Fodor School of Music in Budapest at the age of ten, transferring to the more prestigious [[Franz Liszt Academy of Music|Franz Liszt Academy]] two years later.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; When he was 12 he heard a performance of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Fifth Symphony]] conducted by [[Erich Kleiber]], which gave him the ambition to become a conductor.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Greenfield|Greenfield, Edward]]. [http://www.gramophone.net/Issue/Page/October%201982/22/788181/ &quot;Sir Georg Solti&quot;], ''Gramophone'',  October 1982, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; His parents could not afford to pay for years of musical education, and his rich uncles did not consider music a suitable profession; from the age of 13 Solti paid for his education by giving piano lessons.&lt;ref name=fox/&gt;

The faculty of the Franz Liszt Academy included some of the most eminent Hungarian musicians, including [[Béla Bartók]], [[Leo Weiner]], [[Ernő Dohnányi]] and [[Zoltán Kodály]].  Solti studied under the first three, for piano, chamber music and composition respectively. Some sources state that he also studied with Kodály,&lt;ref name=grove&gt;[[Arthur Jacobs|Jacobs, Arthur]] and José A. Bowen. [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/26170 &quot;Solti, Sir Georg&quot;], ''Grove Music Online'', Oxford Music Online, accessed 22 February 2012 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=who&gt;[http://www.ukwhoswho.com/view/article/oupww/whowaswho/U182009 &quot;Solti, Sir Georg&quot;], ''Who Was Who'', A &amp; C Black, 1920–2008; online edition, Oxford University Press, December 2007, accessed 22 February 2012 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in his memoirs Solti recalled that Kodály, whom he would have preferred, turned him down, leaving him to study composition first with [[Albert Siklós]] and then with Dohnányi.&lt;ref&gt;Solti, pp. 17 and 22&lt;/ref&gt; Not all the Academy's tutors were equally distinguished: Solti remembered with little pleasure the conducting classes run by Ernö Unger, &quot;who instructed his pupils to use rigid little wrist motions. I attended the class for only two years, but I needed five years of practical conducting experience before I managed to unlearn what he had taught me&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Solti. p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pianist and conductor===

After graduating from the Academy in 1930 Solti was appointed to the staff of the [[Hungarian State Opera House|Hungarian State Opera]].{{#tag:ref|This appointment came under the scope of another of Horthy's laws, requiring that state employees must be able to prove that their families had lived in Hungary for at least 50 years. Mor Stern went to the records office in his native village of [[Balatonfőkajár]] and found documents showing that his family had lived there for more than 250 years.&lt;ref&gt;Solti, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} He found that working as a [[répétiteur]], coaching singers in their roles and playing at rehearsals, was a more fruitful preparation than Unger's classes for his intended career as a conductor.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; In 1932 he went to [[Badisches Staatstheater Karlsruhe|Karlsruhe]] in Germany as assistant to [[Josef Krips]], but within a year, Krips, anticipating the imminent rise to power of [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] and the [[Nazism|Nazi]]s, insisted that Solti should go home to Budapest, where at that time Jews were not in danger.&lt;ref&gt;Solti, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; Other Jewish and anti-Nazi musicians also left Germany for Budapest.  Among other musical exiles with whom Solti worked there were [[Otto Klemperer]], [[Fritz Busch]], and Kleiber.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; Before Austria fell under Nazi control, Solti was assistant to [[Arturo Toscanini]] at the 1937 [[Salzburg Festival]]:
[[File:Hungarian State Opera House(PDXdj).jpg|thumb|right|alt=exterior of a large neo-classical theatre|[[Hungarian State Opera House]]]]
{{quote| Toscanini was the first great musical impression in my life. Before I heard him live in 1936, I had never heard a great opera conductor, not in Budapest, and it was like a lightning flash. I heard his ''[[Falstaff (opera)|Falstaff]]'' in 1936 and the impact was unbelievable. It was the first time I heard an ensemble singing absolutely precisely. It was fantastic. Then I never expected to meet Toscanini. It was a chance in a million. I had a letter of recommendation from the director of the Budapest Opera to the president of the Salzburg Festival. He received me and said: &quot;Do you know ''[[The Magic Flute|Magic Flute]]'', because we have an influenza epidemic and two of our repetiteurs are ill? Could you play this afternoon for the stage rehearsals?&quot;&lt;ref name=canning&gt;Canning, Hugh.

After further work as a répétiteur at the opera in Budapest, and with his standing enhanced by his association with Toscanini, Solti was given his first chance to conduct, on 11 March 1938.{{#tag:ref|Solti wrote that, as far as he knew, he was the first unconverted Jew to conduct at the State Opera.&lt;ref&gt;Solti, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} The opera was ''[[The Marriage of Figaro]]''. During that evening, news came of the German invasion of Austria.&lt;ref name=times&gt;[http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:UKNB:LTIB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0F924C9A27B2EE4D&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=102CDD40F14C6BDA &quot;Sir Georg Solti&amp;nbsp;– Obituary&quot;], ''The Times'', 8 September 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Many Hungarians feared that Hitler would next invade Hungary; he did not do so, but Horthy, to strengthen his partnership with the Nazis, instituted anti-semitic laws, mirroring the [[Nuremberg Laws]], restricting Hungary's Jews from engaging in professions.&lt;ref&gt;Levy, p. 323&lt;/ref&gt;  Solti's family urged him to move away.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; He went first to London, where he made his [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]] debut, conducting the [[London Philharmonic Orchestra|London Philharmonic]] for a Russian ballet season.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Opera and Ballet&quot;, ''The Times'', 2 July 1938, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; The reviewer in ''[[The Times]]'' was not impressed with Solti's efforts, finding them &quot;too violent, for he lashed at the orchestra and flogged the music so that he endangered the delicate, evocative atmosphere.&quot;&lt;ref name=ballet&gt;&quot;Covent Garden Ballet&amp;nbsp;– Carnaval&quot;, ''The Times'', 15 July 1938, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; At about this time Solti dropped the name &quot;György&quot; in favour of &quot;Georg&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Solti, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

After his appearances in London Solti went to Switzerland to seek out Toscanini, who was conducting in [[Lucerne]]. Solti hoped that Toscanini would help find him a post in the US. He was unable to do so, but Solti found work and security in Switzerland as vocal coach to the tenor Max Hirzel, who was learning the role of Tristan in [[Tristan und Isolde|Wagner's opera]].&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; Throughout the Second World War, Solti remained in Switzerland.&lt;ref name=canning/&gt; He did not see his father again: Mor Stern died of diabetes in a Budapest hospital in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;Solti, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; Solti was reunited with his mother and sister after the war.&lt;ref&gt;Solti, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; In Switzerland he could not obtain a work permit as a conductor, but earned his living as a piano teacher.&lt;ref&gt;Solti, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; After he won the 1942 [[Geneva International Music Competition|Geneva International Piano Competition]] he was permitted to give piano recitals, but was still not allowed to conduct.&lt;ref&gt;Solti, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; During his exile, he met Hedwig (Hedi) Oeschli, daughter of a lecturer at Zürich University. They married in 1946.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; In his memoirs he wrote of her, &quot;She was very elegant and sophisticated. ... Hedi gave me a little grace and taught me good manners&amp;nbsp;– although she never completely succeeded in this. She also helped me enormously in my career&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.georgsolti.com/ &quot;Salzburg &amp; Swiss exile&quot;], Georg Solti, accessed 23 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===Munich and Frankfurt===
With the end of the war Solti's luck changed dramatically. He was appointed musical director of the [[Bavarian State Opera]] in [[Munich]] in 1946.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; In normal circumstances this prestigious post would have been an unthinkable appointment for a young and inexperienced conductor,{{#tag:ref| Solti's predecessors included prominent conductors such as [[Hans von Bülow]], [[Hermann Levi]], [[Richard Strauss]], [[Bruno Walter]], [[Hans Knappertsbusch]] and [[Clemens Krauss]].|group= n}} but the leading German conductors such as [[Wilhelm Furtwängler]], [[Clemens Krauss]] and [[Herbert von Karajan]] were prohibited from conducting pending the conclusion of [[denazification]] proceedings against them.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; Under Solti's direction, the company rebuilt its repertoire and began to recover its pre-war eminence.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt; He benefited from the encouragement of the elderly [[Richard Strauss]], in whose presence he conducted ''[[Der Rosenkavalier]]''.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt; Strauss was reluctant to discuss his own music with Solti, but gave him advice about conducting.&lt;ref&gt;Solti, pp. 78–79&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Georges Solti and Nikita Magaloff (1965) by Erling Mandelmann.jpg|thumb|alt=two men, both bald, one standing and one sitting|right|upright|Solti (l) with the pianist [[Nikita Magaloff]]]]
In addition to the Munich appointment Solti gained a recording contract in 1946. He signed for [[Decca Records]], not as a conductor but as a piano accompanist.&lt;ref&gt;Culshaw (1967), p 30&lt;/ref&gt;  He made his first recording in 1947, playing [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]]'s [[Violin Sonata No. 1 (Brahms)|First Violin Sonata]] with the violinist [[Georg Kulenkampff]].&lt;ref name=d/&gt; He was insistent that he wanted  to conduct, and Decca gave him his first recording sessions as a conductor later in the same year, with the [[Zurich Tonhalle Orchestra]] in [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s ''[[Egmont (Beethoven)|Egmont]]'' overture.&lt;ref name=d/&gt; Twenty years later Solti said, &quot;I'm sure it's a terrible record, because the orchestra was not very good at that time and I was so excited. It is horrible, surely horrible&amp;nbsp;– but by now it has vanished.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Culshaw (1967), p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; He had to wait two years for his next recording as a conductor. It was in London,  [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]]'s ''[[Symphony No. 103 (Haydn)|Drum Roll]]'' symphony, in sessions produced by [[John Culshaw]], with whose career Solti's became closely linked over the next two decades.&lt;ref&gt;Culshaw (1967), p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; Reviewing the record, ''[[Gramophone (magazine)|The Gramophone]]'' said, &quot;The performance of the London Philharmonic Orchestra under Georg Solti (a fine conductor who is new to me) is remarkable for rhythmic playing, richness of tone, and clarity of execution.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gramophone.net/Issue/Page/July%201950/16 &quot;Haydn Symphony No. 103 in E flat&quot;], ''The Gramophone'', July 1950, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Record Guide]]'' compared it favourably with [[EMI Classics|EMI]]'s rival recording by [[Thomas Beecham|Sir Thomas Beecham]] and the [[Royal Philharmonic Orchestra|Royal Philharmonic]].&lt;ref&gt;Sackville-West, p. 355&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1951 Solti conducted at the [[Salzburg Festival]] for the first time, partly through the influence of Furtwängler, who was impressed by him.&lt;ref name=s85&gt;Solti, pp. 85–86&lt;/ref&gt; The work was ''[[Idomeneo]]'', which had not been given there before.&lt;ref name=s85/&gt; In Munich Solti achieved critical and popular success, but for political reasons his position at the State Opera was never secure. The view persisted that a German conductor should be in charge; pressure mounted, and after five years Solti accepted an offer to move to [[Frankfurt]] in 1952 as musical director of the [[Opern- und Schauspielhaus Frankfurt|Frankfurt Opera]].&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;{{#tag:ref|Solti's successor at Munich was the German [[Rudolf Kempe]].|group= n}} The city's opera house had been destroyed in the war, and Solti undertook to build a new company and repertoire for its recently-completed replacement. He also conducted the symphony concerts given by the opera orchestra.&lt;ref name=s94/&gt; Frankfurt's was a less prestigious house than Munich's and he initially regarded the move as a demotion,&lt;ref name=s94&gt;Solti, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; but he found the post fulfilling and remained at Frankfurt from 1952 to 1961, presenting 33 operas, 19 of which he had not conducted before.&lt;ref&gt;Solti, p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; Frankfurt, unlike Munich, could not attract many of the leading German singers. Solti recruited many rising young American singers such as [[Claire Watson]] and [[Sylvia Stahlman]],&lt;ref&gt;Solti, pp. 100 (Watson) and 101 (Stahlman)&lt;/ref&gt; to the extent that the house acquired the nickname &quot;Amerikanische Oper am Main&quot;.{{#tag:ref|&quot;The American Opera on the [[Main (river)|Main]]&quot;, a play on the title of the [[Deutsche Oper am Rhein]]&amp;nbsp;– the German Opera on the Rhine&amp;nbsp;– at [[Düsseldorf]].&lt;ref&gt;Solti, p. 100&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} In 1953 the West German government offered Solti German citizenship, which, being effectively stateless as a Hungarian exile, he gratefully accepted. He believed he could never return to Hungary, by then under communist rule.&lt;ref&gt;Solti, p. 96&lt;/ref&gt; He remained a German citizen for two decades.&lt;ref&gt;Solti, p. 105&lt;/ref&gt;

During his Frankfurt years Solti made appearances with other opera companies and orchestras. He conducted in the Americas for the first time in 1952, giving concerts in Buenos Aires.&lt;ref&gt;Solti, p. 92–93&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year he made his debut at the [[Edinburgh Festival]] as a guest conductor with the visiting [[Hamburg State Opera]].&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; The following year he was a guest at the [[San Francisco Opera]] with ''[[Elektra (opera)|Elektra]]'', ''[[Die Walküre]]'' and ''[[Tristan und Isolde]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Solti, p. 102&lt;/ref&gt; In 1954 he conducted ''[[Don Giovanni]]'' at the [[Glyndebourne Festival Opera|Glyndebourne Festival]]. The reviewer in ''The Times'' said that no fault could be found in Solti's &quot;vivacious and sensitive&quot; conducting.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Glyndebourne Opera&amp;nbsp;– 'Don Giovanni'&quot;, ''The Times'', 8 July 1954, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year Solti made his first appearance with the [[Chicago Symphony Orchestra]], at the [[Ravinia Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.georgsolti.com/ &quot;Career highlights&quot;], Georg Solti, accessed 23 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In the recording studios Solti's career took off after 1956, when John Culshaw was put in charge of Decca's classical recording programme. Culshaw believed Solti to be &quot;the great Wagner conductor of our time&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Culshaw (1967), p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; and was determined to record the four operas of ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen]]'' with Solti and the finest Wagner singers available.&lt;ref&gt;Culshaw (1967), pp. 52–53&lt;/ref&gt; The cast Culshaw assembled for the cycle included [[Kirsten Flagstad]], [[Hans Hotter]], [[Birgit Nilsson]] and [[Wolfgang Windgassen]].&lt;ref&gt;Culshaw (1967), pp. 273–274&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from ''[[Arabella]]'' in 1957, in which he substituted when [[Karl Böhm]] withdrew, Solti had made no complete recording of an opera until the sessions for ''[[Das Rheingold]]'', the first of the ''Ring'' tetralogy, in September and October 1958.&lt;ref name=d/&gt; In their respective memoirs Culshaw and Solti told how [[Walter Legge]] of Decca's rival [[EMI Classics|EMI]] predicted that ''Das Rheingold'' would be a commercial disaster (&quot;'Very nice,' he said, 'Very interesting. But of course you won't ''sell'' any.'&quot;)&lt;ref&gt;Culshaw (1967), p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|Solti and Culshaw recalled Legge's words slightly differently, though the import was the same; Solti remembered Legge's words as, &quot;A beautiful work, but you won't sell fifty copies.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Solti, p. 113&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} The success of the recording took the record industry by surprise. It featured for weeks in the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' charts, the sole classical album alongside best sellers by [[Elvis Presley]] and [[Pat Boone]], and brought Solti's name to international prominence.&lt;ref&gt;Culshaw (1967), p. 124&lt;/ref&gt; He appeared with leading orchestras in New York, Vienna and Los Angeles, and at Covent Garden he conducted ''Der Rosenkavalier'' and [[Benjamin Britten|Britten]]'s ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream (opera)|A Midsummer Night's Dream]]''.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

===Covent Garden===
[[File:Royal Opera House.JPG|thumb|right|upright|alt=interior of grand nineteenth century theatre|Royal Opera House, Covent Garden]]
In 1960 Solti signed a three-year contract to be music director of the [[Los Angeles Philharmonic]] from 1962.&lt;ref name=s124/&gt;  Before he took up the post the Philharmonic's autocratic president [[Dorothy Buffum Chandler|Dorothy Chandler]] breached his contract by appointing a deputy music director without Solti's approval. Although he admired the chosen deputy, [[Zubin Mehta]], Solti felt he could not have his authority undermined from the outset, and he withdrew from his appointment.&lt;ref name=s124/&gt; He accepted an offer to become musical director of the [[Royal Opera, London|Covent Garden Opera Company]] in London. When first sounded out about the post he had declined it. After 14 years of experience at Munich and Frankfurt he was uncertain that he wanted a third successive operatic post.&lt;ref name=h257&gt;Haltrecht, p. 257&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, founded only 15 years earlier, the Covent Garden company was not yet the equal of the best opera houses in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Haltrecht, p. 237&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bruno Walter]] convinced Solti that it was his duty to take Covent Garden on.&lt;ref&gt;Haltrecht, p. 259&lt;/ref&gt;

The biographer Montague Haltrecht suggests that Solti seized the breach of his Los Angeles contract as a convenient pretext to abandon the Philharmonic in favour of Covent Garden.&lt;ref&gt;Haltrecht, p. 258&lt;/ref&gt; However, in his memoirs Solti wrote that he wanted the Los Angeles position very much indeed.&lt;ref name=s124&gt;Solti, pp. 124–125&lt;/ref&gt; He originally considered holding both posts in tandem, but later acknowledged that he had had a lucky escape, as he could have done justice to neither post had he attempted to hold both simultaneously.&lt;ref name=s124/&gt;

Solti took up the musical directorship of Covent Garden in August 1961.&lt;ref&gt;Haltrecht, p. 264&lt;/ref&gt;  The press gave him a cautious welcome, but there was some concern that under him there might be a drift away from the company's original policy of opera in English.

The company's repertory in the 1960s combined the standard operatic works with less familiar pieces.

In 1967 Solti was invited to become music director of the [[Chicago Symphony Orchestra]]. It was the second time he had been offered the post. The first had been in 1963 after the death of the orchestra's conductor, [[Fritz Reiner]], who made its reputation in the previous decade.&lt;ref name=patmore/&gt; Solti told the representatives of the orchestra that his commitments at Covent Garden made it impossible to give Chicago the eight months a year they sought.&lt;ref name=prov/&gt; He suggested giving them three and a half months a year and inviting [[Carlo Maria Giulini]] to take charge for a similar length of time. The orchestra declined to proceed on these lines.&lt;ref name=prov/&gt; When Solti accepted the orchestra's second invitation it was agreed that Giulini should be appointed to share the conducting.{{#tag:ref|The management of the orchestra had privately hoped for a triumvirate of famous conductors, with Karajan as chief and Solti and Giulini as guests, but Karajan declined.&lt;ref name=o560&gt;Osborne, p. 560&lt;/ref&gt; Karajan's biographer Richard Osborne comments that the outcome was probably fortunate for the Chicago Symphony as it gained &quot;a music director who in the fullness of time would devote a large part of his life to the orchestra.&quot;&lt;ref name=o560/&gt;|group= n}} Both conductors signed three-year contracts with the orchestra, effective from 1969.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jstor.org/stable/3392541 &quot;Bulletin Board&quot;], ''Music Educators Journal'', Vol. 55, No. 8 (April 1969), p. 111 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as raising the orchestra's profile and helping it return to prosperity, Solti considerably expanded its repertoire. Under him the Chicago Symphony gave its first cycles of the symphonies of [[Anton Bruckner|Bruckner]] and [[Gustav Mahler|Mahler]]. He introduced new works commissioned for the orchestra, such as [[Witold Lutosławski|Lutosławski]]'s [[Symphony No. 3 (Lutosławski)|Third Symphony]], and [[Michael Tippett|Tippett]]'s [[Symphony No. 4 (Tippett)|Fourth Symphony]] which was dedicated to Solti.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; Another new work was Tippett's ''Byzantium'', an orchestral song-cycle, premiered by Solti and the orchestra with the [[soprano]] Faye Robinson.

Solti's recordings with the Chicago Symphony included the complete symphonies of Beethoven, Brahms, Bruckner and Mahler.&lt;ref name=d/&gt; Most of his operatic recordings were with other orchestras, but his recordings of ''[[The Flying Dutchman]]'' (1976), ''[[Fidelio]]'' (1979), ''[[Moses und Aron]]'' (1984) and his second recordings of ''Die Meistersinger'' (1995) and [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]]'s ''[[Otello]]'' (1991) were made with the Chicago players.&lt;ref name=d/&gt;

[http://www.charm.rhul.ac.uk/discography/decca.html ''Decca Classical, 1929–2009''],  AHRC Research Centre for the History and Analysis of Recorded Music, accessed 22 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Decca's senior producer, [[Victor Olof]] did not much admire Solti as a conductor&lt;ref&gt;Culshaw (1982) p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; (nor did [[Walter Legge]], Olof's opposite number at EMI's [[Columbia Graphophone Company|Columbia Records]]),&lt;ref&gt;Schwarzkopf, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; but Olof's younger colleague and successor, Culshaw, held Solti in high regard. As Culshaw, and later [[James Walker (conductor)|James Walker]], produced his recordings, Solti's career as a recording artist flourished from the mid-1950s.&lt;ref name=d/&gt; Among the orchestras with whom Solti recorded were the [[Chicago Symphony Orchestra]] and the [[London Philharmonic Orchestra|London Philharmonic]], [[Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra|Vienna Philharmonic]], [[London Symphony Orchestra|London Symphony]] and [[Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra|Berlin Philharmonic]] orchestras.&lt;ref name=d/&gt; Soloists in his operatic recordings included [[Joan Sutherland]], [[Régine Crespin]], [[Plácido Domingo]], [[Gottlob Frick]], [[Carlo Bergonzi]], [[Kiri Te Kanawa]] and [[José van Dam]].&lt;ref name=d/&gt; In concerto recordings, Solti conducted for, among others, [[Julius Katchen]], [[Clifford Curzon]], [[Vladimir Ashkenazy]] and [[Kyung-Wha Chung]].&lt;ref name=d/&gt;

Solti's most celebrated recording was [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]'s ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen]]'' made in Vienna, produced by Culshaw, between 1958 and 1965. It has twice been voted the greatest recording ever made, the first poll being among readers of ''[[Gramophone (magazine)|Gramophone]]'' magazine in 1999,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gramophone.net/Issue/Page/December%201999/40/806832/ &quot;Gramophone Classics&quot;,] ''Gramophone'', December 1999, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; and the second of professional music critics in 2011, for the [[BBC]]'s ''[[BBC Music Magazine|Music Magazine]]''.&lt;ref name=solti100&gt;[http://www.roh.org.uk/news/anniversary-of-sir-georg-soltis-birth-to-be-celebrated &quot;Anniversary of Sir Georg Solti's birth to be celebrated&quot;], Royal Opera House, accessed 15 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
