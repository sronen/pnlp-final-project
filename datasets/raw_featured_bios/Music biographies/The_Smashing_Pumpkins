'''The Smashing Pumpkins''' is an American [[alternative rock]] band that formed in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]] in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;Although frequently referred to as simply &quot;Smashing Pumpkins&quot;, and credited as such on the covers of ''Gish'', ''Siamese Dream'', and ''Zeitgeist'' (and related singles), the band's name has more often been presented as &quot;The Smashing Pumpkins&quot;, dating back to their first demo tape, and exclusively so between ''Mellon Collie'' (1995) and ''Earphoria'' (2002).&lt;/ref&gt; Formed by frontman [[Billy Corgan]] (lead vocals, lead guitar) and [[James Iha]] (rhythm guitar), the band has included [[Jimmy Chamberlin]] (drums), [[Melissa Auf der Maur]] (bass guitar), [[D'arcy Wretzky]] (bass guitar), and currently includes [[Mike Byrne (musician)|Mike Byrne]] (drums), [[Nicole Fiorentino]] (bass guitar, backing vocals), and [[Jeff Schroeder]] (rhythm guitar) among its membership.

Frontman Billy Corgan is the group's primary songwriter—his grand musical ambitions and cathartic lyrics have shaped the band's albums and songs, which have been described as &quot;anguished, bruised reports from Billy Corgan's nightmare-land&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=William Shaw |title=Appetite for Destruction |journal=[[Details (magazine)|Details]] |date=December 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Smashing Pumpkins broke into the musical mainstream with their second album, 1993's ''[[Siamese Dream]]''. The group built its audience with extensive touring and their 1995 follow-up, the double album ''[[Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness]]'', debuted at number one on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] album chart. With 18.75&amp;nbsp;million albums sold in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=2&amp;table=tblTopArt&amp;action= |title=Searchable Database |work=riaa.com |accessdate=1 March 2012}}{{Dead link|date=March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;There are differing reports on the Pumpkins's worldwide sales at the time of their breakup: Jim DeRogatis, in December 2000, reported a total of &quot;twenty-two million copies sold&quot;. David Fricke, that same month, wrote of the band's &quot;more than twenty-five million records sold worldwide&quot;.

However, internal fighting, drug use, and diminishing record sales led to a 2000 break-up.

In 2006, Billy Corgan and Jimmy Chamberlin reconvened to record a new Smashing Pumpkins album, ''[[Zeitgeist (The Smashing Pumpkins album)|Zeitgeist]]''. The band toured with a rotating lineup of between five and nine musicians through much of 2007 and 2008 with new member Jeff Schroeder before Chamberlin left the band in early 2009. New drummer Mike Byrne and bassist Nicole Fiorentino solidified a new lineup with Corgan and Schroeder, toured through much of 2010 and 2011, and are currently recording the album ''[[Teargarden by Kaleidyscope]]'' and the album-within-an-album ''[[Oceania (album)|Oceania]]''.

=== Early years: 1988–1991 ===

Left to right: [[James Iha]], [[D'arcy Wretzky]], [[Billy Corgan]], [[Jimmy Chamberlin]]]]
After the breakup of his [[gothic rock]] band The Marked, singer and guitarist Billy Corgan left [[St. Petersburg, Florida|St. Petersburg]], [[Florida]], to return to his native city of Chicago, where he took a job in a record store and hatched the idea of a new band that would be called &quot;The Smashing Pumpkins&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;atn&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.starla.org/articles/dares.htm |title=Smashing Pumpkin D'Arcy Dares To Be Happy |author=Michael Goldberg |work=[[Addicted to Noise]] |accessdate=4 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; While working there, he met guitarist James Iha. Adorning themselves with [[Paisley (design)|paisley]] and other psychedelic trappings, the two began writing songs together (with the aid of a [[drum machine]]) that were heavily influenced by [[The Cure]] and [[New Order]].&lt;ref name=&quot;seeds&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kot |first=Greg |title=Pumpkin Seeds |journal=[[Guitar World]] |date=January 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The duo performed live for the first time on 9 July 1988 at the Polish bar Chicago 21. This performance included only Corgan and Iha with a drum machine.&lt;ref name=infighting&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kelly |first=Christina |title=Smashing Pumpkins: The Multi-Platinum Band Is Over the Infighting But Can the Harmony Last? |journal=[[US Weekly]] |date=1 December 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter, Corgan met D'arcy Wretzky after a show by the [[Dan Reed Network]] where they argued the merits of the band. After finding out Wretzky played bass guitar, Corgan recruited her into the lineup and the now-trio played a show at the Avalon Nightclub.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=From Fighting to Smashing |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=19 November 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;modern drummer&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title=Jimmy Chamberlin [interview] |journal=[[Modern Drummer]] |date=January 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; After this show, [[Metro Chicago|Cabaret Metro]] owner [[Joe Shanahan]] agreed to book the band on the condition that they replace the drum machine with a live drummer. 

[[Jazz]] drummer Jimmy Chamberlin was recommended by a friend of Corgan's.&lt;ref name=&quot;modern drummer&quot;/&gt; Chamberlin knew little of alternative music and immediately changed the sound of the nascent band. As Corgan recalled of the period, &quot;We were completely into the sad-rock, Cure kind of thing. It took about two or three practices before I realized that the power in his playing was something that enabled us to rock harder than we could ever have imagined.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;seeds&quot;/&gt; On 5 October 1988, the complete band took the stage for the first time at the Cabaret Metro.&lt;ref name=&quot;modern drummer&quot;/&gt;

In 1989, The Smashing Pumpkins made their first appearance on record with the compilation album ''Light Into Dark'', which featured several Chicago alternative bands. The group released its first [[Single (music)|single]], &quot;[[I Am One]]&quot;, in 1990 on local Chicago label Limited Potential. The single sold out and they released a follow-up, &quot;[[Tristessa (song)|Tristessa]]&quot;, on [[Sub Pop]], after which they signed to [[Caroline Records (U.S.)|Caroline Records]].&lt;ref name=&quot;advocate&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Keedle |first=Jayne |title=Patchin' It Back Together |newspaper=[[Advocate Weekly Newspapers#The Hartford Advocate|Hartford Advocate]] |date=1 October 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band recorded their 1991 debut [[studio album]] ''[[Gish]]'' with producer [[Butch Vig]] at his [[Smart Studios]] in [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]], [[Wisconsin]] for $20,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Kot |first=Greg |title=Out of the Patch for Smashing Pumpkins, New Album Is Another Sign of Liftoff |newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=21 June 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to gain the consistency he desired, Corgan often played all instruments save drums, which created tension in the band. The music fused [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] guitars, [[psychedelia]], and [[dream pop]], garnering them comparisons to [[Jane's Addiction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rotondi |first=James |title=Orange Crunch |journal=[[Guitar Player]] |date=January 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gish'' became a minor success, with the single &quot;[[Rhinoceros (song)|Rhinoceros]]&quot; receiving some airplay on [[modern rock]] radio. After releasing the [[Lull (EP)|''Lull'' EP]] in October 1991 on Caroline Records, the band formally signed with [[Virgin Records]], which was affiliated with Caroline.&lt;ref name=&quot;advocate&quot;/&gt; The band supported the album with a tour that included opening for bands such as the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]], Jane's Addiction, and [[Guns N' Roses]]. During the tour, Iha and Wretzky went through a messy breakup, Chamberlin became addicted to narcotics and alcohol, and Corgan entered a deep depression,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hilburn |first=Robert |title=Smashing Pumpkins Endures When (and What) Other '90s Bands Couldn't |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=3 August 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; writing some songs for the upcoming album in the parking garage where he lived at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://music.yahoo.com/read/news/12032575 |title=Smashing Pumpkin Billy Corgan Leaving Hometown of Chicago |last=Davis |first=Darran |work=Yahoo!

=== Mainstream success: 1992–1994 ===
With the breakthrough of alternative rock into the American mainstream due to the popularity of [[grunge]] bands such as [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] and [[Pearl Jam]], The Smashing Pumpkins were poised for major commercial success. At this time, the Pumpkins were routinely lumped in with the grunge movement, with Corgan protesting, &quot;We've graduated now from [being called] 'the next Jane's Addiction' to 'the next Nirvana,' now we're 'the next Pearl Jam.'&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |last= Corgan |first= Billy |program= 120 Minutes |callsign= MTV |date=October 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Amid this environment of intense internal pressure for the band to break through to widespread popularity, the band relocated to [[Marietta, Georgia]] in late 1992 to begin work on their second album, with Butch Vig returning as producer.&lt;ref name=&quot;seeds&quot; /&gt; The decision to record so far away from their hometown was motivated partly by the band's desire to avoid friends and distractions during the recording, but largely as a desperate attempt to cut Chamberlin off from his known drug connections.&lt;ref name=&quot;seeds&quot; /&gt;  The recording environment for ''[[Siamese Dream]]'' was quickly marred by discord within the band.  As was the case with ''Gish'', Corgan and Vig decided that Corgan should play nearly all of the guitar and bass parts on the album, contributing to an air of resentment.&lt;ref name=&quot;impact&quot;&gt;Azerrad, Michael. &quot;Smashing Pumpkins' Sudden Impact&quot;, ''Rolling Stone''.

Following relentless touring to support the recordings, including headline slots on the 1994 [[Lollapalooza]] tour and at [[Reading Festival]] in 1995, the band took time off to write the follow-up album.

The result was ''[[Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness]]'', a [[double album]] featuring twenty-eight songs and lasting over two hours (the vinyl version of the album contained three records, two extra songs, and an alternate tracklisting). The songs were intended to hang together conceptually as a symbol of the cycle of life and death.&lt;ref name=&quot;infighting&quot; /&gt; Praised by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' as &quot;the group's most ambitious and accomplished work yet&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Farley, Christopher John. &quot;A Journey, Not a Joyride&quot;.

October 14, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; It also garnered seven [[Grammy Awards of 1997|1997 Grammy Award]] nominations, including Album of the Year. The band won only the [[Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance|Best Hard Rock Performance]] award, for the album's lead single &quot;[[Bullet with Butterfly Wings]]&quot;, which was also used in the theme of Discovery Channel's [[Whale Wars]] series. The album spawned five singles—&quot;Bullet with Butterfly Wings&quot;, &quot;[[1979 (song)|1979]]&quot;, &quot;[[Zero (song)|Zero]]&quot;, &quot;[[Tonight, Tonight (The Smashing Pumpkins song)|Tonight, Tonight]]&quot;, and &quot;[[Thirty-Three (song)|Thirty-Three]]&quot;—of which the first three were certified gold and all but &quot;Zero&quot; entered the Top 40. Many of the remaining songs that did not make it onto ''Mellon Collie'' were released as B-sides to the singles, and were eventually compiled in ''[[The Aeroplane Flies High]]'' box set. As a testament to the band's popularity, Virgin Records originally intended to limit the set to 200,000 copies, but produced more after the original run sold out due to overwhelming demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| date=1996-12-16 | title= Pumpkins' &quot;Collectors&quot; Set Has Mass Appeal | publisher = MTV.com| url= http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1434226/12161996/smashing_pumpkins.jhtml | accessdate=2006-08-30| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1434226/12161996/smashing_pumpkins.jhtml| archivedate = May 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Corgan later said the decision to continue touring was the worst decision the band had ever made, damaging both their music and their reputation.&lt;ref name=&quot;seeds&quot; /&gt; Meanwhile the band had given interviews since the release of ''Mellon Collie'' stating that it would be the last conventional Pumpkins record,&lt;ref name=zeroguitar&gt;Di Perna, Alan. &quot;Zero Worship&quot;, ''Guitar World''.

=== ''Adore'', ''Machina'', and breakup: 1998–2000 ===

The band adopted a darker, more subdued look to accompany the release of their fourth album, ''Adore''.]]
After the release of ''Mellon Collie'', the Pumpkins contributed multiple songs to various compilations. Released in early 1997, the song &quot;[[Eye (song)|Eye]]&quot; relied almost exclusively on electronic instruments and signaled a drastic shift from the Pumpkins’ previous musical styles. At the time, Corgan stated his &quot;idea [was] to reconfigure the focus and get away from the classic guitars-bass-drum rock format.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Gundersen, Edna. &quot;Smashing that Pumpkins stereotype Band shuns 'tragic' label', ''[[USA Today]]''. February 26, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, the group contributed &quot;[[The End is the Beginning is the End]]&quot; to the [[Film soundtrack|soundtrack]] for the film ''[[Batman &amp; Robin (film)|Batman &amp; Robin]]''. With [[Matt Walker (drummer)|Matt Walker]] on drums, the song featured a heavy sound similar to &quot;Bullet With Butterfly Wings&quot; while still having strong electronic influences. The song later won the [[Grammy Awards of 1998|1998 Grammy]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance|Best Hard Rock Performance]]. Though Corgan announced that the song represented the sound people could expect from the band in the future,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | people = Chris Connelly | title = MTV's Week in Rock | medium = TV-Series| publisher = MTV | date = 1997-05-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the band’s next album would feature few guitar driven songs.

Recorded following the death of Corgan's mother and his divorce, 1998's ''[[Adore (The Smashing Pumpkins album)|Adore]]'' represented a significant change of style from the Pumpkins' previous guitar-based rock, veering into electronica. The record, cut with assistance from studio drummers and drum machines, was infused with a darker aesthetic than much of the band's earlier work. The group also modified its public image, shedding its alternative hipster look for a more subdued appearance. Although ''Adore'' received favorable reviews and was nominated for Best Alternative Performance at the Grammy Awards, the album had only sold about 830,000 copies in the United States by the end of the year, which led the music industry to consider it a failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Fricke, David | date=1998-12-29| title= When Billy Corgan Speaks... | publisher =RollingStone.com | url= http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/smashingpumpkins/articles/story/5921548/when_billy_corgan_speaks | accessdate=2006-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album nonetheless sold three times as many copies overseas.&lt;ref name=&quot;seeds&quot; /&gt; The band embarked on a seventeen-date, fifteen-city charity North American tour in support of ''Adore''. At each stop on the tour, the band donated 100 percent of tickets sales to a local charity organization. The tour's expenses were entirely funded out of the band's own pockets. All told, the band donated over $2.8&amp;nbsp;million to charity as a result of the tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | date=1998-09-22| title=Smashing Pumpkins Raise Over $2.8 Million on Charity Tour| publisher =MTV.com| url= http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1434191/09221998/smashing_pumpkins.jhtml | accessdate=2006-08-30| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070509173841/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1434191/09221998/smashing_pumpkins.jhtml| archivedate = May 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, the band surprised fans by reuniting with a rehabilitated Jimmy Chamberlin for a brief tour dubbed &quot;The Arising&quot;, which showcased both new and classic material. The lineup was short-lived, however, the band announced the departure of Wretzky in September during work on the album ''[[Machina/The Machines of God]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | date=1999-09-10| title= D'Arcy Exits Smashing Pumpkins | publisher =Billboard.com | url= http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/search/google/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=950611 | accessdate=2007-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former [[Hole (band)|Hole]] bassist [[Melissa Auf der Maur]] was recruited for the &quot;Sacred and Profane&quot; tour in support of the album and appeared in the videos accompanying its release.

On May 23, 2000, in a live radio interview on [[KROQ-FM]] (Los Angeles), Billy Corgan announced the band's decision to break up at the end of that year following additional touring and recording.&lt;ref name=breakup /&gt; The group's final album before the break-up, ''[[Machina II/The Friends &amp; Enemies of Modern Music]]'', was released in September 2000 in a limited pressing on vinyl with permission and instructions for free redistribution on the Internet by fans. Only twenty-five copies were cut, each of which was hand numbered and given to friends of the band along with band members themselves. The album, released under the [[Constantinople Records]] label created by Corgan, consisted of one double LP and three ten-inch EPs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.spfc.org/songs-releases/discog.html?discog_id=153 | title=''Machina II/The Friends and Enemies of Modern Music'' | work=The Smashing Pumpkins Fan Collaborative Discography (SPFC.org) | accessdate=2007-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Originally, the band asked Virgin to offer ''Machina II'' as a free download to anyone who bought ''Machina''. When the record label declined, Corgan opted to release the material independently.&lt;ref name=wonder&gt;{{cite web | author=Fricke, David| date=2000-12-22| title=Smashing Pumpkins Look Back in Wonder| publisher=RollingStone.com| url= http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/smashingpumpkins/articles/story/5918770/smashing_pumpkins_look_back_in_wonder | accessdate=2006-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 2, 2000, The Smashing Pumpkins played a farewell concert at The Metro, the same Chicago club where their career had effectively started twelve years earlier. The four-hour-long show featured 35 songs spanning the group's career, and attendees were given a recording of the band’s first concert at The Metro, ''[[Live at Cabaret Metro 10-5-88]]''.&lt;ref name=wonder /&gt; The single &quot;[[Untitled (The Smashing Pumpkins song)|Untitled]]&quot; was released commercially to coincide with the farewell show.

=== Post-breakup: 2001–2004 ===
In 2001, the compilation ''[[Rotten Apples]]'' was released. The double-disc version of the album, released as a limited edition, included a B-sides/rarities collection called &lt;!--SEE JUDAS O DISCUSSION--&gt;''[[Judas O]]''. The ''[[Greatest Hits Video Collection]]'' DVD was also released at the same time, which compiled all of the Pumpkins promo videos from ''Gish'' to ''Machina'' along with unreleased material.&lt;ref&gt;There is one notable omission, &quot;The End Is the Beginning Is the End&quot;. This was excluded because the rights are owned by [[Warner Bros.]], who loaned out the band from their regular label, Virgin Records.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Vieuphoria'' was released on DVD in 2002, as was the soundtrack album ''[[Earphoria]]'', previously released solely to radio stations in 1994.

Billy Corgan and Jimmy Chamberlin reunited in 2001 as members of Corgan's next project, the short-lived [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] [[Zwan]]. The group's only album, ''[[Mary Star of the Sea (album)|Mary Star of the Sea]]'', was released in 2003. After cancelling a few festival appearances, Corgan announced the demise of the band in 2003. During 2001, Corgan also toured as part of [[New Order]] and provided vocals on their comeback album ''[[Get Ready (New Order album)|Get Ready]]''. In October 2004, Corgan released his first book, ''[[Blinking with Fists]]'', a collection of poetry. In June 2005, he released a solo album, ''[[TheFutureEmbrace]]'', which he described as &quot;(picking) up the thread of the as-of-yet-unfinished work of the Smashing Pumpkins&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;message&quot;&gt;Corgan, Billy. &quot;A Message to Chicago from Billy Corgan&quot;, ''Chicago Tribune'', June 21, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, it was greeted with generally mixed reviews and lackluster sales. Only one single, &quot;Walking Shade&quot;, was released in support of the album.

In addition to drumming with Zwan, Jimmy Chamberlin also formed an alternative rock/[[jazz fusion]] project band called [[Jimmy Chamberlin Complex|The Jimmy Chamberlin Complex]]. The group released an album in 2005 titled ''[[Life Begins Again]]''. Corgan provided guest vocals on the track &quot;Lokicat&quot;. James Iha served as a guitarist in [[A Perfect Circle]], appearing on their ''Thirteenth Step'' club tour and 2004 album, ''[[eMOTIVe]]''. He has also been involved with other acts such as [[Chino Moreno]]'s [[Team Sleep]] and [[Vanessa and the O's]]. He continues to work with his own record label as well, [[Scratchie Records]]. D'arcy Wretzky has, aside from one radio interview in 2009, not made any public statements or appearances nor given any interviews since leaving the band in 1999. On January 25, 2000, she was arrested after she allegedly purchased three bags of crack [[cocaine]], but after successfully completing a court-ordered drug education program, the charges were dropped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= Rosen, Craig| date= 2000-05-22| title= Ex-Pumpkin D'Arcy Wretzky Has Crack Case Wiped Clean | publisher =Yahoo.com | url= http://music.yahoo.com/read/news/12051688?ev=29644410 | accessdate=2006-05-08}} {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Corgan insisted during this period that the band would not reform, although when Zwan broke up he announced, &quot;I think my heart was in Smashing Pumpkins [...] I think it was naive of me to think that I could find something that would mean as much to me.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= Dansby, Andrew| date= 2003-09-15| title= Zwan Call It Quits | publisher= RollingStone.com | url= http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/zwan/articles/story/5935907/zwan_call_it_quits | accessdate=2007-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corgan said in 2005, &quot;I never wanted to leave the Smashing Pumpkins.

On June 21, 2005, the day of the release of his album ''[[TheFutureEmbrace]]'', Corgan took out full-page advertisements in the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' and ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' to announce that he planned to reunite the band. &quot;For a year now&quot;, Corgan wrote, &quot;I have walked around with a secret, a secret I chose to keep.

The band's new album, ''[[Zeitgeist (The Smashing Pumpkins album)|Zeitgeist]]'', was released that same month on [[Reprise Records]], entering the ''Billboard'' charts at number two and selling 145,000 copies in its first week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Hasty, Katie | date= 2007-07-18 | title=T.I.

The album divided the Pumpkins' fanbase. Corgan would later admit, &quot;I know a lot of our fans are puzzled by ''Zeitgeist''. I think they wanted this massive, grandiose work, but you don't just roll out of bed after seven years without a functioning band and go back to doing that&quot;.

Corgan and Chamberlin continued to record as a duo, releasing the four-song EP ''[[American Gothic (Smashing Pumpkins EP)|American Gothic]]'' in January 2008 and the singles &quot;[[Superchrist]]&quot; and &quot;[[G.L.O.W.]]&quot; later that year.&lt;ref name=&quot;spinner319&quot;&gt;{{cite web | author = Luerssen, John D. | date= 2008-03-19 | title=Smashing Pumpkins Entering the Studio to Plot Their Next Move | publisher=Spinner.com | url=http://www.spinner.com/2008/03/19/smashing-pumpkins-entering-the-studio-to-plot-their-next-move/ | accessdate= 2008-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; That November, the group released the DVD ''[[If All Goes Wrong]]'', which chronicled the group's 2007 concert residences in [[Asheville, North Carolina]] and San Francisco, California. In late 2008, the band embarked on a controversy-riddled 20th Anniversary Tour.  Around this time, Corgan said the group will make no more full-length records in order to focus exclusively on singles, explaining, &quot;The listening patterns have changed, so why are we killing ourselves to do albums, to create balance, and do the arty track to set up the single? It's done.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Kot, Greg |title=Billy Corgan dishes on the Smashing Pumpkins: The past is dead to me |date= 2008-12-09 |url=http://leisureblogs.chicagotribune.com/turn_it_up/2008/12/billy-corgan-di.html | publisher=ChicagoTribune.com | accessdate=2008-12-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Listen |filename=Smashing_Pumpkins - Cherub Rock.ogg |title=&quot;Cherub Rock&quot; |description=Sample of &quot;Cherub Rock&quot; from ''Siamese Dream'' (1993), which features layers of guitar overdubs influenced by [[arena rock]] and [[shoegazing]], as well as repeated use of &quot;the Pumpkin chord&quot;.}}
The direction of the band is dominated by its sole permanent member Billy Corgan, who is the principal songwriter, lead singer, and sonic architect behind the group's recordings. Corgan has justified his continued use of the name, minus the other original members, by stressing that &quot;for whatever reason, the Smashing Pumpkins, the idea of the band or the spirit of the band, has always pushed me to force myself out of my comfort zone.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Patalano |first=Heidi |url=http://www.metro.us/newyork/entertainment/article/998306--billy-corgan-discusses-new-tour-r-e-m-s-break-up-and-the-smashing-pumpkins |title=Billy Corgan discusses new tour, R.E.M's break up and the Smashing Pumpkins |work=Metro |date=18 October 2011 |accessdate=4 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Journalist Greg Kot wrote, &quot;The music [of The Smashing Pumpkins] would not be what it is without his ambition and vision, and his famously fractured relationships with his family, friends, and bandmembers.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;seeds&quot; /&gt; Corgan has said he strives for atmospheric soundscapes that essentially tell the listener, &quot;Welcome to Pumpkin Land, this is what it sounds like on Planet Pumpkin.&quot;{{sfn|DeRogatis|p=76}}

''The Smashing Pumpkins 1991–2000: Greatest Hits Video Collection'' (Virgin Records, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Corgan has defined the band's aim as &quot;trying to find a synthesis of an alternative idealism combined with classic rock musical values, and then somehow take those things into the mainstream in a subversive way.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.bullz-eye.com/2010/07/15/a-chat-with-billy-corgan/ |title=A Chat with Billy Corgan |last=Harris |first=Will |date=15 July 2010 |work=bullz-eye.com |accessdate=4 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pumpkins' grand, heavily overdubbed production was inspired by 1970s [[arena rock]] bands [[Queen (band)|Queen]], [[Boston (band)|Boston]], and [[Electric Light Orchestra]], while their aggressive hard rock sound and emphasis on virtuoso guitar playing drew heavily from [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] bands such as [[Black Sabbath]], [[Pantera]], and [[Judas Priest]].&lt;ref name=&quot;zeroguitar&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;rs94&quot; &gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.starla.org/articles/rs94.htm |title=RS 94 |work=starla.org |accessdate=4 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Corgan |first=Billy |title=Guitar Geek USA [column] |journal=Guitar World |date=August 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another strong thread in the Pumpkins' sound can be traced to '80s [[post-punk]] and [[gothic rock]] bands like [[Joy Division]]/[[New Order]], [[Bauhaus (band)|Bauhaus]], and [[The Cure]].&lt;ref name=&quot;rs94&quot; /&gt; [[Psychedelic rock]] has been an influence, particularly on the early era of the band,&lt;ref&gt;Commentary for &quot;Siva&quot; music video.

Many of Corgan's lyrics for the Pumpkins are cathartic expressions of emotion, full of personal musings and strong indictments of himself and those close to him.&lt;ref name=&quot;seeds&quot; /&gt; Music critics have often criticized Corgan's angst-filled lyrics. [[Jim DeRogatis]] wrote in 1993 that they &quot;too often sound like sophomoric poetry&quot;,{{sfn|DeRogatis|p=80}} although he viewed the lyrics of later albums ''Adore'' and ''Machina'' as an improvement.{{sfn|DeRogatis|p=88}}

Regarding the band's influence upon other groups, Greg Kot has said, &quot;Whereas Nirvana spawned countless mini-Nirvanas, the Pumpkins remain an island unto themselves.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;seeds&quot; /&gt; However, many artists and bands have mentioned the Pumpkins as an influence, including [[Nelly Furtado]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://music.uk.launch.yahoo.com/read/interview/12058557 |last=Parker |first=Lyndsey |title=Exclusive LAUNCH Artist Chat |last=Parker |first=Lyndsey |date=25 October 2010 |accessdate=4 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Annuals]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Mackey |first=Robbie |title=http://www.indyweek.com/indyweek/billy-corgans-bombast-was-mothers-milk/Content?oid=1210239 |work=[[Independent Weekly]] |date=13 August 2008 |url=http://www.indyweek.com/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A262341 |accessdate=2 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[My Chemical Romance]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.musicpix.net/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=41&amp;mode=thread&amp;order=0&amp;thold=0 |title=Interviews: My Chemical Romance - Interview with Gerard Way - Live Photos |last=Tyme |first=Gwyn |date=5 May 2005 |work=MusicPix |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070927062100/http://www.musicpix.net/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=41&amp;mode=thread&amp;order=0&amp;thold=0 |archivedate=27 September 2007 |accessdate=4 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pumpkinsstatus&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1495856/my-chemical-romance-aim-pumpkins-status.jhtml |last=Montgomery |first=James |date=13 January 2005 |title=My Chemical Romance Aim For Smashing Pumpkins Status |work=mtv.com |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1495856/01132005/my_chemical_romance.jhtml |accessdate=4 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kill Hannah]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.concertlivewire.com/interviews/hannahint.htm |title=Interview with Kill Hannah's Mat Devine |date=21 December 2006 |work=concertlivewire.com |accessdate=4 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Deftones]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Interview with Chino Moreno |journal=[[Kerrang!]] |date=April 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics have found connections with the Pumpkins' sound in various Deftones albums,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.avrev.com/music-disc-reviews/audio-cd/deftones-white-pony.html |title=Deftones - White Pony |author=Bryan Dailey |date=3 October 2000 |work=AVRev.com |accessdate=4 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Rolls |first=Chris |date=25 September 2005 |title=Great Albums: Alternative Metal/Deftones—''Deftones'' (2003) |work=[[MP3.com]] |url=http://www.mp3.com/news/stories/1604.html |accessdate=17 December 2007}}{{dead link|date=March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/review/deftones-saturday-night-wrist/ |title=Deftones: Saturday Night Wrist |author=Adrien Begrand |date=6 November 2006 |work=[[PopMatters]] |accessdate=4 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in the work of [[Silversun Pickups]] and early [[Feeder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Serpick |first=Evan |date=24 July 2006 |title=Silversun Pickups: ''Carnavas'' |work=rollingstone.com |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/silversunpickups/albums/album/10850284/review/10962883/carnavas |accessdate=21 January 2009 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20081229225809/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/silversunpickups/albums/album/10850284/review/10962883/carnavas &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt; |archivedate=December 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9428-carnavas/ |title=Silversun Pickups: Carnavas |author=Rachel Khong |date=2 October 2006 |work=[[Pitchfork Media|Pitchfork]] |accessdate=4 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Music videos ==

The Smashing Pumpkins have been praised for being &quot;responsible for some of the '90s' most striking and memorable video clips&quot; and for having &quot;approached videos from a completely artistic standpoint rather than mere commercials to sell albums&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/r559297 |title=Greatest Hits &lt;nowiki&gt;[Video/DVD]&lt;/nowiki&gt; |author=Greg Prato |work=Allmusic |accessdate=4 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; MTV's 2001 anniversary special ''Testimony: 20&amp;nbsp;Years of Rock on MTV'' credited the Pumpkins, along with [[Nine Inch Nails]], with treating music videos as an art form during the 1990s. Corgan has said, &quot;We generally resisted the idea of what I call the classic MTV rock video, which is like lots of people jumping around and stuff.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Commentary for &quot;Bullet with Butterfly Wings&quot; music video. ''The Smashing Pumpkins 1991–2000: Greatest Hits Video Collection'' (Virgin Records, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; The band worked with video directors including [[Kevin Kerslake]] (&quot;Cherub Rock&quot;), [[Samuel Bayer]] (&quot;Bullet with Butterfly Wings&quot;), and, most frequently, the team of [[Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris]] (&quot;[[Rocket (Smashing Pumpkins song)|Rocket]]&quot;, &quot;[[1979 (song)|1979]]&quot;, &quot;Tonight, Tonight&quot;, &quot;The End is the Beginning is the End&quot;, and &quot;[[Perfect (The Smashing Pumpkins song)|Perfect]]&quot;). Corgan, who was frequently heavily involved in the conception of the videos, said of Dayton and Faris, &quot;I know my [initial] versions are always darker, and they're always talking me into something a little kinder and gentler.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Commentary for &quot;Rocket&quot; music video. ''The Smashing Pumpkins 1991–2000: Greatest Hits Video Collection'' (Virgin Records, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; Videos like &quot;[[Today (The Smashing Pumpkins song)|Today]]&quot;, &quot;Rocket&quot;, and &quot;1979&quot; dealt with images taken from middle American culture, albeit exaggerated. The group's videos so often avoid the literal interpretation of the song lyrics that the video for &quot;Thirty-Three&quot;, with images closely related to the words of the song, was created as an intentional stylistic departure.&lt;ref&gt;Commentary for &quot;Thirty-Three&quot; music video. ''The Smashing Pumpkins 1991–2000: Greatest Hits Video Collection'' (Virgin Records, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;
The band was nominated for several [[MTV Video Music Awards]] during the 1990s. In 1996, the group won seven VMAs total for the &quot;1979&quot; and &quot;Tonight, Tonight&quot; videos, including the top award, Video of the Year, for &quot;Tonight, Tonight&quot;. The video was also nominated for a Grammy at the 1997 ceremony. Fans reacted with equal fervor. Of the &quot;Tonight, Tonight&quot; video, Corgan remarked, &quot;I don't think we've ever had people react [like this]...  it just seemed to touch a nerve.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |last=Corgan |first=Billy |program=Smashing Pumpkins Videography |callsign=MTV |year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after the band's initial breakup, the ''[[Greatest Hits Video Collection]]'' was released, collecting the band's music videos from 1991–2000 and including commentary from Corgan, Iha, Chamberlin, and various music video directors with outtakes, live performances, and the &quot;Try, Try, Try&quot; extended short film. The band has released several music videos since the reunion to [[YouTube]] and other online sources.
