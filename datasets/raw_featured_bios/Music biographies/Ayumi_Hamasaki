{{nihongo|'''Ayumi Hamasaki'''|浜崎 あゆみ|''Hamasaki Ayumi''|also {{nihongo2|濱崎 歩}}; born October 2, 1978}} is a Japanese singer-songwriter, record producer, model, lyricist, and actress. Also called &quot;'''Ayu'''&quot; by her fans, Hamasaki has been dubbed the &quot;Empress of [[Pop music|Pop]]&quot; because of her popularity and widespread influence in [[Japan]] and throughout [[Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first=Lisa |last=Takeuchi Cullen |url=http://www.time.com/time/asia/features/ayumi_hamasaki/ |title=Empress of Pop |publisher=''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' |accessdate=January 24, 2008 |pages=Splash |date=March 25, 2002 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080102082430/www.time.com/time/asia/features/ayumi_hamasaki/ |archivedate=January 2, 2008 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;TalkAsia&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cnnasiapacific.com/programs/en/program/15/ | title=Talk Asia&amp;nbsp;— Program Descriptions|publisher=[[Turner International|Turner International Asia Pacific]]| accessdate=February 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Born and raised in [[Fukuoka]], she moved to [[Tokyo]] at fourteen to pursue a career in entertainment. In 1998, under the tutelage of [[Avex]] CEO [[Max Matsuura]], she released a string of modestly selling singles that concluded with her 1999 debut album ''[[A Song for ××]]''. The album debuted atop the [[Oricon]] charts and stayed there for four weeks, establishing her popularity in Japan.&lt;ref group=fn name=&quot;NFN&quot; /&gt;

Hamasaki's constantly changing image and tight control over her artistry has helped her popularity extend across Asia; music and fashion trends she has started have spread to countries such as [[People's Republic of China|China]], [[Singapore]], and [[Southeast Asia]]. She has appeared in or lent her songs to many advertisements and television commercials. Though she originally supported the exploitation of her popularity for commercial purposes, she later reconsidered and eventually opposed her status as an Avex &quot;product&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;NTVinterview&quot; /&gt;

Since her 1998 debut with the single &quot;[[Poker Face (Ayumi Hamasaki song)|Poker Face]]&quot;,&lt;ref group=fn name=&quot;NFN&quot;&gt;Oricon does not count ''[[Nothing from Nothing (EP)|Nothing from Nothing]]'', released by [[Nippon Columbia]], among Hamasaki's albums.&lt;/ref&gt; Hamasaki has sold over 50 million records in Japan, making her the best selling solo singer in Japanese history as well as one of the country's most successful songwriters, ranking her among the best-selling singers in the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbcayumi&quot;/&gt; As a female singer, Hamasaki holds several domestic records for her singles, such as the most number-one hits overall by a female artist, the most consecutive number-one hits by a solo artist,&lt;ref name=&quot;record&quot;&gt;{{ja icon}} {{cite news | title = 浜崎あゆみ、シングル25作連続首位で歴代単独1位　松田聖子の記録22年ぶり更新 | url = http://www.oricon.co.jp/news/confidence/80699/full/ | publisher = [[Oricon]] | date = 2010-10-05 | accessdate = 2010-10-04 | language = Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; the highest sales, and the most million-sellers.&lt;ref&gt;{{ja icon}} {{cite news|url=http://www.oricon.co.jp/news/rankmusic/46603/ | title=A Great Achievement&amp;nbsp;— Hamasaki Ayumi Ties with Akina Nakamori for the Achievement of Five Crowns|publisher=[[Oricon]]| date=July 24, 2007|accessdate=March 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=fn&gt;This last record is shared with [[Pink Lady (band)|Pink Lady]], [[Namie Amuro]], and [[Hikaru Utada]].&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1999, Hamasaki has had at least one single each year topping the charts (except 2011, which she released a mini-album, ''[[Five (EP)|Five]]'', without any singles).&lt;ref name=&quot;fierce&quot; /&gt; Hamasaki is the first female singer to have eight studio albums since her debut to top the [[Oricon]] and the first artist to have a number-one album for 13 consecutive years since her debut.&lt;ref&gt;{{ja icon}} {{cite news |url=http://www.oricon.co.jp/news/rankmusic/39829/ | title=Ayumi Hamasaki's Feat!

==Life and music career==
===Childhood and early endeavors===
Born in [[Fukuoka Prefecture]], Hamasaki was raised as an only child by her mother and grandmother. Her father had left the family when she was three and never again came into contact with her.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rockin&quot;&gt;{{ja icon}} {{cite journal | first=Atsushi | last=Shikano | title=Interview with Ayumi Hamasaki| journal=Rockin'on japan| date=February 20, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Time&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last=Takeuchi Cullen| first=Lisa| url=http://www.time.com/time/asia/features/ayumi_hamasaki/cover3.html |title=Empress of Pop| publisher= ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''| accessdate=November 28, 2011 | page=3 | date=March 25, 2002 | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20020403135213/http://www.time.com/time/asia/features/ayumi_hamasaki/cover3.html | archivedate=2002-04-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hamasaki's mother worked to support the family, so Hamasaki was primarily taken care of by her grandmother.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rockin&quot;/&gt;

At age seven, Hamasaki began modeling for local institutions, such as banks, to supplement the family's income. She continued this career path by leaving her family at fourteen and moving to Tokyo as a model under SOS, a talent agency.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rockin&quot;/&gt; Her modeling career did not last long; SOS eventually deemed her too short for a model and transferred her to Sun Music, a musicians' agency. Under the name of &quot;Ayumi&quot;, Hamasaki released a rap EP, ''[[Nothing from Nothing (EP)|Nothing from Nothing]]'', on the [[Nippon Columbia]] label in 1995. She was dismissed from the label when the album failed to chart on the Oricon.&lt;ref name=&quot;allmusic&quot; /&gt; After this failure, Hamasaki took up acting and starred in [[B-movies]] such as ''Ladys Ladys!! Sōcho Saigo no Hi'' and [[Japanese television drama|television dramas]] such as ''Miseinen'', which were poorly received by the public.&lt;ref name=&quot;Time&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Metropolis&quot;/&gt; From August 1995 to March 1996, Hamasaki also co-hosted the [[SoundLink]] &quot;[[SoundLink Magazine|magazine]]&quot; {{nihongo|''Hōkago no Ōsama''|放課後の王様||''After-school King''}} for the [[Satellaview|Nintendo Satellaview]] once a week with [[Shigeru Izumiya]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=スーパーファミコンアワー番組表8/1～8/31 ～スーパーファミコンアワー番組ガイド～ |journal=[[Satellaview Tsūshin|サテラビュー通信]] |month=September |year=1995 |volume=2 |pages=33–66 |language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=スーパーファミコンアワー音声連動番組ガイド3/1→3/30 |journal=サテラビュー通信 |month=April |year=1996 |volume=10 |pages=40–73 |language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Growing dissatisfied with her job, Hamasaki quit acting and moved in with her mother, who had recently moved to Tokyo.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rockin&quot;/&gt;

Hamasaki was initially a good student, earning good grades in [[Education in Japan#Junior high school|junior high school]]. Eventually however, she lost faith in the curriculum, thinking that the subjects taught were of no use to her. Her grades worsened as she refused to put her mind to her studies. While living in Tokyo, she attempted to further her studies at [[Horikoshi Gakuen]], a [[Education in Japan#High school|high school]] for [[the arts]], but dropped out in the first year. Hamasaki did not attend school or have a job, so she spent much of her time shopping at [[Shibuya, Tokyo|Shibuya]] boutiques and dancing at [[Velfarre]], an [[avex trax|Avex]]-owned disco club.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rockin&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Time&quot;/&gt;

At Velfarre, she was introduced to her future producer, [[Max Matsuura]], through a friend. After hearing Hamasaki sing [[karaoke]], Matsuura offered her a recording deal, but Hamasaki suspected ulterior motives and turned the offer down.&lt;ref name=&quot;Time&quot;/&gt; He persisted and succeeded in recruiting her for the Avex label in the following year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Time&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Belfiore | first = Michael | url=http://www.musicianguide.com/biographies/1608003868/Ayumi-Hamasaki.html | title=Ayumi Hamasaki Biography | accessdate=June 5, 2008| publisher=Musicianguide.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hamasaki started vocal training, but skipped most of her classes after finding her instructors to be too rigid and the classes dull.&lt;ref name=&quot;Time&quot;/&gt; When she confessed this to Matsuura, he sent her to New York to train her vocals under another method. During her foreign sojourn, Hamasaki frequently corresponded with Matsuura and impressed him with her style of writing. On her return to Japan, he suggested that she try writing her own lyrics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Time&quot;/&gt;

===1998–1999: Rising popularity===
Hamasaki made her debut under Avex on April 8, 1998 with the single &quot;[[Poker Face (Ayumi Hamasaki song)|Poker Face]]&quot;. It—and the following four singles—were not major hits. Hamasaki's debut album, ''[[A Song for ××]]'' (1999), was likewise &quot;unassuming&quot;:&lt;ref name=&quot;VillageVoice&quot; /&gt; the tracks, composed by Yasuhiko Hoshino, Akio Togashi (of [[Da Pump]]), and Mitsuru Igarashi (of [[Every Little Thing (band)|Every Little Thing]]), were &quot;cautious&quot; [[pop rock|pop-rock]] songs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Time&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;VillageVoice&quot; /&gt; However, Hamasaki's lyrics, introspective observations about her feelings and experiences that focused on loneliness and individualism, resonated with the Japanese public.&lt;ref name=&quot;beatfreak1&quot;&gt;{{ja icon}} {{cite journal | title=A Song for XX | journal=Beatfreak | month=January | year=1999 | volume=132}}&lt;/ref&gt; The songs gained Hamasaki a growing following, and the release of the album was a success: it topped the Oricon charts for five weeks and sold over a million copies.&lt;ref name=&quot;allmusic&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p430329/biography|pure_url=yes}} | title=Ayumi Hamasaki | publisher=[[Allmusic]] | accessdate=April 17, 2008 | first=Chris | last=True}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;YCTT&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SCMP&quot;&gt;{{cite news | title = Siege Mentality | page =1 | work =[[South China Morning Post]] | publisher = [[SCMP Group]] | location = Hong Kong, China | date=May 13, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; For her achievements, she earned a [[Japan Gold Disc Award]] for &quot;Best New Artist of the Year&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.riaj.or.jp/e/data/gdisc/1999.html | title=The 14th Japan Gold Disc Award 1999 | accessdate=April 17, 2008 | publisher=[[RIAJ]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With ''[[Ayu-mi-x]]'' (March 1999), the first of a series of remix albums, Hamasaki began moving beyond the pop-rock of ''A Song for ××'' and began to incorporate different styles including [[trance music|trance]], [[dance music|dance]], and [[orchestra]].&lt;ref name=&quot;VillageVoice&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last= Walters| first =Barry | title =Turning (Japanese) Point | publisher =[[The Village Voice]] | date =March 5, 2002 | url = http://www.villagevoice.com/music/0209,168697,32804,22.html| accessdate=April 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hamasaki began to experiment with different musical styles in her singles as well, releasing dance tunes and ballads as well as remixes on the singles which spanned [[reggae]] and [[house music|house]]. The singles were milestones: Hamasaki earned her first number-one single (&quot;[[Love (Destiny)|Love: Destiny]]&quot;) and first million-selling single (&quot;[[A (EP)|A]]&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;fierce&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ja icon}} {{cite web | url=http://www.riaj.or.jp/data/others/million_list/1999.html | title=Million-Selling Singles of 1999 | publisher=RIAJ | accessdate=April 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her second studio album, ''[[Loveppears]]'' (November 1999), not only topped the Oricon charts, it sold nearly 3 million copies.&lt;ref name=&quot;YCTT&quot;&gt;{{Cite news| title =You Can't Top This | work = [[The Straits Times]] | publisher = [[Singapore Press Holdings]] |location=Singapore | date =November 25, 1999|agency=[[Reuters]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album also showcased a change in Hamasaki's lyrics. Though the lyrics of ''Loveppears'' still dealt with loneliness, many of them were written from a [[Third-person narrative|third-person]] perspective.&lt;ref name=&quot;beatfreak1&quot;&gt;{{ja icon}} {{cite journal | title=Loveppears | journal=Beatfreak | month=November | year=1999 | volume=142}}&lt;/ref&gt; In support of ''Loveppears'', she held her first tour, ''Ayumi Hamasaki Concert Tour 2000 A''.

===2000–2002: Commercial peak===
From April to June 2000, Hamasaki released the &quot;Trilogy&quot;, a series of singles consisting of &quot;[[Vogue (Ayumi Hamasaki song)|Vogue]]&quot;, &quot;[[Far Away (Ayumi Hamasaki song)|Far Away]]&quot;, and &quot;[[Seasons (Ayumi Hamasaki song)|Seasons]]&quot;. The lyrics of these songs focused on hopelessness, a reflection of Hamasaki's disappointment that she had not expressed herself thoroughly in any of her previous lyrics and a sense of shame of her public image.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jpoint&quot;&gt;{{ja icon}} {{cite journal | title=Review of Ayu's Year 2000 &amp; M| journal=J-Point|date= December 22, 2000| volume=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, many of the songs she wrote for her subsequent studio album, ''[[Duty (album)|Duty]]'' (September 2000), involved feelings of loneliness, chaos, confusion, and the burden of her responsibilities. She described her feelings after the writing as &quot;unnatural&quot; and &quot;nervous&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rockin&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cawaii10th&quot;&gt;{{ja icon}}{{cite journal | title=Ayu 10th Year Career Anniversary | journal=Cawaii|month=May|year=2008|pages=15, 18 |author=Tsuriya, Takako}}&lt;/ref&gt; The musical style was darker as well; in contrast with ''Loveppears'', ''Duty'' was a [[rock music|rock]]-influenced album with only one dance song, &quot;[[Audience (song)|Audience]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rockin&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;profilestory&quot;&gt;{{ja icon}} {{cite journal | title=Side Face Story | journal=Cawaii | month=November | year=2007|author=Tsuriya, Takako}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Duty'' resonated with fans: the &quot;Trilogy&quot; were &quot;hit singles&quot; (&quot;Seasons&quot; was a million-seller), and the album became Hamasaki's best-selling studio album.&lt;ref&gt;{{ja icon}} {{cite web | url=http://www.oricon.co.jp/prof/artist/246497/ranking/cd_album/|title=Ranking of Ayumi Hamasaki's Albums by Sales|publisher=[[Oricon]]|accessdate=July 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ja icon}} {{cite web | url=http://www.riaj.or.jp/data/others/million_list/2000.html | title=Million-Selling Singles of 2000 | accessdate=April 19, 2008 | publisher=RIAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of 2000, Hamasaki held her first [[Ayumi Hamasaki Countdown Live 2000-2001 A|New Year countdown concert]] at the [[Yoyogi National Gymnasium]].

In 2001, Avex forced Hamasaki to release her first compilation album, ''[[A Best]]'', on March 28, putting the album in &quot;competition&quot; with [[Hikaru Utada]]'s second studio album, ''[[Distance (album)|Distance]]''. The &quot;competition&quot; between the two singers (which both claimed was merely a creation of their record companies and the media) was supposedly the reason for the success of the albums; both sold over 5 million copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title =J-pop Divas Fight It Out | work = [[The Straits Times]] | publisher = [[Singapore Press Holdings]]| location=Singapore | date =April 20, 2001|agency=[[Reuters]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In support of ''Duty'' and ''A Best'', Hamasaki held a [[Ayumi Hamasaki Dome Tour 2001 A|tour of Japan's domes]], making her one of few &quot;top-drawer&quot; Japanese artists to hold a concert at the [[Tokyo Dome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2007/04/19/2007041961012.html|title=Rain to Perform at Prestigious Tokyo Dome | date=April 19, 2007|accessdate=2010-07-23|publisher=Chosun Ilbo Co|work=[[Chosun Ilbo]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Iam3.PNG|thumb|right|In light of the [[September 11 attacks]], Hamasaki updated the cover of ''I Am...''(2002) to represent peace. (Note the [[Peace symbol#The dove and olive branch|dove]].)]]
''[[I Am... (Ayumi Hamasaki album)|I Am...]]'' (January 2002) marked several milestones for Hamasaki. Hamasaki increased her control over her music by composing all of the songs on the album under the pseudonym &quot;Crea&quot;, of which the 2000 single &quot;[[M (song)|M]]&quot; was the first. &quot;[[Connected (Ayumi Hamasaki song)|Connected]]&quot; (November 2002) and &quot;[[A Song Is Born (song)|A Song Is Born]]&quot; (December 2001) were the exceptions.&lt;ref name=&quot;TimeInterview2&quot;&gt;{{cite news | first=Lisa | last=Takeuchi Cullen |url=http://www.time.com/time/asia/features/ayumi_hamasaki/int_ayumi2.html | title=I have very clear ideas of what I want|publisher= ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''| accessdate=January 2, 2008 | page=2 | date=March 25, 2002 | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071212005108/http://www.time.com/time/asia/features/ayumi_hamasaki/int_ayumi2.html &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt; | archivedate=December 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''I Am...'' also showed evolution in Hamasaki's lyrical style: it was a retreat from the themes of &quot;loneliness and confusion&quot; of some of her earlier songs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Time5&quot;&gt;{{cite news | first=Lisa|last=Takeuchi Cullen|url=http://www.time.com/time/asia/features/ayumi_hamasaki/cover5.html| title=Empress of Pop|publisher= ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''| accessdate=February 2, 2008|page=5 | date=March 25, 2002|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071228123046/http://www.time.com/time/asia/features/ayumi_hamasaki/cover5.html &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt;|archivedate=December 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moved by the [[September 11 attacks]], Hamasaki revised her vision of ''I Am...'', focusing on issues such as faith and world peace. &quot;A Song Is Born&quot;, in particular, was directly influenced by the events.&lt;ref name=&quot;Time5&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;TimeInterview&quot;&gt;{{cite news| first=Lisa | last=Takeuchi Cullen | url=http://www.time.com/time/asia/features/ayumi_hamasaki/int_ayumi.html|title=I have very clear ideas of what I want|publisher=''[[Time Magazine|Time]]''| accessdate=February 16, 2008 | page=1 | date=March 25, 2002| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080214075019/http://www.time.com/time/asia/features/ayumi_hamasaki/int_ayumi.html &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt;| archivedate=February 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The single, a duet with [[Keiko Yamada]], was released as part of Avex's non-profit [[Song Nation]] project, which raised money for charity.&lt;ref&gt;{{ja icon}} {{cite web | url=http://www.avexnet.or.jp/songnation/index.htm | title=Song+Nation|publisher= [[Avex Trax]]| accessdate=January 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ja icon}} {{cite web | url=http://www.chosunonline.com/article/20050121000046 | title=BoA and Hamasaki Ayumi Join Song+Nation's South Korean Release|publisher=Chosun Ilbo Co.|work=[[Chosun Ilbo|Chosunonline.com]]| accessdate=December 1, 2008|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20081207020747/http://www.chosunonline.com/article/20050121000046 &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt;|archivedate=December 7, 2008}} (Paid access required to view article)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=fn&gt;Original text: &quot;このシングルは2001年9月11に米国で発生した同時多発テロを追悼するために企画され、リリースと同時に日本で話題を集めたチャリティーシングル『song+nation』の3枚だ。&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;まず、浜崎あゆみとKEIKOがデュエットした『a song is born』が2001年12月12日にリリースされた。&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; She also dropped the planned cover and opted instead to be portrayed as a &quot;peace muse&quot;, explaining, &lt;blockquote&gt;I had a completely different idea for the cover at first. We'd already reserved the space, decided the hair and makeup and everything. But after the incident, as is typical of me, I suddenly changed my mind.

Realizing that English was a &quot;common global language&quot;, she included English lyrics in three songs.&lt;ref&gt;{{ja icon}} {{cite journal | title=Honey Trap| journal=Cawaii|date=March 1, 2007| volume=8|author=Tsuriya, Takako|pages=19, 21|issue=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=fn name=&quot;lyrics&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref group=fn&gt;Original text from ''Cawaii'': &quot;英語を解禁にしようと思ったのは、アルバムの「Rainbow」からなんだけど、あのころMTVなどで賞をいただいてアジアでパフォーマンスするっていうようをことか何回か続いたの。そのときに、日本語だとやっぱけ傳れってをいかもっていう気がしちゃって、単純な少女はやっぱけ世界共通語だよな~っで思ったんだよね。&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The album was stylistically diverse; Hamasaki included [[rock music|rock]]- and [[trip-hop]]-influenced tracks as well as &quot;summery&quot;, &quot;up-tempo&quot; and &quot;grand gothic&quot; songs and experimented with new techniques such as [[gospel music|gospel]] choruses and the yells of an audience.

===2003–2006===
[[Image:Ayumi Hamasaki - Arena Tour 2006.jpg|thumb|right|Hamasaki performing in her ''(Miss)understood'' tour]]
In 2003, Hamasaki released three singles, &quot;[[&amp; (EP)|&amp;]]&quot;, &quot;[[Forgiveness (song)|Forgiveness]]&quot;, and &quot;[[No Way to Say]]&quot;. To celebrate the release of her thirtieth single (&quot;Forgiveness&quot;), Hamasaki held the ''[[30th Single Collection Live (Ayumi Hamasaki)|A Museum]]'' concert at the Yoyogi National Gymnasium.&lt;ref&gt;{{ja icon}} {{cite journal|title=Interview With Ayumi Hamasaki|journal=Casa Brutus|month=September | year=2004|volume=54|pages=24–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her mini-album ''[[Memorial Address]]'' (December 2003) was her first album to be released in CD+DVD format in addition to the regular CD-only format, a decision that came from her increased interest in the direction of her music videos.&lt;ref&gt;{{ja icon}}{{cite journal | title={{nihongo2|浜崎あゆみ}} | journal=Beat Freak ([[Avex]])| issue=192|date=January 5, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like her previous albums, ''Memorial Address'' topped the Oricon chart and sold over a million copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.riaj.or.jp/data/others/million_list/2003.html | title=Million-Selling Albums of 2003|publisher=RIAJ| accessdate=January 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ja icon}} {{cite web | url=http://www.oricon.co.jp/music/special/041222_01.html|title=Yearly Album Rankings for 2004|publisher=[[Oricon]]|accessdate=December 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sales of Hamasaki's singles began to wane. Although all three of the album's singles topped the Oricon charts, &quot;&amp;&quot; was Hamasaki's last single to sell over 500,000 copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{ja icon}} {{cite news | url=http://www.oricon.co.jp/news/ranking/22658/ | title=Ayumi Hamasaki: Newly Released Details of Her Singles| accessdate=April 23, 2008 | publisher=[[Oricon]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of her [[Ayumi Hamasaki Arena Tour 2003-2004 A|''Arena Tour 2003–2004'']], Hamasaki had grown dissatisfied with her position in Avex: she felt that the company was treating her as a product instead of a person.&lt;ref name=MyStoryInt&gt;{{ja icon}} {{cite journal | title=The First-Time Stench of Being a Human|journal=[[Oricon|Oricon Style]]|date=December 27, 2004|issue= 49–1275|pages=17–19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with her dissatisfaction over her last two studio albums (which she thought had been rushed), this led her to begin work on ''[[My Story (Ayumi Hamasaki album)|My Story]]'' (December 2004) early. In contrast with her previous albums, ''My Story'' had no set theme, nor did Hamasaki attempt to write &quot;something good&quot; or even &quot;something that would give people hope&quot;; rather, she simply wrote freely and honestly.&lt;ref name=&quot;MyStoryInt&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref group=fn&gt;Original text from ''Oricon Style'': &quot;今回、正直にとか自由にっていうことはずっと頭の中にありましたね。だから、いいことを書 こうとか感動してもらおうとか、希望を持ってもらおうっていうようをことは一切意誠していなくて。単純に、ただ正直に書いていこうというだけでした。&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the album contained mostly autobiographical lyrics about her emotions and reminiscences of her career. She approached the composition of the music with the same freedom as the lyrics, with the album's notable rock overtones expressing her liking for rock music.&lt;ref name=&quot;CawaiiF2005&quot;&gt;{{ja icon}} {{cite journal | title=Ayumi Hamasaki: Always our Princess| journal=[[Cawaii]]|date=January 1, 2005|pages=10–15|author=Tsuriya, Takako}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was so pleased with the result that she declared ''My Story'' the first album she felt satisfied with.&lt;ref name=&quot;CawaiiF2005&quot;/&gt; ''My Story'' and its singles, &quot;[[Moments (Ayumi Hamasaki song)|Moments]]&quot;, &quot;[[Inspire (song)|Inspire]]&quot;, and &quot;[[Carols (song)|Carols]]&quot;, all topped the weekly Oricon charts; moreover, with sales of over 1,100,000 units, ''My Story'' became Hamasaki's last million-selling studio album according to Oricon.&lt;ref group=fn name=oricondiscrep /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ja icon}} {{cite web |url=http://www.riaj.or.jp/data/others/million_list/2004.html|title=Million-Selling Albums of 2004|publisher=RIAJ| accessdate=April 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ja icon}} {{cite web | url=http://www.oricon.co.jp/music/special/051219_01_2.html|title=Yearly Album Rankings for 2005|publisher=[[Oricon]]|accessdate=December 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; From January to April 2005, Hamasaki held the nationwide [[Ayumi Hamasaki Arena Tour 2005 A|''My Story'' arena tour]], her first album-based tour.&lt;ref name=MyStoryInt/&gt; Also in January, she began working with [[Lamoureux Orchestra]] to create ''[[My Story Classical]]'', a [[classical music|classical]] version of ''My Story''; the album served as an &quot;alter-ego&quot; of the mostly aggressive ''My Story''.

In addition to writing her own lyrics, Hamasaki has also involved herself in other aspects of production such as artistic direction. Though Max Matsuura is officially credited as the producer of her records, he said of Hamasaki, &quot;Ayu is a very meticulous worker behind the scenes. A lot of the work she does by herself is more in the producer's arena. I think really we should say 'Produced by [A]yumi [H]amasaki'.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20040820032901/http://www.avexnet.or.jp/beatfreak/142/artists/ayumi.html|archivedate=August 20, 2004|url=http://www.avexnet.or.jp/beatfreak/142/artists/ayumi.html|title=Loveppears|last=Kazuki|first=Okabe|work=Beat Freak Online|publisher=[[Avex]]|accessdate=2009-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- quotation translated by Delirium-Zer0 @ http://ahsforum.com/forum/member.php?u=235 --&gt; Until her single &quot;M&quot;, however, Hamasaki left the task of composing to her staff; as she has explained, &quot;I'm not a professional; I lack even basic knowledge about writing music.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;TimeInterview2&quot; /&gt; However, she started to compose her own melodies after her staff had failed to compose a tune for &quot;M&quot; that appealed to her.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rockin&quot;/&gt; Wanting to produce works faithful to her visions, Hamasaki took control of most aspects of her artistry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Time5&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;TimeInterview&quot;/&gt; ''I Am...'' is representative of this stage in Hamasaki's career; she directed the production of its songs, videos, and artwork. She began to compose less after ''I Am...'': whereas nearly all of ''I Am...'' was her work, only nine of ''Rainbow'''s fifteen tracks were composed by her. She was even less involved in the composition of subsequent albums, composing two tracks on ''Memorial Address'', three on ''My Story'', and one on ''(Miss)understood''; since ''Secret'', none of the songs on her studio albums have listed her as a composer. With later albums, Hamasaki also began to delegate to her staff tasks she had once handled herself.&lt;ref name=&quot;CNNinterview&quot;&gt;{{cite video| people=Shubert, Atika (Interviewer) | medium=TV-series | publisher=CNN | location=Japan | title=[[Talk Asia]] |date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hamasaki cites Madonna, [[soul music|soul]] musicians [[Babyface (musician)|Babyface]] and [[En Vogue]], and rock bands [[Led Zeppelin]] and [[Deep Purple]] as her influences and states that she admires [[Michelle Branch]], [[Kid Rock]], [[Joan Osborne]], [[Seiko Matsuda]], [[Rie Miyazawa]], and [[Keiko Yamada]];&lt;ref name=&quot;TimeInterview2&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AvexProfile&quot;/&gt; these diverse influences have led to the variety of her own music.

The reason for the divorce was that, initially, Hamasaki wanted to move in with Schwarz in United States but due to the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami|earthquake and tsunami]] that hit her home country on March, 2011, she began to have a strong desire not to leave [[Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.tokyoreporter.com/2012/01/18/japans-empress-of-pop-ayumi-hamasaki-to-divorce-austrian-actor-husband-kyodo-says | title=Japan’s ‘Empress of Pop’ Ayumi Hamasaki to divorce Austrian actor husband|date=January 18, 2012|accessdate=January 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/entertainment/view/1177364/1/.html | title=Japan's pop queen to divorce Austrian hubby |date=January 17, 2012|accessdate=January 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Nippon TV]] ''News Zero'' aired a brief segment on February 14, 2011, at 22:40[JST] about Josh Sehrer's [[2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami|March 11]] &quot;Japanese Girls Worship Me&quot; documentary and it's ties with Hamasaki's divorce.
