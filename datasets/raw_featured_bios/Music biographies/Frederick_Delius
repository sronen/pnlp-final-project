[[File:Fritz Delius (1907).jpg|thumb|Frederick Delius, aged 45, photographed in 1907]]
'''Frederick Theodore Albert Delius''', [[Order of the Companions of Honour|CH]] (29 January 1862{{spaced ndash}}10 June 1934) was an English composer. Born in the north of England to a prosperous mercantile family of German extraction, he resisted attempts to recruit him to commerce. He was sent to [[Florida]] in the United States in 1884 to manage an orange plantation, where he neglected his managerial duties; influenced by [[African-American music]], he began composing. After a brief period of formal musical study in Germany beginning in 1886, he embarked on a full-time career as a composer in Paris and then in nearby [[Grez-sur-Loing]], where he and his wife [[Jelka Rosen|Jelka]] lived (except during the First World War) for the rest of their lives. 

Delius's first successes came in Germany, where [[Hans Haym]] and other conductors promoted his music from the late 1890s. In Delius's native Britain, it was 1907 before his music made regular appearances in concert programmes, after [[Thomas Beecham]] took it up. Beecham conducted the full premiere of ''[[A Mass of Life]]'' in London in 1909 (he had premiered Part II in Germany in 1908); he staged the opera ''[[A Village Romeo and Juliet]]'' at [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]] in 1910; and he mounted a six-day Delius festival in London in 1929, as well as making gramophone recordings of many of Delius's works. After 1918 Delius began to suffer the effects of [[syphilis]], contracted during his earlier years in Paris. He became paralysed and blind, but completed some late compositions between 1928 and 1932 with the aid of an [[amanuensis]], [[Eric Fenby]].

The lyricism in Delius's early compositions reflected both the music he had heard in America and the influences of European composers such as [[Edvard Grieg]] and [[Richard Wagner]]. As his skills matured, he developed a style uniquely his own, characterised by his individual orchestration and his uses of [[Diatonic and chromatic|chromatic harmony]]. Delius's music has been only intermittently popular, and often subject to critical attacks. The Delius Society, formed in 1962 by his more dedicated followers, continues to promote knowledge of the composer's life and works, and sponsors the annual Delius Prize competition for young musicians.

[[File:Bradford City Hall by John Illingworth.jpg|thumb|upright|The Victorian [[Bradford City Hall|Town Hall in Bradford]], Yorkshire, the city where Delius was born and grew up]]
Delius was born in [[Bradford]] in [[Yorkshire]]. He was baptised as &quot;Fritz Theodore Albert Delius&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= The Delius Birthplace|last= Jones|first= Philip|jstor= 963502|journal= The Musical Times|pages= pp. 990–92|date= December 1979}} {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; and used the forename Fritz until he was about 40.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; He was the second of four sons (there were also ten daughters) born to Julius Delius (1822–1901) and his wife Elise Pauline, ''née'' Krönig (1838–1929).&lt;ref name=dnbarchive&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/olddnb/32775 |title= Delius, Frederick |author= Hadley, Patrick |year=1949 |work= Oxford Dictionary of National Biography archive |publisher= Oxford University Press |accessdate=21 January 2011}} {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; Delius's parents were born in [[Bielefeld]], [[Westphalia]],{{#tag:ref|Now part of the [[Ostwestfalen-Lippe]] region of Germany.|group= n}} of Dutch origin;{{#tag:ref|According to Sir Thomas Beecham, the Dutch Delius family had changed its patronymic from Delij or Deligh to a latinized form of the name some time in the sixteenth century, a common practice at the time.&lt;ref name=mingledchime&gt;Beecham (1944), p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} the family had for some generations been settled in German lands near the Rhine.

He married Elise in 1856.&lt;ref name=dnb&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/32775 |title= Delius, Frederick Theodor Albert (1862–1934) |author= McVeagh, Diana |year=2004 |work= Oxford Dictionary of National Biography |publisher= Oxford University Press |accessdate=21 January 2011}} {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Delius household was musical; famous musicians such as [[Joseph Joachim]] and [[Carlo Alfredo Piatti]] were guests, and played for the family.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; Despite his German parentage, the young Fritz was drawn to the music of [[Frédéric Chopin|Chopin]] and [[Edvard Grieg|Grieg]] rather than the Austro-German music of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] and [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], a preference that endured all his life.&lt;ref name=dnbarchive/&gt; The young Delius was first taught the violin by a Mr. Bauerkeller of the [[The Hallé|Hallé Orchestra]], and had more advanced studies under Mr. Haddock of [[Leeds]]. Although he achieved enough skill as a violinist to set up as a violin teacher in later years, his chief musical joy was to improvise at the piano, and it was a piano piece, a waltz by Chopin, that gave him his first ecstatic encounter with music.&lt;ref name=mgobit/&gt;{{#tag:ref|The Chopin piece was the posthumously published [[Waltz in E minor (Chopin)|Waltz in E minor]].&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;|group= n}} From 1874 to 1878, Delius was educated at [[Bradford Grammar School]], where the singer [[John Coates (tenor)|John Coates]] was his slightly older contemporary.&lt;ref&gt;Beecham (1975), p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; He then attended the [[London International College|International College]] at Isleworth between 1878 and 1880. As a pupil he was neither especially quick nor diligent,&lt;ref name=mgobit/&gt; but the college was conveniently close to London for Delius to attend concerts and opera.&lt;ref name=grove&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/49095|title= Delius, Frederick|first= Robert|last= Anderson|coauthors= Anthony Payne|work= Grove Music Online|publisher=  Oxford Music Online |accessdate=20 October 2010}} {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Julius Delius assumed that his son would play a part in the family wool business, and for the next three years he tried hard to persuade him to do so. Delius's first job was as the firm's representative in [[Stroud]] in [[Gloucestershire]], where he did moderately well. After being sent in a similar capacity to [[Chemnitz]], he neglected his duties in favour of trips to the major musical centres of Germany, and musical studies with [[Hans Sitt]].&lt;ref name=grove/&gt; His father sent him to Sweden, where he again put his artistic interests ahead of commerce, coming under the influence of the Norwegian dramatists [[Henrik Ibsen]] and [[Gunnar Heiberg]]. Ibsen's denunciations of social conventions further alienated Delius from his commercial background.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; Delius was then sent to represent the firm in France, but he frequently absented himself from business for excursions to the [[French Riviera]].&lt;ref name=grove/&gt; After this, Julius Delius recognised that there was no prospect that his son would succeed in the family business, but he remained opposed to music as a profession, and instead sent him to America to manage an orange plantation.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;

=== Florida ===
[[File:Rmh1.jpg|thumb|left|The St. Johns River in Florida, near Solano Grove, where Delius was inspired by the plantation music to write several of his early works.]]
Whether the move to America was Julius's idea or his son's is not known.{{#tag:ref|The composer [[Peter Warlock]] (real name Philip Heseltine) wrote in 1915 that the idea was Frederick's, rather than Julius's, but cites no authority for the statement.&lt;ref name=heseltine/&gt;|group= n}} A leading Florida property firm had branches in several English cities including Bradford; in an article on Delius's time in Florida, William Randel conjectures that either Julius Delius visited the Bradford office and conceived the notion of sending his wayward son to grow oranges in Florida, or that Fritz himself saw it as a way to escape the hated family wool business and suggested the idea to his father.&lt;ref name=randel&gt;{{cite journal|title= Frederick Delius in America|last= Randel|first= William|jstor= 4247665|journal= Virginia Magazine of History and Biography|pages= pp. 349–66|date= July 1971}} {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; Delius was in Florida from the spring of 1884 to the autumn of 1885, living on a plantation at Solano Grove on the [[St. Johns River]], near [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]]. He continued to be engrossed in music, and in Jacksonville he met Thomas Ward, who became his teacher in [[counterpoint]] and [[musical composition|composition]]. Delius later said that Ward's teaching was the only useful music instruction he ever had.&lt;ref&gt;Beecham (1975), p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;

Delius later liked to represent his house at Solano Grove as &quot;a shanty&quot;, but it was a substantial cottage of four rooms, with plenty of space for Delius to entertain guests.{{#tag:ref|The building fell into decay after he left it, but it was rescued by [[Jacksonville University]] and moved to the university campus in 1961 and restored.&lt;ref name= F257&gt;Fenby (1981), p. 257&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} Ward sometimes stayed there, as did an old Bradford friend, Charles Douglas, and Delius's brother Ernest. Protected from excessive summer heat by river breezes and a canopy of oak trees, the house was an agreeable place to live in. Delius paid little attention to the business of growing oranges, and continued to pursue his musical interests. Jacksonville had a rich, though to a European, unorthodox musical life. Randel notes that in local hotels, the African-American waiters doubled as singers, with daily vocal concerts for patrons and passers-by, giving Delius his introduction to spirituals. Additionally, ship owners encouraged their deckhands to sing as they worked. &quot;Delius never forgot the singing as he heard it, day or night, carried sweet and clear across the water to his verandah at Solano Grove, whenever a steam-ship passed; it is hard to imagine conditions less conducive to cultivating oranges—or more conducive to composing.&quot;&lt;ref name=randel/&gt; 

While in Florida, Delius had his first composition published, a polka for piano called ''Zum Carnival''.&lt;ref name=randel/&gt; In late 1885 he left a caretaker in charge of Solano Grove and moved to [[Danville, Virginia]]. Thereafter he pursued a wholly musical career. An advertisement in the local paper announced, &quot;Fritz Delius will begin at once giving instruction in Piano, Violin, Theory and Composition. He will give lessons at the residences of his pupils. Terms reasonable.&quot;&lt;ref name=randel/&gt; Delius also offered lessons in French and German. Danville had a thriving musical life, and early works of his were publicly performed there.&lt;ref name=randel/&gt;

=== Leipzig and Paris===
[[File:Edvard Grieg (1888) by Elliot and Fry - 02.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Edvard Grieg]], who was a strong influence on Delius's earlier music]]
In 1886 Julius Delius agreed to allow his son to pursue a musical career, and paid for him to study music formally. Delius left Danville and returned to Europe via New York, where he paused briefly to give a few lessons.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; Back in Europe he enrolled at the [[Felix Mendelssohn College of Music and Theatre|conservatoire]] in [[Leipzig]], Germany. Leipzig was a major musical centre, where [[Artur Nikisch|Nikisch]] and [[Gustav Mahler|Mahler]] were conductors at the [[Semperoper|Opera House]], and [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]] and [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]] conducted their works at the [[Leipzig Gewandhaus|Gewandhaus]].&lt;ref name=mgobit/&gt; At the conservatoire, Delius made little progress in his piano studies under [[Carl Reinecke]], but [[Salomon Jadassohn]] praised his hard work and grasp of counterpoint; Delius also resumed studies under Hans Sitt.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; Delius's early biographer, the composer [[Patrick Hadley]], observed that no trace of his academic tuition can be found in Delius's mature music &quot;except in certain of the weaker passages&quot;.&lt;ref name=dnbarchive/&gt; Much more important to Delius's development was meeting the composer [[Edvard Grieg]] in Leipzig. Grieg, like Ward before him, recognised Delius's potential. In the spring of 1888, Sitt conducted Delius's ''[[Florida Suite]]'' for an audience of three: Grieg, [[Christian Sinding]] and the composer.{{#tag:ref|According to Hadley, the orchestral players were paid in beer.&lt;ref name=dnbarchive/&gt;|group= n}} Grieg and Sinding were enthusiastic and became warm supporters of Delius. At a dinner party in London in April 1888, Grieg finally convinced Julius Delius that his son's future lay in music.&lt;ref name=dnbarchive/&gt; 

After leaving Leipzig in 1888, Delius moved to Paris where his uncle, Theodore, took him under his wing and looked after him socially and financially.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; Over the next eight years, Delius befriended many writers and artists, including [[August Strindberg]], [[Edvard Munch]] and [[Paul Gauguin]]. He mixed very little with French musicians,&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; although [[Florent Schmitt]] arranged the piano scores of Delius's first two operas, ''Irmelin'' and ''The Magic Fountain'' ([[Maurice Ravel|Ravel]] later did the same for his ''[[verismo]]'' opera ''Margot la rouge'').&lt;ref name=mgobit/&gt;  As a result, his music never became known in France.{{#tag:ref|Hadley, writing in 1946, commented that Delius's music remained unknown in France.&lt;ref name=dnbarchive/&gt; The critic [[Eric Blom]] wrote in 1929, while the composer was still alive: &quot;Domiciled in France for nearly three decades, in Paris his name is a blank among the ordinary concert-goers and a curiosity among musicians. In cultivating music lovingly in his quiet riverside home at Grez, he fatally omitted to cultivate the musicians of the capital: the result is an artistic ostracism as rigid as only the injured vanity of Parisian art-circles can decree it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authorlink= Eric Blom|last= Blom|first= Eric|url= http://www.jstor.org/stable/738331|title= Delius and America|journal= The Musical Quarterly|date= July 1929|accessdate= 10 January 2011|pages= pp. 438–47}} {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, the critic Michael White wrote, &quot;European snobbery still prevailed, especially in France, where as late as the 1970s [[Nadia Boulanger]] claimed never to have heard of Delius.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= So Mighty, So Unmusical: How Britannia Found Its Voice |last=White|first=Michael|url= http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/11/arts/music/11whit.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin |journal= The New York Times|pages=|date= 11 February 2007|accessdate=21 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} Delius's biographer Diana McVeagh says of these years that Delius &quot;was found to be attractive, warm-hearted, spontaneous, and amorous.&quot; It is generally believed that during this period he contracted the [[syphilis]] that caused the collapse of his health in later years.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= Medical Histories of Prominent Composers: Recent Research and Discoveries|last= Saffle|first= Michael|coauthors= Jeffrey R. Saffle|jstor= 932980|journal= Acta Musicologica|pages=77–101|date= July - December, 1993}}{{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Delius's Paris years were musically productive. His symphonic poem ''Paa Vidderne'' was performed in [[Oslo|Christiania]] in 1891 and in Monte Carlo in 1894; Gunnar Heiberg commissioned Delius to provide [[incidental music]] for his play ''Folkeraadet'' in 1897; and Delius's second opera, ''The Magic Fountain'', was accepted for staging at [[Prague]], but the project fell through for unknown reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Beecham (1975), pp. 71–73&lt;/ref&gt;  Other works of the period were the fantasy overture ''Over the Hills and Far Away'' (1895–97) and orchestral variations, ''Appalachia'' (1896, rewritten in 1904 for voices and orchestra).&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;

===First successes===
[[File:Delius-by-Krohg-1897.jpg|thumb|left|Delius in 1897 by [[Christian Krohg]]]]
In 1897, Delius met the artist [[Jelka Rosen|Helena Sophie Emilie Rosen]], known as Jelka (1868–1935), who later became his wife. She was a professional painter, a friend of [[Auguste Rodin]], and a regular exhibitor at the [[Salon des Indépendants]].&lt;ref name= dnb/&gt; Jelka quickly declared her admiration for the young composer's music,&lt;ref&gt;Beecham (1975), pp. 77–78&lt;/ref&gt; and the couple were drawn closer together by a shared passion for the works of the German philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]].&lt;ref name= dnb/&gt; Jelka bought a house in [[Grez-sur-Loing]], a village  {{convert|40|mi|km}} outside Paris on the edge of [[Forest of Fontainebleau|Fontainebleau]].&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; Delius visited her there, and after a brief return visit to Florida, he moved in with her. In 1903 they married, and, apart from a short period when the area was threatened by the advancing German army during the [[First World War]],  Delius lived in Grez for the rest of his life.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;  The marriage was not conventional: Jelka was, at first, the principal earner; there were no children; and Delius was not a faithful husband. Jelka was often distressed by his affairs, but her devotion did not waver.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; 

In the same year, Delius began a fruitful association with German supporters of his music, the conductors [[Hans Haym]], [[Fritz Cassirer]] and [[Alfred Hertz]] at [[Elberfeld]], and [[Julius Buths]] at [[Düsseldorf]].&lt;ref name=dnbarchive/&gt; Haym conducted ''Over the Hills and Far Away'', which he gave under its German title ''Über die Berge in die Ferne'' on 13 November 1897, believed to be the first time Delius's music was heard in Germany.&lt;ref name=carley&gt;{{cite journal|title= Hans Haym: Delius's Prophet and Pioneer|last= Carley|first= Lionel|jstor= 734166|journal= Music and Letters|pages= pp. 1–24|date= January 1973}} {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1899 Hertz gave a Delius concert in [[St. James's Hall]] in London, which included ''Over the Hills and Far Away'', a choral piece, ''Mitternachtslied'', and excerpts from the opera ''[[Koanga]]''. This occasion was an unusual opportunity for an unknown composer at a time when any sort of orchestral concert was a rare event in London.&lt;ref&gt;Beecham (1975), p. 104&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of encouraging reviews, Delius's orchestral music was not heard again in an English concert hall until 1907.&lt;ref name=carley/&gt;  

The orchestral work, ''Paris'', subtitled &quot;Song of a Great City&quot; was composed in 1899 and dedicated to Haym. He gave the premiere at Elberfeld on 14 December 1901. It provoked some critical comment from the local newspaper, which complained that the composer put his listeners on a bus and shuttled them from one Parisian night-spot to another, &quot;but he does not let us hear the tuneful gypsy melodies in the boulevard cafés, always just cymbals and tambourine and mostly from two cabarets at the same time at that&quot;.&lt;ref name=carley/&gt; The work was given under [[Ferruccio Busoni|Busoni]] in Berlin less than a year later.&lt;ref name=carley/&gt;

Most of Delius's premieres of this period were given by Haym and his fellow German conductors. In 1904 Cassirer premiered ''Koanga'', and in the same year the Piano Concerto was given in Elberfeld, and ''Lebenstanz'' in Düsseldorf.  ''Appalachia'' (choral orchestral variations on an old slave song, also inspired by Florida) followed there in 1905. ''[[Sea Drift]]'' (a cantata with words taken from a poem by [[Walt Whitman]]) was premiered at [[Essen]] in 1906, and ''[[A Village Romeo and Juliet]]'' in Berlin in 1907.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; Delius's reputation in Germany remained high until the First World War; in 1910 his rhapsody ''[[Brigg Fair]]'' was given by 36 different German orchestras.&lt;ref name=dnbarchive/&gt;

===Growing reputation===
[[File:Beecham-1910-crop.jpg|thumb|right|[[Thomas Beecham]] in 1910]]
By 1907, thanks to performances of his works in many German cities, Delius was, as Thomas Beecham said, &quot;floating safely on a wave of prosperity which increased as the year went on&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beecham 1975, p. 155&quot;&gt;Beecham (1975), p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; In that year, Cassirer conducted some concerts in London, at one of which, with Beecham's New Symphony Orchestra, he presented ''Appalachia''. Beecham, who had hitherto known nothing of Delius's music, expressed his &quot;wonderment&quot; and became a lifelong devotee of the composer's works.&lt;ref&gt;Beecham (1944), pp. 63–64&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, [[Henry Wood]] premiered the revised version of Delius's Piano Concerto. In 1908, Beecham introduced ''Brigg Fair'' to London audiences,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= New Symphony Orchestra|last= |first= |jstor=  902996|journal= The Musical Times|pages= p. 324|date= May 1908}} {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Enrique Fernández Arbós|Fernández Arbós]] presented ''Lebenstanz''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= Mr. Delius's Dance of Life |last= |first= |jstor=904923 |journal= The Musical Times|pages= p. 111|date= February 1908}} {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1909, Beecham conducted the first complete performance of ''[[A Mass of Life]]'', the largest and most ambitious of Delius's concert works, written for four soloists, a double choir, and a large orchestra.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; Although the work was based on the same [[Thus Spoke Zarathustra|Nietzsche work]] as Richard Strauss's ''[[Also sprach Zarathustra (Strauss)|Also sprach Zarathustra]]'', Delius distanced himself from the Strauss work, which he considered a complete failure.&lt;ref name=carley/&gt; Nor was Strauss an admirer of Delius, as he was of [[Edward Elgar|Elgar]]; he told Delius that he did not wish to conduct ''Paris'': &quot;the symphonic development seems to me to be too scant, and it seems moreover to be an imitation of [[Gustave Charpentier|Charpentier]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=butler&gt;{{cite journal|title= Review|last= Butler|first= Christopher|jstor= 735537 |journal= Music and Letters|pages= pp. 78–80|date= January 1986}} {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early years of the 20th century, Delius composed some of his most popular works, including ''Brigg Fair'' (1907), ''[[In a Summer Garden]]'' (1908, revised 1911), ''Summer Night on the River'' (1911), and ''[[On Hearing the First Cuckoo in Spring]]'' (1912), of which McVeagh comments, &quot;These exquisite idylls, for all their composer's German descent and French domicile, spell 'England' for most listeners.&quot;&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; In 1910, Beecham put on an opera season at the [[Royal Opera House]] in London. Having access to the Beecham family's considerable fortune, he ignored commercial considerations and programmed several works of limited box-office appeal, including ''A Village Romeo and Juliet''.{{#tag:ref|Other operas in this season included Richard Strauss's ''[[Elektra (opera)|Elektra]]'', which made a profit, and [[Ethel Smyth]]'s ''[[The Wreckers]]'' and [[Arthur Sullivan]]'s ''[[Ivanhoe (opera)|Ivanhoe]],'' which did not.&lt;ref&gt;Reid, p. 107&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} The reviews were polite, but ''[[The Times]]'', having praised the orchestral aspects of the score, commented, &quot;Mr. Delius seems to have remarkably little sense of dramatic writing for the voice&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= Music, Royal Opera, Covent Garden, 'The Village Romeo And Juliet'|journal= The Times|pages= p. 13|date= 23 February 1910}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other reviewers agreed that the score contained passages of great beauty, but was ineffective as drama.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, &quot;Mr. Delius's Opera&quot;, ''[[The Manchester Guardian]]'', 23 February 1910, p. 14; and &quot;The Beecham Opera Season&quot;, ''[[The Observer]]'', 27 February 1910, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

===War and post-war===
During the First World War, Delius and Jelka moved from Grez to avoid the hostilities. They took up temporary residence in the south of England, where Delius continued to compose. In 1915, ''[[The Musical Times]]'' published a profile of him by his admirer, the composer [[Peter Warlock|Philip Heseltine]] (known as &quot;Peter Warlock&quot;), who commented:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
[H]e holds no official position in the musical life of the country [i.e. Britain]; he does not teach in any of the academies, he is not even an honorary professor or doctor of music. He never gives concerts or makes propaganda for his music; he never conducts an orchestra, or plays an instrument in public (even [[Hector Berlioz|Berlioz]] played the tambourine!)&lt;ref name=heseltine/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote/&gt;

Heseltine depicted Delius as a composer uncompromisingly focused on his own music. &quot;There can be no superficial view of Delius's music: either one feels it in the very depths of one's being, or not at all. This may be a part of the reason why one so seldom hears a really first-rate performance of Delius's work, save under Mr. Beecham&quot;.&lt;ref name=heseltine&gt;{{cite journal|title= Some Notes on Delius and His Music|last= Heseltine|first= Philip|jstor= 909510|journal= The Musical Times|pages= pp. 137–42|date= March 1915}} {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Flecker Cambridge crop.jpg|thumb|left|upright|James Elroy Flecker (1884–1915). Delius provided incidental music to Flecker's ''Hassan'', premiered in 1923]]
One of Delius's major war-time works was his ''[[Requiem (Delius)|Requiem]]'', dedicated &quot;to the memory of all young Artists fallen in the war&quot;. The work owes nothing to the traditional Christian liturgy, eschewing notions of an afterlife and celebrating instead a pantheistic renewal of Nature. When [[Albert Coates (musician)|Albert Coates]] presented the work in London in 1922, its atheism offended some believers.{{#tag:ref|The ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' mistakenly attributes the performance to the composer [[Eric Coates]]. Contemporary reviews confirm that the conductor was Albert Coates. See &quot;Royal Philharmonic Society, Delius's Requiem&quot;, ''The Times'', 24 March 1922, p. 10; and &quot;The New 'Requiem' by Frederic [sic] Delius&quot;, ''[[The Manchester Guardian]]'', 23 March 1922, p. 8.|group= n}}  This attitude persisted long after Delius's death, as the ''Requiem'' did not receive another performance in the UK until 1965, and by 1980 had still had only seven performances world-wide. In Germany, the regular presentation of Delius's works ceased at the outbreak of the war, and never resumed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= Frederick Delius|last= Cardus|first= Neville|journal= The Guardian|pages= p. 8|date= 25 January 1962}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, his standing with some continental musicians was unaffected; Beecham records that [[Béla Bartók|Bartók]] and [[Zoltán Kodály|Kodály]] were admirers of Delius, and the former grew into the habit of sending his compositions to Delius for comment and tried to interest him in both Hungarian and Rumanian popular music.&lt;ref&gt;Beecham (1975), p. 191&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the war, Delius and Jelka had returned to Grez. He had begun to show symptoms of syphilis that he had probably contracted in the 1880s. He took treatment at clinics across Europe, but by 1922 he was walking with two sticks, and by 1928 he was paralysed and blind. There was no return to the prosperity of pre-war years: Delius's medical treatment was an additional expense, his blindness prevented him from composing, and his royalties were curtailed by the lack of continental performances of his music. Beecham gave discreet financial help, and the composer and musical benefactor [[H. Balfour Gardiner]] bought the house at Grez and allowed Delius and Jelka to live there rent-free.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;
 
Beecham was temporarily absent from the concert hall and opera house between 1920 and 1923, but Coates gave the first performance of ''[[A Song of the High Hills]]'' in 1920, and Henry Wood and [[Hamilton Harty]] programmed Delius's music with the [[Queen's Hall]] and [[The Hallé|Hallé]] Orchestras.&lt;ref name=dnbarchive/&gt; Wood gave the British première of the Double Concerto for violin and cello in 1920, and of ''A Song Before Sunrise'' and the ''Dance Rhapsody No. 2'' in 1923.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 447&lt;/ref&gt; Delius had a financial and artistic success with his incidental music for [[James Elroy Flecker]]'s play ''Hassan'' (1923) with 281 performances at [[Her Majesty's Theatre|His Majesty's Theatre]].&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;  With Beecham's return the composer became, in Hadley's words, &quot;what his most fervent admirers had never envisaged—a genuine popular success.&quot;  Hadley cites, in particular, the six-day Delius festival at the Queen's Hall in 1929 under Beecham in the presence of the composer in his bath-chair. &quot;[T]he cream of his orchestral output with and without soli and chorus was included,&quot; and the hall was filled.&lt;ref name=dnbarchive/&gt; The festival included chamber music and songs, an excerpt from ''A Village Romeo and Juliet'', the Piano and Violin Concertos, and premières of ''Cynara'' and ''A Late Lark'', concluding with ''A Mass of Life''.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;
The ''[[Manchester Guardian]]'''s music critic, [[Neville Cardus]], met Delius during the festival. He describes the wreck of the composer's physique, yet &quot;there was nothing pitiable about him ... his face was strong and disdainful, every line graven on it by intrepid living&quot;. Delius, Cardus says, spoke with a noticeable Yorkshire accent as he dismissed most English music as paper music that should never be heard, written by people &quot;afraid of their feelin's&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Cardus, p. 254&lt;/ref&gt;

===Last years===
A young English admirer, [[Eric Fenby]], learning that Delius was trying to compose by dictating to Jelka, volunteered his services as unpaid amanuensis. For five years, from 1928, he worked with Delius, taking down his new compositions from dictation, and helping him revise earlier works. Together they produced ''Cynara'' (a setting of words by [[Ernest Dowson]]), ''A Late Lark'' (a setting of [[William Ernest Henley|W. E. Henley]]), ''[[A Song of Summer]]'', a third violin sonata, the ''Irmelin'' prelude, and ''Idyll'' (1932), which reused music from Delius's short opera ''Margot la rouge'', composed thirty years earlier. McVeagh rates their greatest joint production as ''The Songs of Farewell'', settings of [[Walt Whitman]] poems for chorus and orchestra, which were dedicated to Jelka.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; Other works produced in this period include a ''Caprice and Elegy'' for cello and orchestra written for the distinguished British cellist [[Beatrice Harrison]], and a short orchestral piece, ''Fantastic Dance'', which Delius dedicated to Fenby.&lt;ref name= F88/&gt; The violin sonata incorporates the first, incomprehensible, melody that Delius had attempted to dictate to Fenby before their ''modus operandi'' had been worked out. Fenby's initial failure to pick up the tune led Delius to the view that &quot;[the] boy is no good ... he cannot even take down a simple melody&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Fenby (1981), pp. 31–33&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|A complete list of the works created or revised during the Delius–Fenby collaboration is provided in Fenby (1981), pp. 261–62.|group= n}} Fenby later wrote a book about his experiences of working with Delius. Among other details, Fenby reveals Delius's love of cricket. The pair followed the [[Australian cricket team in England in 1930|1930 Test series]] between England and Australia with great interest, and regaled a bemused Jelka with accounts of their boyhood exploits in the game.&lt;ref&gt;Fenby (1981), pp. 102–03&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1933, the year before both composers died, [[Edward Elgar|Sir Edward Elgar]], who had flown to Paris to conduct a performance of his [[Violin Concerto (Elgar)|Violin Concerto]], visited Delius at Grez. Delius was not on the whole an admirer of Elgar's music,{{#tag:ref| Delius said of Elgar's [[Symphony No. 1 (Elgar)|First Symphony]]: &quot;It starts with a theme out of the ''[[Parsifal (opera)|Parcival]]'' Prelude a little altered. The slow movement is a theme out of [[Requiem (Verdi)|Verdi's Requiem]] a little altered. The rest is [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]] and [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]], thick and without the slightest orchestral charm—gray—and they all shout 'Masterwork'!&quot;&lt;ref name=butler/&gt;  He also called ''[[The Dream of Gerontius]]'' nauseating; he admired Elgar's ''[[Falstaff (Elgar)|Falstaff]]'', however.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;|group= n}} but the two men took to each other, and there followed a warm correspondence until Elgar's death in February 1934.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt; Elgar described Delius as &quot;a poet and a visionary&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Redwood, p. 94, ''quoted'' in McVeagh, ODNB&lt;/ref&gt;

Delius died at Grez on 10 June 1934, aged 72. He had wished to be buried in his own garden, but the French authorities forbade it. His alternative wish was to be buried &quot;in some country churchyard in the south of England, where people could place wild flowers&quot;.&lt;ref  name=grove/&gt; At the time of his death, Jelka was too ill to make the journey across the [[English Channel|Channel]], and Delius’s body was temporarily interred in the cemetery at Grez. It was taken to England in May 1935 and buried at St Peter's Church, [[Limpsfield]], [[Surrey]], on 26 May. The ceremony took place at midnight; the headline in the ''Sunday Dispatch'' was &quot;Sixty People Under Flickering Lamps In A Surrey Churchyard&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Fenby (1981), pp. 106–07 (Fig. 16)&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of Delius's atheism, the vicar offered a prayer: &quot;May the souls of the departed through the mercy of God rest in peace.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Fenby (1981), pp. 233–34&lt;/ref&gt;  Jelka died a few days later, and was buried beside Delius.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

===Influences===
[[File:Jubilee singers image-London Ill-450wide.jpg|thumb|The [[Fisk Jubilee Singers]], portrayed during a European tour in the 1870s]]
After the 1929 London festival ''The Times'' music critic wrote that Delius &quot;belongs to no school, follows no tradition and is like no other composer in the form, content or style of his music&quot;.&lt;ref name= Times29&gt;{{cite journal|title= The Delius Festival: A retrospect|pages= p. 10|date= 2 November 1929|journal= The Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; This &quot;extremely individual and personal idiom&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= The Delius Festival: First Concert at Queen's Hall|pages= p. 16|journal= The Times|date= 14 October 1929}}&lt;/ref&gt; was, however, the product of a long musical apprenticeship, during which the composer absorbed many influences. The earliest significant experiences in his artistic development came, Delius later asserted, from the sounds of the plantation songs carried down the river to him at Solano Grove. It was this singing, he told Fenby, that first gave him the urge to express himself in music;&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; thus, writes Fenby, many of Delius's early works are &quot;redolent of Negro hymnology and folk-song&quot;, a sound &quot;not heard before in the orchestra, and seldom since&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Fenby (1971), p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; Delius's familiarity with &quot;black&quot; music possibly predates his American adventures; during the 1870s a popular singing group, the [[Fisk Jubilee Singers]] from [[Nashville, Tennessee]], toured Britain and Europe, giving several well-received concerts in Bradford. When Delius wrote to Elgar in 1933 of the &quot;beautiful four-part harmonies&quot; of the black plantation workers, he may have been unconsciously alluding to the spirituals sung by the Fisk group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Jones|first= Philip|title= Delius and America: a new perspective|jstor=963053|journal= The Musical Times|date= December 1984|pages=701–02}} {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[Leipzig]], Delius became a fervent disciple of [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]], whose technique of continuous music he sought to master. An ability to construct long musical paragraphs is, according to the Delius scholar Christopher Palmer, Delius's lasting debt to Wagner, from whom he also acquired a knowledge of chromatic harmonic teachnique, &quot;an endlessly proliferating sensuousness of sound&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, pp. 95–96&lt;/ref&gt; Grieg, however, was perhaps the composer who influenced him more than any other. The Norwegian composer, like Delius, found his primary inspiration in nature and in folk-melodies, and was the stimulus for the Norwegian flavour that characterises much of Delius's early music.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, pp. 46–50&lt;/ref&gt;  The music writer [[Anthony Payne]] observes that Grieg's &quot;airy texture and non-developing use of chromaticism showed [Delius] how to lighten the Wagnerian load&quot;.&lt;ref name= grove/&gt; Early in his career Delius drew inspiration from Chopin, later from his own contemporaries Ravel and Richard Strauss,&lt;ref&gt;Fenby (1971), p. 82, Palmer, p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; and from the much younger [[Percy Grainger]], who first brought the tune of ''Brigg Fair'' to Delius's notice.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, pp. 89–90&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to Palmer, it is arguable that Delius gained his sense of direction as a composer from his French contemporary [[Claude Debussy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Palmer|first= Christopher|title= Delius, Vaughan Williams and Debussy|url= http://ml.oxfordjournals.org/content/L/4/475.full.pdf|journal= Music and Letters|year= 1969|pages= pp. 475–80}}&lt;/ref&gt; Palmer identifies aesthetic similarities between the two, and points to several parallel characteristics and enthusiasms. Both were inspired early in their careers by Grieg, both admired Chopin; they are also linked in their musical depictions of the sea, and in their uses of the wordless voice. The opening of ''Brigg Fair'' is described by Palmer as &quot;perhaps the most Debussian  moment in Delius&quot;.&lt;ref name= P138/&gt; Debussy, in a review of Delius's ''Two Danish Songs'' for soprano and orchestra given in a concert on 16 March 1901, wrote: &quot;They are very sweet, very pale - music to soothe convalescents in well-to-do neighbourhoods&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Debussy, Claude, ed. Richard Langham Smith (1988): ''Debussy on Music'' New York, Cornell University Press ISBN 0-436-12559-5  pp. 16–17&lt;/ref&gt; Delius admired the French composer's orchestration, but thought his works lacking in melody&lt;ref name= P138&gt;Palmer, pp. 138–41&lt;/ref&gt;—the latter a comment frequently directed against Delius's own music.&lt;ref name= Stylistic/&gt;&lt;ref name= Cardus/&gt; Fenby, however, draws attention to Delius's &quot;flights of melodic poetic-prose&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Fenby (1971), p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; while conceding that the composer was contemptuous of public taste, of &quot;giving the public what they wanted&quot; in the form of pretty tunes.&lt;ref&gt;Fenby (1981), pp. 188–89&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stylistic development===
From the conventional forms of his early music, over the course of his creative career Delius developed a style easily recognisable and &quot;unlike the work of any other&quot;, according to Payne.&lt;ref name = grove/&gt;  As he gradually found his voice, Delius replaced the methods developed during his creative infancy with a more mature style in which Payne discerns &quot;an increasing richness of chord structure, bearing with it its own subtle means of contrast and development&quot;.&lt;ref name= Stylistic/&gt; [[Hubert J. Foss|Hubert Foss]], the [[Oxford University Press]]'s musical editor during the 1920s and 1930s, writes that rather than creating his music from the known possibilities of instruments, Delius &quot;thought the sounds first&quot; and then sought the means for producing these particular sounds.&lt;ref name= Foss&gt;{{cite journal|last= Foss|first= Hubert|title= The Instrumental Music of Frederick Delius|jstor= 943987|journal= Tempo|publisher= Cambridge University Press|number= 26|date= Winter 1952–53|pages= pp. 30–37}} {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; Delius's full stylistic maturity dates from around 1907, when he began to write the series of works on which his main reputation rests.&lt;ref name = Stylistic&gt;{{cite journal|authorlink= Anthony Payne|last= Payne| first= Anthony|title= Delius's Stylistic Development|url= http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=6252204|journal= Tempo|publisher= Cambridge University Press|number= 60|date= Winter 1961–62|pages=6–16|accessdate=23 January 2011}} {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the more mature works Foss observes Delius's increasing rejection of conventional forms such as [[sonata]] or concerto; Delius's music, he comments, is &quot;certainly not architectural; nearer to painting, especially to the ''[[Pointillism|pointilliste]]'' style of design&quot;.&lt;ref name= Foss/&gt; The painting analogy is echoed by Cardus.&lt;ref name= Cardus&gt;{{cite journal|authorlink= Neville Cardus|last= Cardus|first= Neville|title= Frederick Delius|journal= The Guardian|pages= p. 8|date= 25 January 1962}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Towards recognition====
Delius's first orchestral compositions were, in Palmer's words, the work of &quot;an insipid if charming water-colourist&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Florida Suite]]'' (1887, revised 1889) is &quot;an expertly crafted synthesis of Grieg and Negroid Americana&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; while Delius's first opera ''Irmelin'' (1890–92) lacks any identifiably Delian passages. Its harmony and modulation are conventional, and the work bears the clear fingerprints of Wagner and Grieg. Payne asserts that none of the works prior to 1895 are of lasting interest. The first noticeable stylistic advance is evident in ''[[Koanga]]'' (1895–97), with richer chords and faster harmonic rhythms; here we find Delius &quot;feeling his way towards the vein that he was soon to tap so surely&quot;.&lt;ref name= Stylistic/&gt; In ''Paris'' (1899), the orchestration owes a debt to [[Richard Strauss]]; its passages of quiet beauty, says Payne, nevertheless lack the deep personal involvement of the later works. ''Paris'', the final work of Delius's apprentice years, is described by Foss as &quot;one of the most complete, if not the greatest, of Delius's musical paintings&quot;.&lt;ref name= Foss/&gt;
[[File:Romeo und Julia auf dem Dorfe 1.jpg|thumb|left|Woodcut illustration (1919) of the young lovers  from [[Gottfried Keller]]'s original story, which became Delius's opera ''A Village Romeo and Juliet]] 
In each of the major works written in the years after ''Paris'', Delius combined orchestral and vocal forces. The first of these works was ''[[A Village Romeo and Juliet]]'', a music drama which departs from the normal operatic structure of acts and scenes and tells its story of tragic love in a series of tableaux. Musically it shows a considerable advance in style from the early operas of the apprentice years. The entr'acte known as &quot;The Walk to the Paradise Garden&quot; is described by Heseltine as showing &quot;all the tragic beauty of mortality ... concentrated and poured forth in music of overwhelming, almost intolerable poignancy&quot;.&lt;ref name= heseltine&gt;{{cite journal|authorlink= Peter Warlock|last= Heseltine|first= Philip|title= Some Notes on Delius and his Music|jstor= 909510|journal= The Musical Times|date= March 1915|pages= pp. 137–42}} {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this work Delius begins to achieve the texture of sound that would characterise all his later compositions.&lt;ref name= Stylistic/&gt; Delius's music is often assumed to lack melody and form. Cardus argues that melody, while not a primary factor, is there abundantly, &quot;floating and weaving itself into the texture of shifting harmony&quot; – a characteristic which Cardus believes is shared only by Debussy.&lt;ref name= Cardus/&gt;

Delius's next work, ''Appalachia'', introduces a further feature that would recur in later pieces—the use of the voice instrumentally in wordless singing, in this case depicting the distant plantation songs that had inspired Delius at Solano Grove.&lt;ref name= Stylistic/&gt; Although Payne argues that ''Appalachia'' shows only a limited advance in technique, Fenby identifies one orchestral passage as the first expression of Delius's idea of &quot;the transitoriness of all mortal things mirrored in nature&quot;. Hereafter, whole works rather than brief passages would be informed by this idea.&lt;ref&gt;Fenby (1971), p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; The transitional phase of the composer's career concludes with three further vocal pieces: ''[[Sea Drift (Delius)|Sea Drift]]'' (1903), ''[[A Mass of Life]]'' (1904–05), and ''Songs of Sunset'' (1906–07). Payne salutes each of these as masterpieces, in which the Delian style struggles to emerge in its full ripeness.&lt;ref name= Stylistic/&gt; Fenby describes ''A Mass of Life'' as standing outside the general progression of Delius's work, &quot;a vast parenthesis&quot;, unlike anything else he wrote, but nevertheless an essential ingredient in his development.&lt;ref&gt;Fenby (1971), p. 58&lt;/ref&gt;

====Full flowering====
''Brigg Fair'' (1907) announced the composer's full stylistic maturity, the first of the pieces for small orchestra which confirm Delius's status as a musical poet, with the influences of Wagner and Grieg almost entirely absent.&lt;ref name= Stylistic/&gt;  The work was followed in the next few years by ''[[In a Summer Garden]]'' (1908), ''Life's Dance'' (1911), ''Summer Night on the River'' (1911) and ''[[On Hearing the First Cuckoo in Spring]]'' (1912). The critic R.W.S. Mendl described this sequence as &quot;exquisite nature studies&quot;, with a unity and shape lacking in the earlier formal tone poems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Mendl|first= R.W.S.|title= The Art of the Symphonic Poem|url= http://mq.oxfordjournals.org/content/XVIII/3/443.full.pdf+html|journal= The Musical Quarterly|volume= 18|number= 3|date= July 1932|pages= pp. 443–62}}&lt;/ref&gt; These works became part of the standard English concert repertory, and helped to establish the character of Delius's music in the English concert-goer's mind, although according to [[Ernest Newman]], the concentration on these works to the neglect of his wider output may have done Delius as much harm as good.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authorlink= Ernest Newman|last= Newman|first= Ernest|title= His Country At Last Acclaims Delius |journal= The New York Times Quarterly|date= 16 March 1930|pages= p. SM7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The typical mature Delian orchestral sound is apparent in these works, through the division of the strings into ten or more sections, punctuated by woodwind comments and decorations.&lt;ref name= Stylistic/&gt;  In the ''North Country Sketches'' of 1913–14, Delius divides the strings into 12 parts, and harps, horns, clarinets and bassoons evoke a lifeless winter scene.&lt;ref&gt;Fenby (1971), p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; In Payne's view, the ''Sketches'' are the high water mark of Delius's compositional skill,&lt;ref name= Stylistic/&gt; though Fenby awards the accolade to the later ''[[Eventyr (Once Upon a Time)|Eventyr]]'' (1917).&lt;ref&gt;Fenby (1971), p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; 

During this period Delius did not confine himself to purely orchestral works; he produced his final opera, ''[[Fennimore and Gerda]]'' (1908–10), like ''A Village Romeo and Juliet'' written in tableau form, but in his mature style. His choral works of the period, notably ''An Arabesque'' (1911) and ''[[A Song of the High Hills]]'' (1911) are among the most radical of Delius's writings in their juxtapositions of unrelated chords.&lt;ref name= grove/&gt; The latter work, entirely wordless, contains some of the most difficult choral music in existence, according to Heseltine.&lt;ref name= heseltine/&gt; After 1915, Delius turned his attention to traditional sonata, chamber and concerto forms, which he had largely left alone since his apprentice days. Of these pieces Payne highlights two: the Violin Concerto (1916), as an example of how, writing in unfamiliar genres, Delius remained stylistically true to himself; and the Cello Sonata of 1917 which, lacking the familiarity of an orchestral palate, becomes a melodic triumph.&lt;ref name= Stylistic/&gt; Cardus's verdict, however, is that Delius's chamber and concerto works are largely failures.&lt;ref name= Cardus/&gt; After 1917, according to Payne, there was a general deterioration both in the quantity and quality of Delius's output as illness took hold, though Payne exempts the incidental music to ''Hassan'' (1920–23) from condemnation, believing that it contains some of Delius's best work.&lt;ref name= grove/&gt;&lt;ref name= Stylistic/&gt;

====Final phase====
The four-year association with Fenby from 1929 produced two major works, and several smaller pieces often drawn from unpublished music from Delius's early career. The first of the major works was the orchestral ''[[A Song of Summer]]'', based on sketches that Delius had previously collected under the title of ''A Poem of Life and Love''.&lt;ref&gt;Fenby (1981), p. 132&lt;/ref&gt; In dictating the new beginning of this work, Delius asked Fenby to &quot;imagine that we are sitting on the cliffs in the heather, looking out over the sea&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Fenby (1971) p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; This does not, says Fenby, indicate that the dictation process was calm and leisurely; the mood was usually frenzied and nerve-wracking.&lt;ref&gt;Fenby (1981), pp. 145–47&lt;/ref&gt; The other major work, a setting of [[Walt Whitman]] poems with the title ''Songs of Farewell'', was an even more alarming prospect to Fenby: &quot;the complexity of thinking in so many strands, often all at once; the problems of orchestral and vocal balance; the wider area of possible misunderstandings...&quot;  combined to leave Delius and his helper exhausted after each session of work—yet both these works were ready for performance in 1932.&lt;ref name= F88&gt;Fenby (1971), pp. 88–89&lt;/ref&gt; Of the music in this final choral work, Beecham wrote of its &quot;hard, masculine vigour, reminiscent in mood and fibre of some of the great choral passages in ''[[A Mass of Life]]''&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Beecham (1975), p. 208&lt;/ref&gt; Payne describes the work as &quot;bracing and exultant, with in places an almost [[Gustav Holst|Holstian]] clarity&quot;.&lt;ref name= Stylistic/&gt;

===Reception===
Recognition came late to Delius; before 1899, when he was already 37, his works were largely unpublished and unknown to the public. When the symphonic poem ''Paa Vidderne'' was performed at Monte Carlo on 25 February 1894 in a programme of works from British composers, the ''Musical Times'' listed the composers as &quot;...Balfe, Mackenzie, Oakeley, Sullivan ... and one Delius, whoever he may be&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= Foreign Notes|jstor= 3361873|journal= The Musical Times and Singing Class Circular|date= April 1894|pages= pp. 266–67}} {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work was well received in Monte Carlo, and brought the composer a congratulatory letter from [[Alice Heine|Princess Alice of Monaco]], but this did not lead to demands for further performances of this or other Delius works.&lt;ref&gt;Beecham (1975), p. 63. (Beecham misdates the concert to February 1893)&lt;/ref&gt; Some of his individual songs (he wrote more than 60) were occasionally included in vocal recitals; referring to &quot;the strange songs of Fritz Delius&quot;, ''[[The Times]]'' critic expressed regret &quot;that the powers the composer undoubtedly possesses should not be turned to better account or undergo proper development at the hands of some musician competent to train them&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= New Songs|journal=  The Times|date= 9 August 1899|pages= p. 13}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Stjameshall.gif|thumb|St James's Hall, London, the venue for Delius's first London concert, May 1899]]
Of the May 1899 concert at St. James's Hall, London,  ''The Musical Times'' reviewer remarked on the rawness of some of the music, but praised the &quot;boldness of conception and virile strength that command and hold attention.&quot;&lt;ref name= MT99&gt;{{cite journal|jstor= 3367034|title= Mr. Fritz Delius|journal= The Musical Times and Singing Class Circular|date= July 1899|pages= p. 472}} {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Beecham, however, records that despite this  &quot;fair show of acclaim&quot;, for all the impetus it gave to future performances of Delius's work the event might never have happened; none of the music was heard again in England for many years.&lt;ref&gt;Beecham (1975), p. 106&lt;/ref&gt; Delius was much better received in Germany, where a series of successful performances of his works led to what Beecham describes as a Delius vogue there, &quot;second only to that of Richard Strauss&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Beecham (1975), p. 114&lt;/ref&gt;

In England, a performance of the Piano Concerto on 22 October 1907 at the Queen's Hall was praised for the brilliance of the soloist, Theodor Szánto, and for the power of the music itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= Mr Delius's Pianoforte Concerto|jstor= 904474|journal= The Musical Times|date= November 1907|pages= p. 739}} {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; From that point onwards the music of Delius became increasingly familiar to both British and European audiences, as performances of his works proliferated. Beecham's presentation of ''A Mass of Life'' at the Queen's Hall in June 1909 did not inspire Hans Haym, who had come from Elberfeld for the concert,&lt;ref name=carley/&gt; though Beecham says that many professional and amateur musicians thought it &quot;the most impressive and original achievement of its genre written in the last fifty years&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Beecham 1975, p. 155&quot;/&gt;  Some reviewers, nevertheless, doubted the popular appeal of Delius's music, while others were more specifically hostile.{{#tag:ref|''The Observer'' wrote of &quot;a charm and fascination entirely its own … but whether his contemplative and reticent musical spirit will ever make an appeal to the great public is another question&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= Concerts of the Week|journal= The Observer|pages= p. 6|date= 25 January 1914}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Samuel Langford]] in ''The Manchester Guardian'' wrote that Delius's music had &quot;the modern note without the ancient form and grace. The instruments come in, as it were, anywhere, like little toy reeds pulled by some childish Pan.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= The Beecham Promenade Concerts|last=Langford|first=Samuel|journal= The Manchester Guardian|pages= p. 3|date= 3 October 1917}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}}

From 1910, Delius's works began to be heard in America: ''Brigg Fair'' and ''In a Summer Garden'' were performed in 1910–11 by the [[New York Philharmonic Orchestra]] under [[Walter Damrosch]]. In November 1915 Grainger gave the first American performance of the Piano Concerto, again with the New York Philharmonic. The ''[[New York Times]]'' critic described the work as uneven; richly harmonious, but combining colour and beauty with effects &quot;of an almost crass unskillfulness and ugliness&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= Philharmonic Concert: Percy Grainger, soloist, plays Delius's Piano Concerto|url= http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=F60F1EF6395D16738DDDAE0A94D9415B858DF1D3|journal= The New York Times|date = 27 November 1915}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the rest of his lifetime Delius's more popular pieces were performed in England and abroad, often under the sponsorship of Beecham, who was primarily responsible for the Delius festival in October–November 1929. In a retrospective comment on the festival ''The Times'' critic wrote of full houses and an apparent enthusiasm for &quot;music which hitherto has enjoyed no exceptional vogue&quot;, but wondered whether this new acceptance was based on a solid foundation.&lt;ref name= Times29/&gt; After Delius's death Beecham continued to promote his works; a second festival was held in 1946, and a third (after Beecham's death) at Bradford in 1962, to celebrate the centenary of Delius's birth. These occasions were in the face of a general indifference to the music;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Cooper|first= Martin|title= Question Mark Over Delius Lovers|journal= The Daily Telegraph|date= 7 April 1962}}&lt;/ref&gt; writing in the centenary year, the musicologist [[Deryck Cooke]] opined that at that time, &quot;to declare oneself a confirmed Delian is hardly less self-defamatory than to admit to being an addict of cocaine and marihuana&quot;.&lt;ref name= Cooke&gt;{{cite journal|authorlink= Deryck Cooke|last= Cooke|first= Deryck|title= Delius the Unknown|jstor= 765994|journal= Proceedings of the Royal Musical Association|pages= p. 17|date= 18 December 1962}} {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Beecham had died in 1961, and Fenby writes that it &quot;seemed to many then that nothing could save Delius's music from extinction&quot;, such was the conductor's unique mastery over the music.&lt;ref name=&quot;F257&quot;/&gt; However, other conductors have continued to advocate Delius, and since the centenary year, the Delius Society has pursued the aim of &quot;develop[ing] a greater knowledge of the life and works of Delius&quot;.&lt;ref name= DSoc&gt;{{cite web|title= About the Society|url= http://www.delius.org.uk/aboutus.htm|publisher= The Delius Society|accessdate= 18 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The music has never become fashionable, however, a fact often acknowledged by promoters and critics.{{#tag:ref|Deryck Cooke chose the title &quot;Delius the Unknown&quot; for his December 1962 address to the Royal Musical Association, recognising, Cooke says, the extent to which the composer was out of fashion.&lt;ref name= Cooke/&gt; In 1991 the sleeve note of the Naxos recording of the Violin Concerto and other works ends: &quot;Delius is now out of fashion, for our times do not favour art that is never vulgar, never strident.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= About this Recording: 8.557242 – Delius: Violin Concerto (Tintner Edition 10)|url= http://www.naxos.com/mainsite/blurbs_reviews.asp?item_code=8.557242&amp;catNum=557242&amp;filetype=About%20this%20Recording&amp;language=English|publisher= Naxos|year= 1991|accessdate= 19 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a comment on the BBC Symphony Orchestra's projected October 2010 Elgar and Delius concert at London's [[Barbican Centre]], the critic David Nice observes that while Elgar is in vogue, Delius is &quot;desperately out of fashion&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Nice|first= David|title= BBC Symphony Orchestra, Sir Andrew Davis, Barbican|url= http://www.theartsdesk.com/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;id=2369:bbc-symphony-orchestra-sir-andrew-davis-barbican&amp;Itemid=27|publisher= The Arts Desk|date= 9 October 2010|accessdate= 18 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} To suggestions that Delius's music is an &quot;acquired taste&quot;, Fenby answers: &quot;The music of Delius is not an acquired taste. One either likes it the moment one first hears it, or the sound of it is once and for ever distasteful to one. It is an art which will never enjoy an appeal to the many, but one which will always be loved, and dearly loved, by the few.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Fenby (1981), p. 208&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in 2004 on the 70th anniversary of Delius's death, ''Guardian'' journalist Martin Kettle recalls Cardus arguing in 1934 that Delius as a composer was unique, both in his technique and in his emotionalism. Although he eschewed classical formalism it was wrong, Cardus believed, to regard Delius merely as &quot;a tone-painter, an impressionist or a maker of programme music&quot;. His music's abiding feature is, Cardus wrote, that it &quot;recollects emotion in tranquillity ... Delius is always reminding us that beauty is born by contemplation after the event&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authorlink= Martin Kettle|last= Kettle|first= Martin |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2004/jul/09/classicalmusicandopera.proms2004|title=Three-act tragedy|journal= The Guardian|date=9 July 2004|accessdate=30 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Memorials and legacy==
[[File:Quatrefoil for Delius.jpg|thumb|left|&quot;A Quatrefoil for Delius&quot; by Amber Hiscott. This sculpture in Delius's honour was erected in Exchange Square, Bradford, and unveiled on 23 November 1993.]]
Just before his death, Delius prepared a codicil to his will whereby the royalties on future performances of his music would be used to support an annual concert of works by young composers. Delius died before this provision could be legally effected; according to Fenby, Beecham then persuaded Jelka in her own will to abandon the concerts idea and apply the royalties towards the editing and recording of Delius's main works.&lt;ref&gt;Fenby (1981), p. 255&lt;/ref&gt; After Jelka's death in 1935 the Delius Trust was established, to supervise this task. As stipulated in Jelka's will, the Trust operated largely under Beecham's direction. After Beecham's death in 1961 advisers were appointed to assist the trustees, and in 1979 its administration was taken over by the [[Musicians' Benevolent Fund]]. Over the years the Trust's objectives have been extended so that it can promote the music of other composers who were Delius's contemporaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= The Delius Trust: History|url= http://www.delius.org.uk/history.htm|publisher= The Delius Society|year= 2010|accessdate= 19 January 011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Trust is a co-sponsor of the 2010 Royal Philharmonic Society Composition Prize for young composers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= RPS Composition Prize|url= http://www.royalphilharmonicsociety.org.uk/?page=composers/composition/|publisher= The Royal Philharmonic Society|year= 2010|accessdate= 19 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1962, enthusiasts for Delius's music who had gone to Bradford for the centenary festival formed the Delius Society; Fenby became its first president.&lt;ref name= F257&gt;Fenby (1981), p. 257&lt;/ref&gt; With around 400 members, the Society is independent from the Trust, but works closely with it. Its general objectives are the furtherance of knowledge of Delius's life and works, and the encouragement of performances and recordings.&lt;ref name= DSoc/&gt; In 2004, as a stimulus for young musicians to study and perform Delius's music, the Society established an annual Delius Prize competition, with a prize of £1,000 to the winner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= The Delius Prize|url= http://www.delius.org.uk/thedeliusprize.htm|publisher= The Delius Society|year= 2010|accessdate= 19 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1984, at the [[Grand Theatre, Leeds]], the Delius Trust sponsored a commemorative production of ''A Village Romeo and Juliet'' by [[Opera North]], to mark the 50th anniversary of Delius's death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= A Village Romeo and Juliet (theatre programme)|publisher= Opera North|date= 6 June 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Public interest in Delius's life was stimulated in the UK in 1968, with the showing of the [[Ken Russell]] film ''[[Song of Summer]]'' on BBC Television. The film depicted the years of the Delius–Fenby collaboration; Fenby co-scripted with Russell. [[Max Adrian]] played Delius, with [[Christopher Gable]] as Fenby and [[Maureen Pryor]] as Jelka.&lt;ref name= F258&gt;Fenby (1981), pp. 258–60&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Song of Summer: Frederick Delius|url= http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063628/|publisher= Internet Movie Database|accessdate= 20 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In America, a small memorial to Delius stands in Solano Grove.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Delius Collection|url= http://www.jaxpubliclibrary.org/coll/delius/index.html|publisher= Jacksonville (Florida) Public Library|accessdate= 23 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Delius Association of Florida has for many years organised an annual festival at Jacksonville, to mark the composer's birthday. At Jacksonville University, the Music Faculty awards an annual Delius Composition Prize.&lt;ref name= F257/&gt; In February 2012 Delius was one of ten prominent Britons honoured by the Royal Mail in the &quot;Britons of Distinction&quot; stamps set.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Britons of Distinction|publisher= The British Postal Museum &amp; Archive|url= http://postalheritage.wordpress.com/tag/kathleen-ferrier/|date= 23 February 2012|accessdate= 26 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beecham stresses Delius's role as an innovator: &quot;The best of Delius is undoubtedly to be found in those works where he disregarded classical traditions and created his own forms&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Beecham (1975), p. 217&lt;/ref&gt; Fenby echoes this: &quot;the people who really count are those who discover new ways of making our lives more beautiful. Frederick Delius was such a man&quot;.&lt;ref name= F258/&gt;  Palmer writes that Delius's true legacy is the ability of his music to inspire the creative urge in its listeners and to enhance their awareness of the wonders of life. Palmer concludes by invoking [[George Eliot]]'s poem ''The Choir Invisible'': &quot;Frederick Delius ... belongs to the company of those true artists for whose life and work the world is a better place to live in, and of whom surely is composed, in a literal sense, 'the choir invisible/Whose music is the gladness of the world'&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, p. 193&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recordings==
The first recordings of Delius's works, in 1927, were conducted by Beecham for the Columbia label: the &quot;Walk to the Paradise Garden&quot; interlude from ''A Village Romeo and Juliet'', and ''On Hearing the First Cuckoo in Spring'', performed by the orchestra of the Royal Philharmonic Society. These began a long series of Delius recordings under Beecham that continued for the rest of the conductor's life.&lt;ref name= disco&gt;See Malcolm Walker's &quot;Beecham/Delius discography&quot;, included (unpaginated) in Beecham's ''Frederick Delius (1975)&lt;/ref&gt; He was not alone, however; [[Geoffrey Toye]] in 1929–30 recorded ''Brigg Fair'', ''In a Summer Garden'', ''Summer Night on the River'' and the &quot;Walk to the Paradise Garden&quot;. Fenby recounts that on his first day in Grez, Jelka played Beecham's ''First Cuckoo'' recording.&lt;ref&gt;Fenby (1981), p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1934, when Delius was close to death, Fenby played him Toye's ''In a Summer Garden'', the last music, Fenby says, that Delius ever heard.&lt;ref&gt;Fenby (1981), p. 221&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the 1930s Beecham had issued versions for Columbia of most of the main orchestral and choral works, together with several songs in which he accompanied the soprano [[Dora Labbette]] on the piano.&lt;ref name= disco/&gt; By 1936 Columbia and HMV had issued recordings of Violin Sonatas 1 and 2, the Elegy and Caprice, and of some of the shorter works.&lt;ref&gt;Darrell, R.D. ''The Gramophone Shop Encyclopedia of Recorded Music'', The Gramophone Shop, New York 1936.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Full recordings of the operas were not available until after the Second World War. Once again Beecham, now with the HMV label, led the way, with ''A Village Romeo and Juliet'' in 1948, performed by the new Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and Chorus.&lt;ref name= disco/&gt; Later versions of this work include those of [[Meredith Davies]] for EMI in 1971,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= Delius.

Many of these recordings have been issued in conjunction with The Delius Society, which has prepared various discographies of Delius's recorded music.{{#tag:ref|See, for example, [http://homepage.mac.com/davidtall/journals/files/newsletter24-discography.pdf Delius: a discography compiled by Stuart Upton and Malcolm Walker] The Delius Society, 1969.
