[[Air Marshal (Australia)|Air Marshal]] '''Sir Alister Murray Murdoch''' [[Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire|KBE]], [[Companion of the Order of the Bath|CB]] (9&amp;nbsp;December 1912 &amp;ndash; 29&amp;nbsp;November 1984) was a senior commander in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF). He served as [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]] (CAS) from 1965 to 1969. Joining the Air Force in 1930, Murdoch trained as a seaplane pilot, and participated in an [[Antarctic]] rescue mission for lost explorers in 1935. During World War&amp;nbsp;II, he commanded [[No.&amp;nbsp;221 Squadron RAF]] in Europe and the Middle East, and later occupied senior positions on the staff of RAAF formations in the South West Pacific. His post-war appointments included Commandant of [[RAAF College]] from 1952 to 1953, [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) [[Air Force Training Group RAAF|Training Command]] from 1953 to 1955, [[Deputy Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Deputy Chief of the Air Staff]] from 1958 to 1959, and AOC [[RAAF Air Command|Operational Command]] from 1962 to 1965.

As AOC Training Command in 1954, Murdoch headed a programme to determine aircraft purchases for the RAAF; his recommendations included the [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules|C-130 Hercules]] transport, considered one of the most important acquisitions in the Air Force's history. His term as CAS coincided with increased commitment to the [[Vietnam War]], and he came into conflict with [[Australian Army]] commanders over the employment of helicopters in battle. He was also involved in assessing the readiness of the [[General Dynamics F-111C]] for RAAF service. Appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in 1960, and [[Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire|Knighted]] in 1966, Murdoch was the fourth in a series of CASs who had been cadets at the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]]. He retired from the Air Force in December 1969, and died in 1984.

==Early career==

Alister Murdoch was born on 9 December 1912 in [[Elsternwick, Victoria|Elsternwick]], Victoria, the son of engineer Thomas Murdoch and his wife Kathleen. A [[lieutenant]] in the [[Australian Military Forces|Commonwealth Military Forces]] at the time of Alister's birth, the elder Murdoch later served in both World Wars and rose to the rank of [[brigadier]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Herington&quot;&gt;Herington, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/28/chapters/07.pdf ''Air War Against Germany and Italy'', p. 152]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;&gt;{{Australian Dictionary of Biography|last=McNicoll|first=Ronald|year=1986|id=A100614b|title=Murdoch, Thomas|accessdate=on 8 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Educated at [[Caulfield Grammar School]], Alister entered the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]], in 1929, following his elder brother [[Ian Thomas Murdoch|Ian]] (later a [[Major General (Australia)|major general]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;&gt;Dennis et al., ''The Oxford Companion to Australian Military History'', p. 412&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;&gt;Stephens; Isaacs, ''High Fliers'', pp. 143&amp;ndash;146&lt;/ref&gt; Alister was one of four cadets sponsored that year by the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF), which did not at that stage have its own officer training college. Budgetary constraints imposed during the [[Great Depression]] necessitated the transfer of these cadets out of Duntroon midway through their four-year course.&lt;ref name=&quot;Third Brother&quot;&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp. 196–197&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moore, ''Duntroon'', pp. 64–65&lt;/ref&gt; Although offered positions in the [[Australian Public Service]] or nominations for short-term commissions with the [[Royal Air Force]], all were determined to serve with the RAAF and were more than pleased with the prospect of entering their chosen service early.&lt;ref name=&quot;Third Brother&quot;/&gt;

Enlisting in the Air Force on 10&amp;nbsp;December 1930, Murdoch completed his pilot training the following year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Third Brother&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WW2&quot;&gt;[http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/script/veteran.asp?ServiceID=R&amp;VeteranID=1081098 Murdoch, Alister Murray] at [http://www.ww2roll.gov.au World War 2 Nominal Roll]. Retrieved on 22 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; He was commissioned in 1932 and later qualified as a flying instructor and seaplane pilot, undertaking [[Navy|navy cooperation]] and [[maritime patrol]] operations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; In December 1935, [[Flying Officer]] Murdoch was selected to join an RAAF rescue mission for explorer [[Lincoln Ellsworth]] and his pilot, [[Herbert Hollick-Kenyon]], who were presumed lost while journeying across the [[Antarctica|Antarctic]]. Flying a [[de Havilland DH.60 Moth|de Havilland Gipsy Moth]], Murdoch located Hollick-Kenyon near the [[Bay of Whales]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilson&quot;&gt;Wilson, ''The Brotherhood of Airmen'', p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; Hollick-Kenyon led the search party to Ellsworth, who protested that he was not lost and did not need rescuing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pathfinder&quot;&gt;Air Power Development Centre, &quot;The RAAF in Antarctica&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Murdoch was posted to England in 1936&amp;ndash;37 to undertake a course in long [[navigation]] at [[RAF Manston]] and serve on attachment with [[No. 114 Squadron RAF|No.&amp;nbsp;114 Squadron]].&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Air Marshals&quot;&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''Air Marshals of the RAAF'', p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;  Returning to Australia, he married Florence Miller on 27&amp;nbsp;December 1937; the couple had a daughter.&lt;ref name=&quot;WW2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Who's Who&quot;&gt;Draper, ''Who's Who in Australia 1983'', p. 631&lt;/ref&gt;  Murdoch spent the next two years on the staff of the Directorate of Operations and Intelligence at Air Force Headquarters, [[Melbourne]].&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Air Marshals&quot;/&gt; In June 1938, he helped inaugurate RAAF instruction in long navigation, with a nine-month course in the discipline.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p. 207&lt;/ref&gt;

Ranked [[squadron leader]] at the outbreak of World War&amp;nbsp;II, Murdoch took charge of [[List of British Commonwealth Air Training Plan facilities in Australia#Air Observer Schools|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Air Observer School]] at [[Cootamundra, New South Wales|Cootamundra]], New South Wales, from April 1940 until mid-1941.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt;  Following this posting he was promoted to [[Wing Commander (rank)|wing commander]] and sent to the [[European Theatre of World War II|European Theatre]]. In August 1941, he became [[Commanding Officer]] of [[No.&amp;nbsp;221 Squadron RAF]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Herington&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;/&gt; a [[RAF Coastal Command|Coastal Command]] unit flying [[Vickers Wellington]]s on reconnaissance and [[anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine]] patrols out of [[Iceland]] during the [[Battle of the Atlantic (1939–1945)|Battle of the Atlantic]]. The next year, Murdoch accompanied the squadron to the [[Middle East Theatre of World War II|Middle East]], where it carried out anti-submarine and maritime strike operations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.raf.mod.uk/history/221squadron.cfm 221 Squadron] at [http://www.raf.mod.uk/ Royal Air Force]. Retrieved on 8 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; He also served as Staff Officer Operations with No.&amp;nbsp;235 Wing RAF. Back in London in July 1942, Murdoch was assigned to [[Combined Operations Headquarters]], where he assisted in planning the [[Dieppe Raid]] before returning to Australia in 1943.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;/&gt;

Promoted to [[group captain]], Murdoch was appointed Senior Air Staff Officer (SASO) at Eastern Area Command, [[Sydney]], in July 1943.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;/&gt; In January 1944, he became SASO at North Western Area Command, which controlled thirteen Australian, British, Dutch, and American squadrons from its headquarters in [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], Northern Territory.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/13.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp. 215&amp;ndash;216]&lt;/ref&gt; Murdoch planned many of the command's bombing and mining operations in the [[South West Pacific theatre of World War II|South West Pacific Theatre]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;/&gt; and was [[mentioned in despatches]] for his &quot;distinguished service&quot; in the role.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/awm192/00318/003180143.pdf Recommendation: Mention in Dispatches] at [[Australian War Memorial]].

==Post-war career==
===Rise to Chief of the Air Staff===
Murdoch was appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (CBE) on 25&amp;nbsp;June 1946 for &quot;conspicuous service in operations against the Japanese&quot; during World War&amp;nbsp;II.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=37625|supp=yes|startpage=3217|date=on 21 June 1946|accessdate=on 11 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of a small coterie of officers earmarked for top positions in the post-war Air Force, he was Director of Personnel Services during 1946&amp;ndash;47 before attending the [[Royal College of Defence Studies|Imperial Defence College]], London, in 1948. Returning to Australia, he served as Director of Air Staff Policy and Plans at Air Force Headquarters between 1949 and 1952.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Who's Who&quot;/&gt; In February 1951, he led a team to the Middle East, where the possibility of Australia contributing a garrison force to the region was first raised. Two years later, [[No. 78 Wing RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;78 Wing]] was deployed to Malta to fulfil this role, operating leased RAF [[de Havilland Vampire]] jet fighters.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 202&amp;ndash;203&lt;/ref&gt; Murdoch became Commandant of [[RAAF College]] in June 1952, gaining promotion to [[air commodore]]. In December 1953, he was raised to acting [[air vice marshal]] and appointed [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) Southern Area, shortly to be re-formed as [[Air Force Training Group RAAF|Training Command]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Air Marshals&quot;/&gt;

[[Image:P00448.086VampireT35.jpg|thumb|left|260px|Australian-built Vampire T35; sixty-nine were delivered to the RAAF following Murdoch's recommendation for a jet trainer in 1954|alt=Single-engined, twin-tailboom military jet in flight]]
In 1954, Murdoch led a mission to examine potential new fighter, bomber, transport and training aircraft for the RAAF, following a shift in defence funding towards the Air Force.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 38&amp;ndash;39&lt;/ref&gt; He advocated the [[Lockheed F-104 Starfighter|F-104 Starfighter]] as a replacement for the [[CAC Sabre]], two years before the Sabre entered squadron service with the RAAF,&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p. 354&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear-capable]] British [[V&amp;nbsp;bomber]] strike aircraft to augment Australia's [[English Electric Canberra|Canberra]] jet bombers, and [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules|C-130 Hercules]] transports to replace the [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain|C-47 Dakota]]. While his proposals for V&amp;nbsp;bombers and the F-104 were not taken up, the Australian government acquired the C-130 in 1958. Described as second only to the [[General Dynamics F-111]] as the &quot;most significant&quot; purchase by the RAAF, the Hercules gave the Air Force its first [[Airlift#Strategic airlift|strategic airlift]] capability, which in years to come would provide a &quot;lifeline&quot; for Australian forces deployed to [[Malayan Emergency|Malaya]], [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]], and other parts of the South East Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 416&amp;ndash;18&lt;/ref&gt; Murdoch also recommended the locally built Vampire as a jet trainer for [[No. 1 Flying Training School RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Applied Flying Training School]]; sixty-nine were later delivered as T35s by the [[de Havilland]] factory in [[Bankstown, New South Wales|Bankstown]], New South Wales.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 160&amp;ndash;161&lt;/ref&gt;

Murdoch was seconded to the [[Department of Defence (Australia)|Department of Defence]] in January 1956 as Deputy Secretary (Military). By February 1958, he had been made a substantive air vice marshal and was appointed [[Deputy Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Deputy Chief of the Air Staff]]. In October 1959, Murdoch was posted to London as Head of the Australian Joint Services Staff,&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;/&gt; and appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] (CB) in the 1960 [[New Year Honours]].&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=41910|supp=yes|startpage=37|date=29 December 1959|accessdate=on 11 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to Australia in June 1962, when he became AOC [[RAAF Air Command|Operational Command]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;/&gt; His tenure in the position coincided with the deployment of the first RAAF aircraft to [[South Vietnam]], seven [[de Havilland Canada DHC-4 Caribou|DHC-4 Caribou]]s, commencing in August 1964.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 259&amp;ndash;260&lt;/ref&gt; Murdoch was promoted [[air marshal]] and appointed [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]] (CAS) on 1&amp;nbsp;June 1965, succeeding Air Marshal [[Valston Hancock|Sir Valston Hancock]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p. 278&lt;/ref&gt; He was the last of a quartet of army-trained CASs; from 1954 to 1969 inclusive, every RAAF chief—[[John McCauley (RAAF officer)|John McCauley]], Scherger, Hancock, and Murdoch—had been a cadet at the Royal Military College, Duntroon, prior to serving with the Air Force.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 320&amp;ndash;321&lt;/ref&gt; With this pedigree, Murdoch was described by Air Chief Marshal Scherger as &quot;the last of the professionals&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;/&gt; The new CAS was raised to [[Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (KBE) in the 1966 [[Queen's Birthday Honours]].&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=44005|supp=yes|startpage=6566|date=3 June 1966|accessdate=on 11 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chief of the Air Staff and Vietnam===
Air Marshal Murdoch led the RAAF through the build-up of Australia's commitment to the [[Military history of Australia during the Vietnam War|Vietnam War]] beginning in the mid-1960s. He clashed with the [[Chief of Army (Australia)|Chief of the General Staff]] (CGS), Lieutenant General [[John Wilton (Australian Army officer)|Sir John Wilton]], over the latter's recommendation in mid-1965 to deploy two [[Bell UH-1 Iroquois|UH-1 Iroquois]] helicopters to Vietnam. Wilton believed that both services would benefit from gaining familiarisation with air/ground operations in the region before large-scale commitment of Australian forces. Murdoch dismissed the idea on resourcing grounds, despite the fact that two-thirds of the RAAF's UH-1 complement had been purchased for the express purpose of army cooperation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Royal Australian Air Force&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 264&amp;ndash;268&lt;/ref&gt; 
He further contended that helicopter operations in Malaysia had afforded the RAAF sufficient experience in the type of conditions they might face in Vietnam, though Australia's senior UH-1 pilot at the time considered that the former theatre offered &quot;little if any hostile opposition, and there was none of the insertion and extraction of [[Special Air Service Regiment (Australia)|SAS]] patrols which was to become such an important part of the RAAF's Vietnam operations&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Power Plus Attitude'', p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; Air Commodore [[Brian Eaton]], as Director-General of Operational Requirements, advised Murdoch that if the Air Force did not more fully satisfy the ground support requirements of the Army, then the Army itself would seek to take control of this sphere of operations, undermining the RAAF's position as the main provider of Australia's air power.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 317&amp;ndash;318&lt;/ref&gt; Murdoch's reluctance to deploy the helicopters was eventually overridden by the Australian government, and [[No. 9 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;9 Squadron]]'s UH-1s were in action in Vietnam less than a year later. When Murdoch visited the combat zone himself in August 1966, he was informed by Brigadier [[Oliver David Jackson|David Jackson]] that the squadron was not performing the role the Army expected of it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Royal Australian Air Force&quot;/&gt;

|quote=As early as 1965 the Army had signalled its thoughts on the desirability of helicopter support for [[1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment|1RAR]] in Vietnam and received a cold rebuff from the RAAF. The Chief of Air Staff at the time, Air Marshal Murdoch, ''may'' have been justified in terms of resource allocation for the stance he took, but the terms in which he rejected the Army's suggestion were tactless at best.

}}
Wilton's successor as CGS, Lieutenant General [[Thomas Daly (general)|Sir Thomas Daly]], urged Murdoch to procure specialised [[Attack helicopter|helicopter gunship]]s such as the [[Bell AH-1 Cobra|AH-1 HueyCobra]] for Vietnam, to support the more vulnerable troop-carrying &quot;slicks&quot;. Murdoch largely ignored the suggestion, telling his staff to treat the Army's recommendation with a lesser priority than &quot;anything we now have on our 'shopping list{{' &quot;}}. His preference was for [[Vertical/Short Takeoff and Landing|V/STOL]] fixed-wing aircraft like the [[Harrier Jump Jet]], which he thought would open a &quot;new era in [[close air support|close support]] aircraft&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p. 299&lt;/ref&gt; In the event, the Federal government earmarked eleven AH-1G HueyCobras for purchase in 1971, though the deal never went ahead due to Australia’s withdrawal from South East Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The RAAF in Vietnam'', pp. 182&amp;ndash;183&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Parnell; Lynch, ''Australia Air Force Since 1911'', p. 176&lt;/ref&gt; Murdoch's failure to appreciate the need for cooperation with land forces has been blamed for fostering long-running enmity between the services, which twenty years later would contribute to the government's decision to transfer the RAAF's battlefield helicopters to the Army.&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Royal Australian Air Force&quot;/&gt; Air Force historian Alan Stephens contended that despite Murdoch's &quot;competence&quot; and &quot;good mind&quot;, his &quot;comprehension of air power in its fullest sense and handling of inter-service politics were respectively inadequate and disastrous&amp;nbsp;... A generation of lieutenant-colonels and majors had come to believe that the RAAF did not care about army support, and they were to carry that belief into the 1970s and beyond&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 321&amp;ndash;322&lt;/ref&gt; Murdoch also opposed sending Canberra jet bombers to Vietnam on what were later described in the official post-war history of the RAAF as &quot;misleading&quot; grounds that the type was unsuitable for low-level strike and close support; however their deployment went ahead in April 1967.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 300&amp;ndash;301&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1963, Australia had selected the F-111 [[Variable-sweep wing|swing-wing]] bomber as a replacement for the Canberra.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 285&amp;ndash;288&lt;/ref&gt; Murdoch attended the much-anticipated official hand-over ceremony for the aircraft on 4&amp;nbsp;September 1968 at [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]], Texas, with Defence Minister [[Allen Fairhall|Sir Allen Fairhall]], various US dignitaries, and RAAF F-111 crews. Within eight days a [[United States Navy|US Navy]] F-111B crashed, followed by a [[United States Air Force|USAF]] F-111A twelve days later, creating a &quot;public relations disaster&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 380&amp;ndash;381&lt;/ref&gt; and contributing to the type's entry into RAAF service being delayed until 1973. In late 1969, Murdoch accompanied Secretary of Defence Sir Henry Bland to the United States to gain assurance of an adequate &quot;safe life&quot; for the F-111's swing-wing mechanism, amid the Australian government giving serious consideration to abandoning the programme.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 381&amp;ndash;389&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
Murdoch retired from the military on 31&amp;nbsp;December 1969 after completing his term as CAS, which the government had extended for an additional twelve months beyond its original three years.&lt;ref name=&quot;WW2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=New Chief of Naval Staff named|newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |location=Sydney|date=27 October 1967 |accessdate=on 28 April 2011 |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=zHgpAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=mucDAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=alister-murdoch&amp;pg=3844%2C3007852
|page=1 |publisher=[[Google News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was succeeded by Air Marshal [[Colin Hannah]], whom Murdoch had earlier recommended for the position of Commander Australian Forces Vietnam (the role went to an Army officer, as had been previous practice).&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The RAAF in Vietnam'', pp. 79&amp;ndash;80&lt;/ref&gt; In 1971, Murdoch joined the board of directors of Meggitt Limited, an [[Vegetable fats and oils|oilseed-crushing]] firm that was chaired by World War&amp;nbsp;II fighter ace [[Nicky Barr]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Who's Who&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dornan, ''Nicky Barr'', pp. 273&amp;ndash;274&lt;/ref&gt; Murdoch continued to exercise his interest in Australia's defence after he left the Air Force, joining in 1975 a group of pundits, including retired Air Vice Marshal [[Ian Dougald McLachlan|Ian McLachlan]], who promoted the addition of [[nuclear weapon]]ry to the country's arsenal. He followed a number of sports, including horse racing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;/&gt; A resident of [[Church Point, New South Wales|Church Point]], New South Wales, Sir Alister Murdoch died on 29&amp;nbsp;November 1984.&lt;ref name=&quot;Air Marshals&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Who's Who&quot;/&gt;
