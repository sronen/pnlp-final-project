[[Air Marshal]] '''Sir Richard Williams''' [[Order of the British Empire|KBE]], [[Order of the Bath|CB]], [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]] (3 August 1890{{spaced ndash}}7 February 1980) is widely regarded as the &quot;father&quot; of the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF). He was the first military pilot trained in Australia, and went on to command Australian and British [[fighter aircraft|fighter]] units in World War&amp;nbsp;I. A proponent for air power independent of other branches of the armed services, Williams played a leading role in the establishment of the RAAF and became its first [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]] (CAS) in 1922. He served as CAS for thirteen years over three terms, longer than any other officer.

Williams came from a [[working class]] background in [[South Australia]]. He was a [[lieutenant]] in the [[Australian Army|Army]] when he learned to fly at [[Point Cook, Victoria|Point Cook]], Victoria, in 1914. As a pilot with the Australian Flying Corps (AFC) in World War I, Williams rose to command [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron AFC]], and later [[No. 40 Wing RAF|40th Wing RAF]]. He was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Order]] and finished the war a [[lieutenant colonel]]. Afterwards he campaigned for an Australian Air Force run separately from the Army and [[Royal Australian Navy|Navy]], which came into being on 31&amp;nbsp;March 1921.

The fledgling RAAF faced numerous challenges to its continued existence in the 1920s and early 1930s, and Williams received much of the credit for maintaining its independence. However an adverse report on flying safety standards saw him dismissed from the position of CAS and seconded to the RAF prior to World War&amp;nbsp;II. Despite support in various quarters for his reinstatement as Air Force chief, and promotion to air marshal in 1940, he never again commanded the RAAF. After the war he was forcibly retired along with a number of other World War I veteran officers. He took up the position of [[Airservices Australia#History|Director-General of Civil Aviation]] in Australia, and was [[knight]]ed the year before his retirement in 1955.

==Early career==
[[Image:A04586Williams.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Richard and Constance Williams, c.&amp;nbsp;1915|alt=Half-length portrait of man in military uniform beside woman wearing white dress]]
Williams was born on 3&amp;nbsp;August 1890 into a [[working class]] family in [[Moonta, South Australia|Moonta Mines]], South Australia.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;&gt;Garrison, ''Australian Dictionary of Biography'', pp.502–505&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Helson, ''Ten Years at the Top'', p.75&lt;/ref&gt; He was the eldest son of Richard Williams, a [[Copper extraction techniques|copper miner]] who had emigrated from [[Cornwall]], England, and his wife Emily.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p.49&lt;/ref&gt; Leaving Moonta Public School at junior secondary level, Williams worked as a [[telegraph]] messenger and later as a bank [[clerk (position)|clerk]]. He enlisted in a [[militia]] unit, the South Australian Infantry Regiment, in 1909 at the age of 19.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Commissioned a [[second lieutenant]] in the 5th Australian Infantry Regiment on 5&amp;nbsp;March 1911, he joined the Permanent Military Forces the following year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Personnel file&quot;&gt;Department of Defence, AIF personnel file&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1914, [[Lieutenant]] Williams took part in Australia's inaugural military flying course at [[Central Flying School RAAF|Central Flying School]], run by Lieutenants [[Henry Petre]] and [[Eric Harrison (RAAF officer)|Eric Harrison]]. After soloing in a [[Bristol Boxkite]] around the airfield at [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Point Cook Base|Point Cook]], Victoria, Williams became the first student to graduate as a pilot, on 12&amp;nbsp;November 1914.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p.1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pathfinder&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|title=Who Was the 'Father of the RAAF'?|journal= Pathfinder, Issue 144, October 2010|publisher= Air Power Development Centre|location=Canberra}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following an administrative and instructional posting, he underwent advanced flying training at Point Cook in July 1915. The next month he married Constance Esther Griffiths, who was 13&amp;nbsp;years his senior. The couple had no children.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;

==World War I==

Williams was promoted [[Captain (land and air)|captain]] on 5&amp;nbsp;January 1916. He was appointed a flight commander in [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron Australian Flying Corps (AFC)]], which was initially numbered 67&amp;nbsp;Squadron [[Royal Flying Corps]] by the British. The unit departed Australia in March 1916 without any aircraft; after arriving in [[Egypt]] it received [[Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2|B.E.2]] fighters, a type deficient in speed and manoeuvrability, and which lacked forward-firing [[machine gun]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cutlack&quot;&gt;Cutlack, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/9/chapters/03.pdf ''The Australian Flying Corps'', pp.32–33]&lt;/ref&gt; Williams wrote that in combat with the German [[Fokker]]s, &quot;our fighting in the air was of short duration but could mean a quick end&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers&quot;&gt;Odgers, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p.28&lt;/ref&gt; and that when it came to bombing, he and his fellow pilots &quot;depended mainly on luck&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cutlack&quot;/&gt; He further quoted a truism in the Flying Corps that &quot;if a new pilot got through his first three days without being shot down he was lucky; if he got through three weeks he was doing well and if he got through three months he was set.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers&quot;/&gt; Williams and the other Australians were initially involved in isolated tasks around the [[Suez Canal]], attached to various Royal Flying Corps units. No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron began to operate concertedly in December 1916, supporting the Allied advance on [[Palestine]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AWM&quot;&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/people/77213.asp Air Marshal Richard Williams] at [[Australian War Memorial]]. Retrieved on 10 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Williams rejoined it in February 1917.&lt;ref name=&quot;Personnel file&quot;/&gt;

Shortly after commencing operations with No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron, Williams narrowly avoided crash-landing when his engine stopped while he was bombing the [[Railhead|railway terminus]] at Tel el Sheria. At first believing that he had been struck by enemy fire, he found that the engine switch outside his cockpit had turned off. Within 500&amp;nbsp;feet of the ground he was able to switch the engine back on and return to base.&lt;ref&gt;Cutlack, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/9/chapters/05.pdf ''The Australian Flying Corps'', pp.56–57]&lt;/ref&gt; On 21&amp;nbsp;April 1917, Williams landed behind enemy lines to rescue downed comrade Lieutenant [[Adrian Cole (RAAF officer)|Adrian Cole]], having the day before pressed home an attack on Turkish cavalry whilst under &quot;intense anti-aircraft fire&quot;; these two actions earned him the [[Distinguished Service Order]] for &quot;conspicuous gallantry&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Cutlack, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/9/chapters/05.pdf ''The Australian Flying Corps'', p.63]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=30234|supp=yes|date=14 August 1917|startpage=8353|accessdate=8 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was promoted [[major]] in May and given command of No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron, which was re-equipped with [[Bristol F.2 Fighter|Bristol Fighters]] later that year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens p.16&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p.16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mordike p.18&quot;&gt;Mordike, ''RAF Air Power Review'', p.18&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Now for the first time,&quot; wrote Williams, &quot;after 17 months in the field we had aircraft with which we could deal with our enemy in the air.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mordike p.18&quot;/&gt;

In June 1918, Williams was made a [[Brevet (military)|brevet]] [[lieutenant colonel]] and commander of the [[Royal Air Force|RAF]]'s [[No. 40 Wing RAF|40th (Army) Wing]], which was operating in Palestine.&lt;ref name=&quot;flyingstart&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Less than a flying start for our own air force|first=Troy |last=Lennon|date=31 March 2011|work=[[The Daily Telegraph (Australia)|The Daily Telegraph]] |location=Sydney|page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; It comprised his former No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron and three British units.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens p.16&quot;/&gt; As a [[British Dominions|Dominion]] officer, however, Williams found that he was not permitted to &quot;exercise powers of punishment over British personnel&quot;, leading to him being temporarily &quot;granted a supplementary commission in the Royal Air Force&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Mordike, ''RAF Air Power Review'', p.29&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=31380|startpage=7070|date=3 June 1919|accessdate=8 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Augmented by a giant [[Handley Page Type O|Handley Page bomber]], his forces took part in the [[Battle of Megiddo (1918)|Battle of Armageddon]], the final offensive in Palestine, where they inflicted &quot;wholesale destruction&quot; on Turkish columns.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.13–14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mordike, ''RAF Air Power Review'', pp.33–35&lt;/ref&gt; Of 40th Wing's actions at [[Wadi al-Far'a|Wadi Fara]] on 21&amp;nbsp;September 1918, Williams wrote: &quot;The Turkish Seventh Army ceased to exist and it must be noted that this was entirely the result of attack from the air.&quot; He also sent Captain [[Ross Macpherson Smith|Ross Smith]] in the Handley Page, accompanied by two Bristol Fighters, to aid Major [[T. E. Lawrence]]'s Arab army north of [[Amman]] when it was harassed by German aircraft operating from [[Daraa|Deraa]].&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, ''100 Years of Australia at War'', pp.84–85&lt;/ref&gt; In November, Williams was appointed temporary commander of the [[RAF Palestine Brigade|Palestine Brigade]],&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rafweb.org/GrpO3.htm Air of Authority]. Retrieved on 27 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; which comprised his previous command, the 40th (Army) Wing, and [[No. 5 Wing RAF|5th (Corps) Wing]]. His service in the theatre later saw him awarded the Order of the Nahda by the [[Kingdom of Hejaz|King of the Hejaz]]. Twice [[mentioned in despatches]], by the end of the war Williams had established himself, in the words of RAAF historian Alan Stephens, as &quot;the AFC's rising star&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens p.16&quot;/&gt;

==Inter-war years==
===Birth of the Royal Australian Air Force===
[[Image:AirBoard1928 AWM 128397.jpg|thumb|left|The RAAF Air Board in 1928, with Air Commodore Williams (front row, centre) as Chief of the Air Staff, and Group Captain Stanley Goble (front row, left)|alt=Formal portrait of three men in military uniforms with peaked caps sitting in front of two men in civilian clothes with broad-brimmed hats]]
Appointed an [[Order of the British Empire|Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] in the 1919 [[New Year Honours]],&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=31098|supp=yes|startpage=92|date=31 December 1918|accessdate=8 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Williams served as Staff Officer, Aviation, at [[Australian Imperial Force]] (AIF) headquarters in [[London]], before returning to Australia and taking up the position of Director of Air Services at Army Headquarters, [[Melbourne]]. The Australian Flying Corps had meanwhile been disbanded at the end of the war, replaced by the [[Australian Air Corps]] (AAC) which was, like the AFC, a branch of the [[Australian Army|Army]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AWM&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.26-31&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.26–31&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon establishment of the Australian Air Board on 9&amp;nbsp;November 1920, Williams and his fellow AAC officers dropped their army ranks in favour of [[RAF officer ranks|those based on the Royal Air Force]]. Williams, now a [[Wing Commander (rank)|wing commander]], personally compiled and tabled the Air Board's submissions to create the Australian Air Force (AAF), a service independent of both the Army and the [[Royal Australian Navy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.26-31&quot;/&gt; Though the heads of the Army and Navy opposed the creation of an independent air force for fear that they would be unable to find air cover for their operations, support from Prime Minister [[Billy Hughes]], as well as prominent parliamentary figures including Treasurer [[Joseph Cook]] and Defense Minister [[George Pearce]] allowed the proposal to succeed.&lt;ref name=&quot;flyingstart&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grey, ''A Military History of Australia'', p.132&lt;/ref&gt; The AAF was duly formed on 31&amp;nbsp;March 1921; Williams deliberately chose this day rather than 1&amp;nbsp;April, the founding date of the RAF three years earlier, &quot;to prevent nasty people referring to us as 'April Fools'&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.26-31&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.31&lt;/ref&gt; The &quot;Royal&quot; prefix was added five months later.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.26-31&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/01.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', pp.15–16]&lt;/ref&gt; Williams proposed an [[ensign]] for the AAF in July 1921, based on the [[Royal Air Force Ensign|Royal Air Force flag]] but featuring the five stars of the [[Southern Cross]] within the RAF [[roundel]] and the [[Commonwealth Star]] in the lower hoist quarter. However, this design was not adopted for the RAAF, the government employing instead a direct copy of the RAF ensign until 1949, when a new design was chosen which included the stars of the [[Australian Flag]].&lt;ref name=&quot;The Australian Experience of Air Power&quot;&gt;Air Power Development Centre, ''The Australian Experience of Air Power'', pp.32–35&lt;/ref&gt;

As the senior officer of the Air Board, Williams held the title of First Air Member, the nascent Air Force initially not being deemed suitable for a &quot;Chief of Staff&quot; appointment equivalent to the Army and Navy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.33-34&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.33–34&lt;/ref&gt; He moved to consolidate the new service's position by expanding its assets and training. Shortly after the AAF's establishment, land was purchased for an air base at [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Laverton Base|Laverton]], eight kilometres inland of Point Cook, and in July 1921, Williams made the initial proposal to develop a base at [[RAAF Base Richmond|Richmond]], New South Wales, the first outside Victoria.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.33-34&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roylance, ''Air Base Richmond'', p.15&lt;/ref&gt; He also started a program to second students from the Army and Navy, including graduates of the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]], to bolster officer numbers; candidates reaped by this scheme included future Air Force chiefs [[John McCauley]], [[Frederick Scherger]], [[Valston Hancock]] and [[Alister Murdoch]], along with other senior identities such as [[Joe Hewitt (RAAF officer)|Joe Hewitt]] and [[Frank Bladin]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.33-34&quot;/&gt; As a leader, Williams would gain a reputation for strong will, absorption in administrative minutiae and a &quot;somewhat puritanical&quot; nature.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.26-31&quot;/&gt; He became known throughout the service as &quot;Dicky&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.16,340&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The spelling &quot;Dickie&quot; is occasionally used, for example in Roylance, ''Air Base Richmond'', p.31, though Roylance also employs &quot;Dicky&quot; on p.36&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chief of the Air Staff===
The position of First Air Member was replaced by [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]] (CAS) in October 1922. Williams would serve as CAS three times over seventeen years in the 1920s and 30s, alternating with Wing Commander (later Air Vice Marshal) [[Stanley Goble]]. One motive suggested for the rotation was a ploy by Army and Navy interests to &quot;curb Williams' independence&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Going Solo&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp.20–23&lt;/ref&gt; Instead the arrangement &quot;almost inevitably fostered an unproductive rivalry&quot; between the two officers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.26-31&quot;/&gt; Although in a legal sense the Air Board was responsible for the RAAF rather than the Chief of Staff alone, Williams dominated the board to such an extent that Goble would later complain that his colleague appeared to consider the Air Force his personal command.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.52–53&lt;/ref&gt;

Williams spent much of 1923 in England, attending the [[Staff College, Camberley|British Army Staff College in Camberley]] and [[RAF Staff College, Andover]], followed by further study in Canada and the United States the following year. Goble served as Chief of the Air Staff in his absence. Shortly after his return in February 1925, Williams scuppered a plan by Goble to establish a small [[seaplane]] base at [[Rushcutters Bay]] in Sydney, instead organising purchase of [[Supermarine Seagull (1921)|Supermarine Seagulls]], the RAAF's first [[amphibious aircraft]], to be based at Richmond.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.42-45&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.42–45&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roylance, ''Air Base Richmond'', p.19&lt;/ref&gt; He was promoted to [[group captain]] in July and later that year drafted a major air warfare study, ''&quot;Memorandum Regarding the Air Defence of Australia&quot;''. Considered prescient in many ways, it treated World War&amp;nbsp;I ally [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] as Australia's main military threat,&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.42-45&quot;/&gt; and advocated inter-service cooperation while maintaining that none of the armed forces was &quot;purely auxiliary to another&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Australian Experience of Air Power&quot;/&gt; Its concepts continue to influence RAAF strategy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.42-45&quot;/&gt;

In 1926, Williams mandated the use of [[parachute]]s for all RAAF aircrew. He had visited the [[Leslie Irvin (parachutist)|Irvin Air Chute Company]] while in the US during 1924 and recommended purchase at the time, however a backlog of orders for the RAF meant that the Australian equipment took almost two years to arrive. [[Flying Officer]] [[Ellis Wackett]] was assigned to instruct volunteers at RAAF Richmond, and made the country's first freefall descent from a military aircraft, an [[Airco DH.9]], on 26&amp;nbsp;May. Williams himself jumped over Point Cook on 5 August, having decided that it would set &quot;a good example if, before issuing an order for the compulsory wearing of parachutes, I showed my own confidence in them...&quot; Though his descent took him perilously close to the base water tank (&quot;I thought it would be a poor ending to drown there, or even to be pulled out dripping wet&quot;) and &quot;too close to be comfortable to a 30,000 volt electric transmission line&quot;, he completed the exercise unscathed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Third Brother pp.336-337&quot;&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp.336–337&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:WilliamsPacificIslands.gif|thumb|right|300px|Group Captain Williams (right) with Flight Lieutenant McIntyre (left) and an RAAF mechanic (centre) on their Pacific Islands flight in 1926|alt=Large biplane on floats with three men in civilian clothes in the foreground]]
The young Air Force was a small organisation with the atmosphere of a [[flying club]]; however several pioneering flights were made by its members.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.36–37&lt;/ref&gt; Goble had commanded the first [[circumnavigation]] of Australia by air in 1924 while he was CAS. On 25&amp;nbsp;September 1926, with two crew members including Goble's pilot, [[Ivor McIntyre]], Williams commenced a {{convert|10000|mi|km|sing=on}} round trip from Point Cook to the [[Solomon Islands]] in a [[De Havilland DH.50]]A [[floatplane]], to study the South Pacific region as a possible theatre of operations.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, ''Aerogram'', p.4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.39-41&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.39–41&lt;/ref&gt; The trio returned on 7&amp;nbsp;December to a 12-plane RAAF escort and a 300-man honour guard.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilson&quot;&gt;Wilson, ''The Brotherhood of Airmen'', pp.34–35&lt;/ref&gt; Though seen partly as a &quot;matter of prestige&quot; brought on by contemporary newspaper reports that claimed &quot;'certain Foreign Powers'&quot; were planning such a journey, and also as a &quot;reaction&quot; by Williams to Goble's 1924 expedition,&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, ''The Eagle and the Albatross'', pp.24–25&lt;/ref&gt; it was notable as the first international flight undertaken by an RAAF plane and crew.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.39-41&quot;/&gt; Williams was appointed a [[Order of the British Empire|Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (CBE) in the 1927 [[Queen's Birthday Honours|King's Birthday Honours]] in recognition of the achievement,&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=33280|supp=yes|startpage=3611|date=31 May 1927|accessdate=8 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and promoted to [[air commodore]] on 1 July the same year.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;

As CAS, Williams had to contend with serious challenges to the RAAF's continued existence from the Army and Navy in 1929 and 1932, arising from the competing demands for defence funding during the [[Great Depression]]. According to Williams, only after 1932 was the independence of the Air Force assured.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.50-52&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.50–52&lt;/ref&gt; Williams again handed over the reins of CAS to Goble in 1933 to attend the [[Royal College of Defence Studies|Imperial Defence College]] in London, resuming his position in June 1934. His promotion to [[air vice marshal]] on 1&amp;nbsp;January 1935 belatedly raised him to the equivalent rank of his fellow Chiefs of Staff in the Army and Navy.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; He was made a [[Order of the Bath|Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in June that year.&lt;ref name=&quot;AWM Timeline&quot;&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/people/timeLine_77213.asp Timeline: Air Marshal Richard Williams] at Australian War Memorial. Retrieved on 10 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Williams encouraged the local aircraft industry as a means to further the self-sufficiency of the Air Force and Australian aviation in general. He played a personal part in the creation of the [[Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation]] in November 1936, headed up by former [[Squadron Leader]] [[Lawrence Wackett]], late of the RAAF's Experimental Section.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.50-52&quot;/&gt; Williams made the first overseas flight in an aeroplane designed and built in Australia when he accompanied Squadron Leader [[Allan Walters]] and two aircrew aboard a [[Lawrence Wackett#Wackett in the 1930s|Tugan Gannet]] to [[Singapore]] in February 1938.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilson&quot;/&gt;

A series of mishaps with [[Hawker Demon]]s at the end of 1937, which resulted in one pilot dying and four injured, subjected the Air Force to harsh public criticism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coulthard-Clark1990&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Coulthard-Clark|first1=C.

When war broke out in September 1939, Williams was [[Air Officer]] in charge of Administration at RAF [[Coastal Command]], a position he had held since February that year, following a brief posting to the British [[Air Ministry]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AWM Timeline&quot;/&gt; Goble had succeeded Williams as Chief of the Air Staff for the last time but clashed with the Federal government over implementation of the [[British Commonwealth Air Training Plan|Empire Air Training Scheme]] and stepped down in early 1940. Williams was recalled from Britain with the expectation of again taking up the RAAF's senior position but Prime Minister [[Robert Menzies]] insisted on a British officer commanding the service, over the protest of his Minister for Air, [[James Fairbairn]], and the RAF's Air Chief Marshal [[Charles Burnett (RAF officer)|Sir Charles Burnett]] became CAS.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.113–116&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McKernan, ''The Strength of a Nation'', pp.41–42&lt;/ref&gt; In his volume in the [[Australia in the War of 1939–1945|official history of the Air Force in World War&amp;nbsp;II]], Douglas Gillison observed that considering Williams' intimate knowledge of the RAAF and its problems, and his long experience commanding the service, &quot;it is difficult to see what contribution Burnett was expected to make that was beyond Williams' capacity&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/03.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', p.77]&lt;/ref&gt; Williams was appointed Air Member for Organisation and Equipment and promoted to [[air marshal]], the first man in the RAAF to achieve this rank.&lt;ref&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/05.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', pp.92–93]&lt;/ref&gt;

Williams returned to England in October 1941 to set up [[RAAF Overseas Headquarters]], coordinating services for the large number of Australians posted there.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; He maintained that Australian airmen in Europe and the Mediterranean should serve in RAAF units to preserve their national identity, as per [[Article XV squadrons|Article XV]] of the Empire Air Training Scheme, rather than be integrated into RAF squadrons, but in practice most served in British units.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.63–64&lt;/ref&gt; Even nominally &quot;RAAF&quot; squadrons formed under the Scheme were rarely composed primarily of Australians, and Williams' efforts to establish a distinct RAAF Group within [[RAF Bomber Command|Bomber Command]], similar to the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]]'s [[No. 6 Group RCAF|No.&amp;nbsp;6 Group]], did not come to fruition.&lt;ref&gt;Herington, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/28/chapters/17.pdf ''Air War Against Germany and Italy'', pp.452–455]&lt;/ref&gt; He was, however, able to negotiate improvements to conditions of RAAF personnel in Europe, including full Australian pay scales as opposed to the lower RAF rates that were offered initially.&lt;ref&gt;Herington, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/28/chapters/20.pdf ''Air War Against Germany and Italy'', pp.543–544]&lt;/ref&gt;

When Air Chief Marshal Burnett completed his term in 1942, Williams was once more considered for the role of CAS. However this was vetoed by Prime Minister [[John Curtin]] and the appointment unexpectedly went to acting Air Commodore George Jones.&lt;ref&gt;Helson, ''Ten Years at the Top'', pp.64–68&lt;/ref&gt; A mooted [[Inspector General]]ship of the Air Force, which would have seen Williams reporting directly to the Minister for Air, also failed to materialise.&lt;ref&gt;Helson, ''Ten Years at the Top'', p.59&lt;/ref&gt; Instead Williams was posted to [[Washington, D.C.]] as the RAAF's representative to the [[Combined Chiefs of Staff]] in the United States, and remained there until the end of the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;

In 1946, Williams was forced into retirement despite being four years below the mandatory age of 60. All other senior RAAF commanders who were veteran pilots of World War&amp;nbsp;I, with the exception of the-then Chief of the Air Staff, Air Vice Marshal Jones, were also dismissed, ostensibly to make way for the advancement of younger officers. Williams regarded the grounds for his removal as &quot;specious&quot;, calling it &quot;the meanest piece of service administration in my experience&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Going Solo&quot;/&gt;

Following his completion of duty in the Air Force, Williams was appointed Australia's [[Airservices Australia#History|Director-General of Civil Aviation]], serving in the position for almost 10 years. His department was responsible for the expansion of communications and infrastructure to support domestic and international aviation, establishing &quot;an enviable safety record&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Williams' tenure coincided with the beginnings of the government carrier [[Trans Australia Airlines]] (TAA) and introduction of the [[Two Airlines Policy]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aph.gov.au/library/pubs/online/ansettchron_PartA.htm Ansett Chronology] at Australian Parliamentary Library.

William's wife Constance died in 1948 and he married Lois Victoria Cross on 7&amp;nbsp;February 1950.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; He was appointed [[Order of the British Empire|Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (KBE) in the 1954 New Year Honours,&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=40054|startpage=40|date=29 December 1953|accessdate=8 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; the year before he retired from the Director-Generalship of Civil Aviation. He then took up a place on the board of [[TEAL|Tasman Empire Airways Limited]] (TEAL), forerunner of [[Air New Zealand]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; In 1977, Williams published his memoirs, ''These Are Facts'', described in 2001 as &quot;immensely important if idiosyncratic&amp;nbsp;... the only substantial, worthwhile record of service ever written by an RAAF chief of staff&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.26-31&quot;/&gt;

Sir Richard Williams died in Melbourne on 7&amp;nbsp;February 1980. He was accorded an Air Force funeral, with a [[flypast]] by seventeen aircraft.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;

For his stewardship of the Air Force prior to World War&amp;nbsp;II, as well as his part in its establishment in 1921, Williams is considered the &quot;father&quot; of the RAAF.&lt;ref name=&quot;AWM&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.26-31&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;&gt;Dennis et al, ''The Oxford Companion to Australian Military History'', pp.670–671&lt;/ref&gt; The epithet had earlier been applied to Eric Harrison, who had sole charge of Central Flying School after Henry Petre was posted to the Middle East in 1915, and was also a founding member of the RAAF. By the 1970s, however, the mantle had settled on Williams.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pathfinder&quot;/&gt; Between the wars he had continually striven for his service's status as a separate branch of the Australian armed forces, seeing off a number of challenges to its independence from Army and Navy interests.&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.47–51&lt;/ref&gt; He remains the RAAF's longest-serving Chief, totalling thirteen years over three terms: October to December 1922; February 1925 to December 1932; and June 1934 to February 1939.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defence.gov.au/raaf/leaders/formerchiefs.htm Royal Australian Air Force leaders: Former Chiefs of the Air Force] at RAAF Official Site.

In his 1925 paper ''&quot;Memorandum Regarding the Air Defence of Australia&quot;'', Williams defined &quot;the fundamental nature of Australia's defence challenge&quot; and &quot;the enduring characteristics of the RAAF's strategic thinking&quot;. Ignored by the government of the day, the study's operational precepts became the basis for Australia's defence strategy in the 1980s, which remains in place in the 21st century.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Australian Experience of Air Power&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.42-45&quot;/&gt; However his input to debate in the 1930s around the &quot;[[Singapore strategy]]&quot; of dependence on the [[Royal Navy]] for the defence of the Pacific region has been criticised as limited, and as having &quot;failed to demonstrate the validity of his claims for the central role of air power&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;/&gt;

Williams' legacy extends to the very look of the RAAF. He personally chose the colour of the Air Force's winter uniform, a shade &quot;somewhere between royal and navy blue&quot;, designed to distinguish it from the lighter Royal Air Force shade.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.453&lt;/ref&gt; Unique at the time among [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] forces, the uniform was changed to an all-purpose middle blue suit in 1972 but following numerous complaints in the ensuing years reverted to Williams' original colour and style in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;MacDougall, ''Australians at War'', p.91&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p.305&lt;/ref&gt;
