'''John Lloyd Waddy''' [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]], [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|DFC]] (10 December 1916 – 11&amp;nbsp;September 1987) was a senior officer and aviator in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF), who later served as a member of the [[New South Wales Legislative Assembly]] and [[Minister of the Crown]]. As a [[fighter pilot]] during [[Military history of Australia during World War II|World War II]], he shot down fifteen enemy aircraft in the [[Western Desert Campaign|Desert War]], becoming one of Australia's top-scoring [[Flying ace|aces]] and earning the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross]]. He went on to command [[No. 80 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;80 Squadron]] in the [[South West Pacific theatre of World War II|South West Pacific]], where he was awarded the US [[Air Medal]]. He was also one of eight senior pilots who took part in the &quot;[[Morotai Mutiny]]&quot; of April 1945. 

Discharged from the Permanent Air Force at the end of the war, Waddy took a commission in the RAAF Reserve, leading the organisation as a [[Group Captain]] in the early 1950s. He was active in business and in veterans' groups, and was appointed an [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] in 1955. As the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]] [[Electoral district of Kirribilli|Member for Kirribilli]] from 1962 to 1976, he held cabinet posts in the [[New South Wales Parliament]], including Minister for Child Welfare and Social Welfare (later Youth and Community Services), [[Minister for Health (New South Wales)|Minister for Health]], and [[Minister for Police and Emergency Services (New South Wales)|Minister for Police]] and [[Minister for Police and Emergency Services (New South Wales)|Services]]. He retired from politics in 1976, and died in 1987 at the age of seventy.

==Family and early life==
Born in Sydney on 10&amp;nbsp;December 1916, Waddy was the son of [[first-class cricket]]er Edgar Lloyd Waddy and his wife Lottchen, and great-grandson of General Sir Richard Waddy [[Order of the Bath|KCB]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Who's Who 1980&quot;&gt;Draper, ''Who's Who in Australia 1980'', p. 840&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Who's Who 1950&quot;&gt;Alexander, ''Who's Who in Australia 1950'', p. 724&lt;/ref&gt; His four siblings included a sister and three brothers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Legislative Assembly&quot;/&gt; Edgar Waddy established the real estate firm of E.L.&amp;nbsp;Waddy &amp; Son in [[Rose Bay, New South Wales|Rose Bay]], which John joined as a clerk after completing his education at [[The King's School, Parramatta]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Who's Who 1950&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Newton&quot;&gt;Newton, ''Australian Air Aces'', pp. 114–115&lt;/ref&gt; He married Vera Nellie May (Ve) Dengate on 21&amp;nbsp;July 1938; the couple had a son, Lloyd, and two daughters, Denise and Rosalind.&lt;ref name=&quot;Who's Who 1980&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ve Waddy obit&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://www.smh.com.au/news/obituaries/her-name-on-a-war-plane-says-it-all/2006/06/29/1151174327898.html Her name on a war plane says it all]&quot; at ''[http://www.smh.com.au/ The Sydney Morning Herald]''.

Waddy enlisted in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) in late 1940, learning to fly under the [[Commonwealth Air Training Plan|Empire Air Training Scheme]] (EATS) in [[Rhodesia]]. His two older brothers, Edgar and Richard, were also pilots. Edgar had taken a short-service commission with the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) in the 1930s, while Richard trained in Canada with EATS during the war prior to active duty in Britain, where he was killed flying a single-engined [[Fighter aircraft|fighter]] in 1941.&lt;ref name=&quot;Legislative Assembly&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Newton&quot;/&gt; Waddy's elder sister, Lett, was commissioned into the Women's Volunteer Naval Reserve, and his younger brother Rowen served as an officer with [[Z Special Unit]] in the [[South West Pacific theatre of World War II|South West Pacific]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Legislative Assembly&quot;/&gt;

Completing his training in June 1941, [[Pilot Officer]] Waddy was posted to the [[North African Campaign|North African theatre]] with [[No. 250 Squadron RAF|No.&amp;nbsp;250 (Fighter) Squadron RAF]], operating [[Curtiss P-40|P-40]] Tomahawks and, later, Kittyhawks.&lt;ref name=&quot;Newton&quot;/&gt; He was befriended and mentored by the RAAF's top-scoring [[Flying ace|ace]], [[Clive Caldwell|Clive &quot;Killer&quot; Caldwell]], who became godfather to Waddy's daughter.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alexander&quot;&gt;Alexander, &quot;Cleaning the Augean stables&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Waddy's first operational [[sortie]] was as Caldwell's [[wingman]]; he found the ensuing [[dogfight]] so fast and confusing that he had no idea what was happening and afterwards had to ask the more experienced pilot how things had gone.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, ''Clive Caldwell: Air Ace'', p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; On 9&amp;nbsp;December, however, he registered his first victory—in a Tomahawk that had previously been Caldwell's personal mount—when he shared in the destruction of a [[Messerschmitt Bf 110|Messerschmitt Bf110]] twin-engined fighter near [[Gamal Abdul El Nasser Air Base|El Adem]].&lt;ref&gt;Newton, ''Clash of Eagles'', p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, ''Tomahawk and Kittyhawk Aces of the RAF and Commonwealth'', p. 107&lt;/ref&gt; 

By the end of April 1942, Waddy had scored four-and-a-half victories over enemy aircraft. Promoted [[Flying Officer]], he achieved four &quot;kills&quot; in a single sortie on 12&amp;nbsp;May 1942, destroying two [[Junkers Ju 52|Junkers Ju52]] cargo planes and two escorting Bf110s from a German air transport convoy operating between [[Crete]] and North Africa.&lt;ref name=&quot;Newton&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Herington, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/28/chapters/10.pdf ''Air War Against Germany and Italy''], p. 231&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] (DFC) for this action, [[London Gazette|gazetted]] on 2&amp;nbsp;October. The citation praised his &quot;masterly airmanship as a fighter pilot&quot; and his &quot;great courage and devotion to duty&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=35727|supp=yes|startpage=4273|date=2 October 1942|accessdate=25 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after claiming a victory over a [[Messerschmitt Bf 109|Messerschmitt Bf109]] on 22 May, Waddy was posted to another RAF unit, [[No. 260 Squadron RAF|No.&amp;nbsp;260 Squadron]], flying Kittyhawks.&lt;ref name=&quot;Newton&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Newton, ''Clash of Eagles'', p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; He accounted for two enemy aircraft in June, before being assigned to [[4 Squadron SAAF|No. 4 Squadron]], [[South African Air Force]], with which he destroyed a Bf109 in September.&lt;ref&gt;Newton, ''Clash of Eagles'', pp. 65–66, 70&lt;/ref&gt; In October, following the award of his DFC, Waddy began flying [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire Vs]] in [[No. 92 Squadron RAF|No.&amp;nbsp;92 Squadron RAF]]. He claimed a further three victories with his latest unit before being posted back to Australia on 19&amp;nbsp;November 1942. His final tally of fifteen-and-a-half victories made him one of the most successful Allied fighter pilots in the Desert War, and second only to Caldwell among the RAAF contingent.&lt;ref&gt;Newton, ''Clash of Eagles'', pp. 71, 73, 79&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, ''Air Force Australia'', p. 125&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1945, Waddy joined Caldwell, Arthur, Gibbes and four other senior 1TAF pilots in an action that became known as the &quot;[[Morotai Mutiny]]&quot;.
