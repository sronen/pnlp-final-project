'''Thomas Currie''' &quot;'''Diver'''&quot; '''Derrick''' [[Victoria Cross|VC]], [[Distinguished Conduct Medal|DCM]] (20 March 1914&amp;nbsp;– 24 May 1945) was an [[List of Australian Victoria Cross recipients|Australian recipient]] of the [[Victoria Cross]], the highest decoration for gallantry &quot;in the face of the enemy&quot; awarded to members of the [[United Kingdom|British]] and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] armed forces. In November 1943, during the [[Second World War]], Derrick was awarded the Victoria Cross for his assault on a heavily defended Japanese position at [[Sattelberg]], [[New Guinea]]. During the engagement, he scaled a cliff face while under heavy fire and silenced seven machine gun posts, before leading his platoon in a charge that destroyed a further three.   

Born in the [[Adelaide]] suburb of [[Medindie, South Australia]], Derrick left school at the age of fourteen and found work in a bakery. As the [[Great Depression]] grew worse he lost his job and moved to [[Berri, South Australia|Berri]], working on a fruit farm before marrying in 1939. In July 1941, Derrick enlisted in the [[Second Australian Imperial Force]], joining the 2/48th Battalion. He was posted to the Middle East, where he took part in the [[Siege of Tobruk]], was recommended for the [[Military Medal]] and promoted to corporal. Later, at [[First Battle of El Alamein|El Alamein]], Derrick was awarded the [[Distinguished Conduct Medal]] for knocking out three German machine gun posts, destroying two tanks, and capturing one hundred prisoners.

Derrick returned to Australia with his battalion in February 1943, before transferring to the [[South West Pacific Theatre]] where he fought in the battle to capture [[Lae]]. Back in Australia the following February he was posted to an officer cadet training unit, being commissioned lieutenant in November 1944. In April 1945 his battalion was sent to the Pacific island of [[Morotai]], an assembly point for the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] invasion of the Philippines. Engaged in action the following month on the heavily defended hill ''Freda'' on [[Tarakan Island]] Derrick was hit by five bullets from a Japanese machine gun.  He died from his wounds on 24 May 1945.

== Early life ==
Derrick was born in the [[Adelaide]] suburb of [[Medindie, South Australia]], on 20 March 1914 to David Derrick, a labourer from [[Ireland]], and his Australian wife, Ada (née Whitcombe). The Derricks were poor, and Tom often walked barefoot to attend [[Sturt Street, Adelaide|Sturt Street]] Public School and later [[Le Fevre Peninsula]] School.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;&gt;{{Australian Dictionary of Biography|last=Gammage|first=Bill|year=1993|id=A130694b|title=Derrick, Thomas Currie (Tom) (1914–1945)|accessdate=27 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1928, aged fourteen, Derrick left school and found work in a bakery. By this time, he had developed a keen interest in sports, particularly [[cricket]], [[Australian Rules Football]], [[boxing]] and [[human swimming|swimming]]; his diving in the [[Port River]] earned him the nickname of &quot;Diver&quot;.{{sfn|Macklin|2008|pp=134–135}}

With the advent of the [[Great Depression]], Derrick scraped a living from odd jobs—such as fixing bicycles and selling newspapers—to supplement his job as a baker. When in 1931, the Depression worsened, Derrick lost his bakery job and, with friends, headed by bicycle for the regional town of [[Berri, South Australia|Berri]]—approximately {{convert|225|km|mi}} away—in search of work.&lt;ref name=&quot;AWM&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/people/8249.asp|title=Lieutenant Thomas Currie 'Diver' Derrick, VC, DCM|accessdate=27 July 2008|work=Who’s who in Australian Military History|publisher=Australian War Memorial}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jobs in Berri were hard to come by and Derrick and two friends spent the next few months living in a tent on the banks of the [[Murray River]]. When the annual [[Royal Adelaide Show]] opened that year, Derrick went to the boxing pavilion to accept a challenge of staying upright for three rounds with the ex-lightweight champion of Australia. Although he was knocked down in the second round, he immediately got back to his feet and won the bet; albeit at the cost of a black eye, and a few bruised ribs.{{sfn|Macklin|2008|pp=134–135}}

Eventually, towards the end of 1931, Derrick found work picking fruit at a vineyard in [[Winkie, South Australia|Winkie]], a short distance outside Berri. He later moved onto a fulltime job at a nearby fruit farm, remaining there for the next nine years.{{sfn|Staunton|2005|p=259}} On 24 June 1939, Derrick married Clarance Violet &quot;Beryl&quot; Leslie—his &quot;one true love&quot; whom he had met at a dance in Adelaide seven years earlier{{sfn|Macklin|2008|pp=134–135}}—at St Laurence's Catholic Church, [[North Adelaide]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot; /&gt;

== Second World War ==
Derrick did not join up when war broke out in September 1939 but, like many Australians, enlisted after the [[Battle of France|fall of France]] in June 1940.{{sfn|Horner|2002|p=66}} He joined the [[Second Australian Imperial Force]] on 5 July 1940,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/script/veteran.asp?ServiceID=A&amp;VeteranID=671466 |title=Derrick, Thomas Currie |accessdate=27 July 2008 |work=World War II Nominal Roll |publisher=Commonwealth of Australia |year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was posted to the [[2/48th Battalion (Australia)|2/48th Battalion]], [[26th Brigade (Australia)|26th Brigade]], as a [[Private (rank)|private]]. Derrick first joined his unit at the [[Wayville Showgrounds]], before basic training at [[Woodside, South Australia|Woodside]].{{sfn|Macklin|2008|p=136}}&lt;ref name=&quot;2/48&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.awm.gov.au/units/unit_11288.asp|title=2/48th Battalion |accessdate=27 July 2008|work= Australian military units |publisher=Australian War Memorial}}&lt;/ref&gt; Derrick thrived on military life, but found discipline difficult to accept.{{sfn|Horner|2002|p=66}}

In October, the 2/48th Battalion paraded through the streets of Adelaide to [[Mitcham railway station, Adelaide|Mitcham railway station]] prior to its embarkation for the [[Middle East]]. The battalion's voyage overseas was postponed until 17 November, when the unit boarded the SS ''Stratheden''.{{sfn|Macklin|2008|p=136}} The ship made a stop at Perth, where Derrick was confined onboard for going absent without leave to sightsee. He was soon in more trouble, and was charged and fined for punching another soldier who taunted him over this incident.{{sfn|Horner|2002|p=66}}

=== North Africa ===
On arrival in [[British Mandate of Palestine|Palestine]], the 2/48th Battalion encamped at [[El Kantara]] and began training in desert warfare. For relaxation, the battalion set up athletic events, and Derrick became well known for often winning cross-country races—and for organising a [[Bookmaker|book]] on the outcomes.{{sfn|Macklin|2008|p=136}} In March 1941, the unit went by train and truck to [[Alexandria, Egypt]], then along the North African coast to [[Cyrenaica]], in [[Libya]], to join the [[9th Division (Australia)|9th Australian Division]].&lt;ref name=&quot;2/48&quot; /&gt;{{sfn|Macklin|2008|p=137}}

[[File:Tom Derrick VC 016247.jpg|thumb|alt=An informal portrait of a man in military uniform holding a rifle.|upright|left|200px|Sergeant Derrick, November 1943]]

After the 2/48th Battalion completed its training with the 9th Division at Cyrenaica,&lt;ref name=&quot;2/48&quot; /&gt; they were moved further along the coast to Gazala. Then, just as they began to dig in, the battalion was abruptly withdrawn to [[Tobruk]] in response to the German [[Afrika Korps]]' advance.{{sfn|Macklin|2008|p=137}} They entered Tobruk on 9 April 1941, and spent the following eight months [[Siege of Tobruk|besieged]] by [[Axis powers|Axis]] forces.&lt;ref name=&quot;2/48&quot; /&gt; While there, Derrick acquired an Italian [[Breda Meccanica Bresciana#Breda machine guns|Breda machine gun]] and regularly led fighting patrols against both German and Italian troops.{{sfn|Macklin|2008|p=137}} Although Derrick's bravery was noted during the siege, he wrote in his diary about his constant fear of dying.{{sfn|Johnston|1996|p=19}}

On the night of 30 April, the Axis forces assaulted Tobruk's outer defences and managed to capture substantial ground. In response, the 2/48th Battalion was ordered to counter-attack the following evening. During the ensuing engagement, Derrick fought as a section member in the far left flank of the attack. After suffering heavy casualties in what Derrick described as &quot;a bobby dazzler of a fire fight&quot;, the battalion was forced to withdraw. Praised for his leadership and bravery during the assault,{{sfn|Macklin|2008|pp=137–138}} Derrick was immediately promoted to [[corporal]],&lt;ref name=&quot;AWM&quot; /&gt;{{sfn|Macklin|2008|pp=137–138}} and recommended for the [[Military Medal]]. The award, however, was never made.{{sfn|Macklin|2008|pp=137–138}}

In late May, Derrick discovered a German posing as a British tank officer and reported him to [[Company (military unit)|company]] headquarters; the man was immediately arrested as a spy.{{sfn|Macklin|2008|pp=138–139}} Following a period of heavy fighting in June, the 2/48th Battalion was placed in reserve for a few days the following month. Promoted to [[platoon sergeant]] in September, Derrick—along with the rest of his battalion—was withdrawn from Tobruk and returned to Palestine aboard [[HMS Kingston (F64)|HMS ''Kingston'']] on 22 October. Disembarking at [[Tel Aviv]], they were given three days' leave in the city, before returning for training.{{sfn|Macklin|2008|pp=138–139}}

Following a period of rest and light garrison duties in [[Syria]], the 2/48th Battalion was rushed to [[El Alamein]], Egypt, to reinforce the British [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|Eighth Army]].&lt;ref name=&quot;2/48&quot; /&gt; During the [[First Battle of El Alamein]] on 10 July 1942,{{sfn|Staunton|2005|p=259}} Derrick took part in the 26th Australian Brigade's attack on Tel el Eisa.&lt;ref name=&quot;2/48&quot; /&gt; In the initial assault, Derrick, against a barrage of German grenades, led an attack against three machine gun posts and succeeded in destroying the positions before capturing over one hundred [[Prisoner of war|prisoners]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot; /&gt;{{sfn|Staunton|2005|p=259}} During the Axis counter-attack that evening, the Australian line was overrun by tanks. As the German infantry following the tanks advanced, Derrick's company led a charge against the men.{{sfn|Macklin|2008|pp=138–139}} During the engagement, Derrick managed to destroy two German tanks using [[sticky bomb]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot; /&gt;{{sfn|Staunton|2005|p=259}} Commended for his &quot;outstanding leadership and courage&quot;, Derrick was awarded the [[Distinguished Conduct Medal]] for his part in the fighting at Tel el Eisa.&lt;ref name=&quot;DCM&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/awm192/00305/003050480.pdf|title=Recommendation for Thomas Currie Derrick to be awarded a Distinguished Conduct Medal|accessdate=27 July 2008 |format=PDF |work=Index to Recommendations: Second World War |publisher=Australian War Memorial}}&lt;/ref&gt; The award was announced in a supplement to the ''[[London Gazette]]'' on 18 February 1943.&lt;ref name=&quot;LGDCM&quot;&gt;{{LondonGazette |issue=35908 |date=18 February 1943 |startpage=864 |supp=yes |accessdate=27 July 2008}} (DCM)&lt;/ref&gt;

Promoted to [[sergeant]] on 28 July,{{sfn|Staunton|2005|p=259}} Derrick led a six-man reconnaissance on 3 October, successfully pinpointing several German machine gun positions and strongholds; this information was to be vital for the upcoming [[Second Battle of El Alamein]].{{sfn|Macklin|2008|p=141}} The El Alamein offensive was launched on 23 October, with the 9th Australian Division taking part.&lt;ref name=&quot;2/48&quot; /&gt; At one point during the engagement, Derrick jumped up onto an [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] gun carrier heading towards the Germans. Armed with a [[Thompson submachine gun]] and under intense heavy fire, Derrick attacked and knocked out three machine gun posts while standing in the carrier. He then had the driver reverse up to each post so he could ensure each position was silenced. By the following morning, Derrick's platoon occupied all three posts. The members of the 2/48th Battalion who witnessed Derrick's action were sure he would be awarded the Victoria Cross, though no recommendation was made.{{sfn|Macklin|2008|pp=142–143}}

Disembarking at [[Port Melbourne]] in late February 1943,&lt;ref name=&quot;2/48&quot; /&gt;{{sfn|Macklin|2008|pp=144–145}} Derrick was granted a period of leave and travelled by train to Adelaide where he spent time with Beryl. He rejoined his battalion—now encamped in the outskirts of Adelaide—before they went by train to the [[Atherton Tableland]] for training in jungle warfare. Brought up to full strength by the end of April, the 2/48th Battalion completed its training following landing-craft exercises near [[Cairns, Queensland|Cairns]].{{sfn|Macklin|2008|pp=144–145}} On 23 July, Derrick was attached to the 21st Brigade Headquarters but admitted to hospital for old injuries to his right eye later the same day.&lt;ref name=&quot;ServRec&quot; /&gt; After hospital, Derrick returned briefly to Brigade before rejoining the 2/48th Battalion on 27 August.&lt;ref name=&quot;ServRec&quot; /&gt;

For much of August, the 2/48th Battalion had been in training for the Allied attack on [[Lae]], in [[Papua New Guinea]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot; /&gt;{{sfn|Macklin|2008|pp=144–145}} The unit's objective was to land on a strip of land designated as &quot;Red Beach&quot;, and then fight their way approximately {{convert|30|km|mi}} west towards Lae. Following a bombardment by American [[Destroyer (ship)|destroyers]], Derrick's wave [[Landing at Lae|landed on the beach]] with minimal casualties on 4 September. Ten days later, the 2/48th Battalion's C Company—led by Derrick's platoon—captured [[Malahang, Papua New Guinea|Malahang]] airstrip, before Lae fell to the Allies on 16 September.{{sfn|Macklin|2008|pp=144–145}} Derrick was scornful of the Japanese defence of Lae, and wrote in his diary that &quot;our greatest problem was trying to catch up&quot; with the retreating Japanese force.{{sfn|Johnston|2000|p=108}}

==== Victoria Cross ====
Following Lae, the 9th Division was tasked to seize [[Finschhafen]], clear the [[Huon Peninsula]] and gain control of the [[Vitiaz Strait]]. By 2 October, one of the division's brigades had gained a foothold on Finschhafen, but soon encountered fierce Japanese resistance.

The Australian attack on Sattelberg began in mid-November, with the Japanese slowly giving ground and withdrawing back up the precipitous slopes. Each side suffered heavy casualties, and on 20 November, Derrick—who had been acting as [[company sergeant major]] for the previous month—was given command of B Company's 11 platoon after the unit had &quot;lost all but one of their leaders&quot;.{{sfn|Macklin|2008|pp=146–147}} By 22 November, the 2/23rd and 2/48th Battalions had reached the southern slopes of Sattelberg, holding a position approximately {{convert|600|m|yd}} from the summit. A landslide had blocked the only road, so the final assault was made by infantry alone, without supporting tanks.{{sfn|Staunton|2005|p=259}}

On 24 November, the 2/48th Battalion's B Company was ordered to outflank a strong Japanese position sited on a cliff face, prior to attacking a feature {{convert|140|m|yd}} from the Sattelberg township. The nature of the terrain meant that the only possible route was up a slope covered with [[Imperata cylindrica|kunai grass]] directly beneath the cliffs. Over a period of two hours, the Australians made several attempts to clamber up the slopes to reach their objective, but each time they were repulsed by intense machine gun fire and grenade attacks. As dusk fell, it appeared impossible to reach the objective or even hold the ground already gained, and the company was ordered to withdraw.{{sfn|Staunton|2005|p=259}}{{sfn|Arthur|2005|pp=440–441}} In response, Derrick replied to his company commander: &quot;Bugger the CO.

[[File:Derrick VC flag 016246.JPG|thumb|alt=A kneeling man in military uniform raising a flag up a flag pole.|upright|200px|Sergeant Tom Derrick hoists the [[Australian Red Ensign]] at Sattelberg, New Guinea]]

Moving forward with his platoon, Derrick attacked a Japanese post that had been holding up the advance. He destroyed the position with grenades and ordered his second section around to the right flank. The section soon came under heavy machine gun and grenade fire from six Japanese posts.{{sfn|Staunton|2005|p=259}}{{sfn|Arthur|2005|pp=440–441}} Clambering up the cliff face under heavy fire, Derrick held on with one hand while lobbing grenades into the weapon pits with the other, like &quot;a man&amp;nbsp;... &amp;nbsp;shooting for [a] goal at basketball&quot;.{{sfn|Reid|2000|pp=28–29}} Climbing further up the cliff and in full view of the Japanese, Derrick continued to attack the posts with grenades before following up with accurate rifle fire. Within twenty minutes, he had reached the peak and cleared seven posts,{{sfn|Reid|2000|pp=28–29}} while the demoralised Japanese defenders fled from their positions to the buildings of Sattelberg.{{sfn|Macklin|2008|pp=146–147}}{{sfn|Arthur|2005|pp=440–441}}

Derrick then returned to his platoon, where he gathered his first and third sections in preparation for an assault on the three remaining machine gun posts in the area. Attacking the posts, Derrick personally rushed forward on four separate occasions and threw his grenades at a range of about {{convert|7|m|yd}}, before all three were silenced.{{sfn|Staunton|2005|p=259}}{{sfn|Arthur|2005|pp=440–441}} Derrick's platoon held their position that night,{{sfn|Macklin|2008|pp=146–147}} before the 2/48th Battalion moved in to take Sattelberg unopposed the following morning.{{sfn|Staunton|2005|p=259}} The battalion commander insisted that Derrick personally hoist the Australian flag over the town;{{sfn|Macklin|2008|pp=146–147}} it was raised at 10:00 on 25 November 1943.{{sfn|Staunton|2005|p=259}}

The final assault on Sattelberg became known within the 2/48th Battalion as 'Derrick's Show'.{{sfn|Stanley|1997|p=33}} Although he was already a celebrity within the 9th Division, the action brought him to wide public attention.&lt;ref name=&quot;Burness&quot; /&gt; On 23 March 1944, the announcement and accompanying citation for Derrick's Victoria Cross appeared in a supplement to the ''London Gazette''.

{{quote |
''Government House, Canberra. 23rd&amp;nbsp;March 1944.''

The KING has been graciously pleased to approve the award of the VICTORIA CROSS to:-

Sergeant Thomas Currie Derrick, D.C.M., Australian Military Forces.

For most conspicuous courage, outstanding leadership and devotion to duty during the final assault on Sattelberg in November, 1943.

On 24th&amp;nbsp;November, 1943, a company of an Australian Infantry Battalion was ordered to outflank a strong enemy position sited on a precipitous cliff-face and then to attack a feature 150 yards from the township of Sattelberg. Sergeant Derrick was in command of his platoon of the company. Due to the nature of the country, the only possible approach to the town lay through an open kunai patch situated directly beneath the top of the cliffs. Over a period of two hours many attempts were made by our troops to clamber up the slopes to their objective, but on each occasion the enemy prevented success with intense machine-gun fire and grenades.

Shortly before last light it appeared that it would be impossible to reach the objective or even to hold the ground already occupied and the company was ordered to retire. On receipt of this order, Sergeant Derrick, displaying dogged tenacity, requested one last attempt to reach the objective. His request was granted.

Moving ahead of his forward section he personally destroyed, with grenades, an enemy post which had been holding up this section. He then ordered his second section around on the right flank. This section came under heavy fire from light machine-guns and grenades from, six enemy posts. Without regard for personal safety he clambered forward well ahead of the leading men of the section and hurled grenade after grenade, so completely demoralising the enemy that they fled leaving weapons and grenades. By this action alone the company was able to gain its first foothold on the precipitous ground.

Not content with the work already done, he returned to the first section, and together with the third section of his platoon advanced to deal with the three remaining posts in the area. On four separate occasions he dashed forward and threw grenades at a range of six to eight yards until these positions were finally silenced.

In all, Sergeant Derrick had reduced ten enemy posts. From the vital ground he had captured the remainder of the Battalion moved on to capture Sattelberg the following morning.

Undoubtedly Sergeant Derrick's fine leadership and refusal to admit defeat, in the face of a seemingly impossible situation, resulted in the capture of Sattelberg. His outstanding gallantry, thoroughness and devotion to duty were an inspiration not only to his platoon and company but to the whole Battalion.

[[Officer (armed forces)|Commissioned]] as a [[first lieutenant|lieutenant]] on 26 November 1944, Derrick was granted twenty-four days leave.{{sfn|Staunton|2005|p=259}}&lt;ref name=&quot;ServRec&quot; /&gt; Returning to the 2/48th Battalion as a reinforcement officer, his appointment as a [[platoon]] commander in his old company was met by &quot;great jubilation&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Burness&quot; /&gt; During this period, the battalion had been posted to [[Ravenshoe, Queensland|Ravenshoe]] on the [[Atherton Tablelands]] for &quot;an extensive training period&quot;, before being transported from Cairns to [[Morotai]] during April 1945.&lt;ref name=&quot;2/48&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ServRec&quot; /&gt; It was around this time that Derrick converted from his [[Church of England]] religious denomination and [[Salvation Army|Salvationist]] beliefs to [[Catholicism]]—his wife's religion—though he was not overtly religious.{{sfn|Stanley|1997|p=148}}{{sfn|Horner|2002|p=69}}

On 1 May 1945, Derrick took part in the [[Battle of Tarakan (1945)|landing at Tarakan]]; an island off the coast of [[Borneo]].{{sfn|Stanley|1997|p=71}} Under the cover of a naval and aerial bombardment,{{sfn|Macklin|2008|pp=148–149}} he led his men ashore in the initial waves of the landing, where they were initially posted at the boundary of the 2/48th Battalion and 2/24th Battalion's area of responsibility.{{sfn|Stanley|1997|p=71}} The Japanese force on the island mounted a determined resistance, and Derrick was later quoted in the [[Herald Sun|''Sunday Sun'']] as saying he had &quot;never struck anything so tough as the Japanese on Tarakan&quot;.{{sfn|Stanley|1997|p=137}}

[[File:Derrick grave (AWM 108261).jpg|thumb|alt=A group of men in military uniform gathered around a grave.|225px|Men of the 2/48th Battalion gathered around Derrick's grave during his funeral.]]

Slowly pushing inland,{{sfn|Macklin|2008|pp=148–149}} the 2/48th Battalion's main task from 19 May was to capture a heavily defended hill code-named ''Freda''.{{sfn|Stanley|1997|p=141}} Derrick's platoon unsuccessfully probed Japanese positions on that day and the next, at a loss of two men killed with others wounded. He later recorded in his diary that these setbacks were a &quot;bad show&quot;.{{sfn|Stanley|1997|p=142}} On 21 May, Derrick and Lieutenant Colonel Bob Ainslie, the 2/48th Battalion's commander, debated the optimum size of the unit which should be used to capture the ''Freda'' position. Derrick successfully argued that a [[Company (military unit)|company]] was best, given the restrictions posed by the terrain. He was in high spirits that night, possibly in an attempt to lift his platoon's morale.{{sfn|Stanley|1997|p=143}} On 22 May, Derrick's was one of two platoons that attacked a well-defended knoll and captured the position. Derrick played a key role in this action, and coordinated both platoons during the final assault that afternoon.{{sfn|Stanley|1997|pp=143–144}}

After capturing the knoll, the two platoons—reinforced by two sections of the [[2/4th Cavalry Commando Squadron (Australia)|2/4th Commando Squadron]]—dug in to await an expected Japanese counter-attack. At about 03:30 on 23 May, a Japanese light machine gun fired into the Australian position.{{sfn|Stanley|1997|p=144}}  Derrick sat upright to see if his men were all right, and was hit by five bullets from the gun's second burst; striking him from his left hip to the right of his chest.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot; /&gt; His runner, &quot;Curly&quot; Colby, dragged him behind cover, but Derrick could not be immediately evacuated as Japanese troops attacked at about 04:00. Derrick was in great pain, and told Colby that he had &quot;had it&quot;.{{sfn|Stanley|1997|pp=144–145}} Despite his wounds, he continued to issue orders for several hours. When day broke, it was discovered that Derrick's platoon were directly overlooked by a Japanese bunker—though this would not have been visible during the assault late the previous evening.{{sfn|Long|1963|p=438}}

When stretcher bearers reached the position at dawn, Derrick insisted that the other wounded be attended to first. Derrick was carried off ''Freda'' later that morning, where he was met by the 26th Brigade's commander, Brigadier [[David Whitehead]].{{sfn|Stanley|1997|p=145}} The two men briefly conversed before Derrick excused himself, fearing that he had not much time left and wishing to see the padre. Stepping back, Whitehead saluted and sent for Father Arch Bryson.{{sfn|Macklin|2008|pp=148–149}} At the hospital, surgeons found that bullets had torn away much of Derrick's liver; he died on 24 May 1945 during a second operation on his wounds.{{sfn|Stanley|1997|p=147}} He was buried in the 2/48th Battalion's cemetery on Tarakan that afternoon,{{sfn|Stanley|1997|p=147}} and later re-interred at the [[Labuan War Cemetery]], plot 24, row A, grave 9.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cwgc.org/search/casualty_details.aspx?casualty=2677104 |title=Derrick, Thomas Currie |accessdate=28 July 2008 |publisher=[[Commonwealth War Graves Commission]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tom Derrick was widely mourned. His widow, Beryl, became prostrate with grief on hearing of his death; many members of the Army were affected,{{sfn|Stanley|1997|p=147}} with one soldier lamenting it felt as if &quot;the whole war stopped&quot;.{{sfn|Reid|2000|pp=28–29}} By the time Derrick's death was officially announced on 30 May, most Australians on Tarakan had heard the news and rumours had spread claiming that he had been speared or shot at short range by a sub-machine gun.{{sfn|Stanley|1997|p=147}}

The Japanese force on Tarakan learned of Derrick's death and tried to exploit it for [[propaganda]] purposes. They printed a leaflet which began &quot;We lament over the death of Lieutenant General Terick CinC of Allied Force in Tarakan&quot; and later included the question &quot;what do you think of the death in action of your Commander in Chief&amp;nbsp;...?&quot;{{sfn|Stanley|1997|p=147}} This leaflet reached few Australian soldiers, and had little impact on them. &quot;[[Tokyo Rose]]&quot; also broadcast taunts over &quot;Terick's&quot; death.{{sfn|Stanley|1997|p=148}}

Derrick's reputation continued to grow after his death, and many Australian soldiers recalled any association, however slight, they had with him.{{sfn|Stanley|1997|p=147}} To many Australians, he embodied the '[[ANZAC spirit]]',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Vonthoff |first=Tony |year=2005 |title=Military Heroism: An Australian Perspective |journal=Australian Defence Force Journal |publisher=Australian Defence College |location=Canberra |issue=169 |pages=p. 33 |url=http://www.defence.gov.au/publications/dfj/adfj169.pdf#page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he remains perhaps the best-known Australian soldier of the Second World War.&lt;ref name=&quot;Burness&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Burness |first=Peter |year=2005 |title=&amp;nbsp;'Diver' Derrick |journal=Wartime |publisher=Australian War Memorial |location=Canberra |issue=31 |pages=p. 16 |issn=13282727}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Michael McKernan later remarked that, for his war service, Derrick had arguably deserved &quot;a VC and two bars&amp;nbsp;... at El Alamein, at Sattelberg and now at Tarakan&quot;.{{sfn|Macklin|2008|pp=148–149}} In a 2004 television interview, then [[Chief of the Defence Force (Australia)|Chief of the Australian Defence Force]], General [[Peter Cosgrove]], was asked &quot;Who was the best soldier of all time?&quot; After a short pause, he replied: &quot;Diver Derrick&quot;. This sentiment was endorsed by General [[Frank Hassett|Sir Francis Hassett]]. Hassett—who, as a lieutenant colonel, had served at Finschhafen with [[II Corps (Australia)|II Corps]] headquarters—stated:{{sfn|Essex-Clark|2005|p=147}}

Derrick is also remembered for his personal qualities. He was sensitive and reflective. Despite a limited education, he was a &quot;forceful and logical debater, with a thirst for knowledge&quot;.{{sfn|Stanley|1997|p=148}} Derrick kept a diary, composed poetry, collected butterflies and frequently wrote to his wife, while on active service .{{sfn|Horner|2002|p=69}} Historian [[Peter Stanley]] has compared Derrick's leadership abilities with those of [[Edward Dunlop|Edward 'Weary' Dunlop]], [[Ralph Honner]] and [[Roden Cutler]].{{sfn|Stanley|1997|p=148}}

On 7 May 1947, Beryl Derrick attended an investiture ceremony at the [[Government House, Adelaide]], where she was presented with her late husband's Victoria Cross and Distinguished Conduct Medal by the [[Governors of South Australia|Governor of South Australia]], Lieutenant General [[Charles Norrie, 1st Baron Norrie|Sir Charles Norrie]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DCM&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;VC_Recommendation&quot; /&gt; Derrick's Victoria Cross and other medals are now displayed at the [[Australian War Memorial]], [[Canberra]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.awm.gov.au/virtualtour/valour.asp |title=List of Victoria Crosses at the Memorial |accessdate=27 July 2008 |work=Hall of Valour |publisher=Australian War Memorial}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with a portrait by [[Ivor Hele|Sir Ivor Hele]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot; /&gt; A street in the neighbouring suburb of [[Campbell, Australian Capital Territory|Campbell]] and a rest stop in the [[Remembrance Driveway (Australia)|Remembrance Driveway]] between Sydney and Canberra were also named in his honour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.actpla.act.gov.au/tools_resources/maps_land_survey/place_names/place_search |title=Street search for: &quot;Derrick Street&quot; |publisher=ACT Planning &amp; Land Authority |accessdate=14 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.remembrancedriveway.org.au/driveway-map/default.asp?SECTION=SydneyCanberra |title=Driveway Map |publisher=Remembrance Driveway Committee Inc |accessdate=17 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, a public park was named the Derrick Memorial Reserve on Carlisle St, [[Glanville, South Australia|Glanville]] in his honour, and his VC citation is displayed on a plaque there.{{sfn|Cooper-Smart|Courtney|2003|pp=299–303}} In June 2008, a newly built bridge over the [[Port River]] on the [[Port River Expressway]] was named the [[Tom 'Diver' Derrick Bridge]] following a public campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Name backdown for new Port bridge |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/06/05/2265672.htm |publisher=ABC News |date=5 June 2008 |accessdate=25 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
