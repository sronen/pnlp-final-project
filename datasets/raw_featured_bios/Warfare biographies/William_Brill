'''William Lloyd (Bill) Brill''' [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]], [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|DFC]] &amp; [[Medal bar|Bar]] (17 May 1916 – 12&amp;nbsp;October 1964) was a senior officer and bomber pilot in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF). Born in the [[Riverina]] district of New South Wales, he was a farmer and a member of the [[Australian Army Reserve|Australian Militia]] before joining the RAAF as an air cadet in 1940. [[British Commonwealth Air Training Plan|Training in Australia and Canada]], he was posted to Britain in 1941 to take part in the [[RAF Bomber Command#Strategic Bombing 1943-45|air war over Europe]]. Brill first saw combat as a member of [[No.&amp;nbsp;460 Squadron RAAF]], flying [[Vickers Wellington]] medium bombers. He was awarded the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] (DFC) in May 1942 for attacking a target after his plane had been badly damaged by anti-aircraft fire. Following assignment as an [[Flight instructor|instructor]] with the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF), he returned to the bombing campaign in January 1944 as a [[Flight (military unit)|flight commander]] with [[No.&amp;nbsp;463 Squadron RAAF]], operating [[Avro Lancaster]] heavy bombers.

Brill's leadership and determination to complete his missions despite damage to his aircraft—on one occasion inflicted by another Lancaster's bombs from above—earned him the [[Distinguished Service Order]]. Promoted to [[Wing Commander (rank)|wing commander]] in May 1944, he took over [[No.&amp;nbsp;467 Squadron RAAF]] after the death in combat of its then-commander, Group Captain [[John Balmer]]. Brill was awarded a [[Medal bar|Bar]] to his DFC in July, for his skill in evading three German [[night fighter]]s. Returning to Australia, he remained in the Air Force after the war and led [[No. 10 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;10 Squadron]] in 1949–50. He went on to command air bases at [[RAAF Base Rathmines|Rathmines]], [[Fairbairn, Canberra|Canberra]] and [[RAAF Base Townsville|Townsville]] during the 1950s and 60s. Brill served two terms as RAAF Director of Personnel Services, in 1956–59 and 1960–63, by which time he had been promoted to [[group captain]]. His final posting was at the Department of Air in Canberra, where he died of a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] in October 1964.

==Early life==
Brill was born on 17 May 1916 in the [[Riverina]] town of [[Ganmain]], New South Wales. He was the fourth of seven children of farmer Edward Brill and his wife Bertha, who were originally from [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. The Brills owned a property called &quot;Clearview&quot;, and Bill attended the local school. He completed his education at [[Yanco Agricultural High School|Yanco Agricultural High]], gaining his [[Intermediate Certificate]] before joining his brothers in wheat farming.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;&gt;[http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A130292b.htm Brill, William Lloyd] at [[Australian Dictionary of Biography]].

He was promoted to [[corporal]] in May.&lt;ref&gt;[http://recordsearch.naa.gov.au/scripts/Imagine.asp?B=9266397 Brill, William Lloyd – Australian Military Forces enlistment form] at [[National Archives of Australia]].

===First tour of operations===

Raised under the [[Article XV squadrons|Article XV]] provisions of EATS, No.&amp;nbsp;460 Squadron was one of a number of nominally Australian formations taking part in [[RAF Bomber Command]]'s strategic air campaign against Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Herington, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/28/chapters/24.pdf ''Air War Against Germany and Italy'', p. 649]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;460Sqn&quot;&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Bomber Units'', pp. 118–123&lt;/ref&gt;  In January 1942, the unit moved from Molesworth to [[RAF Breighton]], Yorkshire.&lt;ref name=&quot;AWM460&quot;/&gt; Brill flew as a co-pilot in No.&amp;nbsp;460 Squadron's first operation, against the German port of [[Emden]] in March.&lt;ref name=&quot;460Sqn&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Nelson 20-24&quot;&gt;Nelson, ''From Wagga to Waddington'', pp. 20–24&lt;/ref&gt; He was soon in command of his own Wellington, attacking targets in northern France. On 5&amp;nbsp;April 1942, he undertook his first sortie against a well-defended city deep in enemy territory, [[Cologne]]. He later recorded his apprehension before the raid:&lt;ref name=&quot;Nelson 20-24&quot;/&gt;{{blockquote|How can I get back from this when others who are better than I’ll ever be, have fallen on such targets? Will I funk if I’m in a tight spot? Will I let the rest of the boys down? Who am I to hold the lives of five other men in my hands?}}

On the night of 29/30 May, Brill's was one of 27 aircraft detailed to bomb the [[Gnome et Rhône]], [[Thomson-Houston Electric Company|Thomson Houston]], and [[Goodrich Corporation|Goodrich]] factories in the Paris suburb of [[Gennevilliers]]. The crews were required to have good visibility of the target area before bombing, to ensure accuracy and reduce collateral damage. Due to foul weather over the [[English Channel|Channel]], Brill flew at an altitude of less than {{convert|200|ft|m|disp=5}} until crossing the French coast. The clouds had begun to clear over Paris and searchlights swept the sky, accompanied by heavy anti-aircraft fire. Most of the bombers released their loads from between {{convert|4000|and|8000|ft|m}}. Brill, however, dropped to {{convert|1500|ft|m}} before making his attack. With the bomb bay doors open, his Wellington was struck by flak, damaging the hydraulics and rear gun turret, and leaving one of the {{convert|1000|lb|kg|abbr=on}} bombs hanging after the others dropped on target. Returning to England through more bad weather, he spotted an emergency landing ground and brought the crippled Wellington down with the bomb doors still open and one tyre flat; the plane was later scrapped. Brill's was the only one of four Wellingtons from No.&amp;nbsp;460 Squadron to find the target area and successfully attack.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nelson p.26-27&quot;&gt;Nelson, ''From Wagga to Waddington'', pp. 26–27&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Herington, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/28/chapters/12.pdf ''Air War Against Germany and Italy'', pp. 309–310]&lt;/ref&gt;  For his &quot;courage and determination&quot; in pressing home the assault, he was awarded the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] on 26&amp;nbsp;June,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/AWM192/00306/003060195.pdf Recommendation: Distinguished Flying Cross] at Australian War Memorial.

The press would come to refer to the pair as the &quot;Flying Twins&quot;, as their wartime careers so closely paralleled one another—both men came from the Riverina district, joined the Air Force together on [[Remembrance Day]] 1940, arrived in England in August 1941, flew Wellingtons in No.&amp;nbsp;460 Squadron, volunteered for second tours in Bomber Command, and received many decorations and promotions in tandem.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nelson pp.27-30&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article47698768 |title=DSO For Second &quot;Flying Twin&quot; |newspaper=[[Army (newspaper)|Army News]] |location=Darwin, Northern Territory |date=7 August 1944 |accessdate=20 March 2011 |page=3 |publisher=[[National Library of Australia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Doubleday would survive the war and later become active in civil aviation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nelson pp.52-53&quot;&gt;Nelson, ''From Wagga to Waddington'', pp. 52–53&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second tour of operations===
[[File:463 Squadron RAAF Lancaster taking off August 1944.jpg|thumb|left|260px|No. 463 Squadron Lancaster at RAF Waddington|alt=Four-engined, twin-finned military aircraft taking off]]
Having volunteered for his second tour, Brill underwent conversion to [[Handley Page Halifax]] and [[Avro Lancaster]] heavy bombers in the last months of 1943.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nelson pp.27-30&quot;/&gt; In the new year, he was appointed a flight commander in [[No.&amp;nbsp;463 Squadron RAAF]], operating Lancasters out of [[RAF Waddington]], Lincolnshire. Waddington was also home to another Australian squadron, [[No. 467 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;467]], and Brill took an active part in the station's raucous mess life.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, ''From Wagga to Waddington'', pp. 31–32&lt;/ref&gt; His younger brother Vic, who had joined the RAAF in 1941, was in the same squadron.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nelson pp.52-53&quot;/&gt; Brill returned to combat in the middle of the [[Battle of Berlin (air)|Battle of Berlin]], flying his first sortie to the &quot;Big City&quot; on 20&amp;nbsp;January 1944.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nelson pp.33-36&quot;&gt;Nelson, ''From Wagga to Waddington'', pp. 33–36&lt;/ref&gt; The statistical likelihood of surviving an operational tour of 30 missions in Bomber Command was never more than 50%, however, during the Battle of Berlin, loss rates were far higher.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 95–96&lt;/ref&gt;

Brill took off for his second mission to Berlin on 27&amp;nbsp;January. The Lancaster he flew was said to be jinxed, possessed of an engine that lost power in the air but always tested well on the ground, and suffering oxygen failure that killed its rear gunner the previous sortie. One of the engines did begin to falter before Brill reached Berlin, forcing him to fly lower than normal. Having released his bombs over target, he felt the plane take several strikes that he assumed were anti-aircraft fire, but were in fact the [[Incendiary device|incendiaries]] of a Lancaster flying above. The nose, rudder controls, and electricals were all severely damaged, and the [[Port and starboard|port]] wing was on fire. Having warned his crew to prepare to bail out, Brill dived the Lancaster and succeeded in putting out the flames. The crew was able to remain on board and, after a nine-hour flight, the plane landed back at Waddington. It was, according to Brill, &quot;not my idea of an evening's entertainment&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nelson pp.33-36&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Herington, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/28/chapters/24.pdf ''Air War Against Germany and Italy'', p. 645]&lt;/ref&gt; He flew a total of eleven operations during the Battle of Berlin, including Bomber Command's costliest raid of the war, against [[Nuremberg]] in March. On that occasion, one of his engines failed and another was damaged when he had to fly through a cloud of debris from a Lancaster that was blown to pieces directly in his path.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nelson pp.33-36&quot;/&gt;

By April 1944, No.&amp;nbsp;463 Squadron had begun to concentrate on targets in France and Belgium as the Allied air campaign shifted focus from strategic bombing to destroying airfields and disrupting lines of communication prior to the [[Operation Overlord|invasion of the continent]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Nelson pp.37-38&quot;&gt;Nelson, ''From Wagga to Waddington'', pp. 37–38&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;463Sqn&quot;&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Bomber Units'', pp. 130–133&lt;/ref&gt; On 8&amp;nbsp;May, Brill was the bombing controller for a raid on an airfield near [[Brest, France|Brest]]. The controller was required to arrive ahead of the main Allied force, check that flares marking the target were in place, and warn his fellows if they were bombing inaccurately. By the time Brill had completed this task and gone in himself to attack, the ground defences were fully alert and peppered his Lancaster with 140 bullet holes, but he refused to take evasive action until he had delivered his bombload.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nelson pp.37-38&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Herington, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/29/chapters/02.pdf ''Air Power Over Europe'', pp. 13–21]&lt;/ref&gt; Promoted to acting [[Wing Commander (rank)|wing commander]], Brill assumed control of No.&amp;nbsp;467 Squadron on 12&amp;nbsp;May, following the death in combat of its previous commanding officer, Group Captain [[John Balmer]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AWM&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;467Sqn&quot;&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Bomber Units'', pp. 144–147&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Australia in the War of 1939–1945|official history of the RAAF in World War&amp;nbsp;II]], Brill &quot;proved a very worthy successor to Balmer both in administration and in the dashing type of leadership which had brought the Waddington squadrons to the fore in [[No. 5 Group RAF|No.&amp;nbsp;5 Group]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Herington, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/29/chapters/02.pdf ''Air Power Over Europe'', p. 38]&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Order]] on 19&amp;nbsp;May for &quot;leadership, skill and gallantry of the highest order&quot; and &quot;his determination to make every sortie a success&quot; in spite of frequent damage to his aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/AWM192/00306/003060193.pdf Recommendation: Distinguished Service Order] at Australian War Memorial.

On the night of 4/5&amp;nbsp;July, Nos.&amp;nbsp;463 and 467 Squadrons bombed supply depots for [[V-weapons]] near [[Saint-Leu-d'Esserent]]. Brill's Lancaster was attacked by three German [[night fighter]]s, but he was able to evade them with only a few bullets striking his plane.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Herington, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/29/chapters/08.pdf ''Air Power Over Europe'', pp. 180–181]&lt;/ref&gt; His &quot;fine leadership and courage&quot; during the action earned him a [[Medal bar|Bar]] to his DFC; the award was promulgated in the ''[[London Gazette]]'' on 16&amp;nbsp;January 1945.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/AWM192/00306/003060194.pdf Recommendation: Bar to Distinguished Flying Cross] at Australian War Memorial.

By now he had earned a reputation for being quite &quot;mad&quot;, as he would often circle back and check over his handiwork after a bombing run, rather than making his escape from the target area as quickly as possible.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, ''From Wagga to Waddington'', pp. 38–42&lt;/ref&gt; During non-operational periods, he made a habit of taking a Lancaster on a so-called test flight to the southern border of Northern Ireland, where he and his crew would change into civilian clothes, cross into Ireland and stock up on food and liquor for a party back at Waddington; he always made a point of inviting the Air Officer Commanding [[RAAF Overseas Headquarters]], Air Vice Marshal [[Henry Wrigley]], to such events, which Wrigley attended without fail.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, ''Skylarks'', p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; Brill handed over command of No.&amp;nbsp;467 Squadron on 12&amp;nbsp;October 1944, becoming the first man to survive his time as its leader.&lt;ref name=&quot;467Sqn&quot;/&gt; He had flown a total of 58 missions in Bomber Command when he returned to Australia in the new year. On 29&amp;nbsp;January 1945 he married Ilma Kitto, a teacher, at Ganmain's Methodist Church. The couple had been engaged since before the war; they later had two sons and a daughter.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, ''From Wagga to Waddington'', pp. 4, 16&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-war career==
[[File:043069Lincoln1946.jpg|thumb|left|260px|Australian-built Avro Lincoln, c. November 1946|alt=Four-engined military aircraft with twin tail fins in flight]]
Brill remained in the Air Force following the end of hostilities.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; From February 1946 to August 1947 he served as the first and only commander of the RAAF's newly formed and soon-disbanded Heavy Bomber Crew Conversion Unit at [[RAAF Base East Sale|RAAF Station East Sale]], Victoria. Little support or direction on its use as a training facility was forthcoming from higher command, and in the summer months its [[Avro Lincoln]] bombers were employed in bushfire patrols over [[East Gippsland]], reporting 44 outbreaks in February 1947 alone.&lt;ref&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Training Units'', pp. 152–153&lt;/ref&gt; Brill transferred from the CAF to the Permanent Air Force in 1948,&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; and reverted to the rank of squadron leader. In March 1949 he became the inaugural commander of a re-formed [[No. 10 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;10 (General Reconnaissance) Squadron]], which had been disbanded in 1945 after service throughout World War&amp;nbsp;II. In its new guise the squadron was established from the staff and facilities of RAAF Station Garbutt in [[Townsville, Queensland|Townsville]]. Brill's main tasks were organising to absorb or close surplus wartime facilities in North Queensland, and preparing No.&amp;nbsp;10 Squadron for [[search-and-rescue]] operations. The unit took delivery of its first four Lincoln [[Mark (designation)|Mk]] 30s in September 1949, and Brill handed over command the following January.&lt;ref&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Maritime Units'', pp. 8–16&lt;/ref&gt;
