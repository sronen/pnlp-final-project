Oberst '''Helmut Lent''' (13 June 1918&amp;nbsp;– 7 October 1944) was a German [[night-fighter]] ace in [[World War&amp;nbsp;II]]. Lent shot down 110 [[aircraft]], 103 of them at night, far more than the minimum of five enemy aircraft required for the title of &quot;ace&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Spick 1996, pp. 3–4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=&quot;Notes&quot;&gt;For a list of Luftwaffe night fighter aces see ''[[List of German World War&amp;nbsp;II night fighter aces]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Born into a devoutly religious family, he showed an early passion for [[Glider aircraft|glider]] flying; against his father's wishes, he joined the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' in 1936. After completing his training, he was assigned to the 1.&amp;nbsp;Squadron, or ''Staffel'', of [[Zerstörergeschwader 76]] (ZG 76), a wing flying the [[Messerschmitt Bf 110]] twin-engine [[heavy fighter]]. Lent claimed his first aerial victories at the outset of World War&amp;nbsp;II in the [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|invasion of Poland]] and over the North Sea. During the [[Norwegian Campaign|invasion of Norway]] he flew ground support missions before he was transferred to the newly established [[Nachtjagdgeschwader 1]] (NJG&amp;nbsp;1), a night-fighter wing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fraschka pp185–189&quot;&gt;Fraschka 1994, pp. 185–189.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Williamson pp31–41&quot;&gt;Williamson 2006, pp. 31–41.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=&quot;Notes&quot;&gt;See [[Organization of the Luftwaffe during World War&amp;nbsp;II]] for an explanation of the Luftwaffe structure.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lent claimed his first nocturnal victory on 12 May 1941 and on 30 August 1941 was awarded the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross]] (''Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes'') for 22 victories. His steady accumulation of aerial victories resulted in regular promotions and awards. On the night of 15 June 1944, ''[[Major (Germany)|Major]]'' Lent was the first night fighter pilot to claim 100 nocturnal aerial victories, a feat which earned him the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross#Knight's Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords, and Diamonds (mit Eichenlaub, Schwertern und Brillanten)|Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords and Diamonds]] (''Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes mit Eichenlaub, Schwertern und Brillanten'') on 31 July 1944.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fraschka pp185–189&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Williamson pp31–41&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schaulen 2004, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 October 1944, Lent flew a [[Junkers Ju&amp;nbsp;88]] on a routine transit flight from [[Stade]] to [[Borchen|Nordborchen]], {{convert|5|km|mi|0}} south of [[Paderborn]]. On the landing approach one of the engines cut out and the plane collided with power lines. All four members of the crew were mortally injured. Three men died shortly after the crash and Lent succumbed to his injuries two days later on 7 October 1944.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fraschka pp185–189&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Williamson pp31–41&quot;/&gt;

==Childhood, education and early career==
Helmut Lent was born on 13 June 1918 in Pyrehne, district of [[Landsberg an der Warthe]], [[Province of Brandenburg]], Germany (now [[Pyrzany]], [[Lubusz Province]], western [[Poland]]), and christened Helmut Johannes Siegfried Lent. He was the fifth child of Johannes Lent, a [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] minister and Marie Elisabeth, née Braune. Helmut Lent had two older brothers, Werner and Joachim, and two older sisters, Käthe and Ursula.&lt;ref&gt;Hinchliffe 2003, pp. 2–4.&lt;/ref&gt; His family was deeply religious; in addition to his father, both of his brothers and both grandfathers were also Lutheran ministers.&lt;ref&gt;Hinchliffe 2003, p. xvi.&lt;/ref&gt;

From Easter 1924 until Easter 1928, Lent attended the local [[Volksschule|public primary school]] at Pyrehne. His father and oldest brother Werner then tutored him at home in preparation for the entrance examination at the [[Gymnasium (school)|public secondary school]] at Landsberg.{{#tag:ref|After 1933 the school was renamed ''Hermann Göring Hochschule''&lt;ref&gt;Hinchliffe 2003, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=&quot;Notes&quot;}} In February 1933, Helmut joined the ''[[Jungvolk]]'', the junior branch of the [[Hitler Jugend|Hitler Youth]]. From March 1933, he acted as a youth platoon leader, or ''Jungzugführer'' (1 March 1933&amp;nbsp;– 1 April 1935) and flag-bearer, or ''Fähnleinführer'' (1 April 1935&amp;nbsp;– 9 November 1935) until he left the ''Jungvolk'' to prepare for his ''[[Abitur|diploma]]'' examination.&lt;ref&gt;Hinchliffe 2003, pp. 8–11.&lt;/ref&gt; Helmut passed his graduation examinations at the age of seventeen on 12 December 1935. On 2 February 1936, he began the eight-week compulsory [[Reichsarbeitsdienst|National Labor Service (Reichsarbeitsdienst)]] at [[Mohrin]].&lt;ref&gt;Hinchliffe 2003, pp.5–12.&lt;/ref&gt; He joined the military service in the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' as a ''[[Fahnenjunker]]'' on 1 April 1936, against the wishes of his father.&lt;ref&gt;Fraschka 1994, p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt;

His military training began on 6 April 1936 at the Air Warfare School (''Luftkriegsschule'') at [[Gatow]], on the south-western outskirts of Berlin. He swore the [[Hitler oath|National Socialist oath of allegiance]] on 21 April 1936.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hinchliffe p13&quot;&gt;Hinchliffe 2003, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Flight training began on Monday, 7 August 1936 at Gatow. His first flight was in a [[Heinkel He 72]] ''Kadet'' D-EYZA single engine biplane. Lent logged his first solo flight on 15 September 1936 in a [[Focke-Wulf Fw 44]] ''Stieglitz''. By this time, Lent had accumulated 63 flights in his logbook.&lt;ref&gt;Hinchliffe 2003, pp. 17–18.&lt;/ref&gt; In conjunction with flight training, the students also learned to drive motorcycles and cars, and during one of these training exercises, Lent was involved in a road accident, breaking his upper leg badly enough to prevent him from flying for five months.&lt;ref&gt;Hinchliffe 2003, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; This did not adversely affect his classroom training and on 1 April 1937, after taking his commission examination, he was promoted to ''[[Fähnrich]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Hinchliffe 2003, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 October 1937 Lent completed his flight training and was awarded the A/B License. He earned his wings on 15 November 1937. On 1 February 1938, he was promoted to ''[[Oberfähnrich]]'' (first ensign), and on 1 March 1938 to ''[[Leutnant]]''. By this time, he had made 434 flights in eight different types of aircraft and had accumulated 112 hours and 48 minutes flying time, mostly in daylight flights, in single engine training aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;Hinchliffe 2003, pp. 24–25.&lt;/ref&gt;

After leaving Gatow, Helmut Lent was posted to the Heavy Bomber Crew School, or ''Große Kampffliegerschule'' at [[Tutow]], in northeast Germany. He spent three months training as an observer (1 March 1938&amp;nbsp;– 30 May 1938). Prior to completing this course, Lent was run over by a car, resulting in a broken lower jaw, concussion, and internal bleeding. On 1 July 1938, Lent was posted to the 3rd Group of [[Jagdgeschwader 132]] &quot;Richthofen&quot; (III./JG 132), flying on 19 July 1938 for the first time after his injuries.&lt;ref&gt;Hinchliffe 2003, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of September, Lent's squadron, 7./JG 132, relocated to [[Großenhain]] near Dresden, in preparation and support of the [[Occupation of Czechoslovakia by Nazi Germany|annexation of Czechoslovakia]]. Lent flew a number of operational patrols in this conflict until his ''Staffel'' relocated again to [[Rangsdorf]] on 29 September 1938. After the tension over the occupation of the [[Sudetenland|Sudeten]] territories eased, Lent's unit began a conversion to the [[Messerschmitt Bf 108]] ''Taifun''. On 1 November 1938 III./JG 132 moved to [[Fürstenwalde]], between Berlin and [[Frankfurt/Oder|Frankfurt an der Oder]], and was renamed II./JG 141, and Lent was posted to the 6th Squadron.&lt;ref&gt;Hinchliffe 2003, pp. 30–31.&lt;/ref&gt;

II./JG 141 changed its designation to I./[[Zerstörergeschwader 76]] (I./ZG 76) on 1 May 1939 at the same time relocating to an airfield at [[Olmütz]], Czechoslovakia. The group was being re-equipped with the [[Messerschmitt Bf 110]], and Lent made his first flight in the Bf 110 on 7 June 1939. Lent was granted his Luftwaffe Advanced Pilot's Certificate (''Erweiterter Luftwaffen-Flugzeugführerschein''), also known as 'C'-Certificate, confirming proficiency on multi-engine aircraft, on 12 May 1939.&lt;ref&gt;Hinchliffe 2003, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; While converting to the Bf 110, Lent did not have a regular wireless operator (''Funker'') in the rear gunner's seat, but on 14 August 1939 he was accompanied in M8+AH for the first time by ''[[Gefreiter]]'' [[Walter Kubisch]].&lt;ref&gt;Hinchliffe 2003, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; During the prelude of [[World War&amp;nbsp;II]] on 25 August 1939 I./ZG 76 deployed to an airfield at [[Ohlau]] to the southeast of [[Breslau]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hinchliffe p34&quot;&gt;Hinchliffe 2003, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War II==
World War II began at 04:45 on Friday 1 September 1939 when German troops and armour crossed the Polish border. Helmut Lent, flying a Bf 110 marked M8-DH, took off from [[Ohlau]], at 04:44 to escort [[Heinkel He 111]] bombers on a mission over [[Krakow]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hinchliffe p34&quot;/&gt;

===Invasion of Poland===

The German plans for the [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|invasion of Poland]] were conceived under the codename [[Fall Weiss (1939)|''Fall Weiss'']] (Case White). This operation called for simultaneous attacks on Poland from three directions, the north, the west and the south, beginning at 04:45 on the early morning of 1 September 1939. On this morning Helmut Lent, with Kubisch as his wireless operator and [[rear gunner]], escorted a formation of Heinkel 111 bombers of I. and III./[[Kampfgeschwader 4]] (KG 4) attacking the airfields at Krakow in support of the southern prong of the German attack.&lt;ref&gt;Hinchliffe 2003, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; At 16:30 on 2 September 1939, the second day of the German attack, Lent took off in the direction of [[Lódz]] and claimed his first aerial-victory of the war, shooting down a [[PZL P.11]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Helden der Wehrmacht p112&quot;&gt;''Helden der Wehrmacht'' 2004, p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bekker 1994, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

At this point of the campaign the Bf 110s switched from bomber escort to ground-attack since the [[Polish Air Force]] was all but defeated. In this capacity Lent and Kubisch destroyed a twin-engined monoplane on the ground on 5 September and another aircraft, a [[PZL P.24]], on 9 September. On 12 September 1939 he was attacked by a Polish aircraft which shot out his starboard engine. Lent made a forced landing behind German lines.&lt;ref&gt;Hinchliffe 2003, pp. 40–41.&lt;/ref&gt; He flew five more missions during the Polish campaign, destroying one anti-aircraft battery. For his actions in the Polish campaign Lent was awarded one of the first [[Iron Cross]] 2nd class of World War&amp;nbsp;II on 21 September 1939. I./ZG 76 relocated to the [[Stuttgart]] area on 29 September 1939 to defend the western border against the French and British, who had been at war with Germany since 3 September 1939.&lt;ref&gt;Hinchliffe 2003, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; From early October to middle December I./ZG 76 operated from a number of airfields in the Stuttgart and Ruhr areas before relocating north to [[Jever]] on 16 December 1939.&lt;ref&gt;Hinchliffe 2003, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Battle of the Heligoland Bight===
During the first month of the war the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) mostly focused its bomber attacks against anti-shipping operations on the [[German Bight]]. RAF bombers mounted a heavy attack against shipping off [[Wilhelmshaven]] on 18 December 1939 in what became to be known as the [[Battle of the Heligoland Bight (1939)|Battle of the Heligoland Bight]].&lt;ref&gt;Hinchliffe 2003, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; Twenty-four twin-engine [[Vickers Wellington]] from [[No. 9 Squadron RAF|No. 9 Squadron]], [[No. 37 Squadron RAF|No. 37 Squadron]] and [[No. 149 Squadron RAF|No. 149 Squadron]] formed up over [[Norfolk]] heading for the island of [[Heligoland]]. Two aircraft aborted the mission due to mechanical defects, but the remaining 22 pursued the attack and were spotted by a [[Freya radar]] on the [[East Frisian Islands]].&lt;ref&gt;Hinchliffe 2003, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

Helmut Lent was ordered to intercept and engage the attacking bomber force and after refuelling—Lent had just landed at [[Jever]] from an armed patrol—claimed three Wellingtons, two of which, shot down at 14:30 and 14:45, were later confirmed.&lt;ref&gt;Hinchliffe 2003, pp. 47–49.&lt;/ref&gt; The two aircraft were both from No. 37 Squadron, captained by Flying Officer P.A. Wimberley and Flying Officer O.J.T. Lewis respectively, and both crashed in the shallow sea off [[Borkum]]. It is likely that his third claim may have been No. 37 Squadron Wellington 1A N2396, LF-J, piloted by Sergeant H. Ruse, which crash-landed on the sand dunes of Borkum.&lt;ref&gt;Hinchliffe 2003, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; Lent was refused the victory over Wimberley, as the Wellington was attacked by Lent after it had already been badly damaged and was about to crash. The Wellington was credited to pilot [[Carl-August Schumacher]]
.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2010, pp. 78—81.&lt;/ref&gt;

His success as a fighter pilot over the North Sea had made him a minor national hero. Exploits such as those at Heligoland made good news stories for German propaganda machine. Consequently, he attracted fan mail—mainly from young girls and women—among them Elisabeth Petersen. Lent replied to her letter, and he and Elisabeth met on a [[wikt:blind date|blind date]] at the ''Reichshof'' hotel in [[Hamburg]], after which they enjoyed a skiing holiday in [[Hirschegg]] in February 1940.&lt;ref&gt;Hinchliffe 2003, pp. 54–55.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Norwegian Campaign and Battle of Britain===

The left wing and nose is buried in the ground. The aircraft is marked with the number 427.]]
On 8 April 1940 eight aircraft of 1./ZG 76, under the command of ''[[Staffelkapitän]]'' Werner Hansen, deployed northward from Jever to [[Westerland, Germany|Westerland]] on [[Sylt]] in preparation for operation ''Weserübung'', the [[Norwegian Campaign|invasion of Norway]].&lt;ref&gt;Hinchliffe 2003, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; The German plan for the attack called for an amphibious assault on the Norwegian capital, [[Oslo]], and six major ports from [[Kristiansand]] in the south to [[Narvik]] in the north.&lt;ref&gt;Hinchliffe 2003, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; Simultaneously, [[Junkers Ju 52|Junkers 52]] (Ju 52) transport aircraft would drop parachute troops to secure Oslo's [[Oslo Airport, Fornebu|Fornebu airport]]. Additional Ju 52s were scheduled to arrive at Fornebu twenty minutes after the parachute drop, by which time the airfield had to be in German hands. 1./ZG 76 provided air cover and ground-attack support for both waves. Eight Bf 110 ''Zerstörer'' of 1./JG 76 took off at 7:00 in the morning, planning to synchronize their arrival at Fornebu with the parachute drop at 8:45. The distance from Westerland to Fornebu meant that this was a one-way operation; the Bf 110s could not hold enough fuel for the return trip and would have to land at Fornebu once the airfield had been seized.&lt;ref&gt;Hinchliffe 2003, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-399-0006-19, Norwegen, abgeschossene Me 110.jpg|thumb|right|Lent's Bf110C ran out of fuel and was forced to land at Oslo/Fornebu airfield on 9 April 1940.&lt;ref&gt;Weal 1999, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; A troop-carrying Ju 52 flies over Lent's belly-landed Bf 110.&lt;ref&gt;Hinchliffe 2003, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;|alt=A black-and-white photo of a three-engine aircraft flying over trees. The aircraft is viewed from the front and below. Among the trees is a house with three people standing in front of it. A further aircraft is sitting on the ground and viewed from the rear-right.]]
On the early morning flight to Fornebu, Lent engaged and shot down a Norwegian [[Gloster Gladiator]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hinchliffe 2003, p. 61&quot;/&gt; While the Ju 52s transporting the German paratroops came under heavy fire, Lent's ''Rotte'' engaged the enemy ground positions. Lent's starboard engine caught fire, forcing him to land immediately. With Kubisch manning the movable machine gun, Lent negotiated the capitulation with the Norwegian ground forces and the airfield was in German hands.&lt;ref&gt;Hinchliffe 2003, pp. 62–63.&lt;/ref&gt;

At 18:50 the same day, Lent and his ''Staffelkapitän'' Werner Hansen took off again from Fornebu in undamaged Bf 110s. During the 40-minute flight, they came across a RAF [[Short Sunderland]] flying boat, serial number L2167, from [[No. 210 Squadron RAF]] which they shot down together; Hansen received credit for the &quot;kill&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Hinchliffe 2003, pp. 62–63, 295.&lt;/ref&gt; This incident is covered in great detail in the 2010 one hour documentary &quot;[[A Very Short War]]&quot; produced by Conti Bros Films and distributed by SBS Content Sales.

Helmut Lent was awarded the [[Iron Cross]] 1st Class on 13 May 1940 before he was transferred to [[Trondheim]] on 18 May.&lt;ref&gt;Hinchliffe 2003, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed his second aerial victory of the Norwegian campaign on 27 May over a RAF Gloster Gladiator from [[No. 263 Squadron RAF]], piloted by [[Flight Lieutenant]] [[Caesar Hull]]. On 2 June 1940 Lent and his wingman Thönes claimed a Gladiator each. The flight lasted 5&amp;nbsp;hours and 46&amp;nbsp;minutes and their opponents were again from No. 263&amp;nbsp;Squadron, aircraft serial number N5893 piloted by Pilot Officer J.L. Wilkie, and N5681 piloted by Pilot Officer L.R. Jacobsen. He claimed his seventh victory overall and final of the Norwegian theatre of operations on 15 June 1941 over a [[No. 254 Squadron RAF]] [[Bristol Blenheim]], piloted by Pilot Officer P.C. Gaylord. On 1 July 1940 Lent was promoted to ''[[Oberleutnant]]'' and on 13 July 1./ZG 76 was relocated to Stavanger/Forus.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hinchliffe 2003, p. 61&quot;/&gt;

Helmut Lent briefly participated in the [[Battle of Britain]] when on 15 August 1940 twenty-one Bf 110s from I./ZG 76 escorted He&amp;nbsp;111 bombers from [[Kampfgeschwader 26]] (KG 26) on their attack on [[Yorkshire]] and the [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]]/[[Sunderland, Tyne and Wear|Sunderland]] area. I./ZG 76 lost seven aircraft on this mission and it was Helmut Lent's 98th and final mission as a ''Zerstörer'' pilot.&lt;ref&gt;Hinchliffe 2003, pp. 73–74.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Night fighter career===
By June 1940 [[RAF Bomber Command]] penetrations of German airspace had increased to the level that [[Hermann Göring]] decreed that a [[night fighter|night-fighter]] force should be formed. The officer tasked with its creation was [[Wolfgang Falck]], ''Gruppenkommandeur'' of the I./[[Zerstörergeschwader 1]] (ZG&amp;nbsp;1).&lt;ref&gt;Hinchliffe 2003, p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; The night-fighter force began to expand rapidly, with existing units being divided to form the nucleus of new units. By October 1940 [[Nachtjagdgeschwader 1]] (NJG&amp;nbsp;1) comprised three ''Gruppen'', while [[Nachtjagdgeschwader 2]] (NJG&amp;nbsp;2) and [[Nachtjagdgeschwader 3]] (NJG&amp;nbsp;3), were still forming.&lt;ref&gt;Hinchliffe 2003, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; It was during this period that Helmut Lent reluctantly became a member of the night-fighter force. At the end of August Lent wrote home, &quot;We are currently converting to night fighting. We are not very enthusiastic. We would sooner head directly for England.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hinchliffe 2003, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lent completed night fighter training at [[Ingolstadt]] in south-western Germany, and was appointed squadron leader, or ''Staffelkapitän'', of the newly formed 6./NJG&amp;nbsp;1 on 1 October 1940. The squadron was based at Fliegerhorst Deelen, located {{convert|12.5|km|0}} north of [[Arnhem]] in the Netherlands. On the night 11–12 May 1941, Lent claimed his first nocturnal aerial victories against two Wellington IC bombers from [[No. 40 Squadron RAF]] on a mission against Hamburg. BL-H (serial number R1330) was shot down at 01:40 near [[Süderstapel]] and BL-Z (R1461) at 02:49 near [[Nordstrand, Germany|Nordstrand]].&lt;ref&gt;Hinchliffe 2003, p. 295.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 July 1941, he took command of 4./NJG 1, stationed in the Netherlands at ''Fliegerhorst'' (airfield) [[Leeuwarden]], {{convert|161|km|0}} north of Arnheim, on the Friesland coast, where he remained until his death. From this position in the so-called [[German Bight]], the squadron patrolled the North Sea coast, and could intercept Allied night-time bombing missions, what the Luftwaffe called terror attacks, based out of England.&lt;ref&gt;''Die Wehrmachtberichte 1939–1945.'' Band 3, pp. 285–286.&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the war, the 4./NJG 1 was one of the most successful ''Nachtjagdstaffel''—a squadron of a night fighter wing—of the Luftwaffe. Other members included such night fighter pilots as ''Oberleutnant'' [[Helmut Woltersdorf]], ''Leutnant'' [[Ludwig Becker (pilot)|Ludwig Becker]] (44 victories, KIA February 1943), ''Leutnant'' [[Egmont Prinz zur Lippe-Weißenfeld]] (51 victories, killed in a flying accident in the Netherlands in March 1944), ''Leutnant'' [[Leopold Fellerer]] (41 victories), ''Oberfeldwebel'' [[Paul Gildner]] (46 victories, killed in a flying accident at Fliegerhorst Gilze-Rijen in the Netherlands in February 1943), and ''Unteroffizier'' Siegfried Ney (12 victories, KIA February 1943). On 30 August 1941, Lent received the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross]] (''Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes'') for seven daytime and 14 night victories.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fraschka p187&quot;&gt;Fraschka 1994, p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 November 1941, Lent became acting Group Commander ''[[Gruppenkommandeur]]'' of the newly formed II./NJG 2.&lt;ref&gt;Hinchliffe 2003, p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; Lent's first aerial victory as a ''Gruppenkommandeur'', his 20th night-time, and his last in 1941, came during the night of Friday 7 November to Saturday 8 November. He shot down a Wellington 1C heading for Berlin, which came down near [[Akkrum]]. The six-man crew of the bomber, [[United Kingdom military aircraft serials|''X9976'']] of [[No. 75 Squadron RAF|No. 75 (New Zealand) Squadron]], was killed in action. This achievement earned Lent a reference in the [[Wehrmachtbericht]] (his first of six in total), an information bulletin issued by the headquarters of the Wehrmacht. To be singled out individually in the ''Wehrmachtbericht'' was an honour and was entered in the Orders and Decorations' section of one's Service Record Book.&lt;ref&gt;Hinchliffe 2003, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was promoted to ''[[Hauptmann]]'' on 1 January 1942.&lt;ref&gt;Hinchliffe 2003, p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, he was awarded the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross#Knight's Cross with Oak Leaves (mit Eichenlaub)|Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves]] (''Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes mit Eichenlaub'') on 6 June 1942, at which time his total stood at 34 nocturnal victories plus seven day-time victories.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fraschka p187&quot;/&gt; The award was presented at the ''[[Führerhauptquartier]]'' on 28 and 29 June, his tally standing then at 39 nocturnal and seven day-time victories.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hinchliffe pp147,296&quot;/&gt; By the end of 1942, Lent had 56 victories and was the top German night-fighter ace. He was promoted to ''Major'' on 1 January 1943 and appointed ''[[Geschwaderkommodore]]'' of [[Nachtjagdgeschwader 3]]&amp;nbsp;(NJG 3) on 1 August 1943.&lt;ref&gt;Hinchliffe 2003, p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt; After 73 kills, of which 65 were claimed at night, he was awarded the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross#Knight's Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords (mit Eichenlaub und Schwertern)|Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords]] (''Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes mit Eichenlaub und Schwertern'') on 2 August 1943 and notified by telegram on 4 August.&lt;ref&gt;Hinchliffe 2003, pp. 201, 297.&lt;/ref&gt; The Swords were presented to him at the ''Führerhauptquartier'' at [[Rastenburg]] on 10/11 August 1943.&lt;ref&gt;Hinchliffe 2003, p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1944, Lent downed three so-called &quot;heavies&quot;—four-engined [[strategic bomber]]s—in one night, but his plane was damaged by return fire, requiring a forced landing. He used only 22 cannon shells to down two bombers on the night of the 22–23 March 1944, and fired only 57 rounds in seven minutes against three [[Avro Lancaster]]s on 15–16 June. Promoted to ''[[Oberstleutnant]]'', he was awarded the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross#Knight's Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords, and Diamonds (mit Eichenlaub, Schwertern und Brillanten)|Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords and Diamonds]] (''Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes mit Eichenlaub, Schwertern und Brillanten'') in recognition of his 110 confirmed air kills, the first of two night-fighter pilots to be awarded the decoration.&lt;ref name=&quot;Obermaier&quot;&gt;Obermaier 1989, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; The second was [[Heinz-Wolfgang Schnaufer]], who, with 121 aerial victories, became aviation history's leading night-fighter pilot.&lt;ref&gt;Williamson 2006, pp. 50, 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personal life===
All German officers were required to obtain official permission to marry; however, this was usually a bureaucratic formality. When Lent decided to marry Elizabeth Petersen, his admirer from Hamburg whom he had met on a blind date, his case was more complicated. 'Elisabeth Petersen' was in fact Helene (Lena) Senokosnikova, born in Moscow in April 1914. She had been afraid to reveal her true identity, since Russians were not popular in the Third Reich,&lt;ref&gt;Hinchliffe 2003, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; but after a thorough investigation into her background and racial ancestry, she received her German citizenship on 15 March 1941. They were married on 10 September 1941 in [[Wellingsbüttel]], [[Hamburg]].&lt;ref&gt;Hinchliffe 2003, p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; The marriage produced two daughters. Christina was born on 6 June 1942; the second, Helma, was born on 6 October 1944, shortly after her father's fatal crash.&lt;ref&gt;Hinchliffe 2003, pp. 143, 259.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both of Helmut's older brothers, Joachim and Werner, as members of the [[Confessing Church]] (German: ''Bekennende Kirche''), encountered trouble with the Nazi party. The Confessing Church, led by Pastor [[Martin Niemöller]], was a schismatic Protestant church which opposed the Reich's efforts to &quot;Nazify&quot; Germany's Protestant churches. It stood in outspoken opposition to National Socialist principles, particularly those embodied in the [[Aryan Paragraph]]. Through the [[Barmen Declaration]], the church condemned the national [[German Evangelical Church]] as heretical. Werner Lent, an adherent to the Confessing church, was arrested for the first time in 1937 after preaching an anti-Nazi sermon.&lt;ref&gt;Hinchliffe 2003, p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1942, his brother Joachim was arrested by the [[Gestapo]] after reading the so-called [[Mölders letter]] from the pulpit. The Mölders letter was a propaganda piece conceived by [[Sefton Delmer]], the chief of the British [[black propaganda]] in the [[Political Warfare Executive]] (PWE) to capitalize on the death of Germany's fighter ace [[Werner Mölders]]; this letter, ostensibly written by Mölders, attested to the supreme importance of his Catholic faith in his life—by implication, placing faith above his allegiance to the National Socialist Party.&lt;ref&gt;Hinchliffe 2003, pp. 149–151.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===

On 5 October 1944, Lent flew his [[Junkers Ju-88]] G–6, coded D5+AA, from [[Stade]] to [[Paderborn]]. His crew included his long-time radio operator ''[[Oberfeldwebel]]'' [[Walter Kubisch]], the [[war correspondent]] ''Leutnant'' Werner Kark in the aerial gunner position, and ''Oberleutnant'' Hermann Klöss, second radio operator. Lent was on his way to visit the ''Geschwaderkommodore'' of the [[Nachtjagdgeschwader 1]], ''Oberstleutnant'' [[Hans-Joachim Jabs]], to discuss operational matters. During the landing approach, the left engine of the plane failed, causing the wing to dip. Lent was unable to keep the plane steady and it struck high-voltage cables and crashed. All four members of the crew sustained serious injuries but were rescued alive. Kubisch and Klöss succumbed to their injuries on the same day, Kark on the next morning and Lent himself died two days later on 7 October 1944.&lt;ref&gt;Hagen 1998, p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt;

Helmut Lent's [[state funeral]] was held in the [[Reich Chancellery]], Berlin, on Wednesday 11 October 1944. ''[[Reichsmarschall]]'' [[Hermann Göring]] took the salute at Lent's coffin, which was draped in the national flag of the Third Reich. Ahead of the coffin, carrying Lent's honours and decorations on a velvet cushion, marched ''Oberstleutnant'' [[Werner Streib]], the Inspector of Night Fighters. Six steel-helmeted officers, all recipients of the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross, escorted the coffin on its caisson and stood as [[guard of honour]] during the ceremony: ''Oberstleutnant'' [[Günther Radusch]], ''Oberstleutnant'' [[Hans-Joachim Jabs]], ''Major'' [[Rudolf Schoenert]], ''Hauptmann'' [[Heinz Strüning]], ''Hauptmann'' [[Karl Hadeball]] and ''Hauptmann'' [[Paul Zorner]].&lt;ref&gt;Hagen 1998, pp. 265–266.&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 October 1944 Lent and his crew were interred in a single grave in the military cemetery at [[Stade]].&lt;ref&gt;Hagen 1998, p. 268.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
On 18 July 1964, a German Armed Forces [[Army Aviation Corps (Germany)|Heeresflieger]] installation in [[Rotenburg (Wümme)]] (Lower Saxony) was renamed the Lent Barracks, or ''Lent-Kaserne'', in his honour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lexikon-der-wehrmacht.de/Personenregister/LentH.htm|title=Helmut Lent|work=Lexikon der Wehrmacht|accessdate=2 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of Helmut Lent's awards were auctioned at [[Sotheby's]], London, on 18 July 1966. The items were bought in one lot by an anonymous bidder for the total sum of £500. The purchaser was [[Adolf Galland]], the former ''[[General der Jagdflieger]]'', acting on behalf of the [[Federal Ministry of Defence (Germany)|Federal German Ministry of Defence]]. The awards were sold by Helmut Lent's elder daughter Christina after consultation with her mother, Lena, who was in urgent need for money to pay for an operation. The Federal Ministry of Defence presented the collection to the Museum of Defence History (''Wehrgeschichtliches Museum'') in [[Rastatt]], Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Hinchliffe 2003, pp. 287–288.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary of career==
Helmut Lent is officially credited with 110 victories in 507 flights. The total includes 103 victories at night, during which he destroyed 59 four-engine bombers and one [[de Havilland Mosquito|Mosquito]], among other types. Lent received a posthumous promotion to ''Oberst'' (Colonel).{{#tag:ref|According to Jerry Scutts 113 victories of which 102 at night.&lt;ref&gt;Scutts 1998, pp. 20, 88.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=&quot;Notes&quot;}}
