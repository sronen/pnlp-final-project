[[Field Marshal (Australia)|Field Marshal]] '''Sir Thomas Albert Blamey''', [[Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire|GBE]], [[Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath|KCB]], [[Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George|CMG]], [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]], [[Efficiency Decoration|ED]] (24 January 1884 – 27 May 1951) was an [[Australia]]n general of the [[First World War|First]] and [[Second World War]]s, and the only Australian ever to attain the rank of field marshal.

Blamey joined the Australian Army as a regular soldier in 1906, and attended the [[Command and Staff College|Staff College at Quetta]]. During the First World War he participated in the [[landing at Anzac Cove]] on 25 April 1915, and served as a staff officer in the [[Gallipoli Campaign]], where he was [[mentioned in despatches]] for a daring raid behind enemy lines. He later served on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]], where he distinguished himself in the planning for the [[Battle of Pozières]]. He rose to the rank of [[brigadier general]], and served as chief of staff of the [[Australian Corps]] under [[Lieutenant General (Australia)|Lieutenant General]] Sir [[John Monash]], who credited him as a factor in the Corps' success in the [[Battle of Hamel]], the [[Battle of Amiens (1918)|Battle of Amiens]] and the [[Battle of the Hindenburg Line]].

After the war Blamey was Deputy [[Chief of the General Staff (Australia)|Chief of the General Staff]], and was involved in the creation of the [[Royal Australian Air Force]]. He resigned from the regular Army in 1925 to become Chief Commissioner of the [[Victoria Police]], but remained in the [[Australian Army Reserve|Militia]], rising to command the [[3rd Division (Australia)|3rd Division]] in 1931. As Chief Commissioner, Blamey set about dealing with the grievances that had led to the [[1923 Victorian Police strike]], and implemented innovations such as police dogs and equipping vehicles with radios. His tenure as Chief Commissioner was marred by a scandal in which his police badge was found in a brothel, and a later attempt to cover up the shooting of a police officer led to his forced resignation in 1936. He later made weekly broadcasts on international affairs on Melbourne radio station [[3UZ]]. Appointed chairman of the Commonwealth Government's Manpower Committee and Controller General of Recruiting in 1938, he headed a successful recruiting campaign which doubled the size of the part-time volunteer Militia.

During the Second World War  he commanded the [[Second Australian Imperial Force]] and the [[I Corps (Australia)|I Corps]] in the Middle East. In the latter role he commanded Australian and Commonwealth troops in the disastrous [[Battle of Greece]]. In the former role, he attempted to protect Australian interests against British commanders who sought to disperse his forces on all manner of missions. He was appointed Deputy Commander in Chief in the Middle East, and was promoted to [[General (Australia)|general]] in 1941. In 1942, he returned to Australia as Commander in Chief of the [[Australian Military Forces]] and Commander of Allied Land Forces in the [[South West Pacific Area]] under the command of [[General (United States)|General]] [[Douglas MacArthur]]. On the orders of MacArthur and [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] [[John Curtin]], he assumed personal command of [[New Guinea Force]] during the [[Kokoda Track Campaign]], and relieved [[Lieutenant General (Australia)|Lieutenant General]] [[Sydney Rowell]] and  [[Major General (Australia)|Major General]] [[Arthur Allen]] under controversial circumstances. During the [[Salamaua–Lae Campaign]] Blamey planned and executed a major and victorious campaign. Nonetheless, during the final campaigns of the war he faced vociferous criticism of the Army's performance. He signed the instrument of surrender on behalf of Australia at Japan's ceremonial surrender in Tokyo Bay on 2 September 1945, and later personally accepted the Japanese surrender at [[Morotai]]. He was promoted to field marshal in June 1950.

==Early life==
The seventh of ten children, Blamey was born on 24 January 1884 in [[Lake Albert, New South Wales|Lake Albert]], near [[Wagga Wagga, New South Wales]]. He was the son of Richard Blamey, a farmer who had emigrated from [[Cornwall]] at the age of 16 in 1862, and his Australian-born wife, Margaret Blamey née Murray.  After farming failures in Queensland and on the [[Murrumbidgee River]] near Wagga Wagga, his father Richard moved to a small {{convert|20|acre|adj=on}} property in Lake Albert, where he supplemented his farm income working as a drover and shearing overseer.{{sfn|Hetherington|1973|pp=1–3}} Blamey acquired the bush skills associated with his father’s enterprises and became a sound horseman. He attended Wagga Wagga Superior Public School (now Wagga Wagga Public School), where he played [[Australian football]], and was a keen member of the [[Australian Army Cadets|Army Cadet]] unit. He transferred to Wagga Wagga Grammar when he was 13, and was head cadet of its unit for two years.{{sfn|Hetherington|1973|pp=6–8}}

Blamey began his working life in 1899 as a trainee school teacher at Lake Albert School. He transferred to South Wagga Public School in 1901. In 1903 he moved to Western Australia, where he taught for three years at Fremantle Boys School. He coached the rifle shooting team of its cadet unit there to a win in the Western Australian Cup.{{sfn|Hetherington|1973|pp=11–15}} Blamey was raised in a  [[Methodist]] family and was involved with his church. By early 1906 he was a lay preacher, and Church leaders in Western Australia offered him an appointment as an associate minister in [[Carnarvon, Western Australia]].{{sfn|Hetherington|1973|pp=18–20}}

==Early military career==
With the creation of the Cadet Instructional Staff of the [[Australian Military Forces]], Blamey saw a new opportunity. He sat the exam and came third in Australia, but failed to secure an appointment as there were no vacancies in Western Australia. After correspondence with the military authorities he persuaded the Deputy Assistant Adjutant General, Major [[Julius Bruche]], that he should be given the option of taking up an appointment for one of the vacancies in another state. He was appointed to a position in Victoria with the rank of [[lieutenant]], commencing duty in November 1906 with responsibility for school cadets in Victoria.{{sfn|Hetherington|1973|pp=18–20}}

In Melbourne, Blamey met  Minnie Millard, the daughter of a [[Toorak, Victoria|Toorak]] stockbroker who was involved in the Methodist Church there. They were married at her home on 8 September 1909. His first child was born on 29 June 1910, and named Charles Middleton after a friend of Blamey's who had died in a shooting accident; but the boy was always called Dolf by his family. A second child, a boy named Thomas, was born four years later.{{sfn|Hetherington|1973|pp=24–26}}

Blamey was promoted to [[captain (OF-2)|captain]] on 1 December 1910{{sfn|Hetherington|1973|pp=24–26}}  and became [[Brigade Major|brigade major]] of the 12th Brigade Area. Blamey next set his sights on attending the British Staff College. There were two staff colleges, at [[Staff College, Camberley|Camberley]] in England and [[Command and Staff College|Quetta]] in India, and from 1908 one position was set aside for the Australian Army at each every year. No Australian officers managed to pass the demanding entrance examinations, although this requirement was waived to allow them to attend. In 1911, Blamey became the first Australian officer to pass the entrance test for examination.{{sfn|Horner|1998|pp=15–16}} He commenced his studies at Quetta in 1912, accompanied by Minnie and Dolf. He performed very well, completing the course in December 1913.{{sfn|Hetherington|1973|pp=28–30}}

The usual practice was for Australian staff college graduates to follow their training with a posting to a [[British Army]] or [[British Indian Army]] headquarters. He was initially attached to the 4th Battalion, [[King's Royal Rifle Corps]] at [[Rawalpindi]], and then on the staff of the [[Kohat Brigade]] on the  [[North-West Frontier Province (1901–1955)|North West Frontier]]. Finally, he was assigned to the General Staff at Army Headquarters at [[Shimal]]. In May 1914, Blamey was sent to Britain for more training, while his family returned home to Australia. He left India and visited Turkey (including the Dardanelles), Belgium, and the battlefields of the [[Franco-Prussian War]] en route. He spent a brief time on attachment to the [[4th Dragoon Guards]] at [[Tidworth]] before taking up duties on the staff of the [[British 43rd (Wessex) Division|Wessex Division]], at that time entering its annual camp. On 1 July 1914, he was promoted to [[major (United Kingdom)|major]].{{sfn|Horner|1998|pp=22–25}}

==First World War==
Following the outbreak of the [[First World War]], Blamey was transferred to the [[War Office]], where he worked in the [[military intelligence|Intelligence Branch]] preparing daily summaries for the [[George V of the United Kingdom|King]] and [[Secretary of State for War]], [[Horatio Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]]. Fully trained staff officers were rare and valuable in the Australian Army, and while still in Britain, Blamey was appointed to the [[First Australian Imperial Force]] (AIF) as General Staff Officer, Grade 3 (Intelligence), on the staff of [[Major General (Australia)|Major General]] [[William Bridges (general)|William Bridges]]' [[Australian 1st Division (World War I)|1st Division]]. As such, he reported to the 1st Division's GSO1, [[Lieutenant Colonel]] [[Brudenell White]]. In November 1914 Blamey sailed for Egypt with [[Colonel]] [[Harry Chauvel]], to join the Australian contingent there.{{sfn|Hetherington|1973|pp=32–33}}

===Gallipoli===
Along with Bridges, White, and other members of 1st Division headquarters, Blamey left the battleship {{HMS|Prince of Wales|1902|6}} in a trawler and [[Landing at Anzac Cove|landed on the beach at Anzac Cove]] at 07:20 on 25 April 1915.{{sfn|Bean|1921|p=365}} Blamey was sent to evaluate the need for reinforcements by Colonel [[James McCay]]'s 2nd Brigade on the [[Lone Pine (tree)|400 Plateau]]. He confirmed that they were in such need, and the reinforcements were sent.{{sfn|Bean|1921|pp=400–401}}

The position was exposed to shrapnel fire and Major [[John Gellibrand]] was wounded there.|alt=Two dugouts with tents for awnings. Wooden boxes are stacked nearby. Men in uniforms with peaked caps (and one with a solar topee) stand around a wooden folding camp table.]]
On the night of 13 May 1915, Blamey, in his capacity as 1st Division intelligence officer, led Sergeant J.H. Will and Bombardier A.A. Orchard on a patrol behind the Turkish lines in an effort to locate the Olive Grove guns that had been harassing the beach. Near Pine Ridge, an enemy party of eight Turks approached; when one of them went to bayonet Orchard, Blamey shot the Turk with his revolver. In the action that followed, six Turks were killed. He withdrew his patrol back to the Australian lines without locating the guns.{{sfn|Bean|1924|pp=176–177}} For this action, he was [[mentioned in despatches]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/AWM28/2/46P1/0013.pdf |title=Honours and Awards – T.A. Blamey – Recommendation for Mention in Despatches |accessdate=10 October 2011 |publisher=Australian War Memorial }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MID1&quot;&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=29354|supp=yes|startpage=11001|date=5 November 1915|accessdate=10 October 2010}} Mentioned in Despatches.&lt;/ref&gt;

Blamey was always interested in technical innovation, and receptive to unorthodox ideas. He was instrumental in the adoption of the [[periscope rifle]] at Gallipoli, an instrument which he saw during an inspection of the front line. He arranged for the inventor, [[Lance Corporal]] W.C.B. Beech, to be seconded to division headquarters to develop the idea. Within a few days, the design was perfected and periscope rifles began to be used throughout the Australian trenches.{{sfn|Bean|1924|pp=250–251}}

In July 1915 Blamey was given a staff appointment as a General Staff Officer, Grade 2 (GSO2),&lt;ref name=GSO2&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=29287|startpage=8873|date=7 September 1915|accessdate=17 August 2008}} Appointed General Staff Officer—2nd Grade.&lt;/ref&gt;  and in September 1915 he was promoted to temporary lieutenant colonel and joined the staff of the newly forming [[Australian 2nd Division (World War I)|2nd Division]] in Egypt as its Assistant Adjutant and Quartermaster General (AA&amp;QMG) – the senior administrative officer of the division.&lt;ref name=LtCol&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=29331|supp=yes|startpage=10243|date=15 October 1915|accessdate=16 August 2008}} Promotion to temporary Lieutenant Colonel.&lt;/ref&gt; Its commander, Major General [[James Gordon Legge]], preferred to have an Australian colonel in this post as he felt that a British officer might not take such good care of the troops. The 2nd Division Headquarters embarked for Gallipoli on 29 August 1915, but Blamey was forced to remain in Egypt as he had just had an operation for [[haemorrhoids]]. He finally returned to Anzac on 25 October 1915, remaining for the rest of the campaign. {{sfn|Horner|1998|pp=37–39}}

===Western Front===
[[File:Blamey E05006.jpg|thumb|right|Blamey in Belgium, March 1919|alt=A man in a neat military uniform with a peaked cap, ribbons on his tunic, Sam Brown belt, cane, riding boots and spurs.]]
After the Australian forces moved to the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] in 1916, Blamey returned to the 1st Division as GSO1.&lt;ref name=GSO1&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=29703|startpage=7917|date=11 August 1916|accessdate=16 August 2008}} Appointed GSO1.&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[Battle of Pozières]], he developed the plan of attack which captured the town,{{sfn|Hetherington|1973|pp=38–39}} for which he received a mention in despatches,&lt;ref name=&quot;MID2&quot;&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=29890|supp=yes|startpage=253|date=4 January 1917|accessdate=10 October 2010}} Mentioned in Despatches.&lt;/ref&gt; and was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Order]] in the 1917 [[New Year Honours]].&lt;ref name=DSO&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=29886|supp=yes|startpage=19|endpage=28|date=29 December 1916|accessdate=17 August 2008}} New Year's Honours 1917. DSO.&lt;/ref&gt; He was considered as a possible brigade commander, but he had never commanded a battalion, which was usually regarded as a prerequisite for brigade command. He was therefore appointed to command the [[2nd Battalion (Australia)|2nd Infantry Battalion]] on 3 December 1916. On 28 December, Blamey, as senior ranking battalion commander, took over as acting commander of the [[1st Brigade (Australia)|1st Infantry Brigade]]. On 9 January 1917, he went on leave, handing over command to Lieutenant Colonel [[Iven Mackay]]. However, when General Headquarters [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|BEF]] found out about this use of a staff college graduate, it reminded [[I ANZAC Corps]] that &quot;it is inadvisable to release such officers for command of battalions unless they have proved to be unequal to their duties on staff&quot;.{{sfn|Horner|1998|pp=46–47}}

Blamey therefore returned to 1st Division Headquarters. [[Lieutenant General (United Kingdom)|Lieutenant General]] Sir [[William Birdwood]] did, however, promote Blamey to full colonel, backdated to 1 December 1916, thereby making him technically senior to a number of recently promoted [[brigadier general]]s, that rank being only held temporarily. His division commander, Major General [[Harold Bridgwood Walker|H. B. Walker]], had Blamey mentioned in despatches for this period of battalion and brigade command,&lt;ref name=&quot;MID3&quot;&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=30107|supp=yes|startpage=5419|date=1 June 1917|accessdate=10 October 2010}} Mentioned in Despatches.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MID4&quot;&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=30448|supp=yes|startpage=13563|date=28 December 1917|accessdate=10 October 2010}} Mentioned in Despatches.&lt;/ref&gt; although the battalion had spent most of the period out of the line and there had been no significant engagements.{{sfn|Horner|1998|pp=46–47}} Blamey was also acting commander of the 2nd Brigade during a rest period from 27 August to 4 September 1917.{{sfn|Horner|1998|pp=48–51}}  On 8 September he was hospitalised with vomiting and coughing. He was sent to England where he was admitted to the 3rd London General Hospital for treatment for debilitating [[psoriasis]] on 22 September, and did not return to duty until 8 November 1917.&lt;ref name=&quot;NAA&quot;/&gt; Blamey was made a [[Companion of St Michael and St George]] in the 1918 New Year's list,&lt;ref name=CMG&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=30450|supp=yes|startpage=6|date=28 December 1917|accessdate=16 August 2008}} Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG).&lt;/ref&gt; and received another mention in despatches in May 1918.&lt;ref name=&quot;MID5&quot;&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=30706|supp=yes|startpage=6200|date=28 May 1918|accessdate=10 October 2010}} Mentioned in Despatches.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 June 1918, [[Lieutenant General (Australia)|Lieutenant General]] [[John Monash]] succeeded Birdwood as commander of the [[Australian Corps]], and Blamey was promoted to the rank of brigadier general and replaced White as the corps Brigadier General General Staff (BGGS).{{sfn|Horner|1998|pp=48–51}}  He played a significant role in the success of the Australian Corps in the final months of the war. Blamey remained interested in technological innovation. He was impressed by the capabilities of the new models of tanks and pressed for their use in the [[Battle of Hamel]], where they played an important part in the success of the battle.{{sfn|Hetherington|1973|pp=43–44}} Monash acknowledged Blamey's role the Australian Corps' success in the [[Battle of Amiens (1918)|Battle of Amiens]] in August and the [[Battle of the Hindenburg Line]] in September.{{sfn|Monash|1920|p=296}} The Major General General Staff (MGGS) of the [[Fourth Army (United Kingdom)|British Fourth Army]], of which the Australian Corps was a part during these battles, Major General [[Archibald Montgomery-Massingberd]], was a former instructor of Blamey's at Quetta. He declared himself &quot;full of admiration for the staff work of the Australian Corps.&quot;{{sfn|Horner|1998|p=55}} Monash later wrote:
{{quote|No reference to the staff work of the Australian Corps during the period of my command would be complete without a tribute to the work and personality [of] Brigadier General T. A. Blamey, my Chief of Staff. He possessed a mind cultured far above the average, widely informed, alert and prehensile. He had [an] infinite capacity for taking pains. A Staff College graduate, but not on that account a pedant, he was thoroughly versed in the technique of staff work, and in the minutiae of all procedure.

He served me with an exemplary loyalty, for which I owe a debt of gratitude which cannot be repaid. Our temperaments adapted themselves to each other in a manner which was ideal. He had an extraordinary faculty for self-effacement, posing always and conscientiously as the instrument to give effect [to] my policies and decisions. Really helpful whenever his advice was invited, he never obtruded his own opinions, although I knew that he did not always agree with me.{{sfn|Monash|1920|p=296}}}}

Blamey's loyalty to Monash would continue after the latter's death in 1931.{{sfn|Horner|1998|p=55}} For his services as Corps Chief of Staff, Blamey was appointed [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in 1919,&lt;ref name=CB&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=31245|supp=yes|startpage=3835|date=21 March 1919|accessdate=16 August 2008}} Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB).&lt;/ref&gt;  mentioned in despatches twice more,&lt;ref name=&quot;MID6&quot;&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=31089|supp=yes|startpage=15225|date=31 December 1918|accessdate=10 October 2010}} Mentioned in Despatches.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MID7&quot;&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=31448|supp=yes|startpage=8826|date=11 July 1919|accessdate=10 October 2010}} Mentioned in Despatches.&lt;/ref&gt; and was awarded the French [[Croix de guerre 1914–1918 (France)|Croix de guerre]].&lt;ref name=cdg&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=31109|supp=yes|startpage=312|date=3 January 1919|accessdate=16 August 2008}} Croix de Guerre.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inter-war years==
===General staff===
Blamey arrived back in Australia on 20 October 1919 after an absence of seven years, and became director of Military Operations at Army Headquarters in Melbourne. His AIF appointment was terminated on 19 December 1919, but he retained his wartime rank of a brigadier general as an honorary  rank. He was promoted to a substantive colonel in January 1920, and in May 1920 was appointed Deputy [[Chief of the General Staff (Australia)|Chief of the General Staff]].{{sfn|Horner|1998|pp=60–63}}

His first major task was the creation of the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF). The government established a joint Army–Navy board to provide recommendations on the matter, with Blamey and Lieutenant [[Richard Williams (RAAF officer)|Richard Williams]] as the Army representatives. Blamey supported the creation of a separate air force, albeit one still subordinate to the Army and Navy. He refused to yield, however, on his opposition to the Navy's demand that Lieutenant Colonel [[Stanley Goble]] become its first chief.{{sfn|Horner|1998|pp=65–66}}

In November 1922 Blamey embarked for London to be the Australian representative on the [[Imperial General Staff]]. He reported that the &quot;conception of an Imperial General Staff ... was absolutely dead&quot;.{{sfn|Horner|1998|p=67}} The British Army saw no little use in the concept of a combined staff which could coordinate the defence of the [[British Empire]].{{sfn|Horner|1998|p=67}} He became involved with the development of the [[Singapore strategy]], and he briefed Prime Minister [[Stanley Bruce]] on it for the [[1923 Imperial Conference]], at which it was formally adopted. Even in 1923, though, Blamey was sceptical about the strategy.{{sfn|Horner|1998|pp=67–69}}

When White retired as Chief of General Staff in 1923, Blamey was widely expected to succeed him, as he had as chief of staff of the Australian Corps in France, but there were objections from more senior officers, particularly Major General [[Victor Sellheim]], at being passed over. Instead, the Inspector General, Lieutenant General Sir [[Harry Chauvel]], was made Chief of General Staff as well, while Blamey was given the new post of Second CGS, in which he performed most of the duties of Chief of General Staff.{{sfn|Horner|1998|pp=70–73}}

Seeing no immediate prospects for advancement, Blamey transferred from the Permanent Military Forces to the [[Australian Army Reserve|Militia]] on 1 September 1925. For the next 14 years he would remain in the Army as a part-time soldier. On 1 May 1926 he assumed command of the [[10th Brigade (Australia)|10th Infantry Brigade]], part of the [[3rd Division (Australia)|3rd Division]]. Blamey stepped up to command the 3rd Division on 23 March 1931, and was promoted to major general, one of only four Militia officers promoted to this rank between 1929 and 1939. In 1937 he was transferred to the unattached list.{{sfn|Horner|1998|pp=104–113}}

===Chief Commissioner of the Victoria Police===
In 1923, the [[Victoria Police]] [[1923 Victorian Police strike|went on strike]], and Monash and McCay established a Special Constabulary Force to carry out police duties. After the Chief Commissioner, Alexander Nicholson, resigned for ill-health in 1925, Chauvel recommended Blamey for the post. He became Chief Commissioner on 1 September 1925 for a five-year term, with a salary of £1,500 per annum (A${{formatnum:{{Inflation|AU|3000|1925|2008}}}} in 2008 dollars).{{sfn|Hetherington|1973|pp=50–52}}  Blamey set about addressing the grievances that had caused the strike, which he felt &quot;were just, even if they went the wrong way about them&quot;.{{sfn|Hetherington|1973|p=52}} Blamey improved pay and conditions, and implemented the recommendations of the Royal Commission into the strike.{{sfn|Hetherington|1973|pp=50–52}} He attempted to introduce faster promotion based on merit, but this was unpopular with the [[Police Association Victoria|Police Association]], and was abandoned by his successors.{{sfn|Horner|1998|pp=87–89}} As in the Army, he showed a willingness to adopt new ideas. He introduced police dogs,{{sfn|Hetherington|1973|pp=52–53, 57}} and increased the number of police cars equipped with two-way radios from one in 1925 to five in 1930.{{sfn|Horner|1998|pp=87–89}} He also boosted the numbers of policewomen on the force.{{sfn|Horner|1998|p=91}}

[[File:Blamey as Police Commissioner.jpeg|thumb|left|Blamey as Chief Commissioner of the Victoria Police|alt=A man seated, wearing a dark uniform with two rows of buttons, with his peaked cap on his lap]]
Blamey became involved in his first and greatest scandal soon after taking office. During a raid on a brothel in [[Fitzroy, Victoria|Fitzroy]] on 21 October 1925, the police encountered a man who produced Blamey's police badge, No. 80. Blamey later said that he had given his key ring, which included his badge, to a friend who had served with him in France, so that the man could help himself to some alcohol in Blamey's locker at the Naval and Military Club. Blamey's story was corroborated by his friend [[Stanley Savige]], who was with him at the time. Blamey protected the man in question, whom he said was married with children, and refused to identify him. He has never been identified, but the description given by the detectives and the brothel owner did not match Blamey.{{sfn|Hetherington|1973|pp=53–55}}{{sfn|Horner|1998|pp=80–82, 99}}

During the 1920s, Victoria had repressive and restrictive drinking laws, including the notorious [[six o'clock closing]]. Blamey took the position that it was the job of the police to enforce the laws, even if they did not support them. He drew a sharp distinction between his personal life and his job. Many members of the public did not agree with this attitude. Blamey's presence in a hotel after closing time was always welcome, as it meant that drinking could continue, for it was known that it would not be raided while he was there; but other citizens felt that it was unjust that they continued to be arrested for breaking the same laws.{{sfn|Hetherington|1973|pp=56–57}}

As Police Commissioner he defended the actions of the police during the 1928 [[Waterside Workers' Federation]] dispute, during which police opened fire, killing a striking worker who was also a Gallipoli veteran, and wounding several others. Blamey's treatment of the unionists was typical of his hard line anti-[[communism|communist]] beliefs and as such his relations with left-wing governments were tense. Along with many senior army and ex-army officers, he was a leading member of the clandestine far-right-wing League of National Security. This was reportedly a response to the rise of communism in Australia. Its members stood ready to take up arms to stop a Catholic or communist revolution.{{sfn|Horner|1998|pp=93–97}}

Blamey was re-appointed as Chief Commissioner in 1930, but at a reduced salary of  £1,250 per annum. A year later it was reduced still further, to  £785, due to cutbacks as a result of the [[Great Depression]].{{sfn|Horner|1998|pp=91–92}} Minnie became an invalid, and by 1930 no longer accompanied him in public.{{sfn|Horner|1998|p=99}} His son Dolf, now an [[RAAF]] [[flying officer]], was killed in an air crash at [[RAAF Base Richmond]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article2322852 |title=Funeral of Air Victim. |newspaper=[[Canberra Times]] |date=8 December 1932 |accessdate=22 October 2011 |page=1 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Minnie died in October 1935.{{sfn|Horner|1998|p=99}} Blamey was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] in the 1935 New Year Honours,&lt;ref name=Kt1&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=34119|supp=yes|startpage=1|endpage=2|date=28 December 1934|accessdate=16 August 2008}} Knight Bachelor.&lt;br/&gt;Citation: &quot;Major General Thomas Albert Blamey, C.B., C.M.G., D.S.O.

A second scandal occurred in 1936 when Blamey attempted to cover up details of the shooting of the superintendent of the Criminal Investigation Branch, John O'Connell Brophy, whom Blamey had appointed to the post. Brophy had taken two women friends along with him to a meeting with a police informant. While they were waiting for the informant, they had been approached by armed bandits, and Brophy had opened fire and had himself been wounded. In order to cover up the identities of the two women involved, Blamey initially issued a press release to the effect that Brophy had accidentally shot himself. The [[Premier of Victoria|Premier]], [[Albert Dunstan]], gave Blamey the choice of resigning or being dismissed. The latter meant the loss of pension rights and any future prospects of employment in the Public Service or the Army. Blamey reluctantly submitted his resignation on 9 July 1936.{{sfn|Hetherington|1973|pp=66–69}}

From March 1938 Blamey supplemented his income by making weekly broadcasts on international affairs on Melbourne radio station [[3UZ]] under the pseudonym &quot;the Sentinel&quot;. Blamey and the station's general manager, [[Alfred Kemsley]], felt that Australians were poorly informed about international affairs, and set about raising awareness of matters that Blamey believed would soon impact them greatly.{{sfn|Hetherington|1973|pp=73–74}} He was appalled at [[Nazi Germany]]'s persecution of Jews, and saw a clear and growing menace to world peace from Nazi Germany and the [[Empire of Japan]]. Blamey's 15-minute weekly talks continued until the end of September 1939, by which time the war that he had warned was coming had started.{{sfn|Horner|1998|pp=117–119}}

In November 1938, Blamey was appointed chairman of the Commonwealth Government's Manpower Committee and Controller General of Recruiting. As such, he laid the foundation for the expansion of the Army in the event of war with Germany or Japan, which he now regarded as inevitable.{{sfn|Hetherington|1973|pp=74–78}} In 1938 and 1939, he headed a successful recruiting campaign which doubled the size of the part-time volunteer Militia from 35,000 in September 1938 to 70,000 in March 1939.{{sfn|Long|1952|p=26}} On 5 April 1939 he married Olga Ora Farnsworth, a 35-year-old fashion artist, at St John's Anglican Church, Toorak.{{sfn|Horner|1998|p=124}}

[[Richard Gardiner Casey, Baron Casey|Richard Casey]], who had served with Blamey on Gallipoli and in France, and [[Jo Gullett]] put Blamey's name forward to [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] [[Joseph Lyons]] as a possible commander in chief in the event of a major war. &quot;We've got some brilliant staff officers,&quot; Casey told Lyons, &quot;but Blamey is a commander. That's the difference.&quot; Lyons initially had concerns about Blamey's morals, but Casey and Lyons summoned Blamey to a meeting in Canberra, after which, Lyons designated Blamey for the job. Lyons died on 7 April 1939, but was replaced as prime minister by [[Robert Menzies]], another prominent supporter of Blamey's.{{sfn|Hetherington|1973|pp=78–80}} Two other officers, Major Generals [[Gordon Bennett (general)|Gordon Bennett]] and [[John Lavarack]], were considered, and had strong supporters, but both were strong and public critics of the government's defence policies, whereas Blamey had never publicly criticised government policy.{{sfn|Horner|1998|pp=128–130}}

On 13 October 1939, a month after the outbreak of the [[Second World War]], Blamey was promoted to lieutenant general, and appointed to command the [[Australian 6th Division|6th Division]], the first formation of the new [[Second Australian Imperial Force]], and received the AIF service number VX1. Menzies limited Blamey's choice of commanders by insisting that they be selected from the Militia rather than the PMF. For brigade commanders Blamey chose [[Brigadier]]s [[Arthur Samuel Allen|Arthur Allen]], [[Leslie Morshead]] and Stanley Savige. He selected Brigadier [[Edmund Herring]] to command the 6th Division artillery, Colonel [[Samuel Burston]] for its medical services, and Lieutenant Colonels [[Clive Steele]] and [[Jack Stevens]] for its engineers and signals. All except Allen had previously served with Blamey during his time commanding the 3rd Division in Melbourne. For his two most senior staff officers, he chose Colonel [[Sydney Rowell]] and Lieutenant Colonel [[George Alan Vasey]].{{sfn|Long|1952|pp=44–50}}

In February 1940, the [[War Cabinet]] decided to form a second AIF division, the [[Australian 7th Division|7th Division]], and group the 6th and 7th Divisions together as [[I Corps (Australia)|I Corps]], with Blamey as its commander.{{sfn|Horner|1998|p=137}} On Blamey's recommendation, Major General Iven Mackay was appointed to succeed him in command of the 6th Division, while Lieutenant General John Lavarack assumed command of the 7th Division. Blamey took Brigadier Rowell with him as his chief of staff, and picked Major General [[Henry Wynter]] as his administrative officer.{{sfn|Long|1952|pp=84–85}} Blamey flew to [[Palestine]] on a [[Qantas]] [[flying boat]] in June 1940.{{sfn|Horner|1998|p=142}} He refused to allow his troops to perform police duties in Palestine, and established warm relations with the Jewish community there, becoming a frequent guest in their homes.{{sfn|Hetherington|1973|pp=116–117}}

As commander of the AIF, Blamey was answerable directly to the [[Minister for Defence (Australia)|Minister of Defence]], rather than to the Military Board. He was given a charter based on that given to Bridges in 1914. Part of his charter required that his forces remain together as cohesive units, and that no Australian forces were to be deployed or engaged without the prior consent of the Australian government.{{sfn|Long|1952|pp=100–101}}  Blamey was not inflexible and permitted Australian units to be detached when there was a genuine military need. Because the situation in the Middle East tended to lurch from crisis to crisis, this resulted in his troops becoming widely scattered at times. When the crises had passed, however, he wanted units returned to their parent formations.{{sfn|Horner|1998|pp=213–214, 226}} This resulted in conflicts with British commanders. The first one occurred in August 1940 when the British [[Commander in Chief]] Middle East, General Sir [[Archibald Wavell]], and [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]], [[Winston Churchill]], ordered the [[16th Brigade (Australia)|16th Infantry Brigade]] forward to Egypt. Blamey refused on the grounds that the brigade was not yet fully equipped, but eventually compromised.{{sfn|Horner|1998|pp=152–157}}

I Corps assumed responsibility for the front in [[Cyrenaica]] on 15 February 1941, but within days Blamey was informed that his troops would be sent to Greece. Blamey has been criticised for allowing Australian troops to be sent on the [[Battle of Greece|expedition to Greece]] when he knew it was extremely hazardous after he was told that Menzies had approved.{{sfn|Horner|1998|pp=168–167}} Blamey insisted, however, on sending the veteran 6th Division first instead of the 7th Division, resulting in a heated argument with Wavell, which Blamey won.{{sfn|Horner|1998|pp=174–176}} Blamey was under no illusions about the odds of success and immediately prepared plans for an evacuation.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=37638|supp=yes|startpage=3425|endpage=3431|date=2 July 1946|accessdate=17 August 2008}} Extract from official despatch by Sir Archibald Wavell.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=38293|startpage=3046|date=18 May 1948|accessdate=31 January 2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=38296|supp=yes|startpage=3117|endpage=3118|date=21 May 1948|accessdate=16 August 2008}} Despatch to the Admiralty, 4 August 1941 by Adm Cunningham C-in-C Mediterranean regarding events of the evacuation of Crete, 31 May 1941.&lt;/ref&gt; His foresight and determination saved many of his men but he lost credibility when he chose his son to fill the one remaining seat on the aircraft carrying him out of Greece.{{sfn|Horner|1998|pp=203–204}} The campaign exposed deficiencies in the Australian Army's training, leadership and staff work that had passed unnoticed or had not been addressed in the [[Operation Compass|Libyan Campaign]]. The pressure of the campaign opened a rift between Blamey and Rowell, which was to have important consequences. While Rowell and Brigadier [[William Bridgeford]] were extremely critical of Blamey's performance in Greece, this opinion was not widely held.{{sfn|Horner|1998|pp=207–208}} Wavell reported that &quot;Blamey has shown himself a fine fighting commander in these operations and fitted for high command.&quot;{{sfn|Horner|1998|p=211}}

The political fallout from the disastrous Battle of Greece led to Blamey's appointment as Deputy Commander in Chief Middle East in April 1941.&lt;ref name=DepCinCME&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=35144|supp=yes|startpage=2348|date=22 April 1941|accessdate=16 August 2008}} Appointed Deputy Commander in Chief, Middle East.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=37638|supp=yes|startpage=3444|date=2 July 1946|accessdate=17 August 2008}} Extract from official despatch by Sir Archibald Wavell.&lt;/ref&gt; However, to ensure that command would not pass to Blamey in the event of something happening to Wavell, the British government promoted Sir [[Henry Maitland Wilson]] to [[General (United Kingdom)|general]] in June.{{sfn|Horner|1998|p=226}} Soon afterwards, Wavell was replaced by General Sir [[Claude Auchinleck]].{{sfn|Horner|1998|p=243}} Blamey was subsequently promoted to the same rank on 24 September 1941, becoming only the fourth Australian to reach this rank, after Monash, Chauvel and White.{{sfn|Horner|1998|p=243}} During the [[Syrian campaign]] against the [[Vichy France|Vichy French]], Blamey took decisive action to resolve the command difficulties caused by Wilson's attempt to direct the fighting from the [[King David Hotel]] in [[Jerusalem]] by interposing Lavarack's I Corps headquarters.{{sfn|Horner|1998|pp=222–225}}

During Blamey's absence in Greece, AIF units had become widely scattered, with forces being deployed to [[Cyprus]], and the [[Australian 9th Division|9th Division]] and the [[18th Brigade (Australia)|18th Infantry Brigade]] coming under [[Siege of Tobruk|siege in Tobruk]]. Blamey would spend the rest of the year attempting to reassemble his forces.{{sfn|Horner|1998|p=226}} This led to a clash with Auchinleck over the relief of Tobruk, where Blamey accepted Burston's advice that the Australian troops there should be relieved on medical grounds.

===Papuan campaign===
[[File:Blamey and MacArthur.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Blamey with MacArthur in October 1942. MacArthur had flown to Port Moresby to consult with Blamey on logistical arrangements for the campaign in Papua.{{sfn|Horner|1998|pp=340–341}}|alt=A group of men in uniforms.]]
The defence of Australia took on a new urgency in December 1941 with the entry of Japan into the war. Within the Army there was a concern that Bennett or Lavarack would be appointed as Commander in Chief. In March 1942, Vasey, Herring and Steele approached the [[Minister for Defence (Australia)#Ministers for the Army|Minister for the Army]], [[Frank Forde]], with a proposal that all officers over the age of 50 be immediately retired and Major General [[Horace Robertson]] be appointed Commander in Chief. This &quot;revolt of the generals&quot; collapsed with the welcome news that Blamey was returning from the Middle East to become Commander in Chief [[Australian Military Forces]].{{sfn|Horner|1978|pp=57–58}}{{sfn|Carlyon|1980|p=89}}

[[General (United States)|General]] [[Douglas MacArthur]] arrived in Australia in March 1942 to become [[Supreme Allied Commander|Supreme Commander]] [[South West Pacific Area (command)|South West Pacific Area]] (SWPA). In addition to his duties as Commander in Chief, Blamey became Commander of Allied Land Forces, South West Pacific Area. In the reorganisation that followed his return to Australia on 23 March, Blamey appointed Lavarack to command the [[First Army (Australia)|First Army]], Mackay to command the [[Second Army (Australia)|Second Army]], and Bennett to command the [[III Corps (Australia)|III Corps]] in Western Australia. Vasey became Deputy Chief of the General Staff (DCGS), while Herring took over Northern Territory Force, and Robertson became commander of the [[1st Armoured Division (Australia)|1st Armoured Division]].{{sfn|McCarthy|1959|pp=24–27}}{{sfn|Horner|1978|p=299}} Blamey's Allied Land Forces Headquarters (LHQ) was established in Melbourne, but after MacArthur's General Headquarters (GHQ) moved to Brisbane in July 1942, Blamey established an Advanced LHQ in [[St Lucia, Queensland]].{{sfn|Long|1963|p=593}}

The Allied command structure was soon put under strain by Australian reverses in the [[Kokoda Track Campaign]]. MacArthur was highly critical of the Australian performance, and confided to the [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army]], General [[George Marshall]], that &quot;The Australians have proven themselves unable to match the enemy in jungle fighting. Aggressive leadership is lacking.&quot;{{sfn|McCarthy|1959|p=225}}  MacArthur told Curtin that Blamey should be sent up to New Guinea to take personal command of the situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Note of Secraphone Conversation between MacArthur and Curtin |url=http://www.info.dfat.gov.au/info/historical/HistDocs.nsf/(LookupVolNoNumber)/6~47 |accessdate=2 February 2009 |publisher=[[Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Australia)]]
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Curtin later confessed that &quot;in my ignorance (of military matters) I thought that the Commander in Chief should be in New Guinea.&quot;{{sfn|Horner|1998|p=327}} [[Jack Beasley]] suggested that Blamey would make a convenient scapegoat: &quot;[[Port Moresby|Moresby]] is going to fall. Send Blamey up there and let him fall with it!&quot;{{sfn|Horner|1998|p=327}}

[[File:Blamey and Eichelberger.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Blamey and Lieutenant General [[Robert L. Eichelberger]].|alt=Two men in uniforms, without ties. One wears a garrison cap while the other wears a slouch hat.]]
Blamey felt he had no choice,{{sfn|Hetherington|1973|p=239}} but his assumption of command of New Guinea Force sat uneasily with Rowell, the commander of I Corps there, who saw it as displaying a lack of confidence in him. A petulant Rowell would not be mollified, and, after a series of disagreements, Blamey relieved Rowell of his command, replacing him with Herring.{{sfn|Horner|1998|pp=329–332}} More reliefs followed. Herring relieved Brigadier [[Arnold Potts]] of the [[21st Brigade (Australia)|21st Infantry Brigade]], replacing him with Brigadier [[Ivan Dougherty]] on 22 October. Five days later, Blamey replaced Allen as the 7th Division's commander with Vasey.{{sfn|Horner|1998|pp=347–352}} Nor were generals the only ones to be removed. Blamey cancelled [[Chester Wilmot]]'s accreditation as a [[war correspondent]] in October 1939 for spreading a false rumour that Blamey was taking payments from the laundry contractor at [[Puckapunyal]].{{sfn|Horner|1998|p=134}} Wilmot had later been reinstated, but on 1 November 1942, Blamey again terminated Wilmot's accreditation, this time for good.{{sfn|Hetherington|1973|pp=401–403}} 

Blamey made a controversial speech to the 21st Infantry Brigade on 9 November 1942. According to the official historian, [[Dudley McCarthy]]:{{quote|[Blamey] said that the Jap was like a gorilla; he would get into a hole and he would not surrender; while in his hole and protected by it he would kill; to be dealt with he had to be got out of his holes and put on the run. Blamey added that it was like shooting rabbits: while the rabbits were in their burrows they could not be shot; they had to be got on the run and then the man with the gun could get them. &quot;It never entered my head as I stood there on parade that the general had any idea he was being offensive, or that he intended to be so&quot;, wrote Brigadier Dougherty (then a newcomer to the brigade) afterwards. &quot;But the brigade gave to what he said the interpretation that 'they ran like rabbits'. This interpretation of what he said spread throughout New Guinea and indeed back home, and resulted in bitter feelings. Following his address to the whole brigade [General Blamey] addressed the officers separately. He was direct with them and said that a few officers in the brigade had failed. This caused bitterness. But after both addresses Blamey told me that he thought highly of the brigade, and repeated to me what he had told the whole brigade—that I, as their new brigade commander, would be very proud of them.&quot;{{sfn|McCarthy|1959|pp=334–335}} }}
The implication of cowardice was seen as contrasting with his own inability to stand up to MacArthur and the Prime Minister. Rowell felt that Blamey &quot;had not shown the necessary 'moral courage' to fight the Cabinet on an issue of confidence in me.&quot;{{sfn|Horner|1998|p=328}} However, when American troops suffered serious reverses in the [[Battle of Buna-Gona]], Blamey turned the tables on MacArthur and &quot;frankly said he would rather send in more Australians, as he knew they would fight... a bitter pill for MacArthur to swallow&quot;.{{sfn|Kenney|1949|p=151}} In January 1943, Blamey visited the Buna-Gona battlefield, surprising Vasey at how far forward he went, seemingly unconcerned about his safety. Blamey was impressed by the strength of the Japanese fortifications that had been captured, later telling correspondents that Australian and American troops had performed miracles.{{sfn|Horner|1998|pp=380–381}}

At the [[Battle of Wau]] in January 1943, Blamey won the battle by acting decisively on intelligence, shifting the 17th Infantry Brigade from [[Milne Bay]] in time to defeat the Japanese attack.{{sfn|Horner|1998|p=384}} The official historian, Dudley McCarthy, later wrote:
{{quote|At the very peak of this leadership development was General Blamey himself. His greatness was demonstrated almost daily by a knowledge unparalleled in Australia of how an army should be formed and put to work; by his exercise of the vital field command at the same time as he kept within his grasp a vastly detailed control of the Australian Army as a whole; by his sagacity and strength in meeting the rapidly changing demands of a difficult political situation; by his ability speedily to encompass the requirements of the new war and plan far ahead of the events of the day as he controlled them; by his generally unappreciated humanity.{{sfn|McCarthy|1959|p=591}}}}

For the Papuan Campaign, MacArthur awarded Blamey the American [[Distinguished Service Cross (United States)|Distinguished Service Cross]],{{sfn|MacArthur|1964|p=165}} and Blamey was created a [[Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire]]  on 28 May 1943.&lt;ref name=&quot;GBE&quot;&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=36031|supp=yes|startpage=2373|date=25 May 1943|accessdate=31 January 2008}} Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire.&lt;/ref&gt; This was unusual as it was the [[Australian Labor Party]]'s policy not to award knighthoods. Blamey's and Herring's knighthoods would be the last that the Labor government would award to Australian soldiers.{{sfn|Hetherington|1973|p=202}}

===New Guinea Campaign===
The relationship between MacArthur and Blamey was generally good, and they had great respect for each other's abilities. MacArthur's main objection was that as Commander in Chief AMF as well as Commander Allied Land Forces, Blamey was not wholly under his command.{{sfn|Horner|1998|pp=389–390}} Official Historian [[Gavin Long]] argued that:{{quote|Nothing substantial would have been gained by this arrangement and much would have been lost: notably the existence of a single commander who could advise the Australian Government on all the problems of its army and be answerable to that Government for the manner in which it was employed both at home and in the field.{{sfn|Long|1963|p=599}}}}

The next operation was MacArthur's [[Operation Cartwheel]], an advance on the major Japanese base at Rabaul. The Australian Army was tasked with the capture of the [[Huon Peninsula]]. Blamey was ordered to again assume personal command of New Guinea Force. His concept, which he developed with Herring and [[Frank Berryman]], who had replaced Vasey as DCGS, was to draw the Japanese forces away from Lae with a demonstration against [[Salamaua]], and then capture [[Lae]] with a double envelopment. Blamey remained a devotee of new technology. His plan called for the use of the landing craft of the [[2nd Engineer Special Brigade]], and he intended to cross the [[Markham River]] with the aid of paratroops.{{sfn|Horner|1998|pp=407–409}} Supplies would be brought across the river using [[DUKW]]s, a relatively new invention.{{sfn|Mallett|2007|p=18}} He also attempted to acquire helicopters, but met resistance from the RAAF, and they were never delivered.{{sfn|Mallett|2007|p=318}} MacArthur accepted a number of changes that Blamey made to his strategy, probably the most notable of which was putting the [[New Britain campaign|landing on New Britain]] before Blamey's attack on [[Madang]].{{sfn|Horner|1998|pp=407–409}}

The campaign started well; Lae was captured well ahead of schedule. Blamey then handed over command of New Guinea Force to Mackay and returned to Australia. The 7th Division then [[Finisterre Range campaign|advanced through the Ramu Valley]] while the 9th Division [[Battle of Finschhafen|landed at Finschhafen]]. The campaign then slowed owing to a combination of logistical difficulties and Japanese resistance. Blamey responded to a request from Mackay to relieve Herring, whose chief of staff had been killed in an aircraft accident. He immediately sent Morshead.{{sfn|Horner|1998|pp=420–425}} In February 1944 there was criticism in Parliament of the way that Blamey had &quot;side tracked&quot; various generals; the names of Bennett, Rowell, Mackay, Wynter, Herring, Lavarack, Robertson, Morshead and Clowes were mentioned.{{sfn|Long|1963|p=57}} Blamey responded, {{quote|We had twelve divisions to fight the Jap. On arrival of other equipment, other considerations came in and we now have six divisions. Can you tell me what should have been done with the surplus generals? I do know that on every occasion I proposed to terminate a general's appointment, politicians have tried to stop it.{{sfn|Long|1963|p=70}} }}

Blamey could only reply that the Australian Army had one general for 15,741 men and women compared to one per 9,090 in the British Army.{{sfn|Long|1963|pp=600–602}}

Blamey was annoyed by the media campaign run against him by [[William Dunstan]] and [[Keith Murdoch]] of the ''[[The Herald and Weekly Times Ltd|The Herald and Weekly Times]]'' newspaper group, but success in New Guinea led to a change of heart at the newspaper, and Blamey even accepted a dinner invitation from Murdoch in 1944.{{sfn|Hetherington|1973|pp=322–324}} There was another victory, though, far more significant. The Army had taken heavy casualties from [[malaria]] in the fighting in 1942. Blamey took the advice of [[Edward Ford (physician)|Edward Ford]] and [[Neil Hamilton Fairley]], and strongly backed their ultimately successful efforts to control the disease. To acquaint himself with the issues, Blamey read through ''Manson's Tropical Diseases'', the standard medical textbook on the subject.{{sfn|Hetherington|1973|pp=275–277}}  Blamey also promoted the work of [[Howard Florey]] on the development of [[penicillin]], and wrote to Curtin urging that £200,000 be earmarked for Florey's vision of a national institute for medical research in Canberra, which ultimately became the [[John Curtin School of Medical Research]].{{sfn|Hetherington|1973|pp=347–349}}

Blamey was involved in discussions with the government over the size of the Army to be maintained. Now that the danger of invasion of Australia had passed, the government reconsidered how the nation's resources, particularly of manpower, should be distributed. Blamey pressed for a commitment to maintain three AIF divisions, as only they could legally be sent north of the equator where the final campaigns would be fought. He urged that the [[Empire Air Training Scheme]] be curtailed, and opposed MacArthur's proposal to use the Australian Army primarily for logistic support and leave combat roles principally to American troops.{{sfn|Horner|1998|pp=404–406, 425–428}}

===Final campaigns===
[[File:Japanese-surrender-mac-arthur-speaking-ac02716.jpg|thumb|left|300px|upright|Blamey (front row, third from left) stands behind MacArthur at the Japanese surrender. Blamey signed the document on behalf of Australia.|alt=A man in a khaki uniform stands a microphone, reading from papers in his hand. A line of men in smart uniforms stands at attention behind him.]]
On 5 April 1944, Blamey departed for San Francisco on board [[SS Lurline|USS ''Lurline'']] for the first leg of a voyage to attend the 1944 [[Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference]] in London as part of Curtin's party. The journey was made by sea and rail due to Curtin's fear of flying. Also on board the ship were American military personnel returning to the United States, and some 40 Australian war brides.{{sfn|Horner|1998|pp=448–449}} Blamey &quot;was always attractive to women and attracted by them. Advancing years had not reduced either his taste for amorous adventures or his capacity to enjoy them&quot;,{{sfn|Hetherington|1973|p=116}} and he brought with him several cases of spirits. The rowdy goings-on in Blamey's cabin did not endear him to the Prime Minister, who was a reformed alcoholic. The party travelled by train to Washington, DC, where Blamey was warmly greeted by the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]], and briefed the [[Combined Chiefs of Staff]] on the progress of the war in SWPA.{{sfn|Horner|1998|pp=448–449}} In London Blamey had a series of meetings with the [[Chief of the Imperial General Staff]], Field Marshal Sir [[Alan Brooke]], and was briefed on [[Operation Overlord]] by General Sir [[Bernard Montgomery]] and [[Air Chief Marshal]] Sir [[Arthur Tedder]]. Blamey was disappointed to have to turn down an offer to accompany the invasion as a guest of General [[Dwight Eisenhower]] because Curtin feared that the invasion would lead to retaliatory German bombing, and wanted to be far away before it started.{{sfn|Hetherington|1973|pp=333–335}}{{sfn|Horner|1998|pp=458–459}}

As a matter of policy, Curtin wanted Australian forces to be involved in liberating New Guinea. MacArthur therefore proposed that Australian troops relieve the American garrisons on [[New Britain Campaign|New Britain]], [[Bougainville Campaign|Bougainville]] and [[Aitape-Wewak campaign|New Guinea]]. However, MacArthur baulked at Blamey's proposal to replace the seven American divisions with just seven Australian brigades, resulting in the 6th Division being employed as well. The larger garrisons permitted offensive operations, and demanded them if the 6th Division was to be freed for employment elsewhere.{{sfn|Long|1963|pp=20–23}} These operations aroused considerable criticism on the grounds that they were unnecessary, that the troops should have been employed elsewhere, and that the Army's equipment and logistics were inadequate. Blamey vigorously defended his aggressive policy to reduce the bypassed Japanese garrisons and free the civilian population, but some felt that he went too far in putting his case publicly in a national radio broadcast. He was also criticised for not spending enough time in forward areas, although he spent more than half his time outside Australia in 1944, and between April 1944 and April 1945 travelled {{convert|65000|mi}} by air,  {{convert|7000|mi}} by sea and  {{convert|7500|mi}} by land.{{sfn|Long|1963|pp=58–61}} Blamey urged that the 7th Division not be sent to [[Battle of Balikpapan (1945)|Balikpapan]], an operation that he regarded as unnecessary. On this occasion, he was not supported by the government, and the operation went ahead as planned.{{sfn|Long|1963|p=65}}

Gavin Long wrote: {{quote|Some of the reasons for Blamey's lack of popularity with several of the Ministers and part of the public can probably be discovered only by exploring traits in the Australian national character of those days; other reasons are easier to unearth. Throughout the war Blamey commanded an army whose senior appointments were shared between regular and citizen officers. In some places this created tensions and rivalry which adversely affected Blamey's reputation, through no fault of his own; also the ambiguous relationship between his headquarters and MacArthur's led to disagreements of which at least the Ministers were aware. A man of greater tact, however, could have managed these problems more smoothly. But Blamey was not a man of great tact.{{sfn|Long|1963|p=586}} }}

On 2 September 1945, Blamey was with MacArthur on {{USS|Missouri|BB-63|6}} and signed the Japanese surrender document on behalf of Australia. He then flew to [[Morotai]] and personally accepted the surrender of the remaining Japanese in the South West Pacific.{{sfn|Hetherington|1973|pp=374–375}} He insisted that Australia should be represented in the [[Allied occupation of Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=39202|supp=yes|startpage=2153|endpage=2154|date=13 April 1951|accessdate=31 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==After the war==
[[File:Field Marshal Blamey.jpg|thumb|right|The Governor General, Rt Hon [[William McKell]], presents Blamey with his field marshal's baton in a bedside ceremony at [[Heidelberg Repatriation Hospital]]|alt=A man lies in a hospital bed, incongruously wearing an Army uniform instead of pajamas.

MacArthur abolished SWPA on 2 September 1945, and on 15 September Blamey offered to resign. The war was over, and the post of Commander in Chief was now a purely administrative one. His offer was not accepted, but on 14 November, the government abruptly announced that it had accepted his resignation, effective 30 November. A farewell party was held in Melbourne, which was attended by 66 brigadiers and generals. Blamey was given time to write up his despatches, and was formally retired on 31 January 1946.{{sfn|Horner|1998|pp=557–561}} Forde asked Blamey if he wanted anything in way of recognition for his services, and Blamey asked for knighthoods for his generals, but Forde could not arrange this. In the end, Forde decided to gift Blamey the Buick staff car he had used during the war, which had clocked up {{convert|50000|mi}} in the Middle East and the South West Pacific.{{sfn|Hetherington|1973|p=380}}

Blamey returned to Melbourne, where he devoted himself to business affairs, to writing, and to promoting the welfare of ex-service personnel.{{sfn|Hetherington|1973|pp=388–389}} In September 1948, Blamey paid a visit to Japan, where he was warmly greeted on arrival at [[Iwakuni]] by Horace Robertson, the commander of the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]], who also provided an RAAF honour guard. MacArthur sent his own aircraft, the ''Bataan'', to collect Blamey and bring him to Tokyo, where he met Blamey at the airport and gave him another warm greeting.{{sfn|Hetherington|1973|p=393}} In the late 1940s Blamey became involved with The Association, an organisation similar to the earlier League of National Security, which was established to counter a possible communist coup. He was the head of the organisation until ill health forced him to stand down in favour of Morshead in 1950.{{sfn|Hetherington|1973|pp=389–392}}

Menzies became prime minister again in December 1949, and he resolved that Blamey should be promoted to the rank of field marshal, something that had been mooted in 1945.{{sfn|Horner|1998|p=579}} The recommendation went via the [[Governor General]], [[William McKell]], to the War Office in London, which replied that a [[dominion]] officer could not be promoted to the rank. Menzies pointed out that [[Jan Smuts]] already had. The War Office then claimed that Blamey could not be promoted to field marshal because he was a retired officer, which was not true. Menzies then restored Blamey to active duty.{{sfn|Hetherington|1973|pp=393–394}} Blamey was duly promoted to field marshal in the King's Birthday Honours of 8 June 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette |issue=38930 |supp=yes |startpage=2811| date=2 June 1950| accessdate=31 January 2008}} Field Marshal.&lt;/ref&gt;

A few days afterwards, Blamey became seriously ill and was forced to receive his field marshal's baton from McKell in a bedside ceremony at the [[Heidelberg Repatriation Hospital]]. Blamey died there of hypertensive [[cerebral haemorrhage]] on 27 May 1951. His body lay in state at the [[Shrine of Remembrance]], where 20,000 people filed past.{{sfn|Hetherington|1973|pp=394–399}} Crowds estimated at 300,000 lined the streets of Melbourne at his state funeral. Ten of his lieutenant generals served as pallbearers: Frank Berryman, William Bridgeford, Edmund Herring, Iven Mackay, Leslie Morshead, [[John Northcott]], Sydney Rowell, Stanley Savige, [[Vernon Sturdee]] and [[Henry Wells (general)|Henry Wells]]. His body was cremated at the [[Fawkner Crematorium and Memorial Park]].{{sfn|Horner|1998|pp=581–582}}

==Legacy==

Blamey is honoured in Australia in various ways, including a square named after him which is situated outside the [[Russell Offices]] headquarters of the [[Australian Defence Force]] and [[Department of Defence (Australia)|Department of Defence]] in the national capital, [[Canberra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.defence.gov.au/media/SpeechTpl.cfm?CurrentId=926 |accessdate=29 October 2011 |title=The Blamey Oration &amp;mdash; Australians |publisher=[[Department of Defence (Australia)|Department of Defence]] |last=Hawke |first=Allan |authorlink=Allan Hawke |date=25 May 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A statue of Blamey stands in [[Kings Domain, Melbourne]], on the corner of Government House Drive and Birdwood Avenue, opposite that of John Monash.
