'''Henry William &quot;Harry&quot; Murray''' [[Victoria Cross|VC]], [[Order of St Michael and St George|CMG]], [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]] &amp; [[medal bar|Bar]], [[Distinguished Conduct Medal|DCM]] (1 December 1880 &amp;ndash; 7 January 1966) was an [[List of Australian Victoria Cross recipients|Australian recipient]] of the [[Victoria Cross]], the highest decoration for gallantry &quot;in the face of the enemy&quot; that can be awarded to members of the British and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] armed forces. Decorated several times throughout his service in the [[First World War]], Murray rose from the rank of [[Private (rank)|private]] to [[lieutenant colonel]] in three-and-a-half years. He is often described as the most highly decorated infantry soldier of the [[British Empire]] during the First World War.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Franki|Slatyer|2003|p=181.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Born in [[Tasmania]], Murray worked as a farmer, courier and timber cutter before enlisting in September 1914. Assigned to a machine gun crew, he served during the [[Gallipoli Campaign]], where he was awarded the [[Distinguished Conduct Medal]] before the withdrawal from the peninsula. He was later transferred along with the rest of his battalion to France for service on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]], where he was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Order]] during the [[Battle of the Somme (1916)|Battle of the Somme]]. In February 1917, Murray commanded a company during the battalion's attack on the German position of Stormy Trench. During the engagement, the company was able to capture the position and repulse three fierce counter-attacks, with Murray often leading bayonet and bombing charges himself. For his actions during the battle, Murray was awarded the Victoria Cross. Soon after his Victoria Cross action, he was promoted to [[major]] and earned a [[medal bar|Bar]] to his Distinguished Service Order during an attack on the [[Hindenburg Line]] near [[Bullecourt]]. Promoted to lieutenant colonel in early 1918, he assumed command of the 4th Machine Gun Battalion, where he would remain until the end of the war.

Returning to Australia in 1920, Murray eventually settled in Queensland, where he purchased the grazing farm that would be his home for the remainder of his life. Re-enlisting for service in the [[Second World War]], he was appointed as commanding officer of the [[26th Battalion (Australia)|26th (Militia) Battalion]]. Taking his discharge in 1944, Murray returned to his farm and died in 1966 at the age of 85.

==Early life==
Murray was born at Clairville, near [[Evandale, Tasmania|Evandale]], [[Tasmania]], on 1 December 1880,&lt;ref&gt;Note: There has been much confusion over Murray's date of birth, which seems to have been caused by the man himself. Most publications claim his birth as 1 December 1884, which is the date he placed on his enlistment forms for the First World War and supplied to historian [[C. E. W. Bean]]. Upon his enlistment for the Second World War, he gave his year of birth as 1885, and also placed differing years on his marriage certificates and the birth certificates for his children. However, according to {{Harvnb|Franki|Slatyer|2003|p=1}} his birth certificate states 1 December 1880.&lt;/ref&gt; the eighth of nine children of Edward Kennedy Murray, a farmer, and his wife Clarissa, n√©e Littler. Descended from convicts on his father's side, Murray was baptised on 23 November 1885, and attended Evandale State School. When he was fourteen years of age, his parents withdrew him from school to work on the family farm. However, his mother continued his education, placing emphasis on English.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Franki|Slatyer|2003|pp=4&amp;ndash;6.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family later moved to Northcote, near [[St Leonards, Tasmania|St. Leonards]], where Edward Murray died in 1904.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Franki|Slatyer|2003|p=184.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harry Murray joined the Launceston Volunteer Artillery Corps in 1902, serving until 1908, when he migrated to Western Australia where his two older brothers had previously settled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Franki|Slatyer|2003|p=6.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Murray initially worked on his brother's wheat farm, before becoming a courier for a mining company at [[Kookynie, Western Australia|Kookynie]], transporting gold and mail by either bicycle or on horseback. He travelled the same track on a fortnightly basis, gaining a reputation for being a crack shot with a .32&amp;nbsp;carbine that he carried.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Franki|Slatyer|2003|p=7.}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of his enlistment in 1914, Murray was working near [[Manjimup, Western Australia|Manjimup]], in the south west of Western Australia, employing [[lumberjack|timber cutters]] for the [[Western Australian Government Railways|railways]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AWM&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/people/863.asp|title=Lieutenant Colonel Henry William (Harry) Murray, VC, CMG, DSO &amp; bar, DCM|work=Who's who in Australian Military History|accessdate=6 August 2008|publisher=Australian War Memorial}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==First World War==
===Enlistment and training===
Murray enlisted in the [[First Australian Imperial Force|Australian Imperial Force]] (AIF) in Perth on 30 September 1914. He declined the offer of a commission,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Franki|Slatyer|2003|p=8.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was posted as a [[Private (rank)|private]] to A Company of the newly formed [[16th Battalion, Royal Western Australia Regiment|16th Battalion]], [[4th Brigade (Australia)|4th Brigade]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/awm8/23_33_1/pdf/0015.pdf|title=16 Infantry Battalion|accessdate=6 August 2008|format=PDF|work=First World War Embarkation Roll|publisher=Australian War Memorial}}&lt;/ref&gt; Appointed to one of the unit's two machine gun crews, he was sent to [[Blackboy Hill Training Camp|Blackboy Hill Camp]] for training, where he became the gun No.&amp;nbsp;2, whose job it was to feed ammunition belts through the gun; [[Percy Black]] was No.&amp;nbsp;1 and the pair soon became firm friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Franki|Slatyer|2003|pp=9&amp;ndash;11.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 November, the battalion entrained for [[Fremantle, Western Australia|Fremantle]], boarding troopships headed for [[Melbourne]]; it was there that the four battalions combined to form the 4th Brigade under the command of Colonel [[John Monash]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Franki|Slatyer|2003|pp=11&amp;ndash;12.}}&lt;/ref&gt; After completing their basic training in [[Victoria, Australia|Victoria]], the brigade left Port Melbourne aboard Troopship A40, ''Ceramic'' on 26 December. After a brief stop at [[Albany, Western Australia|Albany]], Western Australia, they arrived in [[Egypt]] in early February 1915. The brigade marched from [[Alexandria]] to [[Heliopolis (Cairo suburb)|Heliopolis]] as part of the [[New Zealand and Australian Division]] of Major General [[Alexander Godley]].&lt;ref name=&quot;16th&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/units/unit_11203.asp|title=16th Battalion|work=Australian military units|accessdate=6 August 2008|publisher=Australian War Memorial}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gallipoli===
The [[Allies (World War I)|Allied]] commanders planned to defeat [[Turkey]] and force a supply route through to Russia via the [[Bosporus]] and the [[Black Sea]]. As such they planned a land invasion on the [[Gallipoli Peninsula]]. On the afternoon of 25 April 1915, Murray's 16th Battalion landed at Ari Burnu, [[Gallipoli]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Franki|Slatyer|2003|p=17.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Setting their machine gun on Pope's Hill, Black and Murray fired their gun throughout the afternoon and into the night.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Franki|Slatyer|2003|p=19.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, the battalion's two machine gun crews sniped at the Turkish soldiers on Russell's Top, and Murray and his gunner continued fighting during the counterattack on 26&amp;ndash;27 April, despite being wounded.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;&gt;{{Australian Dictionary of Biography|last=Lincoln|first=Merrilyn|year=1986|id=A100626b|title=Murray, Henry William (1880 &amp;ndash; 1966)|accessdate=6 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Promoted to [[lance corporal]] on 12 May,&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Murray was evacuated to Egypt eighteen days later, due to a gunshot wound to his right knee. His knee soon stiffened and he was posted to a hospital ship set to return to Australia. Murray, however, had other ideas and made his way to the wharf at Alexandria where he boarded a transport bound for Gallipoli.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Macklin|2008|pp=64&amp;ndash;65.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arriving at the peninsula on 3 July, both Murray and Black received the [[Distinguished Conduct Medal]] for their actions between 9&amp;ndash;31 May,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Franki|Slatyer|2003|pp=28&amp;ndash;29.}}&lt;/ref&gt; during which time they tirelessly manned their machine gun, &quot;inflict[ing] serious losses upon the enemy&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/awm28/2/311/0018.pdf|title=Recommendation for H Murray to be awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal|work=Recommendations: First World War|accessdate=6 September 2008|format=PDF|publisher=Australian War Memorial}}&lt;/ref&gt; Murray was again wounded on 8 August when the machine gun section of the 4th Brigade covered the withdrawal after the attack on Hill 971. On 13 August, he was promoted to [[sergeant]], commissioned as a [[second lieutenant]] and transferred to the [[13th Battalion (Australia)|13th Battalion]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;

Murray was again evacuated to Egypt on 26 September due to [[dysentery]]. After nearly six weeks in the 2nd Australian General Hospital at Ghezireh, he rejoined the 13th Battalion at Gallipoli on 7 December, before leaving for the last time in the Allied evacuation later that month.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Franki|Slatyer|2003|pp=38&amp;ndash;42.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Returning to Egypt, the AIF expanded and was reorganised; the 13th Battalion was split and provided experienced soldiers for the 45th Battalion, while the 4th Brigade was combined with the 12th and 13th Brigades to form the [[4th Australian Division]].&lt;ref name=&quot;13th&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/units/unit_11200.asp|title=13th Battalion|work=Australian military units|accessdate=6 August 2008|publisher=Australian War Memorial}}&lt;/ref&gt; Murray was promoted to [[lieutenant]] on 20 January 1916, and then to [[Captain (land)|captain]] on 1 March.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;

===Western Front: June 1916 to April 1917===
On 1 June 1916, the 13th Battalion embarked at [[Alexandria]] for [[Marseilles]], France, before being deployed to the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]. In mid-June, the battalion moved into trenches at Bois Grenier near [[Armentieres]], and on 13 July they relocated to [[Bailleul, Somme|Bailleul]], in time for the [[Battle of the Somme (1916)|Battle of the Somme]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Franki|Slatyer|2003|pp=49&amp;ndash;53.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 August, Murray commanded A Company&amp;mdash;which consisted of fewer than one hundred men&amp;mdash;in a successful attack that captured [[Battle of Mouquet Farm|Mouquet Farm]] under heavy fire. His men repelled four German counterattacks before he ordered them to withdraw. He remained in command until the next morning, when he fainted from loss of blood from two wounds he had sustained during the action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/awm28/2/406/0017.pdf|title=Recommendation for Henry William Murray to be awarded a Distinguished Service Order|work=Recommendations: First World War|accessdate=6 August 2008|format=PDF|publisher=Australian War Memorial}}&lt;/ref&gt; Murray was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Order]] for his service during the action, an event that was published in a supplement of the ''[[London Gazette]]'' dated 14 November 1916.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=29824|date=14 November 1916|startpage=11043|supp=yes|accessdate=6 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was later evacuated to England aboard the hospital ship ''Asturias'', and admitted to the 4th General Hospital, London, where he was to share a ward with [[Albert Jacka]] and Percy Black, who were recovering from wounds received at Pozi√©res and Mouquet Farm respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Franki|Slatyer|2003|p=67.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Macklin|2008|p=68.}}&lt;/ref&gt; After nearly six weeks of recuperation, he returned to the 13th Battalion in France on 19 October.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Franki|Slatyer|2003|p=69.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a period of patrols and trench raids, the 13th was relieved by the 5th Battalion on 6 December, and marched back to Ribemont, where Murray was granted leave to England. On 4 January 1917, he was [[Mentioned in Despatches]].&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=29890|date=4 January 1917|startpage=255|supp=yes|accessdate=6 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The battalion returned to the front in February, relieving the 15th Battalion at Gueudecourt. On 4 February, the battalion's commanding officer received the order to attack Stormy Trench; it was during this action that Murray would earn his [[Victoria Cross]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Franki|Slatyer|2003|pp=73&amp;ndash;75.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the night of 4&amp;ndash;5 February 1917, the 13th Battalion&amp;mdash;with Murray commanding A Company&amp;mdash;attacked the German position at Stormy Trench. Preceded by a heavy artillery barrage,&lt;ref name=&quot;VCs&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Gliddon|2000|p=5.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Company seized the right of the position after overcoming stiff resistance,&lt;ref name=&quot;AF&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Staunton|2005|p=67.}}&lt;/ref&gt; consolidating their gains by setting up a makeshift barricade.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; The Germans counterattacked, prompting Murray to send an SOS signal to the artillery officer, calling for more support. Although repulsed, the Germans counterattacked twice more. On the third attack, Murray organised a twenty-man grenade bombing party and led them in a charge against their attackers, pushing them back to their original start line.&lt;ref name=&quot;VCs&quot;/&gt; On another occasion when the company lost some ground, Murray rallied his men and retook it. Between midnight and 03:00, the company maintained spasmodic bombing, repelling further assaults with the aid of artillery support. By 20:00 on 5 February, the 16th Battalion relieved Murray's company, which had only 48 survivors from the 140 who had begun the attack.&lt;ref name=&quot;AF&quot;/&gt;

The full citation for Murray's Victoria Cross appeared in a supplement to the ''London Gazette'' on 10 March 1917, reading:&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=29978|date=10 March 1917|startpage=2451|supp=yes|accessdate=6 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|''War Office, 10th&amp;nbsp;March, 1917''

His Majesty the KING has been graciously pleased to approve of the award of the Victoria Cross to the undermentioned Officer and Non-Commissioned Officer: -

Capt. Henry William Murray, D.S.O., Aus. infy.

For most conspicuous bravery when in command of the right flank company in attack. He led his company to the assault with great skill and courage, and the position was quickly captured. Fighting of a very severe nature followed, and three heavy counter-attacks were beaten back, these successes being due to Captain Murray's wonderful work.

Throughout the night his company suffered heavy casualties through concentrated enemy shell fire, and on one occasion gave ground for a short way. This gallant officer rallied his command and saved the situation by sheer valour.

He made his presence felt throughout the line, encouraging his men, heading bombing parties, leading bayonet charges, and carrying wounded to places of safety.

His magnificent example inspired his men throughout.}}

In April 1917, the battalion relocated to [[Bullecourt]] in preparation for an attack on the [[Hindenburg Line]]. On the night of 11 April, seven battalions of the [[4th Australian Division]] assembled for the advance,&lt;ref name=&quot;AF&quot;/&gt; which was launched at 04:30.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Franki|Slatyer|2003|p=94.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Murray's company seized a section of German trench, but were quickly isolated.&lt;ref name=&quot;AF&quot;/&gt; By 07:00, ammunition was running low and casualties were high. Murray sent for artillery support, but conflicting messages meant that it was not provided, so the Australians were forced to withdraw.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gliddon|2000|p=7.}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the action, the 4th Division lost 2,339 of the 3,000 men that it had committed, with 1170 captured as prisoners of war.&lt;ref name=&quot;AF2&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Staunton|2005|p=68.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the dead was Percy Black, who had been killed while trying to find a gap in the barbwire surrounding the German trenches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Macklin|2008|p=77.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Murray was awarded a [[Medal bar|Bar]] to his Distinguished Service Order for his efforts during the battle,&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=30135|date=18 June 1917|startpage=5980|supp=yes|accessdate=7 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was promoted to temporary [[major]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gliddon|2000|p=8.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was later informed by General [[William Birdwood, 1st Baron Birdwood|Birdwood]] that had the attack at Bullecourt been successful, he would have instead been awarded a Bar to his Victoria Cross.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Franki|Slatyer|2003|p=104.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Western Front, April 1917 to repatriation, March 1920===
After Bullecourt, the 4th Brigade withdrew to Ribemont, where reinforcements brought it up to strength. During this period, Murray oversaw musketry training before being granted convalescent leave to London in May. While in the capital, he was decorated with his Victoria Cross and Distinguished Service Order by [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]] in [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] on 2 June 1917.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Franki|Slatyer|2003|pp=109&amp;ndash;113.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Promoted major on 12 July, he rejoined his battalion later in the month, and during the 4th Brigade's advance to the Hindenburg Line over subsequent months, was involved in actions at [[Battle of Messines|Messines]], Ploegstreert Wood, Menin Road, [[Battle of Polygon Wood|Polygon Wood]], Broodseinde, Poelcappelle and [[Battle of Passchendaele|Passchendaele]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Franki|Slatyer|2003|pp=116&amp;ndash;119.}}&lt;/ref&gt; For his actions at Passchendaele, Murray garnered a mention in [[Field Marshal]] [[Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig|Sir Douglas Haig's]] dispatch of 7 November 1917.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=30448|date=28 December 1917|startpage=13566|supp=yes|accessdate=7 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Passchendaele, the 4th Brigade spent three months in reserve. Murray became second in command of the 13th Battalion, frequently assuming temporary command of the unit while the commanding officer was absent. Granted leave to Paris from 12 January to 2 February 1918,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Franki|Slatyer|2003|pp=121&amp;ndash;122.}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was promoted to temporary [[lieutenant colonel]] on 15 March and assumed command of the 4th Machine Gun Battalion.&lt;ref name=&quot;TL&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/people/timeLine_863.asp|title=Timeline of Lieutenant Colonel Henry William (Harry) Murray, VC, CMG, DSO &amp; bar, DCM|accessdate=7 August 2008|publisher=Australian War Memorial}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commanding the unit during the German [[Spring Offensive]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Franki|Slatyer|2003|pp=125&amp;ndash;129.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Murray's rank was confirmed on 24 May.&lt;ref name=&quot;TL&quot;/&gt;

On 25 June, Murray attended a conference at 4th Divisional Headquarters to discuss a proposed attack on [[Battle of Hamel|Hamel]]. Having submitted a plan for the use of machine guns in the battle, five extra sections were attached to Murray's battalion. The battle commenced on 4 July, and over the period of two days, the 4th Machine Gun Battalion fired 373,000 rounds of small arms ammunition, suffering 33 casualties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Franki|Slatyer|2003|pp=132&amp;ndash;133.}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 August, he attended another divisional conference regarding the planned attack near [[Battle of Amiens (1918)|Amiens]] scheduled for 8 August. Lieutenant General [[John Monash]]'s instructions called for several of the 4th Machine Gun Battalion's companies to be moved forward by [[Mark I tank#Mark V series|Mark V]] tanks, accompanying different units during the battle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Franki|Slatyer|2003|pp=139&amp;ndash;140.}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the three-day action, German General [[Erich Ludendorff]] described the Allied success as &quot;the black day of the German Army in this war&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;13th&quot;/&gt;

From 23 September to 3 October 1918, Murray was seconded to the Headquarters of the United States [[II Corps (United States)|II Corps]] as a liaison officer with the [[27th Infantry Division (United States)|27th Division]]. The 27th Division, along with the [[30th Infantry Division (United States)|30th Division]], had been attached to Lieutenant General Monash's Corps for the assault on the Bellicourt Tunnel of the Hindenburg Line.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Franki|Slatyer|2003|pp=142&amp;ndash;143.}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his service with the Americans, Murray was recommended for the United States' [[Distinguished Service Medal (United States)|Distinguished Service Medal]] by the commander of the 27th, Major General [[John F.

The battle alongside the Americans was Murray's last of the war, as the Australians were placed in reserve in early October before the signing of the [[Armistice]] on 11 November 1918.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Franki|Slatyer|2003|pp=142&amp;ndash;144.}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 January 1919, Murray was awarded the French [[Croix de guerre 1914‚Äì1918 (France)|Croix de Guerre]]&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=31109|date=7 January 1919|startpage=314|supp=yes|accessdate=7 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; for his service as commander of the 4th Machine Gun Battalion from 23 March to 24 April and 2&amp;ndash;7 August 1918.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/awm28/1/240P4/0023.pdf|format=PDF|title=Recommendation for Henry William Murray to be awarded a Croix de Guerre; France|work=Recommendations: First World War|accessdate=7 August 2008|publisher=Australian War Memorial}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 May 1919, he was awarded a [[Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George]]&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=31370|date=30 May 1919|startpage=6793|supp=yes|accessdate=7 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; for his command of the 4th Machine Gun Battalion, the recommendation of which particularly citing his success during attacks on the Hindenburg Line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/awm28/1/253/0029.pdf|title=Recommendation for Henry William Murray to be awarded a Companion of the Order of Saint Michael and Saint George|work=Recommendations: First World War|accessdate=6 September 2008|format=PDF|publisher=Australian War Memorial}}&lt;/ref&gt; Murray's final honour came on 11 July 1919, when he was [[Mentioned in Despatches]] for the fourth time,&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=31448|date=11 July 1919|startpage=8833|supp=yes|accessdate=7 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; having received his third mention on 31 December 1918.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=31089|date=31 December 1918|startpage=15229|supp=yes|accessdate=7 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From June to September 1919, Murray&amp;mdash;along with fellow Australian Victoria Cross recipient [[William Donovan Joynt]]&amp;mdash;led parties of AIF members on a tour of the farming districts of [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and Denmark to study agricultural methods under the education schemes.&lt;ref name=&quot;AF2&quot;/&gt; After touring through France and Belgium, he left England on 19 November 1919 aboard the Orient Line transport, ''Ormonde'', along with Generals Birdwood and Monash. A month later, a large crowd celebrated the arrival of the two generals and Murray at the docks in Fremantle. Attempting to evade further fanfare, Murray quietly travelled to northern Tasmania and then to his sister's house in Launceston.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Franki|Slatyer|2003|pp=150&amp;ndash;151.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was discharged from the AIF on 9 March 1920.&lt;ref name=&quot;TL&quot;/&gt;

==Later life==
After his discharge, Murray moved north, buying a grazing property in south-eastern [[Queensland]]. On 13 October 1921, he married estate agent Constance Sophia Cameron at [[Bollon, Queensland|Bollon]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; The marriage was an unhappy one, and the pair separated in 1925 when Murray went to New Zealand. On 11 November 1927, with Constance Murray as petitioner, a [[decree nisi]] with costs against Henry Murray was granted on the grounds of desertion. Nine days later, at the Auckland Registrar's Office, Murray married Ellen Perdon &quot;Nell&quot; Cameron; Constance's niece.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Franki|Slatyer|2003|p=155.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple returned to Queensland, and in April 1928 Murray bought Glenlyon station, [[Richmond, Queensland|Richmond]], a 74,000 acre (29,947 ha) grazing property, where he lived for the rest of his life.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;

The Murrays had two children. Their son Douglas, born in 1930, was named after Lieutenant Colonel Douglas Grey Marks, the commanding officer of the 13th Battalion from 1917 to 1918. In 1934, Nell gave birth to their second child, a girl named Clementine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Franki|Slatyer|2003|pp=156&amp;ndash;157.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1929 and 1939, Murray wrote fifteen articles for ''Reveille'', the magazine of the New South Wales branch of the [[Returned and Services League of Australia|Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League of Australia]] (RSL), detailing several of his experiences during the First World War, and praising several of his comrades.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Franki|Slatyer|2003|pp=161&amp;ndash;163.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 July 1939, with the [[Second World War]] looming, Murray volunteered for military service and was appointed as commanding officer of the [[26th Battalion (Australia)|26th (Militia) Battalion]], 11th Brigade, based in [[Townsville]]; he was mobilised for full-time service on 21 October 1941. Murray's second-in-command of the unit during this time was Major [[Edgar Towner]], who had additionally been decorated with the Victoria Cross in 1918.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Franki|Slatyer|2003|pp=164&amp;ndash;165.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 26th became an [[Second Australian Imperial Force|Australian Imperial Force]] unit in 1942, and in August Murray was removed from his post by General [[Thomas Blamey|Sir Thomas Blamey]], Commander in Chief Australian Military Forces, on the grounds of his advancing age. He was instead appointed to command the 23rd Queensland Regiment, Volunteer Defence Corps, which he led until his retirement from active duty on 8 February 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Franki|Slatyer|2003|pp=168&amp;ndash;169.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/script/veteran.asp?ServiceID=A&amp;VeteranID=371686|title=Murray, Henry William|accessdate=7 August 2008|work=World War II Nominal Roll|publisher=Commonwealth of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the outbreak of the [[Korean War]] in 1950, wool prices soared and Murray earned a large income from wool sales, allowing him to regularly travel across Australia. Taking a trip to [[Brisbane]] in 1954, he met [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] during her Royal Tour of Australia. Despite rarely attending [[Anzac Day]] services or functions for Victoria Cross recipients, Murray and his wife travelled to London in 1956 to commemorate the centenary of the Victoria Cross.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Franki|Slatyer|2003|pp=171&amp;ndash;173.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the ceremonies, the Murrays spent five weeks on a motor tour of England and Scotland, before visiting Switzerland and France. However, Murray refused to revisit the battlefields.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Franki|Slatyer|2003|p=177.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 January 1966, Nell was driving the family car with Harry as a passenger; they were going to the south coast of Queensland for a holiday. A tyre blew out and the car rolled on the [[Leichhardt Highway]] near [[Condamine, Queensland|Condamine]]. Murray was taken to Miles District Hospital with broken ribs. He had suffered heart trouble for some time, and the shock of the accident is believed to have caused his death the following day. Murray was interred at Mount Thompson Crematorium with full military honours after a funeral service at [[St. Andrew's Presbyterian Church, Brisbane|St. Andrew's Presbyterian Church]], Brisbane.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Franki|Slatyer|2003|p=178.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 February 2006 in Evandale, Tasmania, [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]] [[Michael Jeffery]] unveiled a statue of Murray by sculptor Peter Corlett. This tribute was facilitated by a small group of volunteers who raised [[Australian dollar|A$]]85,000 in two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defence.gov.au/news/armynews/editions/1138/topstories/story15.htm|title=Memorial Unveiled |accessdate=7 August 2008|author=Michael Harris|publisher=Army - The Soldier's Newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Henry Murray ward at [[Hollywood Private Hospital]] has been named in his honour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywood.ramsayhealth.com.au/default.aspx?id=141|title=A history of Caring|accessdate=5 March 2009|publisher=Hollywood Private Hospital}}&lt;/ref&gt;
