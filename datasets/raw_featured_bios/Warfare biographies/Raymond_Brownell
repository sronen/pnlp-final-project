[[Air Commodore]] '''Raymond James Brownell''' [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]], [[Military Cross|MC]], [[Military Medal|MM]] (17 May 1894 &amp;ndash; 12 April 1974) was a senior officer in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) and a [[First World War]] [[flying ace]]. Born in [[Hobart]], [[Tasmania]], Brownell was working as a clerk with a firm of accountants when he enlisted in the [[First Australian Imperial Force|Australian Imperial Force]] on the outbreak of the First World War. He served during the [[Gallipoli Campaign]] before transferring to the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]. Awarded the [[Military Medal]] for his actions during the [[Battle of Pozières]], he was accepted for a transfer to the [[Royal Flying Corps]] in 1917. Brownell undertook flight training in the [[United Kingdom]]. [[Officer (armed forces)|Commissioned]] as a [[second lieutenant]], he was posted for operational service over the Western Front in September 1917. Moving with his squadron to [[Italy]], he was awarded the [[Military Cross]] and credited with shooting down 12 aircraft by war's end. Taking his discharge in 1919, Brownell returned to Australia.

Commissioned in the Royal Australian Air Force during 1921, Brownell had risen to the rank of [[group captain]] by the beginning of the [[Second World War]]. Establishing the Royal Australian Air Force base in [[Singapore]], he returned to Australia in 1941 as an air commodore and was appointed to lead No. 1 Training Group. He was [[Air Officer Commanding]] Western Area from January 1943 until July 1945, when he took charge of the recently formed [[No. 11 Group RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;11 Group]] on [[Morotai]]. Retiring from the Air Force in 1947, Brownell assumed a partnership in a stockbroking firm. He died in 1974 at the age of 79; his autobiography, ''From Khaki to Blue'', was published posthumously.

==Early life==
Brownell was born in the Hobart suburb of [[New Town, Tasmania|New Town]], Tasmania, on 17 May 1894 to William Percival Brownell, a [[draper]], and his wife Julie Ann James (née Scott). Initially educated at [[Leslie House School]], Brownell later attended [[Scotch College, Melbourne]] where he was an active sportsman. On graduation, he was apprenticed to a firm of public accountants and auditors in Hobart.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;&gt;{{Australian Dictionary of Biography|last=Edmonds|first=Leigh|year=1993|id=A130318b|title=Brownell, Raymond James (1894 &amp;ndash; 1974)|accessdate=24 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; During 1912, Brownell enlisted in the [[Citizens Military Force]] and was posted to the 41st Battery, [[Royal Regiment of Australian Artillery|Australian Field Artillery]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ServRec&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://naa12.naa.gov.au/scripts/imagine.asp?B=3131872&amp;I=1&amp;SE=1|title=Brownell, Raymond James : SERN 2058|accessdate=24 March 2009|work=Records Search|publisher=National Archives of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==First World War==
===Australian Imperial Force===
On 12 September 1914, Brownell transferred to the Australian Imperial Force for service during the First World War.&lt;ref name=&quot;Embark&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/awm8/13_31_1/pdf/0473.pdf|title=Raymond James Brownell|accessdate=24 March 2009|format=PDF|work=First World War Embarkation Roll|publisher=Australian War Memorial}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AIF&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aif.adfa.edu.au:8080/showPerson?pid=36477|title=Raymond James Brownell|accessdate=24 March 2009|work=AIF Project|publisher=Australian Defence Force Academy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allotted to the 9th Battery, 3rd Field Artillery Brigade with the rank of [[Gunner (rank)|gunner]], Brownell embarked from Hobart aboard HMAT ''Geelong'' on 20 October, bound for [[Egypt]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Embark&quot;/&gt; On arrival, the unit spent several months training in the desert, before it was posted for service during the [[Gallipoli Campaign]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Instead of landing on the [[Gallipoli|peninsula]] with the battery, Brownell was transferred to [[Alexandria, Egypt|Alexandria]] where the Army required his administrative abilities as an accountant.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oxford&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com.rp.nla.gov.au:2048/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t271.e237|title=Brownell, Air Commodore Raymond James|accessdate=22 April 2009|author=Peter Dennis, Jeffrey Grey, Ewan Morris, Robin Prior and Jean Bou|work=The Oxford Companion to Australian Military History|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During July 1915, Brownell was shipped to Gallipoli and rejoined the 9th Battery.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Promoted to [[Bombardier (rank)|bombardier]] on 12 November,&lt;ref name=&quot;ServRec&quot;/&gt; he was among one of the final Australian waves to be evacuated from the peninsula in December during the [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] withdrawal.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Returning to Egypt, he was advanced to provisional [[sergeant]] on 24 February 1916. Embarking with his unit from Alexandria, Brownell arrived in [[France]] for service on the Western Front on 29 March, following a six-day voyage.&lt;ref name=&quot;ServRec&quot;/&gt;

On 21&amp;ndash;22 July 1916, Brownell was in action with his battery at [[Battle of Pozières|Pozières]], during which the unit was subject to severe German shellfire. Throughout the engagement, Brownell established and maintained communications between the battery and firing line, despite fatigue or personal risk to himself. Commended for his &quot;particularly meritorious service&amp;nbsp;... and&amp;nbsp;... gallantry in this work&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;MM&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/awm28/2/168/0025.pdf|title=Recommendation for Raymond James Brownell to be awarded a Military Medal|accessdate=24 March 2009|format=PDF|work=Recommendations: First World War|publisher=Australian War Memorial}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brownell was subsequently recommended for the Military Medal.&lt;ref name=&quot;MM&quot;/&gt; The notification for the award was published in a supplement to the ''[[London Gazette]]'' on 16 November 1916.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=29827|date=16 November 1916|startpage=11144|supp=yes|accessdate=24 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Royal Flying Corps===
In October 1916, Brownell applied for a transfer to the Royal Flying Corps. One of 5,000 applicants, Brownell was accepted on 1 January 1917 along with a further 200 Australians.&lt;ref name=&quot;ServRec&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;No.25&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.raaf.gov.au/units/25sqn.aspx|title=No 25 (City of Perth) Squadron|accessdate=24 March 2009|work=Units|publisher=Royal Australian Air Force}}&lt;/ref&gt; Posted for pilot training, he proceeding to [[England]] and was posted to No.&amp;nbsp;3 School of Military Aeronautics at [[Exeter College, Oxford]] from 26 January.&lt;ref name=&quot;ServRec&quot;/&gt; On graduating from the course, Brownell was discharged from the Australian Imperial Force on 16 March and commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Royal Flying Corps the following day.&lt;ref name=&quot;AIF&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=30014|date=11 April 1917|startpage=3467|supp=yes|accessdate=24 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Allotted to [[No. 45 Squadron RAF|No.&amp;nbsp;45 Squadron RFC]] flying [[Sopwith Camel]]s, Brownell moved to France for operational service over the Western Front during September 1917.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Aces&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernad|Franks|2003|p=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 September, he took part in his first patrol, during which he shot down a two-seater German aircraft.&lt;ref name=&quot;No.25&quot;/&gt; In his time flying over the Western Front, Brownell accumulated a total of five victories and achieved 'ace' status before his squadron was transferred to [[Italy]] during December.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aces&quot;/&gt; Later that month, Brownell and his observer, Lieutenant Henry Moody, shot down German ace [[Alwin Thurm]] over [[Asolo]].&lt;ref name=&quot;No.25&quot;/&gt;

Appointed a flight commander in No.&amp;nbsp;45 Squadron, Brownell was promoted to temporary [[Captain (land)|captain]] on 11 February 1918.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=30582|date=18 March 1918|startpage=3399|supp=yes|accessdate=24 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; During aerial engagements against [[Central Powers|Central]] aircraft over the Italian front, he was accredited with the destruction of a further seven aircraft, bringing his total to 12 with an additional nine probables.&lt;ref name=&quot;No.25&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Aces&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Page|2008|p=378}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brownell's aerial victories were composed of five aircraft and one shared destroyed, two and one shared out of control, one shared captured, and one [[Observation balloon|balloon]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Newton&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Newton|1996|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; For his success in bringing six of these aircraft down over a three-month period, Brownell was consequently awarded the Military Cross.&lt;ref name=&quot;MC&quot;&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=30845|date=16 August 1918|startpage=9563|supp=yes|accessdate=24 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The announcement of the decoration was published in a supplement of the ''London Gazette'' on 4 March 1918,&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=30555|date=4 March 1918|startpage=2728|supp=yes|accessdate=24 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the citation for the award being published in a later issue on 16 August 1918, reading:&lt;ref name=&quot;MC&quot;/&gt;

{{quote|''War Office, 16th August, 1918.''

With reference to the awards conferred as announced in the London Gazette dated 4th March, 1918, the following are the statements of service for which the decorations were conferred:—

Awarded the Military Cross.

2nd Lt. Raymond James Brownell, M.M., R.F.C., Spec. Res.

For conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty. Within the last three months he has brought down six enemy aeroplanes, four of which were seen to come down in flames, the other two falling completely out of control. The dash, gallantry and offensive spirit displayed on all occasions by this officer are worthy of the highest praise.}}

During April 1918, Brownell was granted compassionate leave to visit his seriously ill mother. Leaving No.&amp;nbsp;45 Squadron, he travelled to Tasmania. At the end of his leave in September, he commenced his return journey to the United Kingdom. During the voyage, he became grievously ill with [[Pneumonia|pneumonic]] [[influenza]]. On arrival, Brownell accepted a commission in the newly formed [[Royal Air Force]]. However, Brownell's mother again suffered a deterioration in health,&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; so he sought to resign from the Royal Air Force and was placed on the unemployed list on 14 August 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=31522|date=26 August 1919|startpage=10760|accessdate=24 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Embarking for Tasmania, he arrived during September.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;

On his return to Australia, Brownell was employed as a sub-accountant for a firm of merchants in [[Melbourne]], and later with the Hobart City Council as a clerk.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; On 22 April 1920, Brownell acted as one of the [[pallbearer]]s at the military funeral of his friend and fellow No.&amp;nbsp;45 Squadron officer, Captain [[Cedric Howell]], who had been killed in an aeroplane crash while participating in the [[England to Australia flight|England to Australia air race]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Late Captain Howell|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/1694457?searchTerm=Cedric+Howell|publisher=[[The Argus (Australia)|The Argus]]|date=23 April 1920|accessdate=9 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seeking a position in the newly formed Royal Australian Air Force, Brownell was commissioned as a [[flying officer]] on 12 September 1921 and posted to [[RAAF Williams|RAAF Point Cook]] in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]],&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/script/veteran.asp?ServiceID=R&amp;VeteranID=1204617|title=Brownell, Raymond James|accessdate=24 March 2009|work=World War II Nominal Roll|publisher=Commonwealth of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; training Air Force cadets.&lt;ref name=&quot;No.25&quot;/&gt; In a ceremony at St Andrew's Presbyterian Church, Hobart, on 26 August 1925, Brownell married Rhyllis Jean Birchall; the couple would later have two daughters.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; The following year, Brownell assumed command of [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron]]. He led the squadron until 1928, when he was appointed to the Royal Australian Air Force Headquarters in [[Melbourne]] as Director of Personnel Services.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oxford&quot;/&gt;

During 1934, Brownell was posted to England for exchange service with the Royal Air Force. Made second-in-command of No.&amp;nbsp;3 Flying Training School at [[Grantham, England|Grantham]], he was promoted to [[Wing Commander (rank)|wing commander]] on 1 April 1936. While still serving in the United Kingdom, Brownell was appointed commanding officer of [[No. 25 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;23 (City of Perth) Squadron]] (later No.&amp;nbsp;25 Squadron), which had been formed earlier in 1937. The squadron moved to [[RAAF Base Pearce]] in [[Western Australia]] during March 1938, at which time Brownell returned to Australia and assumed command of the unit along with the base.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;No.25&quot;/&gt; Brownell was the first Commanding Officer of Pearce, which was not only the first RAAF establishment to be located in Western Australia,&lt;ref name=&quot;Oxford&quot;/&gt; but also the first permanent air force unit to be established in the state.&lt;ref name=&quot;Newton&quot;/&gt;

==Second World War==

On the outbreak of the Second World War, additional units were placed under Brownell's purview at RAAF Base Pearce and he was consequently promoted to temporary group captain in December 1939.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; With the introduction of [[Lockheed Hudson]] aircraft to the Royal Australian Air Force in February 1940, several units were re-equipped, including [[No. 14 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;14 Squadron]] at RAAF Base Pearce. The Hudsons replaced the squadron's [[Avro Anson]]s, which were to be ferried back to the eastern coast of Australia in order to be used as training aircraft. On one occasion, Brownell took part in ferrying an Anson to RAAF Point Cook with No.&amp;nbsp;14 Squadron pilot [[Charles Learmonth]]. Arriving with the aircraft, the pair piloted a [[de Havilland Moth Minor]]&amp;mdash;a two-seated, open-cockpit, monoplane&amp;mdash;back to Pearce. The return journey took Brownell and Learmonth seven days to complete, and involved a total of twenty-one refuelling stops along the way.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Page|2008|pp=79&amp;ndash;80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During August 1940, Brownell was ordered to Singapore in order to establish and command an RAAF station on the island, as well as administer the RAAF squadrons located in [[Malaysia|Malaya]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Gillison|1962|p=142}}&lt;/ref&gt; Embarking aboard the SS ''Strathallan'' in mid-August, Brownell and his staff formed the RAAF station within two weeks of arrival at [[Sembawang]]. Under the control of [[Far East Air Force (Royal Air Force)|RAF Far East Command]], the station was established as [[Sembawang Air Base|RAF Sembawang]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison&quot;/&gt; During this time, Brownell frequently visited the Malaya peninsula.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;

Promoted to acting air commodore, Brownell returned to Australia during August 1941 and was appointed Air Officer Commanding No.&amp;nbsp;1 Training Group in Melbourne. With this position, Brownell was in command of approximately thirty establishments located in southern Australia. On 1 January 1943, he was posted as Air Officer Commanding Western Area.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Based at RAAF Base Pearce, Brownell's responsibilities involved coordinating training and directing long-range bombing operations.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Following intelligence reports that a Japanese force was en-route to raid Western Australia, the [[Australian Government]] ordered a build-up to defences in the area. In response to this, Brownell organised air defences around [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] and the [[Exmouth Gulf]] during March 1944. With the use of Army transports, he also reinforced [[Cunderdin, Western Australia|Cunderdin]] with supplies and bombs for the use of the heavy bombers in the area. The attack from the Japanese, however, did not occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Odgers|1968|p=136}}&lt;/ref&gt; For his service as Air Officer Commanding Western Area, Brownell was appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] in the 1945 New Years Honours.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=36866|date=1 January 1945|startpage=18|supp=yes|accessdate=24 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Relinquishing command of Western Area in July 1945, Brownell was appointed commander of the recently formed [[No. 11 Group RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;11 Group]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; No.&amp;nbsp;11 Group was established as a static organisation that was to take administrative control of all RAAF units based on [[Morotai]]. The group assumed its role on 30 July, and had the initial jurisdiction of all Dutch territory in the area, along with [[British North Borneo]] and [[Sarawak]]. In addition to this, the unit held the three main responsibilities of local air defence and sea lane protection, support of adjacent formations and offensive operations against Japanese targets within range, as well as line-of-communication duties. The unit, however, was formed too late in the war to assume all of its responsibilities before the Second World War drew to an end.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Odgers|1968|p=478}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brownell was present at the Japanese surrenders in [[Manila]], [[Tokyo]], and on Morotai.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; He was selected by the Australian government to attend the ceremony aboard the [[USS Missouri (BB-63)|USS ''Missouri'']] on 2 September 1945, but was replaced by the [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]], [[Air Vice Marshal]] [[George Jones (RAAF officer)|George Jones]], when Jones became available to make the trip to Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Helson|2006|pp=220&amp;ndash;221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
Returning to Western Australia after the war,&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Brownell attended an investiture ceremony at [[Government House, Perth]] on 3 January 1947, where he was presented with his Commander of the Order of the British Empire by the Lieutenant-[[Governor of Western Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/awm192/00306/003060347.pdf|title=Recommendation for Raymond James Brownell to be awarded a Commander of the Order of the British Empire|accessdate=24 March 2009|format=PDF|work=Index to Recommendations: Second World War|publisher=Australian War Memorial}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 March that year, Brownell retired from the Royal Australian Air Force on medical grounds.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; He had in any case been slated for early retirement, along with a number of other senior officers and veterans of the First World War, to make way for the advancement of younger and equally capable officers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Helson|2006|p=234}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following his retirement from the Air Force, Brownell was made a partner of S. G. Brearley &amp; Co., a stockbroking firm located in Perth. In 1951, he was made chairman of the associated sporting committee of the National Fitness Council of Western Australia; he served in this role until 1967. Aged 79, Brownell died at [[Subiaco, Western Australia]], on 12 April 1974 and was accorded a funeral with full Air Force honours. Brownell's autobiography, ''From Khaki to Blue'', was posthumously published by the Military Historical Society of Australia in 1978.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Newton|1996|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
