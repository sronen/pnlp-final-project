[[Lieutenant General (Australia)|Lieutenant General]] '''Sir Henry Wells''' [[Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire|KBE]], [[Companion of the Order of the Bath|CB]], [[Companion of the Distinguished Service Order|DSO]] (22 March 1898 &amp;ndash; 20 October 1973) was a senior officer in the [[Australian Army]]. Serving as [[Chief of Army (Australia)|Chief of the General Staff]] from 1954 to 1958, Wells' career culminated with his appointment as the first [[Chief of the Defence Force (Australia)|Chairman, Chiefs of Staff Committee]], a position marking him as the professional head of the Australian Military. He served in this capacity from March 1958 until March 1959, when he retired from the army.

Born in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], Wells began his career in the Australian Army in 1916 when he entered the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]]. Graduating as a lieutenant three years later, he served in a variety of staff and instructional positions before the outbreak of the [[Second World War]]. Initially posted to the [[7th Division (Australia)|7th Division]] as a staff officer in 1940, Wells was promoted to lieutenant colonel and made senior liaison officer to [[I Corps (Australia)|I Corps]]. Serving in [[Battle of Greece|Greece]] and [[North African Campaign|North Africa]], he was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Order]] for his leadership at [[Second Battle of El Alamein|El Alamein]]. Transferred to the [[South West Pacific theatre of World War II|South West Pacific theatre]] in 1943 as a brigadier, he served in the [[New Guinea Campaign]] with the headquarters of [[II Corps (Australia)|II Corps]] and later in the [[Borneo campaign (1945)|Borneo campaign]] with I Corps.

Wells was promoted to major general in 1946 and appointed Deputy Chief of the General Staff. Following promotion to lieutenant general, he was made Commander-in-Chief, [[British Commonwealth Forces Korea]] from 1953 to 1954, serving during the last days of the war. In retirement, Wells was a director of several companies. Aged 75, he died in 1973.

==Early life and career==
Wells was born in the [[Victoria (Australia)|Victorian]] town of [[Kyneton, Victoria|Kyneton]] on 22 March 1898,&lt;ref name=&quot;WWII&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/script/veteran.asp?ServiceID=A&amp;VeteranID=789658|title=Wells, Henry |accessdate=8 March 2009|work=World War II Nominal Roll|publisher=Commonwealth of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; the youngest of seven children to Arthur Wells, a [[draper]], and his wife Elizabeth (née Carter). Educated at [[Kyneton Secondary College|Kyneton High School]], Wells entered the Royal Military College, Duntroon, in February 1916, where he was a keen sportsman. Graduating from the college in December 1919, he was [[Officer (armed forces)|commissioned]] as a [[First Lieutenant|lieutenant]] in the Australian Army, and posted to [[England]] for further training.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;&gt;{{Australian Dictionary of Biography|last=Andrews|first=E. M.|year=2002|id=A160617b|title=Wells, Sir Henry (1898 &amp;ndash; 1973)|accessdate=8 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On his return to Australia, Wells was appointed as [[adjutant]] and [[quartermaster]] of the 8th Light Horse Regiment in 1921. The following year, he was allocated to the 9th Light Horse Regiment. In February 1926, Wells was briefly appointed [[brigade major]] of the 6th Cavalry Brigade, before becoming an instructor at the Small Arms School, Sydney, during July. On 14 December that year, Wells married Lorna Irene Skippen in a ceremony at St John's Church of England, [[Cessnock, New South Wales|Cessnock]]; the couple would later have two sons.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;

During 1927, Wells was assigned to the Royal Military College, Duntroon as a company commander and promoted to [[Captain (land)|captain]] that December. Returning to the Small Arms School as an instructor in 1931, he was dispatched to England and attended the [[Staff College, Camberley]] between 1935 and 1936. Arriving back in Australia, Wells was made adjutant and quartermaster of the 4th/3rd Battalion, and later brigade major of the [[1st Brigade (Australia)|1st Infantry Brigade]]. During 1938, he was reposted to Royal Military College, Duntroon as a lecturer on [[Military tactics|tactics]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;

==Second World War==
===Greece and North Africa===
On 15 May 1940, Wells transferred to the [[Second Australian Imperial Force]] for active service during the Second World War.&lt;ref name=&quot;WWII&quot;/&gt; Promoted to [[major]], he was posted to the headquarters of the 7th Division. Wells proceeded with the division to the [[Middle East]], where, on arriving in December, he was promoted to [[lieutenant colonel]] and posted as senior liaison officer to I Corps.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; During this time, the Australian [[6th Division (Australia)|6th Division]] and I Corps Headquarters were diverted for service in the [[Battle of Greece|Greek Campaign]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Long34&quot;/&gt;

Wells arrived in Greece on 7 March 1941, with an advance party of Lieutenant General [[Thomas Blamey|Sir Thomas Blamey's]] I Corps staff.&lt;ref name=&quot;Long34&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Long|1953|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 April, a plan was formulated to withdraw Greek and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] troops from their positions in the [[Verria]] pass of the [[Vermion Mountains]] to the River [[Aliakmon]]. To carry this out, Blamey despatched Wells to coordinate the movement of the 12th Greek Division west to its new position.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Long|1953|p=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;OBERecommendation&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documentsonline/details-result.asp?Edoc_Id=7682462|title=Recommendations for Honours and Awards (Army)—Image details—Wells, Henry—30 December 1941|work=DocumentsOnline|publisher=[[The National Archives]]|format=fee usually required to view full pdf of original recommendation|accessdate=8 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The withdrawal began on 12 April, but the force's movement was hampered because of lack of vehicles and the division did not arrive until late evening the following day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Long|1953|p=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, Wells travelled between I Corps Headquarters and the 12th Greek Division, organising and coordinating the division's movement, despite frequent air attacks on the roads.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;OBERecommendation&quot;/&gt;

On 24 April 1941, Wells embarked from Greece along with the remainder of the I Corps Headquarters during the British and Commonwealth withdrawal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Long|1953|pp=160&amp;ndash;161}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commended for his &quot;conspicuous skill, ability and energy&quot; and fostering &quot;mutual confidence and goodwill between the Allied forces&quot;,&lt;ref name=OBERecommendation /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;RecOBE&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/awm192/00307/003070592.pdf|title=Recommendation for Henry Wells to be awarded an Officer of the Order of the British Empire |accessdate=8 March 2009|format=PDF|work=Index to Recommendations: Second World War|publisher=Australian War Memorial}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wells was recommended for the [[Distinguished Service Order]], but was subsequently appointed an [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] for his services in Greece.&lt;ref name=&quot;OBERecommendation&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;RecOBE&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=GazOBE&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=35396|date=30 December 1941|startpage=7328|supp=yes|accessdate=8 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The announcement of the award was published in a supplement to the ''[[London Gazette]]'' on 30 December 1941.&lt;ref name=&quot;GazOBE&quot;/&gt; Then Brigadier [[Stanley Savige]] later wrote of Wells during the campaign: &quot;Tireless in his long journeys, helpful in every possible way, and courageous in all circumstances&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Long|1953|p=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; For his &quot;gallant and distinguished services&quot; during this time,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/awm192/00307/003070593.pdf|title=Recommendation for Henry Wells to be awarded a Mention in Despatches |accessdate=8 March 2009|format=PDF|work=Index to Recommendations: Second World War|publisher=Australian War Memorial}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wells was additionally [[Mentioned in Despatches]].&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=35821|date=15 December 1942|startpage=5446|supp=yes|accessdate=8 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Greece, the headquarters of I Corps returned to [[British Mandate of Palestine|Palestine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Long|1953|pp=335&amp;ndash;336}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wells was made [[Staff (military)|General Staff Officer]], 2nd Grade (GSO2),&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; the deputy chief of staff in charge of planning operations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Marshall-Cornwell&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Marshall-Cornwell|1977|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; I Corps was alerted to take part in the [[Syria-Lebanon Campaign]], in spite of the fact that since Blamey had been promoted to Deputy Commander in Chief [[Middle East Command]], the corps lacked a commanding officer. General [[Henry Maitland Wilson, 1st Baron Wilson|Sir Henry Maitland Wilson]]&amp;mdash;the British commander in Palestine and [[Transjordan]]&amp;mdash;believed that I Corps' loss of transport and signal equipment precluded it from participating in the campaign from the outset.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Long|1953|pp=340&amp;ndash;341}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, Wilson attempted to exercise command from the [[King David Hotel]]. This proved to be a serious error, as his staff were preoccupied with political and administrative issues, and were too remote from the battlefields to exercise the close command required.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Long|1953|p=527}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following a series of reverses, I Corps headquarters was sent for on 18 June, and Lieutenant General [[John Lavarack]] assumed command that day. The headquarters was confronted by a difficult situation, with almost all reserves committed. Lavarack began regrouping his force, concentrating the 7th Division for a decisive thrust towards [[Beirut]]. Hard fighting was required before the campaign was brought to a successful conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Long|1953|pp=413&amp;ndash;414}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Promoted to [[colonel]], Wells became General Staff Officer, 1st Grade (GSO1), to the [[9th Division (Australia)|9th Division]] in November 1941.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; As such, he was the 9th Division's chief of staff, responsible for the full range of staff activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Maughan|1966|p=544}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 June 1942, Wells accompanied Lieutenant General [[Leslie Morshead|Sir Leslie Morshead]]&amp;mdash;Commander of the 9th Division&amp;mdash;to [[Cairo]], where they received orders tasking the 9th Division with the defence of Cairo. The pair spent that night and the following day organising plans for the move, before Morshead received further orders on 30 June cancelling his previous instructions and directing the division instead be dispatched to [[Alexandria, Egypt|Alexandria]]; the move took place on 1 July.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Maughan|1966|pp=544&amp;ndash;545}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later, it was decided that the 24th Infantry Brigade would be sent forward to reinforce the position at [[El Alamein]]. The brigade was lacking in equipment, and Wells spent that day arranging equipment for the unit as well as overseeing its preparation; the brigade moved forward the next day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Maughan|1966|pp=551&amp;ndash;552}}&lt;/ref&gt; The divisional headquarters proceeded to El Alamein on 7 July, and was posted to the northern flank of the British front line. The unit then spent the remainder of the month [[First Battle of El Alamein|in action]] against [[Axis powers|Axis]] forces in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Maughan|1966|p=555}}&lt;/ref&gt; For his &quot;distinguished services&quot; during this period, Wells was Mentioned in Despatches a second time.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=36065|date=24 June 1943|startpage=2865|supp=yes|accessdate=8 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 October 1942, the British and Commonwealth forces under Lieutenant General [[Bernard Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein|Bernard Montgomery]] launched an [[Second Battle of El Alamein|offensive against Axis forces]] at El Alamein. The 9th Division took part in the battle, and was initially tasked with the seizure of a section of the [[Second Battle of El Alamein#Allied plan|Oxalic Line]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Maughan|1966|pp=677&amp;ndash;678}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the proceeding twelve days, the Australians heavily contributed to the assault, with Morshead and his staff coordinating the 9th Division's operations; success was claimed on 4 November.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Maughan|1966|p=745}}&lt;/ref&gt; Praised for his &quot;ability of high order&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/awm192/00307/003070591.pdf|title=Recommendation for Henry Wells to be awarded a Distinguished Service Order |accessdate=8 March 2009|format=PDF|work=Index to Recommendations: Second World War|publisher=Australian War Memorial}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wells was awarded the Distinguished Service Order for his efforts in training and preparing the division before the battle, in addition to his labours during the engagement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documentsonline/details-result.asp?Edoc_Id=7656197|title=Recommendations for Honours and Awards (Army)—Image details—Wells, Henry—11 February 1943|work=DocumentsOnline|publisher=[[The National Archives]]|format=fee usually required to view full pdf of original recommendation|accessdate=8 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The notification for the decoration was published in a supplement to the ''London Gazette'' on 11 February 1943.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=35898|date=11 February 1943|startpage=743|supp=yes|accessdate=8 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late November 1942, the members of the 9th Division returned to Palestine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Maughan|1966|p=748}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January, the unit embarked from North Africa and sailed home to Australia in preparation for service against the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] in the [[South West Pacific theatre of World War II|South West Pacific]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Maughan|1966|pp=753&amp;ndash;754}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wells arrived back in Australia during February 1943.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; On 15 March, Morshead was appointed to command II Corps, and Wells was transferred along with him to the unit's headquarters as Brigadier, General Staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/awm52/1/AWM52-1-4-8-009.pdf|title=2 Australian Corps General Branch: March 1943 |accessdate=8 March 2009|format=PDF|work=Australian Army War Diaries|publisher=Australian War Memorial}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was promoted to temporary [[brigadier]] in April.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; During this time, the combat forces of the corps undertook training in both jungle and amphibious warfare in preparation for its planned deployment to [[New Guinea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dexter|1961|pp=265&amp;ndash;266}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wells took an active hand in organising these exercises,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/awm52/1/AWM52-1-4-8-016.pdf|title=2 Australian Corps General Branch: September 1943 |accessdate=8 March 2009|format=PDF|work=Australian Army War Diaries|publisher=Australian War Memorial}}&lt;/ref&gt; before he moved with the corps headquarters to New Guinea during October.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/awm52/1/AWM52-1-4-8-017.pdf|title=2 Australian Corps General Branch: October 1943 |accessdate=8 March 2009|format=PDF|work=Australian Army War Diaries|publisher=Australian War Memorial}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During March 1945, Wells acted as one of the eight [[pallbearer]]s for Major General [[George Alan Vasey]] at the latter's funeral.

==Senior command==
In March 1946, Wells was briefly posted as director of military operations at Army Headquarters, before being promoted to temporary [[major general]] and appointed Deputy Chief of the General Staff. The following year, he embarked for the United Kingdom where he attended the [[Imperial Defence College]] in [[London]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; During this time, Wells attended an investiture ceremony at [[Buckingham Palace]], where he was presented with his Commander of the Order of the British Empire by [[George VI of the United Kingdom|King George VI]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CBErec&quot;/&gt; On his return to Australia in 1949, Wells was made Commandant of the Royal Military College, Duntroon.

Wells was appointed Commander-in-Chief, [[British Commonwealth Forces Korea]], in 1953.

Though its incumbents were considered to have performed well, the role garnered little credit for helping facilitate combat success but was a soft target for criticism when operations did not run smoothly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|O'Neill|1985|pp=288&amp;ndash;289}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wells had been sent to Korea with no instructions regarding the withdrawal of troops and&amp;mdash;as armistice talks appeared on the verge of success&amp;mdash;he was closely involved in liaison with the heads of Commonwealth governments regarding General [[Mark Wayne Clark|Mark Clark's]] requests for their commitment to retain forces in the theatre for some period following the end of hostilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|O'Neill|1981|pp=371&amp;ndash;372}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Raised to substantive lieutenant general on 12 April 1954,&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Wells was appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in the [[Queen's Birthday Honours]] that June.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=40189|date=10 June 1954|startpage=3295|supp=yes|accessdate=8 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was commended for his &quot;exceptional meritorious service&quot; in Korea,&lt;ref name=&quot;LOMrec&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/awm192/00201/002010465.pdf|title=Recommendation for Henry Wells to be awarded a US Legion of Merit |accessdate=8 March 2009|format=PDF|work=Index to Recommendations: Korean War|publisher=Australian War Memorial}}&lt;/ref&gt; and awarded the [[United States]] [[Legion of Merit]] in the degree of Commander.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=40325|date=12 November 1954|startpage=6420|accessdate=8 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Presented with the decoration by General [[John E. Hull]] on 19 October,&lt;ref name=&quot;LOMrec&quot;/&gt; Wells returned to Australia three days later.&lt;ref name=&quot;KoreaNR&quot;/&gt; In December, he was made Chief of the General Staff; the professional head of the Australian Army. Wells' appointment coincided with the commitment of Australian forces to the [[Malayan Emergency]], and as such he presided over the deployment of soldiers to the engagement as well as the formation of the first regular brigade group.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; He was upgraded to a [[Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] in the 1956 New Years Honours.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=40670|date=2 January 1956|startpage=40|supp=yes|accessdate=8 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 March 1958, Wells was appointed the first Chairman, Chiefs of Staff Committee (COSC); the professional head of the Australian Military.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chiefs&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defence.gov.au/cdf/past_chiefs.htm|title=Previous Chiefs |accessdate=8 March 2009|work=Chief of the Defence Force|publisher=Department of Defence}}&lt;/ref&gt; The position had previously existed as an extension to the responsibilities of the senior service chief&amp;mdash;either the [[Chief of Navy (Australia)|Chief of Naval Staff]], Chief of the General Staff or [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]]&amp;mdash;but Wells was the first to occupy the position as a separate post. The chairmanship of COSC was created as part of the [[Australian Government]]'s response to a review of the Defence group of departments conducted by Lieutenant General Sir Leslie Morshead in 1957, which recommended greater centralisation of the armed forces. Although the Chairman was the Government's principal military advisor and reported directly to the [[Minister for Defence (Australia)|Minister for Defence]], Wells was not promoted and remained at the same rank as the heads of the [[Royal Australian Navy|Navy]], Army and [[Royal Australian Air Force|Air Force]]. He was also hampered by being given only a small staff. The role of the Chairman, COSC was not strengthened until 1965, when [[Air Marshal (Australia)|Air Marshal]] [[Frederick Scherger|Sir Frederick Scherger]]&amp;mdash;who had been appointed to the position in 1961&amp;mdash;was promoted to [[Air Chief Marshal (Australia)|air chief marshal]] so that he out-ranked the service heads.&lt;ref name=&quot;Horner_ADF_43&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Horner|2001|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wells served in this capacity until his retirement from the Australian military on 22 March 1959.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Chiefs&quot;/&gt;

==Retirement==
In retirement, Wells was appointed as a director to several companies, including Broken Hill South Ltd, Metal Manufactures Ltd, Navcot Australia Pty Ltd and Sitmar Line (Australia) Pty Ltd. During April 1961, Wells was appointed honorary colonel of the [[Royal Victoria Regiment]]. Described as &quot;somewhat reserved and taciturn&quot; during his life,&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Wells died at [[Yarrawonga, Victoria|Yarrawonga]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], on 20 October 1973, and was survived by his wife and their two sons. His funeral service took place with full military honours at Toorak Presbyterian Church, after which he was cremated. In his will, Wells bequeathed a sizable proportion of his estate to [[Legacy Australia|Junior Legacy]], Melbourne.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Wells Road, a street in [[Duntroon, Australian Capital Territory|Duntroon]], [[Australian Capital Territory]], is named in his honour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.actpla.act.gov.au/tools_resources/maps_land_survey/place_names/place_search?sq_content_src=%2BdXJsPWh0dHAlM0ElMkYlMkZ3d3cuYWN0bWFwaS5hY3QuZ292LmF1JTJGUGxhY2VOYW1lcyUyRlBsYWNlRGV0YWlscy5hc3B4JTNGb2JqZWN0SUQlM0QxMDQ1NyZhbGw9MQ%3D%3D|title=Wells Road |accessdate=23 August 2009|work=Place name search|publisher=ACT Planning and Land Authority}}&lt;/ref&gt;
