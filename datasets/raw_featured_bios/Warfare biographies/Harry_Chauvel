[[General (Australia)|General]] '''Sir Harry Chauvel''', [[Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George|GCMG]], [[Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath|KCB]] (16 April 1865{{spaced ndash}}4 March 1945) was a senior officer of the [[First Australian Imperial Force|Australian Imperial Force]] who fought at [[Gallipoli Campaign|Gallipoli]] and in the [[Middle Eastern theatre of World War I|Middle Eastern theatre]] during the [[World War I|First World War]]. He was the first Australian to attain the rank of [[Lieutenant General (Australia)|lieutenant general]] and later [[General (Australia)|general]], and the first to lead a [[corps]]. As commander of the [[Desert Mounted Corps]], he was responsible for one of the most decisive victories and fastest pursuits in military history.

The son of a [[wikt:grazier|grazier]], Chauvel was commissioned as a [[Captain (land)|captain]] in the Upper Clarence Light Horse, a unit organised by his father, in 1886. After the family moved to [[Queensland]] he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the [[2nd/14th Light Horse Regiment|Queensland Mounted Infantry]] in 1890, and saw service during the [[1891 Australian shearers' strike]]. He became a regular officer in 1896, and went to the United Kingdom as part of the Queensland contingent for the 1897 [[Diamond Jubilee]] of [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]]. In 1899 he commanded one of two companies of Queensland Mounted Infantry that were Queensland's initial contribution to the [[Second Boer War|Boer War]]. After the war, he was closely involved with the training of the [[Australian Light Horse]].

Promoted to [[colonel]] in 1913, Chauvel became the Australian representative on the [[Imperial General Staff]] but the First World War broke out while he was still ''en route'' to the United Kingdom. Chauvel arranged for the Australian Imperial Force to be diverted to Egypt, where he joined his new command, the [[1st Light Horse Brigade]], in December. In May 1915, it was sent dismounted to [[Gallipoli]], where Chauvel assumed responsibility for some of the most dangerous parts of the line. He took charge of the [[1st Division (Australia)|1st Division]] that November. In March 1916, Chauvel became commander of the [[Anzac Mounted Division]], gaining victories in the [[Battle of Romani]] in August and the [[Battle of Magdhaba]] in December, and nearly winning the [[First Battle of Gaza]] in March 1917. The following month, he took over the Desert Column, later known as the Desert Mounted Corps, thereby becoming the first Australian to command a corps, and the first to reach the rank of lieutenant general. At [[Battle of Beersheba (1917)|Beersheba]] in October 1917, his light horse captured the town and its vital water supply in one of history's last great cavalry charges. By September 1918, Chauvel was able to effect a secret redeployment of three of his mounted divisions and launch a surprise attack on the enemy that won the [[Battle of Megiddo (1918)|Battle of Megiddo]]. He followed up this victory with one of the fastest pursuits in military history.

In 1919, Chauvel was appointed Inspector General, the Army's most senior post. He was forced to maintain an increasingly hollow structure by politicians intent on cutting expenditure. He was concurrently [[Chief of Army (Australia)|Chief of the General Staff]] from 1923 until his retirement in 1930. In November 1929, he became the first Australian to be promoted to the rank of general. During the [[World War II|Second World War]], he was recalled to duty as Inspector in Chief of the [[Volunteer Defence Corps (Australia)|Volunteer Defence Corps]].

==Early life==
Henry George Chauvel was born in [[Tabulam, New South Wales|Tabulam]], [[New South Wales]] on 16 April 1865, the second child of a [[wikt:grazier|grazier]], Charles Henry Edward Chauvel, and his wife Fanny Ada Mary, née James.&lt;ref name=&quot;adb&quot;&gt;{{Australian Dictionary of Biography|last=Hill|first =Alec|year=1979|id=A070634b|title='Chauvel, Sir Henry George (Harry) (1865–1945)'|accessdate=11 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1884, Charles Henry Chauvel's [[Station (Australian agriculture)|station]] at Tabulam consisted of {{convert|96000|acre|ha|lk=on}}, on which he raised 12,000&amp;nbsp;head of cattle and 320&amp;nbsp;horses.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hill|1978|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; From an early age Henry George Chauvel was known as &quot;Harry&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hill|1978|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated at Mr Belcher's School near [[Goulburn, New South Wales|Goulburn]], before going to [[Sydney Grammar School]] from 1874 to 1880, and [[Toowoomba Grammar School]] from 1881 to 1882. While at Sydney Grammar, Harry served in the school [[Australian Army Cadets|cadet unit]], rising to the rank of [[lance corporal]]. In 1886, Charles Henry was given permission to raise two troops of cavalry. On 14 March 1886, he was commissioned as a [[Captain (land)|captain]] in the Upper Clarence Light Horse, with his sons Arthur and Harry becoming [[second lieutenant]]s, while his two younger sons became troopers. The unit escorted [[Robert Wynn Carrington, 1st Marquess of Lincolnshire|Lord Carrington]], [[Governor of New South Wales]], when he formally opened the railway at [[Tenterfield, New South Wales]] in 1886.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hill|1978|pp=4–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Following a [[Drought in Australia|series of severe droughts]] in northern New South Wales, Charles Henry Chauvel sold his property at Tabulam in 1888 for £50,000. After paying his debts, he bought a much smaller {{convert|12000|acre|ha|adj=on}} property at [[Canning Downs]] on the [[Darling Downs]] in Queensland. In 1889, Harry Chauvel embarked on a solo tour of Europe, visiting Venice, Rome, Florence, Paris and London. While in the United Kingdom, he watched military manoeuvres near [[Aldershot]] in the presence of [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Emperor Wilhelm II of Germany]]. Harry resigned his commission in the New South Wales Military Forces when he moved to Queensland, but on 9 January 1890 he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the [[2nd/14th Light Horse Regiment|Queensland Mounted Infantry]]. After completing his examinations for the rank, he was confirmed as lieutenant in June 1890.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hill|1978|pp=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Chauvel's unit was called up in March 1891 during the [[1891 Australian shearers' strike|shearers' strike]] that had begun earlier that year. Leading his troops and a small detachment of [[Queensland Police]], Chauvel was given the task of escorting a party of [[strikebreaker]]s to a station north of [[Charleville, Queensland|Charleville]]. Near Oakwood, Chauvel's troops were confronted by a crowd of around two hundred mounted [[sheep shearer]]s. When the inspector in charge of the police detachment arrested four of the shearers who were wanted by the police, the crowd became agitated, but Chauvel managed to disperse the crowd peacefully, and bring his charges safely to their destination. During the 1894 Australian shearers' strike, the Queensland government enrolled special constables rather than calling up the militia. Chauvel was appointed a temporary sub-inspector in [[Clermont, Queensland|Clermont]], and later the district around [[Longreach, Queensland|Longreach]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hill|1978|pp=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 September 1896, Chauvel transferred to the Queensland Permanent Military Forces with the rank of captain in the [[9th Battalion, Royal Queensland Regiment|Moreton Regiment]]. He was sent to the United Kingdom with the Queensland contingent for the [[Diamond Jubilee]] of [[Queen Victoria]]. Sporting the [[emu]] feathers worn by Queensland units, he marched with the colonial troops through London behind [[Frederick Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts|Lord Roberts]] on 21 June 1897. Chauvel qualified at the School of Musketry at [[Hythe, Kent]], and served on exchange with the 3rd Battalion, [[King's Royal Rifle Corps]] and 2nd Battalion, [[Royal Berkshire Regiment]] at Aldershot. On returning to Australia, he became a staff officer at Headquarters, Queensland Defence Force.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hill|1978|pp=10–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Boer War==

In July 1899, the [[Premier of Queensland]], [[James Robert Dickson|James Dickson]], offered a contingent of troops for service in South Africa in the event of war between the [[British Empire]], and the [[Boer]] [[South African Republic|Transvaal Republic]] and [[Orange Free State]]. For a time Chauvel served as an enrolment officer, signing up volunteers from the Darling Downs. The [[Second Boer War|Boer War]] broke out in October 1899, and Chauvel was given command of one of two companies of Queensland Mounted Infantry that departed Brisbane on 1 November 1899.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hill|1978|pp=14–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; They disembarked at [[Cape Town]] on 14 December and joined the Imperial force under [[Paul Methuen, 3rd Baron Methuen|Lord Methuen]] at the [[Orange River]]. The Queensland Mounted Infantry's first fighting was in an action at Sunnyside on 1 January 1900 alongside the infantry of the [[Royal Canadian Regiment]]. In February, the Queensland Mounted Infantry became part of [[Major-General (United Kingdom)|Major General]] [[John French, 1st Earl of Ypres|John French]]'s Cavalry Division. After a strenuous march, the Cavalry Division relieved the [[Siege of Kimberley]] on 15 February.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hill|1978|pp=17–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the reorganisation that followed, the Queensland Mounted Infantry became part of Major General [[Edward Hutton (British Army officer)|Edward Hutton]]'s 1st Mounted Infantry Brigade, along with the Canadian and New Zealand mounted units. Chauvel distinguished himself fighting alongside a group of New Zealanders and capturing a [[Maxim gun]]. The Queensland Mounted Infantry participated in the capture of [[Pretoria]] and the [[Battle of Diamond Hill]]. Chauvel was given a mixed force of British, Australian, Canadian and New Zealand mounted troops that became known as &quot;Chauvel's Mounted Infantry&quot;, with [[Victor Sellheim]] as his chief of staff. Initially, Chauvel was given the mission of escorting 10,000 head of cattle to [[Belfast, Mpumalanga]] to supply the troops in the eastern Transvaal. However, his force was diverted by local commanders, who assigned it to burning homesteads sheltering Boer commandos and attacking Boer units.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hill|1978|pp=22–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Queensland Mounted Infantry embarked for Australia on 13 December 1900. They reached Brisbane on 17 January 1901 and the regiment was disbanded there on 23 January.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hill|1978|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; For his part in the fighting, Chauvel was [[mentioned in despatches]],&lt;ref name=&quot;mid1&quot;&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=27305|date=16 April 1901|startpage=2607| accessdate=14 January 2010}} ''mentioned in despatches (Boer War)''&lt;/ref&gt; and appointed a [[Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George]].&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=27306|date=19 April 1901|startpage=2699|accessdate=24 July 2008}} ''Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG)''&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 January 1901, the colonies of Australia federated to form the Commonwealth of Australia. When Chauvel returned to Australia on 17 January, he found that during his absence he had become an officer in the newly formed [[Australian Army]]. A force of 14,000&amp;nbsp;troops was assembled for the opening of the first [[Parliament of Australia|Federal Parliament]] on 9 May 1901 in [[Melbourne]]; Chauvel was selected as brigade major of the mounted contingent, his first Federal posting. He became Staff Officer, Northern Military District, based at [[Townsville]], Queensland, in July. In 1902, Chauvel was appointed to command of the [[Australian Commonwealth Horse|7th Commonwealth Light Horse]], a unit newly raised for service in South Africa,&lt;ref name=&quot;Hill, pp. 30-31&quot;/&gt; with the local rank of [[lieutenant colonel]].&lt;ref name=LTCOL&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=27583|date=4 August 1903|startpage= 4905|accessdate=24 July 2008}} ''Commander, 7th Commonwealth Light Horse''&lt;/ref&gt; Departing from Brisbane on 17 May 1902, the 7th Commonwealth Light Horse arrived at [[Durban]] on 22 June, three weeks after the war ended. It therefore re-embarked for Brisbane, where it was disbanded. Chauvel remained in South Africa for a few weeks in order to tour the battlefields. On returning to Australia he became Staff Officer, Northern Military District once more. He was promoted to the [[brevet (military)|brevet rank]] of lieutenant colonel in December 1902.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hill, pp. 30-31&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Hill|1978|pp=30–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1903, Hutton, now [[Chief of Army (Australia)|General Officer Commanding Australian Military Forces]], sent Chauvel to [[South Australia]] to organise the light horse regiments there. On returning to Queensland in 1904, he became acting Chief Staff Officer Queensland, based in Brisbane. He was promoted to the [[Military rank#Types of rank|substantive rank]] of lieutenant colonel in December 1909, but his ambition to become the Australian representative on the [[Imperial General Staff]] in London was blocked by Hutton's successor Major General [[John Charles Hoad|Charles Hoad]]. Based on his experiences in South Africa, Chauvel propounded ideas on the nature of [[mounted infantry]]. He recommended that Australian troops improve their discipline in the field, called for stronger leadership from officers, and emphasised the need for better organisation for supply and for timely and efficient medical evacuation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hill, pp. 33-37&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Hill|1978|pp=33–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chauvel knew Keith Jopp of [[Newmarket, Queensland]] even before the Boer War, and while stationed in Brisbane, Chauvel and Major [[Brudenell White]] played tennis at the Jopps' place with their daughters Dora and Sibyl. Chauvel became engaged to Sibyl in January 1906, and they were married on 16 June 1906 at [[All Saints Anglican Church, Brisbane|All Saints Anglican Church]], Brisbane.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hill, pp. 33-37&quot;/&gt; Their union ultimately produced two sons and two daughters.&lt;ref name= &quot;adb&quot;/&gt; That year Chauvel also sold the property at Canning Downs South.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hill, pp. 33-37&quot;/&gt; In the shuffle of senior positions that followed Hoad's death in 1911, Chauvel was appointed to the Military Board in Melbourne as Adjutant General. As such, Chauvel was involved in the implementation of the [[Conscription in Australia|universal training scheme]]. Chauvel was particularly involved with the training of the [[Australian Light Horse|light horse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hill|1978|pp=40–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;When the next war comes,&quot; White predicted, &quot;it will only need an [[Turner Ashby|Ashby]] or a [[J.E.B. Stuart]] to make their name immortal.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hill|1978|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==First World War==
===War Office===
Chauvel was promoted to [[colonel]] in 1913. On 3 July 1914, he sailed for England with his wife and three children to replace Colonel [[James Gordon Legge]] as the Australian representative on the Imperial General Staff. While he was still travelling, the First World War broke out. On reporting for duty at the [[War Office]] in mid-August 1914, Chauvel was given a cable directing him to assume command of the [[1st Light Horse Brigade]] of the [[First Australian Imperial Force|Australian Imperial Force]] (AIF) when it arrived in the United Kingdom. Chauvel became concerned with slow progress on construction of the AIF's proposed quarters on the [[Salisbury Plain]]. He made frequent visits to the site and had a [[Royal Australian Engineers]] officer, Major [[Cecil Henry Foott]], appointed to the local staff to safeguard Australian interests. Convinced that the huts would not be ready on time, and that Australian troops would therefore have to spend a winter on Salisbury Plain under canvas, Chauvel persuaded the [[High Commission of Australia in London|High Commissioner for Australia in London]], former Prime Minister Sir [[George Reid (Australian politician)|George Reid]], to approach [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]] with an alternate plan of diverting the AIF to Egypt, which was done. Accompanied by Major [[Thomas Blamey]], Chauvel sailed for Egypt on the [[ocean liner]] {{SS|Mooltan||6}} on 28 November 1914, arriving at [[Port Said]] on 10 December 1914.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hill|1978|pp=42–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gallipoli===
Chauvel began training his Brigade upon arrival in Egypt. He was noted for insisting on high standards of dress and bearing from his troops.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bean|1921|p=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1st Light Horse Brigade became part of Major General [[Alexander Godley]]'s [[New Zealand and Australian Division]], along with the [[4th Brigade (Australia)|4th Infantry Brigade]], the New Zealand Infantry Brigade and [[New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bean|1921|p=118}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the rest of the [[Australian and New Zealand Army Corps]] departed for [[Landing at Anzac Cove|Anzac Cove]] on 25 April 1915, the mounted brigades remained in Egypt - the [[Gallipoli Peninsula]] being unsuited to mounted operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bean|1921|p=216}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following heavy casualties in the early days of the [[Gallipoli Campaign]], however, the light horse were called upon to provide 1,000&amp;nbsp;reinforcements. The British commander in Egypt, Lieutenant General Sir [[John Maxwell (British Army officer)|John Maxwell]], elected instead to ship the mounted brigades to Anzac Cove intact.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bean|1921|pp=599–600}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:H G Chauvel P02648.JPG|thumb|left|Brigadier General H. G. Chauvel outside his Headquarters at Monash Valley|alt=Soldier wearing Sam Browne belt and peaked cap, with a walking stick, sitting in front of a sandbagged doorway half covered by a tarpaulin. A sign says: &quot;headquarters&quot;.]]

Chauvel arrived on 12 May 1915 and took over the critical sector, which included Pope's Hill and Quinn's, Courtney's and Steele's Posts, from Colonel [[John Monash]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bean|1924|pp=116–117}}&lt;/ref&gt; Open to Turkish observation on two sides, these four advanced posts at the top of Monash Valley were the linchpin of the defence. Chauvel reorganised the defence, appointing permanent commanders for the posts.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bean|1924|pp=200–201}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also formed special [[sniper]] groups who eventually managed to suppress the Turkish snipers, making it safe even for mule trains to move up Monash Valley.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bean|1924|pp=248–253}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chauvel's brigade soon found itself under heavy pressure from the Turks. On 29 May 1915, the Turks fired a mine under Quinn's Post and broke into it. The permanent commander of the post, Lieutenant Colonel [[James Harold Cannan|J. H. Cannan]] was absent on leave and the acting commander, Lieutenant Colonel G. J. Burnage was wounded in the fighting. Chauvel responded by bringing up reserves and appointing a temporary post commander, Lieutenant Colonel H. Pope, with orders to drive the Turks out at all costs. Major [[Sydney Herring|S. C. E. Herring]] was miraculously able to charge across the open practically unscathed, his attack having coincided with a Turkish one on another part of the post so that the Turkish machine gunners could not shoot without hitting their own men. There were in fact only about seventeen Turks in the post, who eventually surrendered. Chauvel's decision may have been the wrong one, but it was decisive; he was also lucky.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bean|1924|pp=206–229}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this action, he was mentioned in despatches.&lt;ref name=&quot;mid2&quot;&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=29354|date=5 November 1915|startpage=11001|supp= yes|accessdate=19 January 2010}} ''mentioned in despatches (Quinn's Post)''&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 July 1915, Chauvel was promoted to [[Brigadier General#Australia|brigadier general]], back-dated to when he assumed command of the 1st Light Horse Brigade on 10 December 1914.&lt;ref name= BrigGen&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=29224|date=9 July 1915|startpage=6707|accessdate=17 January 2010}} ''appointment to Brigadier General''&lt;/ref&gt; He spent six weeks in Egypt, in June and July, in hospital with [[pleurisy]], but returned in time for the [[Battle of Sari Bair|August offensive]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hill|1978|p=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; for which he was mentioned in despatches.&lt;ref name=&quot;mid3&quot;&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=29455|date=28 January 1916|startpage=1207|supp=yes|accessdate=19 January 2010}} ''mentioned in despatches (August offensive)''&lt;/ref&gt; Chauvel was acting commander of the New Zealand and Australian Division for short periods in September and October in Godley's absence. Then on 6 November 1915, he became commander of the 1st Division, and was promoted to [[Major General (Australia)|major general]]. He commanded this division through the final phase of the Gallipoli Campaign, the evacuation, and the reorganisation in Egypt in February and March 1916.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bean|1929|p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; For his part in the evacuation, he was mentioned in despatches.&lt;ref name=&quot;mid4&quot;&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=29664|date=13 July 1916|startpage=6942|supp=yes|accessdate=19 January 2010}} ''mentioned in despatches (Gallipoli evacuation)''&lt;/ref&gt; His role in the campaign as a whole was recognised by his appointment as a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]].&lt;ref name= &quot;cb&quot;&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=29438|date=11 January 1916|startpage=564|supp=yes|accessdate=24 July 2008}} ''Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB)''&lt;/ref&gt;

Chauvel assumed command of the newly formed [[Anzac Mounted Division]] on 16 March 1916,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gullett|1923|p=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; the day after it relieved the 1st Division on the [[Suez Canal]] defences.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gullett|1923|p=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chauvel was again mentioned in despatches for his part in the defence of the Canal.&lt;ref name=&quot;mid5&quot;&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=29763|date=25 September 1916|startpage=9341|supp=yes|accessdate=19 January 2010}} ''mentioned in despatches (defence of Suez Canal)''&lt;/ref&gt; His division was committed to No. 3 Section of the Suez Canal Defences, the northern part of the Canal, under Major General H. A. Lawrence. Arrangements were far from ideal. The mounted troops were parcelled out so that only two brigades of the Anzac Mounted Division remained under Chauvel's command. The 3rd Light Horse Brigade had been placed under No. 2 Section by General Sir [[Archibald Murray]] GHQ [[Egyptian Expeditionary Force]] (EEF).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hill|1978|pp=70–71}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lawrence was too far away to control the battle, especially once the telephone lines were cut. Murray, in [[Ismailia]], was even further back.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hill 1978 82–83&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Hill|1978|pp=82–83}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Powles p.86.jpg|thumb|left|Lieutenant General Sir Harry Chauvel.|alt=a man in uniform with shift and tie and Sam Browne belt, holding a walking stick and wearing a slouch hat with emu feathers. He is standing in front of a large tent.]]

For the [[Battle of Romani]], Chauvel chose his ground carefully, reconnoitring it from the ground and the air, and selecting both forward and fall back positions. His luck held; the German commander — [[Friedrich Kreß von Kressenstein]] — selected the same position as the forming up area for his attack in August 1916. Under great pressure, Chauvel maintained his position until Brigadier General [[Edward Chaytor]]'s New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade arrived after being released by Lawrence.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hill, pp. 74-77&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Hill|1978|pp=74–77}}&lt;/ref&gt; The counterattack that Chauvel had been calling for all day did not materialise until dusk. At Katia and again at Bir el Abd, Chauvel attempted to sweep around the Turkish flank but wound up making frontal attacks on the Turkish rearguard and was beaten off by determined counterattacks and artillery fire against the 3rd Light Horse Brigade.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gullett|1923|pp=167–169}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite killing 1,250 Turks and taking over 4,000 prisoners,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gullett|1923|p=173}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chauvel was criticised for his failure to rout and destroy the Turks.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gullett|1923|p=191}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, for the [[ANZAC|Anzac]] horsemen, who suffered over 900 of the 1,130&amp;nbsp;British casualties,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gullett|1923|p=184}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was a clear-cut victory, their first decisive win and the turning point of the campaign. Later, Chauvel realised that Romani was the first decisive British victory of the war outside [[West Africa Campaign (World War I)|West Africa Campaign]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hill 1978 82–83&quot;/&gt;

|quote=Chauvel was no hard-riding gambler against odds. Like [[Fernando Álvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba|Alva]], he could on occasion ignore the ardent enthusiasm of his officers and bide his time. Always cool, and looking far enough ahead to see the importance of any particular fight in its proper relation to the war as a whole, he was brave enough to break off an engagement if it promised victory only at what he considered an excessive cost to his men and horses. He fought to win, but not at any price. He sought victory on his own terms. He always retained, even in heated moments of battle, when leaders are often careless of life, a very rare concern for the lives of his men and his horses.|source=Henry Gullett&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gullett|1923|p=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his report to the War Office on the battle, Murray passed lightly over the part played by the Anzac Mounted Division. The majority of awards for the Battle of Romani went to British troops, including a generous number to officers of Murray's staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gullett|1923|p=192}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lawrence was made a [[Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath]], but Chauvel, having already been made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George for South Africa and Companion of the Order of the Bath for Gallipoli, was recommended for a lesser award, which he refused. In view of this, Murray decided that Chauvel should receive no award at all,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hill|1978|p=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he was merely mentioned in despatches.&lt;ref name=&quot;mid6&quot;&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=29845|date= 1 December 1916|startpage=11807|supp=yes|accessdate=19 January 2010}} ''mentioned in despatches (Battle of Romani)''&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1916, the command arrangements were altered. A new command, Eastern Force, was formed under Major General Sir [[Charles Macpherson Dobell]], an officer with broad experience in fighting colonial wars. Its advanced troops — including Chauvel's Anzac Mounted Division — became part of the [[Desert Mounted Corps|Desert Column]] under Major General Sir [[Philip Chetwode]], a British cavalry [[baronet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gullett|1923|p=207}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Battle of Magdhaba]] in December 1916, Chauvel therefore had a free hand, answerable only to Chetwode, instead of the cumbersome arrangements on the Canal. His [[military intelligence|intelligence]] on enemy dispositions was considerably better thanks to the work of the aviators of [[No. 5 Wing RAF|No. 5 Wing]], which consisted of [[No. 14 Squadron RAF|No. 14 Squadron]], [[Royal Flying Corps]] and [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No. 1 Squadron]], [[Australian Flying Corps]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|MacMunn|Falls|1928|p=203}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he had only limited time to capture the position and its water supply, and when the issue was in doubt Chauvel ordered a withdrawal. The order was ignored by Brigadier General [[Charles Frederick Cox]] of the 1st Light Horse Brigade, whose troops carried the position, and was cancelled by Chetwode. Despite his premature withdrawal order, it was Chauvel's plan of attack that won the battle.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gullett|1923|pp=214–228}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Chauvel's leadership,&quot; wrote [[Henry Gullett]], &quot;was distinguished by the rapidity with which he summed up the very obscure Turkish position in the early morning, and by his judgement and characteristic patience in keeping so much of his force in reserve until the fight developed sufficiently to ensure its most profitable employment.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gullett|1923|p=228}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chauvel gained another important success in the [[Battle of Rafa]] in January 1917. In many ways, the battle was similar to Magdhaba, but the Turkish position was stronger and the threat of its reinforcement was greater. Once again, the availability of water was a crucial feature of the battle. This time it was Chetwode who decided to call off the battle, with Chauvel's concurrence, but once again the troops carried the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hill|1978|pp=90–93}}&lt;/ref&gt; The victories at Magdhaba and Rafah changed Murray's mind about awarding Chauvel a knighthood and in January 1917 Chauvel was appointed a [[Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George]].&lt;ref name= &quot;kcmg&quot;&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=29909|date=18 January 1917|startpage=749|accessdate=19 January 2010}}  ''Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG)''&lt;/ref&gt; This particular knighthood was a bit of an insult for Chauvel as it is normally bestowed on those who had performed &quot;extraordinary or important non-military service in a foreign country.&quot; In July, he was mentioned in despatches for these operations.&lt;ref name=&quot;mid7&quot;&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=30169|date=6 July 1917| startpage=6772|supp=yes|accessdate=19 January 2010}} ''mentioned in despatches (Battle of Magdhaba)''&lt;/ref&gt;

The following month, a second mounted division — the [[Imperial Mounted Division]] — was formed from the 3rd and 4th Light Horse Brigades and the British 5th and 6th Yeomanry Brigades. A British regular army officer fresh from experience in the [[Senussi Campaign]], Major General Sir H. W. Hodgson, was appointed to command, with an all-British staff. The deliberate mixing of Australian and Imperial troops was done with Chauvel's approval but was contrary to the policy of the [[Government of Australia|Australian Government]], which soon registered its displeasure, sending Brigadier General Sir [[Robert Anderson (general)|Robert Anderson]] to [[Cairo]] to discuss the matter frankly with Chauvel and his superiors. As a result, the Imperial Mounted Division was renamed the Australian Mounted Division.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gullett|1923|pp=255–257}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[First Battle of Gaza]] in March 1917, Chauvel's mission was similar to Rafa and Magdhaba, but on a larger scale. He enveloped the Turkish position at [[Gaza]] while the British [[53rd (Welsh) Infantry Division]] and [[54th (East Anglian) Infantry Division]] attempted to capture it.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gullett|1923|pp=264–265}}&lt;/ref&gt; When this failed, Chetwode ordered Chauvel to attempt to capture Gaza from the rear. Chauvel successfully improvised a late afternoon assault on Gaza that captured the town despite the barriers of high cactus hedges and fierce enemy opposition, entering it after dark, only to have an out-of-touch Dobell order the mounted troops to withdraw, despite Chauvel's protests. This time his brigadiers at the front, Generals [[Granville Ryrie|Ryrie]] and Chaytor, although they that believed that Gaza could be held, felt compelled to obey, as they could not see the whole battle. All guns, including captured ones were hauled away, as were all unwounded prisoners, the wounded and even the dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gullett|1923|pp=277–286}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chauvel ensured that wounded Turkish prisoners that were unfit to make the march to [[Deir al-Balah]] were each left with a full water bottle.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hill|1978|p=105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dobell launched the [[Second Battle of Gaza]] in April 1917 with a full scale frontal assault supported by [[Naval gunfire support|naval gunfire]], tanks and [[Chemical warfare|poison gas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gullett|1923|pp=302–307}}&lt;/ref&gt; It ended even more unsatisfactorily, and Dobell was relieved of command of Eastern Force on 19 April. His place was taken by Chetwode, while Chauvel took over the Desert Column, thereby becoming the first Australian to reach the rank of [[Lieutenant General (Australia)|lieutenant general]]. Command of the Anzac Mounted Division passed to Chaytor. In June, General Sir [[Edmund Allenby]] took over the EEF from Murray.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gullett|1923|pp=334–335}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allenby moved his headquarters to Palestine and re-organised his command along more regular lines. Eastern Force was abolished and two corps headquarters were formed, [[XX Corps (United Kingdom)|XX Corps]] under Chetwode and [[XXI Corps (United Kingdom)|XXI Corps]] under Lieutenant General [[Edward Bulfin]]. The Desert Column became the [[Desert Mounted Corps]], with the [[Anzac Mounted Division]], the Australian Mounted Division, the newly formed [[Yeomanry Mounted Division]] and the [[Imperial Camel Corps Brigade]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gullett|1923|pp=361–365}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although some British thought that Allenby should replace Chauvel with a British officer, Allenby retained him in command. However he overrode Chauvel's own preference to appoint a [[Royal Horse Guards]] officer, Brigadier General Richard Howard-Vyse, known as &quot;[[Wombat]]&quot;, as Chauvel's chief of staff. Chauvel thus, on 2 August 1917, became the first Australian to permanently command a corps. By coincidence, all three of Allenby's new corps commanders were regulars who had been commissioned from the militia.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hill|1978|pp=118–123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Third Battle of Gaza]] in October 1917, it was again Chauvel and his Desert Mounted Corps that had the critical role. Chetwode believed that the EEF did not have the resources to defeat the Turks in their fixed positions so he planned to drive the Turks from them by turning the enemy flank at [[Beersheba]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gullett|1923|pp=345–351}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a waterless area on the flank of the enemy line. The Desert Mounted Corps would have a long overnight approach over waterless desert and would have to capture the town quickly with its wells intact or perish from thirst.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gullett|1923|pp=363–367}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Battle of Beersheba (1917)|Battle of Beersheba]] went right down to the line, but the mission was accomplished, albeit not without a wild mounted [[bayonet]] charge by the 4th Light Horse Brigade—the last of history's great cavalry charges—to capture the town and its vital water supply. Few battles have been won in such spectacular fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gullett|1923|pp=394–402}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this decisive victory, and the subsequent capture of Jerusalem, Chauvel was mentioned in despatches twice more,&lt;ref name= &quot;mid8&quot;&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=30480|date=15 January 1918|startpage=937|supp=yes|accessdate=19 January 2010}} ''mentioned in despatches (Beersheba)''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mid9&quot;&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue= 30492|date=25 January 1918|startpage=1195|supp=yes|accessdate=19 January 2010}} ''mentioned in despatches (Beersheba)''&lt;/ref&gt; and appointed a [[Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath]] in the 1918 [[New Year Honours]] List.&lt;ref name=&quot;kcb&quot;&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=30624|date=11 April 1918| startpage=4409|supp=yes|accessdate=19 January 2010}} ''Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB)''&lt;/ref&gt;

Chauvel, however, was still disappointed with the failure to destroy the Turkish army. The Turks had fought hard, forcing the commitment of the Desert Mounted Corps in heavy action before the moment for a sweeping pursuit came. When it did, the men and horses were too tired and could not summon the required energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gullett|1923|pp=439–444}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1918, the EEF began a series of operations across the Jordan. Allenby soon found his British troops diverted to France, to be replaced by two Indian cavalry divisions, and the Australian Mounted Division faced a similar fate for a time.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gullett|1923|pp=651–657}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the meantime, during the second Transjordan operations Chauvel faced great difficulties with the terrain, the weather and a tenacious enemy; the campaign was not a success. The Desert Mounted Corps found itself fighting outnumbered, with Turkish reinforcements closing in from all sides. Chauvel was forced to withdraw to the West Bank of the Jordan.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hill|1978|pp=142–145}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently the 5th Yeomanry Mounted Brigade was disbanded and Chauvel replaced it with the [[5th Light Horse Brigade]], formed from the Australian and New Zealand components of the now disbanded Imperial Camel Corps Brigade, and a composite French cavalry regiment of [[Spahis]] and [[Chasseurs d'Afrique]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gullett|1923|pp=639–641}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Chauvel B01033.jpg|thumb|right|240px|General Sir Harry and Lady Chauvel (third and fourth from left) at [[Nahr al-Kalb|Dog River, Lebanon]], near the stone tablet recording the occupation of [[Beirut]] and [[Tripoli, Lebanon|Tripoli]]|alt=Five soldiers in Sam Browne belts, riding boots and peaked caps, and one woman in light coloured dress and matching hat in front of a stone inscription that reads: &quot;The British XXI Corps with Le Detachment Français de Palestine et Syrie occupied Beirut and Tripoli October 1918 AD.&quot;]]

In September 1918, Chauvel was able to effect a secret redeployment of two of his mounted divisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gullett|1923|pp=688–692}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allenby launched a surprise attack on the enemy and won the [[Battle of Megiddo (1918)|Battle of Megiddo]]. He then followed up this victory with one of the fastest pursuits in military history—167&amp;nbsp;km in only three days.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gullett|1923|pp=693–712}}&lt;/ref&gt; This time he succeeded in destroying the Turkish army. The Desert Mounted Corps moved across the [[Golan Heights]] and captured [[Damascus]] on 1 October. Between 19 September and 2 October, the Australian Mounted Division lost 21 killed and 71 wounded, and captured 31,335 Turkish prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gullett|1923|pp=761–772}}&lt;/ref&gt; To restore calm in the city, Chauvel ordered a show of force. Lieutenant Colonel [[T. E. Lawrence]] later lampooned this as a &quot;triumphal entry&quot; but it was actually a shrewd political stroke,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hill|1978|pp=181–182}}&lt;/ref&gt; freeing Chauvel's forces to advance another 300&amp;nbsp;km to Aleppo, which was captured on 25 October. Five days later, Turkey surrendered.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gullett|1923|pp=776–779}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this victory, Chauvel was again mentioned in despatches.&lt;ref name=&quot;mid10&quot;&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=31138|date=21 January 1919|startpage=1164| accessdate=19 January 2010}} ''mentioned in despatches (Damascus and Aleppo)''&lt;/ref&gt;

Chauvel was obliged to remain in the Middle East due to the situation in [[Syria]] and the [[Egyptian Revolution of 1919|Egyptian Rebellion]], although he was able to have Lady Chauvel join him there in January 1919. By April, the situation had calmed and Chauvel was able to hand over command of the AIF in the Middle East to Ryrie. Chauvel and Lady Chauvel then headed for London on the RMS ''Malwa''. They arrived in time for him to lead Australian troops on a victory march through the city on 3 May. Soon after, he was hospitalised at the 3rd London General Hospital at [[Wandsworth]] with [[appendicitis]]. The whole Chauvel family was able to sail for home on the transport HMAT ''Demosthenes'' on 26 July 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hill|1978|pp=190–196}}&lt;/ref&gt; For his services as commander of the Desert Mounted Corps, Chauvel was created a [[Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George]] in June 1919,&lt;ref name=&quot;gcmg&quot;&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=31395| date=9 June 1919|startpage=7422|accessdate=24 July 2008}} ''Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George (GCMG)''&lt;/ref&gt; was awarded the French ''[[Croix de guerre 1914–1918 (France)|Croix de Guerre avec Palme]]'' by the [[President of France]] and the [[Order of the Nile]] (2nd Class) by the [[Sultan of Egypt]],&lt;ref name=&quot;croix&quot;&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=31393|date=7 June 1919|startpage=7398|supp=yes|accessdate=24 July 2008}} ''Croix de Guerre avec Palme''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nile&quot;&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=31002|date=8 November 1918|startpage=13273|supp =yes|accessdate=19 January 2010}} ''Order of the Nile''&lt;/ref&gt; and was mentioned in despatches for the 11th time.&lt;ref name=&quot;mid11&quot;&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=31498|date=8 August 1919|startpage=10194| supp=yes|accessdate=19 January 2010}} ''mentioned in despatches (commander of the Desert Mounted Corps)''&lt;/ref&gt; At his special request, when he was conferred with vestments and accoutrements of the Order of St Michael and St George by [[George V|King George V]], the King dubbed him &quot;Sir Harry&quot; rather than &quot;Sir Henry&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hill|1978|p=196}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
===Between the wars===
Chauvel's AIF appointment was terminated on 9 December 1919, and the next day he was appointed Inspector General, the Army's most senior post,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hill|1978|p=199}}&lt;/ref&gt; which he held until 1930.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hill|1978|p=218}}&lt;/ref&gt; The office of Inspector General had been created as an auditor who provided annual reports to the Council of Defence. In the event of war, it was intended that the Inspector General would become the Commander in Chief with the Military Board as his general staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wood|2006|pp=57–58}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chauvel's annual reports tended to emphasise the parlous state of the nation's defences. He warned, for example, that if war came, soldiers would &quot;be subject to the unfair handicap and the certainty of increased loss of life which inferiority in armament and shortage of ammunition must inevitability entail&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hill|1978|p=214}}&lt;/ref&gt; Looking back from the perspective of the [[Second World War]], historian [[Gavin Long]] noted that Chauvel's annual reports were &quot;a series of wise and penetrating examinations of Australian military problems of which, however, little notice was taken&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Long|1952|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Dedication ceremony, Shrine of Remembrance, 1934.jpg|thumb|250px|left|The dedication ceremony for the Shrine of Remembrance. Over 300,000 people were in attendance, a figure that was approximately a third of Melbourne's population at the time.|alt=Aerial view of a square temple structure, surrounded by thousands of people.]]

In February 1920, Chauvel was promoted to the substantive rank of lieutenant general, back-dated to 31 December 1919. In January 1920, he chaired a committee to examine the future structure of the army. The committee's recommendations proved to be next to impossible to implement in the face of defence cuts that were imposed in 1920 and 1922.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hill|1978|pp=200–203}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Lieutenant General Brudenell White's retirement as Chief of the General Staff in 1923, that post was divided into two, with Chauvel becoming 1st Chief of the General Staff as well as Inspector General, while Brigadier General Thomas Blamey became 2nd Chief of the General Staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hill|1978|pp=207–209}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chauvel also served as Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee, being the senior of the three service chiefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hill|1978|p=215}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1929, he became the first Australian to be promoted to the rank of [[General (Australia)|general]].&lt;ref name=&quot;adb&quot;/&gt; He attempted to maintain the Army's structure in the face of short-sighted politicians intent on cutting expenditure. As a result, the Army became increasingly hollow, retaining the form of a large force without the substance. When [[conscription]] was abolished by Prime Minister [[James Scullin]]'s government in 1929, it was left up to Chauvel to attempt to make the new volunteer system work. He finally retired in April 1930.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hill|1978|pp=217–219}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Harry Chauvel J00503.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Chauvel at Maribyrnong camp in March 1923.|alt=Head and shoulders of man in Army uniform with Sam Brown belt and slouch hat with emu feathers.]]

Chauvel's sons Ian and Edward resigned their commissions in the Australian Army in 1930 and 1932 respectively, and accepted commissions in cavalry regiments of the [[Indian Army (1895–1947)|British Indian Army]]. His daughter [[Elyne Mitchell|Elynne]] married [[Thomas Walter Mitchell]], a grazier. Chauvel became a frequent visitor to their property &quot;Towong Hill&quot; near [[Corryong]], Victoria. He was staying at Towong Hill during the [[Black Friday Bushfires of 1939]]. When the property was threatened by fire, he directed the firefighting effort, and at one point climbed a tree close to the house to hack away burning branches.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hill|1978|pp=222–223}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dedication of the [[Shrine of Remembrance]] in 1934 saw a series of reunions. Ian and Edward arrived from India on leave, Alexander Godley came from Britain, and Howard-Vyse as chief of staff to [[Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hill|1978|p=223}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1937, Chauvel travelled to the United Kingdom as head of the Australian contingent for the [[coronation]] of [[George VI|King George VI]], where he was welcomed by Chetwode and Howard-Vyse. Chauvel had the contingent dressed as light horsemen, wearing emu plumes, [[bandolier]]s and [[spur]]s. When the [[Dominion]] troops assembled at [[Buckingham Palace]] to receive their [[King George VI Coronation Medal]]s, Chauvel led the parade, with Howard-Vyse as his chief of staff. On the way back, the contingent visited France, where ceremonies were held at the [[Villers–Bretonneux Australian National Memorial]] and the [[Arc de Triomphe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hill|1978|pp=225–226}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chauvel frequently led [[Anzac Day]] parades through Melbourne but resigned from the leadership of the march in 1938 in protest against at decision by the [[Returned and Services League of Australia]] to change the form of service at the Shrine from a [[Christian]] to a [[secular]] one.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hill|1978|p=222}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second World War and legacy===
During the [[World War II|Second World War]], Chauvel was recalled to duty as Inspector in Chief of the [[Volunteer Defence Corps (Australia)|Volunteer Defence Corps]] (VDC), the Australian version of the [[Home Guard (United Kingdom)|British Home Guard]]. Following Brudenell White's death in the [[Canberra air disaster, 1940|Canberra air disaster]], Prime Minister [[Robert Menzies]] turned to Chauvel for advice on a successor as Chief of the General Staff. On Chauvel's recommendation, Menzies appointed Lieutenant General [[Vernon Sturdee]] to the post. During the war, Chauvel's son Ian served as staff officer in the [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italian campaign]], while Edward was posted to [[New Guinea]] to learn about [[jungle warfare]] from the Australian Army. Chauvel's daughter Eve joined the [[Women's Royal Australian Naval Service]] and spent a day in a lifeboat in the [[North Atlantic]] after her ship was [[torpedo]]ed by a [[U-Boat]]. Tom Mitchell was captured by the Japanese in the [[Battle of Singapore]]. Chauvel remained with the VDC, based at [[Victoria Barracks, Melbourne]] but constantly travelling on inspections until his death on 4 March 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hill|1978|pp=228–229}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Chauvel an002775.jpg|thumb|left|250px|General Sir Harry Chauvel (centre) with a group of officers holding [[Owen gun]]s|alt=Five soldiers in a line, all in greatcoats except the closest and all wearing steel helmets except the one in the middle, who is wearing a peaked cap with oak leaves on the peak.]]

Chauvel was given a state funeral service at [[St Paul's Cathedral, Melbourne]] officiated by the [[Anglican Diocese of Melbourne|Anglican Archbishop of Melbourne]], [[Joseph John Booth]], after which he was [[cremated]] at [[Springvale Crematorium]] with full military honours. Eight generals acted as [[pallbearers]]: Lieutenant General [[John Northcott]], Chief of the General Staff; Lieutenant General [[John Whitham]], Corps Commander, VDC; Major General [[James Cannan]], [[Quartermaster General]]; Major General [[Charles Brand]]; Major General [[Cyril Clowes]], GOC, Victoria Line of Communications Area; Major General [[John Austin Chapman]], Deputy Chief of General Staff; Major General [[Charles Edward Maurice Lloyd|Charles Lloyd]], [[Adjutant General]]; and Major General [[Clive Steele]], Engineer in Chief.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|newspaper=[[The Argus (Australia)|The Argus]]|date=Tuesday 6 March 1945|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Portraits of Chauvel are held by the [[Australian War Memorial]] in Canberra, the [[Naval and Military Club]] in Melbourne, and the [[Imperial War Museum]] in London. A portrait by [[George Washington Lambert]] is in the possession of the family. Chauvel is commemorated in a bronze plaque in St Paul's Cathedral, Melbourne. His sword is in Christ Church, [[South Yarra, Melbourne|South Yarra]] and his uniform in the Australian War Memorial. There is also a memorial window in the chapel of the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]].&lt;ref name=&quot;adb&quot;/&gt;

Chauvel's daughter [[Elyne Mitchell]] wrote a number of non-fiction works about her father and his corps. In his book ''[[Seven Pillars of Wisdom]]'', [[T. E. Lawrence]] provided a wildly inaccurate version of Chauvel.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hill|1978|p=224}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Bean]] noted that &quot;this wise, good and considerate commander was far from the stupid martinet that readers of Lawrence's ''Seven Pillars of Wisdom'' might infer.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bean|1948|p=321}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lawrence confessed that &quot;little of his book was strict truth though most of it was based on fact.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hill|1978|p=181}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Chauvel's nephew [[Charles Chauvel (filmmaker)|Charles Chauvel]] became a well-known film director, whose films included ''[[Forty Thousand Horsemen]]'' (1940), about the [[Battle of Beersheba]].

Harry Chauvel was portrayed in film: by [[Bill Kerr]] in ''[[The Lighthorsemen (film)|The Lighthorsemen]]'' (1987), which covered the exploits of an Australian cavalry regiment during the [[Third Battle of Gaza]]; by Ray Edwards in ''[[A Dangerous Man: Lawrence After Arabia]]'' (1990), which took place around the 1919 [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris peace conference]]; and by [[Colin Baker]] in the 1992 ''[[The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles|Young Indiana Jones]]'' TV movie ''Daredevils of the Desert'', another retelling of the Third Battle of Gaza from the director of ''The Lighthorsemen''.&lt;ref&gt;{{imdb character|0096006}} Retrieved on 19 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
