'''Lisa del Giocondo''' (née '''Gherardini'''; 15 June 1479 – 15 July 1542 or ca. 1551), also known as '''Lisa Gherardini''', '''Lisa di Antonio Maria''' (or '''Antonmaria''') '''Gherardini''' and '''Mona Lisa''', was a member of the Gherardini family of [[Florence]] and [[Tuscany]] in [[Italy]]. Her name was given to ''[[Mona Lisa]]'', her [[portrait painting|portrait]] commissioned by her husband and painted by [[Leonardo da Vinci]] during the [[Italian Renaissance]].

Little is known about Lisa's life. Born in Florence and married in her teens to a cloth and silk merchant who later became a local official, she was mother to five children and led what is thought to have been a comfortable and ordinary middle-class life. Lisa outlived her husband, who was considerably her senior.

Centuries after Lisa's death, ''Mona Lisa'' became the world's most famous painting&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Riding, Alan|title=In Louvre, New Room With View of 'Mona Lisa'|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/06/arts/design/06lisa.html|work=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=April 6, 2005|accessdate=2007-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and took on a life separate from Lisa, the woman. Speculation by scholars and hobbyists made the work of art a globally recognized icon and an object of commercialization. In 2005, Lisa was definitively identified as the model for the ''Mona Lisa''.

==Early life and family==
Lisa's [[Florence|Florentine]] family was old and aristocratic but over time had lost its influence.&lt;ref&gt;Pallanti 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;58&lt;/ref&gt; They were well off but not wealthy, and lived on farm income in a city that was among the largest in Europe and economically successful, while there were great disparities in wealth among its inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;Pallanti 2006, pp. 17, 23, 24&lt;/ref&gt;

Antonmaria di Noldo Gherardini, Lisa's father, had lost two wives, Lisa di Giovanni Filippo de' Carducci, whom he married in 1465, and Caterina Rucellai, whom he married in 1473. Both died in childbirth.&lt;ref name=Pallanti-37&gt;Pallanti 2006, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; Lisa's mother was Lucrezia del Caccia, daughter of Piera Spinelli and Gherardini's wife by his third marriage in 1476.&lt;ref name=Pallanti-37 /&gt; Gherardini at one time owned or rented six farms in [[Chianti]] that produced wheat, wine and olive oil and where livestock was raised.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pallanti&quot;&gt;Pallanti 2006, pp. 41-44&lt;/ref&gt;

Lisa was born in Florence on 15 June 1479 on Via Maggio,&lt;ref name=&quot;Pallanti-37&quot; /&gt; although for many years it was thought she was born on one of the family's rural properties, Villa Vignamaggio just outside Greve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Villa Vignamaggio|title=History of Vignamaggio|url=http://www.vignamaggio.it/english/history.html|accessdate=2008-04-05|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060512180457/http://www.vignamaggio.it/english/history.html |archivedate = May 12, 2006|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is named for Lisa, a wife of her paternal grandfather.&lt;ref&gt;Pallanti 2006, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; The eldest of seven children, Lisa had three sisters, one of whom was named Ginevra, and three brothers, Giovangualberto, Francesco, and Noldo.&lt;ref&gt;Pallanti 2006, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;

The family lived in Florence, originally near [[Santa Trinita]] and later in rented space near [[Santo Spirito, Florence|Santo Spirito]], most likely because they were not able to afford repairs to their former house when it was damaged. Lisa's family moved to what today is called Via dei Pepi and then near Santa Croce, where they lived near Ser Piero da Vinci, Leonardo's father.&lt;ref name=Pallanti-45-46&gt;Pallanti 2006, pp. 45-46&lt;/ref&gt; They also owned a small country home in St. Donato in the village of Poggio about {{convert|32|km|mi|0}} south of the city.&lt;ref name=Z4&gt;Zöllner 1993, p.&amp;nbsp;4&lt;/ref&gt; Noldo, Gherardini's father and Lisa's grandfather, had bequeathed a farm in Chianti to the [[Santa Maria Nuova (commune)|Santa Maria Nuova]] hospital. Gherardini secured a lease for another of the hospital's farms and, so that he could oversee the wheat harvest, the family spent summers there at the house named Ca' di Pesa.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pallanti&quot; /&gt;

==Marriage and later life==
On 5 March 1495, Lisa married Francesco di Bartolomeo di Zanobi del Giocondo, a modestly successful [[textile|cloth]] and [[silk]] merchant, becoming his third wife at age&amp;nbsp;15. Lisa's dowry was 170&amp;nbsp;[[Italian coin florin|florins]] and the San Silvestro farm near her family's country home, a sign that the Gherardini family was not wealthy at the time and reason to think she and her husband loved each other.&lt;ref name=Z5&gt;Zöllner 1993, p.&amp;nbsp;5&lt;/ref&gt; The property lies between Castellina and San Donato in Poggio, near two farms later owned by [[Michelangelo]].&lt;ref name=Pallanti-45-46 /&gt; Neither poor nor among the most well-to-do in Florence, the couple lived a middle-class life. Lisa's marriage may have increased her [[social status]] because her husband's family may have been richer than her own.&lt;ref name=Z5 /&gt; Francesco is thought to have benefited because Gherardini is an &quot;old name&quot;.&lt;ref name=Kemp /&gt; They lived in shared accommodation until 5&amp;nbsp;March 1503, when Francesco was able to buy a house next door to his family's old home in the Via della Stufa. Leonardo is thought to have begun painting Lisa's portrait the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Portrait of Lisa Gherardini, wife of Francesco del Giocondo|url=http://www.louvre.fr/llv/oeuvres/detail_notice.jsp?CONTENT%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198673226503&amp;CURRENT_LLV_NOTICE%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198673226503&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;FOLDER%3C%3Efolder_id=9852723696500816&amp;bmUID=1155229237450&amp;bmLocale=en|publisher=Musée du Louvre|accessdate=2007-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Z9&gt;Zöllner 1993, p.&amp;nbsp;9&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Del Giocondo-Gherardini-Firenze-map.jpg|thumb|alt=Map of Florence with colored dots near the Ponte Vechhio|Central [[Florence]]. Francesco and Lisa lived on Via della Stufa (red), about {{convert|1|km|mi|1}} north of the [[Arno River]]. Lisa's parents lived closer to the river, at first north and later south (purple).]]

Lisa and Francesco had five children: Piero, Camilla, Andrea, Giocondo, and Marietta, four of them between 1496 and 1507.&lt;ref name=Johnston&gt;{{cite news|author=Johnston, Bruce|title= Riddle of Mona Lisa is finally solved: she was the mother of five|work=Telegraph.co.uk|publisher=Telegraph Media Group|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2004/08/01/wmona01.xml&amp;sSheet=/news/2004/08/01/ixworld.html|date=January 1, 2004|accessdate=2007-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lisa also raised Bartolomeo, the son of Francesco and his second wife, Camilla di Mariotto Rucellai, who was about a year old when his mother died. Lisa's stepmother, Caterina di Mariotto Rucellai, and Francesco's first wife were sisters, members of the prominent Rucellai family.

Camilla and Marietta became Catholic nuns. Camilla took the name Suor Beatrice and entered the convent of San Domenico di Cafaggio, where she was entrusted to the care of Antonmaria's sister, Suor Albiera and Lisa's sisters, Suor Camilla (who was acquitted in a scandalous visitation by four men at the convent) and Suor Alessandra.&lt;ref name=Pallanti-61-62&gt;Pallanti 2006, pp.&amp;nbsp;61-62&lt;/ref&gt; Beatrice died at age 18&lt;ref name=Pallanti-61-62 /&gt; and was buried in the [[Basilica of Santa Maria Novella|Basilica di Santa Maria Novella]].&lt;ref name=M154&gt;Müntz 1898, p.&amp;nbsp;154&lt;/ref&gt; Lisa developed a relationship with Sant'Orsola, a convent held in high regard in Florence, where she was able to place Marietta in 1521. Marietta took the name Suor Ludovica and became a respected member of the convent in a position of some responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;Pallanti 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;63&lt;/ref&gt;

Francesco became an official in Florence. He was elected to the ''[[Signoria of Florence|Dodici Buonomini]]'' in 1499 and to the [[Signoria of Florence|Signoria]] in 1512, where he was confirmed as a ''Priori'' in 1524. He may have had ties to [[Medici]] family political or business interests. In 1512 when the government of Florence feared the return of the Medici from exile, Francesco was imprisoned and fined 1,000&amp;nbsp;florins. He was released in September when the Medici returned.&lt;ref name=M154 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Masters&gt;{{cite book|author=Masters, Roger D.|title=Fortune is a River: Leonardo da Vinci and Niccolò Machiavelli's Magnificant Dream of Changing the Course of Florentine History (online notes for Chapter 6)|publisher=Free Press via Dartmouth College (dartmouth.edu)|date=June 15, 1998|url=http://www.dartmouth.edu/~rmasters/fourtune/notes/06.html|isbn=0-684-84452-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one account, Francesco died in the plague of 1538. Lisa fell ill and was taken by her daughter Ludovica to the convent of Sant'Orsola, where she died about four years later at the age of 63.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Lorenzi, Rossella|title=Mona Lisa Grave Found, Claims Scholar|url=http://dsc.discovery.com/news/2007/01/19/monalisa_his.html?category=history&amp;guid=20070119134500|work=Discovery Channel News|publisher=|Discovery Communications|date=January 19, 2007|accessdate=2007-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lorenzi&gt;{{cite news|author=Lorenzi, Rossella|title=Mona Lisa's Identity Revealed?|work=Discovery Channel News|publisher=Discovery Communications|url=http://dsc.discovery.com/news/2007/05/02/monalisa_arc.html?category=archaeology&amp;guid=20070502143030|date=May 2, 2007|accessdate=2007-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a scholarly account of their lives, Francesco lived to be 80 years old. He died in 1538, and Lisa may have lived until at least 1551, when she would have been 71 or&amp;nbsp;72.&lt;ref name=Z4 /&gt;

In June 1537 in his will among many provisions, Francesco returned Lisa's dowry to her, gave her her personal clothing and jewelry and provided for her future. Upon entrusting her care to their daughter Ludovica and, should she be incapable, his son Bartolomeo, Francesco wrote, &quot;Given the affection and love of the testator towards Mona Lisa, his beloved wife; in consideration of the fact that Lisa has always acted with a noble spirit and as a faithful wife; wishing that she shall have all she needs...&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Pallanti 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;105&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Mona Lisa''==

{{main|Mona Lisa}}

Like other Florentines of their financial means, Francesco's family members were art lovers and patrons. His son Bartolommeo asked Antonio di Donnino Mazzieri to paint a fresco at the family's burial site in the [[Santissima Annunziata, Florence|Basilica della Santissima Annunziata di Firenze]]. [[Andrea del Sarto]] painted a [[Madonna (art)|Madonna]] for another member of his family.&lt;ref name=M154 /&gt; Francesco gave commissions to Leonardo for a portrait of his wife and to [[Domenico Puligo]] for a painting of [[Francis of Assisi|Saint Francis of Assisi]]. He is thought to have commissioned Lisa's portrait to celebrate both Andrea's birth and the purchase of the family's home.&lt;ref name=Z9 /&gt;

''Mona Lisa'' fulfilled 15th- and early 16th century requirements for portraying a woman of virtue. Lisa is portrayed as a faithful wife through gesture—her right hand rests over her left. Leonardo also presented Lisa as fashionable and successful, perhaps more well-off than she was. Her dark garments and black veil were Spanish-influenced high fashion; they are not a depiction of mourning for her first daughter, as some scholars have proposed. The portrait is strikingly large; its size is equal to that of commissions acquired by wealthier art patrons of the time. This extravagance has been explained as a sign of Francesco and Lisa's social aspiration.&lt;ref name=Z12&gt;Zöllner 1993, p.&amp;nbsp;12&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Mona Lisa stolen-1911.jpg|thumb|left|alt=The space on the wall in the Louvre left by the thief|The theft of the ''Mona Lisa'' from the Louvre in 1911 and its travels to [[Asia]] and [[North America]] during the 1960s and 1970s contributed to the painting's iconization and fame.&lt;ref&gt;Sassoon 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;14–16&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Leonardo had no income during the spring of 1503, which may in part explain his interest in a private portrait.&lt;ref name=Masters /&gt;&lt;ref name=Z7&gt;Zöllner 1993, p.&amp;nbsp;7&lt;/ref&gt; But later that year, he most likely had to delay his work on ''Mona Lisa'' when he received payment for starting ''[[The Battle of Anghiari (painting)|The Battle of Anghiari]]'', which was a more valuable commission and one he was contracted to complete by February 1505.&lt;ref name=M136&gt;Müntz 1898, p.&amp;nbsp;136&lt;/ref&gt; In 1506 Leonardo considered the portrait unfinished.&lt;ref name=Clark /&gt; He was not paid for the work and did not deliver it to his client.&lt;ref name=Z6&gt;Zöllner 1993, p.&amp;nbsp;6&lt;/ref&gt; The artist's paintings traveled with him throughout his life, and he may have completed ''Mona Lisa'' many years later in France,&lt;ref name=Kemp /&gt; in one estimation by 1516.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|title=Mona Lisa 1503-16|url=http://www.universalleonardo.org/work.php?id=197|date=|publisher=University of the Arts, London|accessdate=2007-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Mona Lisa margin scribble.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Vespucci's notation on an old manuscript|[[Agostino Vespucci]]'s margin note]]

The painting's title dates to 1550. An acquaintance of at least some of Francesco's family,&lt;ref name=Z4 /&gt; [[Giorgio Vasari]] wrote, &quot;Leonardo undertook to paint, for Francesco del Giocondo, the portrait of Mona Lisa, his wife&quot;&lt;ref name=Clark&gt;{{cite journal|author=Clark, Kenneth, quoting a translation of Vasari|title=Mona Lisa|journal=The Burlington Magazine|publisher=The Burlington Magazine Publications via JSTOR|volume=115|issue=840|month=March | year=1973|pages=144–151|issn=00076287|jstor=877242}}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{Lang-it|Prese Lionardo a fare per Francesco del Giocondo il ritratto di mona Lisa sua moglie.}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Vasari, Giorgio|others=Gaetano Milanesi|title=Le vite de' più eccellenti pittori, scultori ed architettori|volume=IV|url=http://books.google.com/?id=EroFAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA39|location=Firenze|publisher=G.C.
