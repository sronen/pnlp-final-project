{{Audio|ru-El_Lissitzky.ogg|'''Lazar Markovich Lissitzky'''}} ({{lang-ru|Ла́зарь Ма́ркович Лиси́цкий}}) ({{OldStyleDate|November 23|1890|November 11}} – December 30, 1941), better known as '''El Lissitzky''' ({{lang-ru|Эль Лиси́цкий}}, {{lang-yi|על ליסיצקי}}), was a [[Russia]]n [[artist]], [[designer]], [[photographer]], [[typographer]], [[polemicist]] and [[architect]]. He was an important figure of the [[Russian avant garde]], helping develop [[suprematism]] with his mentor, [[Kazimir Malevich]], and designing numerous [[Art exhibition|exhibition]] displays and [[propaganda]] works for the former [[Soviet Union]]. His work greatly influenced the [[Bauhaus]] and [[Constructivism (art)|constructivist]] movements, and he experimented with production techniques and stylistic devices that would go on to dominate [[Graphic design#Twentieth century design|20th-century graphic design]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Curl&quot;/&gt;

El Lissitzky's entire career was laced with the belief that the artist could be an agent for change, later summarized with his edict, &quot;das zielbewußte Schaffen&quot; (goal-oriented creation).&lt;ref name = r4&gt;Glazova&lt;/ref&gt; Lissitzky, of Jewish faith, began his career illustrating [[Yiddish]] [[Children's literature|children's books]] in an effort to promote Jewish culture in Russia, a country that was undergoing massive change at the time and that had just repealed its [[Anti-Semitism|antisemitic]] laws. When only 15 he started teaching; a duty he would stay with for most of his life. Over the years, he taught in a variety of positions, schools, and artistic media, spreading and exchanging ideas. He took this ethic with him when he worked with Malevich in heading the suprematist [[art group]] [[UNOVIS]], when he developed a variant suprematist series of his own, [[El Lissitzky#Proun|Proun]], and further still in 1921, when he took up a job as the Russian cultural ambassador to [[Weimar Republic|Weimar]] [[Germany]], working with and influencing important figures of the [[Bauhaus]] and [[De Stijl]] movements during his stay. In his remaining years he brought significant innovation and change to [[typography]], exhibition design, [[photomontage]], and book design, producing critically respected works and winning international acclaim for his exhibition design. This continued until his deathbed, where in 1941 he produced one of his last works – a [[Soviet propaganda]] poster rallying the people to construct more tanks for the fight against [[Nazi Germany]].

==Early years==
El Lissitzky was born on November 23, 1890 in [[Pochinok (town)|Pochinok]], a small [[Jewish]] community {{convert|50|km|mi}} southeast of [[Smolensk]], former Russian Empire. During his childhood, he lived and studied in the city of [[Vitebsk]], now part of [[Belarus]], and later spent 10 years in Smolensk living with his grandparents and attending the Smolensk Grammar School, spending summer vacations in Vitebsk.&lt;ref name=SHA57&gt;Shatskikh, 57&lt;/ref&gt; Always expressing an interest and talent in [[drawing]], he started to receive instruction at 13 from [[Yehuda Pen]], a local Jewish artist, and by the time he was 15 was teaching students himself. In 1909, he applied to an art academy in [[Saint Petersburg]], but was rejected. While he passed the entrance exam and was qualified, the law under the [[Russian history, 1892-1920|Tsarist regime]] only allowed a limited number of Jewish students to attend Russian schools and universities.

Like many other Jews then living in the Russian Empire, El Lissitzky went to study in [[Germany]]. He left in 1909 to study [[architectural engineering]] at a [[Darmstadt University of Technology|Technische Hochschule in Darmstadt]], Germany.&lt;ref name=&quot;Curl&quot;&gt;Curl&lt;/ref&gt; During the summer of 1912, El Lissitzky, in his own words, &quot;wandered through [[Europe]]&quot;, spending time in [[Paris]] and covering {{convert|1200|km|mi}} on foot in [[Italy]], teaching himself about [[fine art]] and sketching architecture and landscapes that interested him.&lt;ref name = r3&gt;Lissitzky-Kuppers&lt;/ref&gt; His interest in ancient Jewish culture has originated during the contacts with [[Paris]]-based group of Russian Jews led by sculptor [[Ossip Zadkine]], a lifetime friend of Lissitzky since early childhood, who exposed Lissitzky to conflicts between different groups within the diaspora.&lt;ref&gt;Schatskikh, p.58&lt;/ref&gt; In the same 1912 some of his pieces were included for the first time in an exhibit by the St. Petersburg Artists Union; a notable first step. He remained in Germany until the outbreak of [[World War I]], when he was forced to return home through [[Switzerland]] and the [[Balkans]],&lt;ref name=SP69&gt;Spencer, Poynor, 2004:69&lt;/ref&gt; along with many of his countrymen, including other [[expatriate]] artists born in the former Russian Empire, such as [[Wassily Kandinsky]] and [[Marc Chagall]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Curl&quot;/&gt;

Upon his return to [[Moscow]], Lissitzky attended the [[Polytechnic Institute of Riga]], which had been evacuated to Moscow because of the war,&lt;ref&gt;Margolin (1997), p.24&lt;/ref&gt; and worked for the architectural firms of [[Boris Velikovsky]] and [[Roman Klein]].&lt;ref name=SP69/&gt;  During this work, he took an active and passionate interest in Jewish culture which, after the downfall of the openly [[Anti-Semitism|antisemitic]] Tsarist regime, was experiencing a renaissance. The new [[Russian Provisional Government, 1917|Provisional Government]] repealed a decree that prohibited the printing of [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]] letters and that barred Jews from citizenship. Thus El Lissitzky soon devoted himself to Jewish art, exhibiting works by local Jewish artists, traveling to [[Mahilyow]] to study the traditional architecture and ornaments of old [[synagogue]]s, and illustrating many [[Yiddish]] [[Children's literature|children's books]]. These books were El Lissitzky's first major foray in book design, a field that he would greatly innovate during his career.

His first designs appeared in the 1917 book, ''Sihas hulin: Eyne fun di geshikhten'' (An Everyday Conversation), where he incorporated Hebrew letters with a distinctly [[art nouveau]] flair. His next book was a visual retelling of the traditional Jewish [[Passover]] song ''Had gadya'' (One Goat), in which El Lissitzky showcased a [[typography|typographic]] device that he would often return to in later designs. In the book, he integrated letters with images through a system that matched the color of the characters in the story with the word referring to them. In the designs for the final page , El Lissitzky depicts the mighty &quot;hand of [[God]]&quot; slaying the angel of death, who wears the tsar's crown. This representation links the redemption of the Jews with the victory of the [[Bolshevik]]s in the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]].&lt;ref name = r5&gt;Perloff 2005&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative view asserts that the artist was wary of Bolshevik internationalization, leading to destruction of traditional Jewish culture.&lt;ref&gt;Margolin (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; Visual representations of the hand of God would recur in numerous pieces throughout his entire career, most notably with his 1925 [[photomontage]] self-portrait ''The Constructor,'' which prominently featured the hand.

==Avant garde==
===Suprematism===
In May 1919,&lt;ref name=SHA57 /&gt; upon receiving an invitation from fellow [[Jewish]] artist [[Marc Chagall]], El Lissitzky returned to Vitebsk to teach graphic arts, printing, and architecture at the newly formed People's Art School – a school that Chagall created after being appointed Commissioner of Artistic Affairs for Vitebsk in 1918. Lissitzky was engaged in designing and printing propaganda posters; later, he preferred to keep quiet about this period, probably because one of main subjects of these posters was the exile [[Leon Trotsky]].&lt;ref&gt;Shatskikh, 62&lt;/ref&gt; The quantity of these posters is sufficient to regard them as a separate [[genre]] in the artist's output.&lt;ref&gt;Shatskikh, 63&lt;/ref&gt;

Chagall also invited other Russian artists, most notably the [[Painting|painter]] and art theoretician [[Kazimir Malevich]] and El Lissitzky's former teacher, Yehuda Pen. However, it was not until October 1919 when Lissitzky, then on an errand in Moscow, persuaded Malevich to relocate to Vitebsk.&lt;ref&gt;Shatskikh, 66&lt;/ref&gt; The move coincided with the opening of the first art exhibition in Vitebsk directed by Chagall.&lt;ref&gt;Shatskikh, 70&lt;/ref&gt; Malevich would bring with him a wealth of new ideas, most of which inspired Lissitzky but clashed with local public and professionals who favored [[figurative art]] and with Chagall himself.&lt;ref&gt;Shatskikh, 71&lt;/ref&gt; After going through [[impressionism]], [[primitivism]], and [[cubism]], Malevich began developing and advocating his ideas on [[suprematism]] aggressively. In development since 1915, suprematism rejected the imitation of natural shapes and focused more on the creation of distinct, [[Geometry|geometric]] forms. He replaced the classic teaching program with his own and disseminated his suprematist theories and techniques school-wide. Chagall advocated more classical ideals and El Lissitzky, still loyal to Chagall, became torn between two opposing artistic paths. El Lissitzky ultimately favoured Malevich's suprematism and broke away from traditional Jewish art. Chagall left the school shortly thereafter.

At this point El Lissitzky subscribed fully to suprematism and, under the guidance of Malevich, helped further develop the movement. Lissitzky designed ''On the New System of Art'' by Malevich, who responded in December 1919: &quot;Lazar Markovich, I salute you on the publication of this little book&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Shatskikh, 78-79&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the most famous work by Lissitzky from the same period was the 1919 propaganda [[poster]] &quot;[[Beat the Whites with the Red Wedge]]&quot;. Russia was going through a [[Russian Civil War|civil war]] at the time, which was mainly fought between the &quot;Reds&quot; (communists and revolutionaries) and the &quot;Whites&quot; (monarchists, conservatives, liberals and socialists who opposed the [[Bolshevik Revolution]]). The image of the red wedge shattering the white form, simple as it was, communicated a powerful message that left no doubt in the viewer's mind of its intention. The piece is often seen as alluding to the similar shapes used on military maps and, along with its [[political symbolism]], was one of El Lissitzky's first major steps away from Malevich's non-objective suprematism into a style his own. He stated: &quot;The artist constructs a new symbol with his brush. This symbol is not a recognizable form of anything that is already finished, already made, or already existent in the world – it is a symbol of a new world, which is being built upon and which exists by the way of the people.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Tupitsyn, 9&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 17, 1920,&lt;ref name=SHA92&gt;Shatskikh, 92&lt;/ref&gt; Malevich and El Lissitzky co-founded the short-lived ''Molposnovis'' (Young followers of a new art), a proto-suprematist association of students, professors, and other artists. After a brief and stormy dispute between &quot;old&quot; and &quot;young&quot; generations, and two rounds of renaming, the group reemerged as [[UNOVIS]] (Exponents of the new art) in February.&lt;ref name=SHA93&gt;Shatskikh, 93&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Malgrave, 239&lt;/ref&gt; Under the leadership of Malevich the group worked on a &quot;suprematist [[ballet]]&quot;, choreographed by [[Nina Kogan]] and on the remake of a 1913 [[Futurism (art)|futurist]] [[opera]] ''[[Victory Over the Sun]]'' by [[Mikhail Matyushin]] and [[Aleksei Kruchenykh]].&lt;ref name=SHA93/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The opera was produced without original orchestral music - Shatskikh, 98&lt;/ref&gt; El Lissitzky and the entire group chose to share credit and responsibility for the works produced within the group, signing most pieces with a black square. This was partly a [[homage]] to a similar piece by their leader, Malevich, and a symbolic embrace of the [[Communist]] ideal. This would become the de facto [[Seal (device)|seal]] of UNOVIS that took the place of individual names or initials. Black squares worn by members as chest badges and [[cufflink]]s also resembled the ritual [[tefillin]] and thus were no strange symbol in Vitebsk [[shtetl]].&lt;ref&gt;Shatskikh, 111&lt;/ref&gt;

The group, which disbanded in 1922, would be pivotal in the dissemination of suprematist ideology in Russia and abroad and launch El Lissitzky's status as one of the leading figures in the avant garde. Incidentally, the earliest appearance of the signature El Lissitzky ({{lang-ru|Эль Лисицкий}}) emerged in the handmade ''UNOVIS Miscellany'', issued in two copies in March–April 1920,&lt;ref&gt;Shatskikh, 125&lt;/ref&gt; and containing his manifesto on book art: &quot;the book enters the skull through the eye not the ear therefore the pathways the waves move at much greater speed and with more intensity. if i &lt;small&gt;(sic)&lt;/small&gt; can only sing through my mouth with a book i &lt;small&gt;(sic)&lt;/small&gt; can show myself in various guises.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Shatskikh, 122&lt;/ref&gt;

===Proun===
[[Image:A Prounen by El Lissitzky c.1925.jpg|right|thumb|A Proun by El Lissitzky, c.1925. Commenting on Proun in 1921, El Lissitzky stated, &quot;We brought the canvas into circles {{nowrap|. . .}} and while we turn, we raise ourselves into the space.&quot;&lt;ref name = r5/&gt;]]
During this period El Lissitzky proceeded to develop a suprematist style of his own, a series of [[Abstract art|abstract]], geometric [[painting]]s which he called ''Proun'' (pronounced &quot;pro-oon&quot;). The exact meaning of &quot;Proun&quot; was never fully revealed, with some suggesting that it is a contraction of ''proekt unovisa'' (designed by UNOVIS) or ''proekt utverzhdenya novogo'' (Design for the confirmation of the new). Later, El Lissitzky defined them ambiguously as &quot;the station where one changes from painting to architecture.&quot;&lt;ref name = r3/&gt;

Proun was essentially El Lissitzky's exploration of the visual language of suprematism with [[Three-dimensional space|spatial]] elements, utilizing shifting axes and multiple perspectives; both uncommon ideas in suprematism. Suprematism at the time was conducted almost exclusively in flat, [[Dimension|2D]] forms and shapes, and El Lissitzky, with a taste for architecture and other [[dimension|3D]] concepts, tried to expand suprematism beyond this. His Proun works (known as ''Prounen'') spanned over a half a decade and evolved from straightforward paintings and [[lithograph]]s into fully three-dimensional installations. They would also lay the foundation for his later experiments in architecture and exhibition design. While the paintings were artistic in their own right, their use as a staging ground for his early architectonic ideas was significant. In these works, the basic elements of architecture – volume, mass, color, space and rhythm – were subjected to a fresh formulation in relation to the new suprematist ideals. Through his Prouns, utopian models for a new and better world were developed. This approach, in which the artist creates art with socially defined purpose, could aptly be summarized with his edict &quot;das zielbewußte Schaffen&quot; – &quot;task oriented creation.&quot;&lt;ref name = r4/&gt;

[[Jewish symbolism|Jewish themes and symbols]] also sometimes made appearances in his Prounen, usually with El Lissitzky using Hebrew letters as part of the typography or visual code. For the cover of the 1922 book ''Arba'ah Teyashim'' (Four Billy Goats; [[:Image:Design by El Lissitzky 1922.jpg|cover]]), he shows an arrangement of Hebrew letters as architectural elements in a dynamic design that mirrors his contemporary Proun typography.&lt;ref name = r5/&gt; This theme was extended into his illustrations for the ''Shifs-Karta'' (Passenger Ticket) book.

===Return to Germany===
In 1921, roughly concurrent with the demise of UNOVIS, suprematism was beginning to fracture into two ideologically adverse halves, one favoring Utopian, spiritual art and the other a more utilitarian art that served society. El Lissitzky was fully aligned with neither and left Vitebsk in 1921. He took a job as a cultural representative of Russia and moved to [[Berlin]] where he was to establish contacts between Russian and [[Germany|German]] artists. There he also took up work as a writer and designer for international [[magazine]]s and journals while helping to promote the avant garde through various [[art gallery|gallery]] shows. He started the very short-lived but impressive periodical ''Veshch-Gegenstand Objekt'' with Russian-Jewish writer [[Ilya Ehrenburg]]. This was intended to display contemporary Russian art to [[Western Europe]]. It was a wide-ranging pan-arts publication, mainly focusing on new suprematist and constructivist works, and was published in [[German language|German]], [[French language|French]], and [[Russian language|Russian]] languages.&lt;ref name=M250&gt;Malgrave, 250&lt;/ref&gt; In the first issue, El Lissitzky wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
We consider the triumph of the constructive method to be essential for our present. We find it not only in the new economy and in the development of the industry, but also in the psychology of our contemporaries of art. Veshch will champion constructive art, whose mission is not, after all, to embellish life, but to organize it.&lt;ref name = r4/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During his stay El Lissitzky also developed his career as a [[graphic designer]] with some historically important works such as the books ''Dlia Golossa'' (For the Voice), a collection of poems from [[Vladimir Mayakovsky]], and ''Die Kunstismen'' (The Artisms) together with [[Jean Arp]]. In Berlin he also met and befriended many other artists, most notably [[Kurt Schwitters]], [[László Moholy-Nagy]], and [[Theo van Doesburg]].&lt;ref&gt;Malgrave, 243&lt;/ref&gt; Together with Schwitters and van Doesburg, El Lissitzky presented the idea of an international artistic movement under the guidelines of [[Constructivism (art)|constructivism]] while also working with Kurt Schwitters on the issue ''Nasci'' (Nature) of the periodical ''Merz'', and continuing to illustrate children's books. The year after the publication of his first Proun series in [[Moscow]] in 1921, Schwitters introduced El Lissitzky to the [[Hanover]] gallery [[kestnergesellschaft]], where he held his first [[solo exhibition]]. The second Proun series, printed in Hanover in 1923, was a success, utilizing new printing techniques.&lt;ref name=M250/&gt; Later on, he met [[Sophie Kuppers]], who was the widow of Paul Kuppers, an art director of the kestnergesellschaft at which El Lissitzky was showing, and whom he would marry in 1927.

===Horizontal skyscrapers===
In 1923–1925, El Lissitzky proposed and developed the idea of horizontal [[skyscraper]]s (''Wolkenbügel'', &quot;cloud-irons&quot;). A series of eight such structures was intended to mark the major intersections of the [[Boulevard Ring]] in Moscow. Each ''Wolkenbügel'' was a flat three-story, 180-meter-wide L-shaped slab raised 50 meters above street level. It rested on three pylons (10×16×50 meters each), placed on three different street corners. One pylon extended underground, doubling as the staircase into a proposed [[rapid transit|subway]] station; two others provided shelter for ground-level [[tram]] stations.&lt;ref name=KM213&gt;Khan-Magomedov, 213&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BA&gt;Balandin&lt;/ref&gt;

Lissitzky argued that as long as humans cannot fly, moving horizontally is natural and moving vertically is not. Thus, where there is not sufficient land for construction, a new plane created in the air at medium altitude should be preferred to an American-style tower. These buildings, according to Lissitzky, also provided superior [[Building insulation|insulation]] and [[ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]] for their inhabitants.&lt;ref name=KM215&gt;Khan-Magomedov, 215&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:EL-LISITZKY-OGONYOK-1.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Printing plant of &quot;Ogonyok&quot; magazine|print shop designed by El Lissitzky]], showing the least damaged south end of the building]]

Lissitzky, aware of severe mismatch between his ideas and the existing urban landscape, experimented with different configurations of the horizontal surface and height-to-width ratios so that the structure appeared balanced visually (&quot;spatial balance is in the contrast of vertical and horizontal tensions&quot;).&lt;ref name=KM215/&gt; The raised platform was shaped in a way that each of its four facets looked distinctly different. Each tower faced the [[Kremlin]] with the same facet, providing a pointing arrow to pedestrians on the streets. All eight buildings were planned identically, so Lissitzky proposed [[color-coding]] them for easier orientation.&lt;ref name=KM216&gt;Khan-Magomedov, 216&lt;/ref&gt;

An illustration of the concept appeared on the front cover of [[Adolf Behne]]'s book ''Der Moderne Zweckbau'', and articles on it written by El Lissitzky appeared in the [[Moscow]]-based architectural review ''ASNOVA News'' (journal of [[ASNOVA]], the Association of New Architects) and in the German art journal ''Das Kunstblatt''.

After some time of creating &quot;paper architecture&quot; projects such as the ''Wolkenbügels'' he was hired to design an actual building in Moscow. Located at {{coord|display=inline|55.777277|37.610828}} 17, 1st Samotechny Lane, it is Lissitzky's sole tangible work of architecture. It was commissioned in 1932 by [[Ogonyok]] magazine to be used as a print shop. In June 2007 the independent ''Russky Avangard'' foundation filed a request to list the building on the heritage register. In September 2007 the city commission (Moskomnasledie) approved the request and passed it to the city government for a final approval, which did not happen. In October 2008, the abandoned building was badly damaged by fire.&lt;ref&gt;Ilyicheva&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibitions of the 1920s==

After two years of intensive work Lissitzky was taken ill with acute [[pneumonia]] in October 1923. A few weeks later he was diagnosed with [[lung|pulmonary]] [[tuberculosis]]; in February 1924 he relocated to a Swiss [[sanatorium]] near [[Locarno]].&lt;ref name=SP70&gt;Spencer, Poynor, 70&lt;/ref&gt; He kept very busy during his stay, working on advertisement designs for Pelikan Industries (who in turn paid for his treatment), translating articles written by Malevich into German, and experimenting heavily in typographic design and [[photography]]. In 1925, after the Swiss government denied his request to renew his visa, El Lissitzky returned to [[Moscow]] and began teaching [[interior design]], [[metalwork]], and architecture at [[VKhUTEMAS]] (State Higher Artistic and Technical Workshops), a post he would keep until 1930. He all but stopped his Proun works and became increasingly active in architecture and propaganda designs.

In June 1926, Lissitzky left the country again, this time for a brief stay in [[Germany]] and the [[Netherlands]]. There he designed an exhibition room for the Internationale Kunstausstellung art show in [[Dresden]] and the Raum Konstruktive Kunst (Room for constructivist art) and Abstraktes Kabinett shows in [[Hanover]], and perfected the 1925 ''Wolkenbügel'' concept in collaboration with [[Mart Stam]].&lt;ref name=SP70/&gt; In his autobiography (written in June 1941, and later edited and released by his wife), El Lissitzky wrote, &quot;1926. My most important work as an artist begins: the creation of exhibitions.&quot;&lt;ref name = r3/&gt;

Back in the USSR, Lissitzky designed displays for the official Soviet pavilions at the international exhibitions of the period, up to the [[1939 New York World's Fair]]. One of his most notable exhibits was the All-Union Polygraphic Exhibit in Moscow in August–October 1927, where Lissitzky headed the design team for &quot;photography and photomechanics&quot; (i.e. [[photomontage]]) artists and the installation crew.&lt;ref&gt;Tolstoy, 57-58 provides verbatim copies of relevant government decrees dated June 1927.&lt;/ref&gt; His work was perceived as radically new, especially when juxtaposed with the classicist designs of [[Vladimir Favorsky]] (head of the book art section of the same exhibition) and of the foreign exhibits.

In the beginning of 1928, Lissitzky visited [[Cologne]] in preparation for the 1928 Press Show scheduled for April–May 1928. The state delegated Lissitzky to supervise the Soviet program; instead of building their own pavilion, the Soviets rented the existing central pavilion, the largest building on the fairground. To make full use of it, the Soviet program designed by Lissitsky revolved around the theme of a [[film]] show, with nearly continuous presentation of the new feature films, propagandist [[newsreel]]s and early [[animation]], on multiple screens inside the pavilion and on the open-air screens.&lt;ref&gt;Tolstoy, 123-125&lt;/ref&gt; His work was praised for near absence of paper exhibits; &quot;everything moves, rotates, everything is energized&quot; ({{lang-ru|всё движется, заводится, электрифицируется}}).&lt;ref&gt;Tolstoy, 127&lt;/ref&gt; Lissitzky also designed and managed on site less demanding exhibitions like the 1930 [[Hygiene]] show in [[Dresden]].&lt;ref&gt;Tolstoy, 144&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with pavilion design, Lissitzky began experimenting with print media again. His work with book and periodical design was perhaps some of his most accomplished and influential. He launched radical innovations in [[typography]] and [[photomontage]], two fields in which he was particularly adept. He even designed a photomontage birth announcement in 1930 for his recently born son, Jen. [[:Image:Photomontage by El Lissitzky 1930.jpg|The image]] itself is seen as being another personal endorsement of the Soviet Union,&lt;ref name = r5/&gt; as it superimposed an image of the infant Jen over a factory chimney, linking Jen's future with his country's industrial progress. Around this time, El Lissitzky's interest in book design escalated. In his remaining years, some of his most challenging and innovative works in this field would develop. In discussing his vision of the book, he wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In contrast to the old monumental art [the book] itself goes to the people, and does not stand like a cathedral in one place waiting for someone to approach {{nowrap|. . .}} [The book is the] monument of the future.&lt;ref name = r4/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He perceived books as permanent objects that were invested with power. This power was unique in that it could transmit ideas to people of different times, cultures, and interests, and do so in ways other art forms could not. This ambition laced all of his work, particularly in his later years. El Lissitzky was devoted to the idea of creating art with power and purpose, art that could invoke change.

==Later years==
In 1932, [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] closed down independent artists' unions; former avant-garde artists had to adapt to the new climate or risk being officially criticised or even blacklisted. El Lissitzky retained his reputation as the master of exhibition art and management into late thirties. The terminal disease gradually reduced his physical abilities, and he was becoming more and more dependent on his wife in actual completion of his work.&lt;ref&gt;Tupitsyn&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1937, Lissitzky served as the lead decorator for the upcoming [[All-Russia Exhibition Centre|All-Union Agricultural Exhibition]], reporting to the master planner [[Vyacheslav Oltarzhevsky]] but largely independent and highly critical of him. The project was plagued by delays and political interventions. By the end of 1937 the &quot;apparent simplicity&quot; of Lissitzky's artwork aroused the concerns of the political supervisors, and Lissitzky responded: &quot;The simpler the shape, the finer precision and quality of execution required... yet until now [the working crews] are instructed by the foremen (Oltarzhevsky and Korostashevsky), not the authors&quot; (i.e. [[Vladimir Shchuko]], author of the Central Pavillion, and Lissitzky himself).&lt;ref name=T172&gt;Tolsoy, 172-174, cites verbatim a report signed by Lissitzky October 20, 1937&lt;/ref&gt; His artwork, as described in 1937 proposals, completely departed from the modernist art of 1920s in favor of [[socialist realism]]. The iconic statue of Stalin in front of the central pavillion was proposed by Lissitzky personally: &quot;this will give the square its head and its face&quot; ({{lang-ru|Это должно дать площади и голову и лицо}}).&lt;ref name=T172/&gt;

In June 1938, he was only one of seventeen professionals and managers responsible for the Central Pavilion;&lt;ref&gt;Tolstoy, 185&lt;/ref&gt; in October 1938, he shared the responsibility for its Main Hall decoration with Vladimir Akhmetyev.&lt;ref&gt;Tolstoy, 189&lt;/ref&gt; He simultaneously worked on the decoration of the Soviet pavilion for the [[1939 New York World's Fair]]; the June 1938 commission considered Lissitzky's work along with nineteen other proposals and eventually rejected it.&lt;ref&gt;Tolstoy, 400-403&lt;/ref&gt;

Lissitzky's work on the ''USSR im Bau'' (USSR in construction) magazine took his experimentation and innovation with book design to an extreme. In issue #2 he included multiple fold-out pages, presented in concert with other folded pages that together produced design combinations and a narrative structure that was completely original. Each issue focused on a particular issue of the time – a new dam being built, constitutional reforms, [[Red Army]] progress and so on. In 1941, his tuberculosis worsened, but he continued to produce works, one of his last being a propaganda poster for Russia's efforts in [[World War II]], titled &quot;''Davaite pobolshe tankov!''&quot; (Give us more tanks!) He died on December 30, 1941, in Moscow.

==Legacy==
On April 21, 2005 [[Swann Galleries]] sold a copy of Lissitzky's 1929 photomontage image for ''USSR Russische Ausstellung'' for an auction record price of $64,400.
