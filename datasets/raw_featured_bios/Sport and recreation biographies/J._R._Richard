'''James Rodney Richard''' (born March 7, 1950) is a former [[right-handed]] [[starting pitcher]] in [[Major League Baseball]] who played his entire career, from 1971 to 1980, with the [[Houston Astros]].

After leaving high school, Richard was selected by the Astros as the second pick in the first round of the [[1969 Major League Baseball Draft|1969 amateur draft]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/HOU/1969_trans.shtml|title=1969 Houston Astros Trades and Transactions|accessdate=2007-05-10|publisher=Sports Reference, Inc}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the time he made his major league debut with the Astros in 1971 until 1975, Richard had a limited role as an Astros pitcher, throwing no more than 72 [[innings pitched|innings]] in a season.&lt;ref name=&quot;BR&quot;&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/r/richaj.01.shtml|title=J.R. Richard Statistics|accessdate=2007-05-10|publisher=Sports Reference, Inc}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975, Richard played his first full season in the majors as a starting pitcher.

From 1976 to 1980, he was one of the premier pitchers in the majors, leading the [[National League]] twice in [[strikeout]]s, once in [[earned run average]], and three times in [[hits per nine innings|hits allowed per nine innings]], [[win (baseball)|winning]] at least 18&amp;nbsp;games between 1976 and 1979.&lt;ref name=&quot;BR&quot;/&gt; On July 30, 1980, Richard suffered a [[stroke]] and collapsed while playing a game of catch before an Astros game, and was rushed to the hospital for emergency surgery to remove a life-threatening [[thrombus|blood clot]] in his neck. His condition brought a sudden end to his major league career at the age of 30.&lt;ref name=&quot;July1980&quot;&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.baseballlibrary.com/baseballlibrary/chronology/1980JULY.stm|title=July 1980 in baseball|accessdate=2007-05-10|publisher=The Idea Logical Company, Inc}}&lt;/ref&gt; His 313&amp;nbsp;strikeouts in 1979 remains an Astros franchise record, and he held the team's record for career strikeouts (1,493) until 1987.

In 1981, Richard attempted a comeback with the Astros, but this failed because the stroke had slowed down his [[reaction time]] and weakened his [[depth perception]]. He spent the next few seasons in the [[minor league baseball|minor leagues]] before being released by the Astros in 1984. After his professional baseball career ended, Richard became involved in unsuccessful business deals and went through two divorces, which led to him being homeless and destitute in 1994. Richard found [[succor]] in a local church and later became a [[minister (Christianity)|Christian minister]].

==Early life==
Richard was born to Clayton and Lizzie (''née'' Frost) Richard in [[Vienna, Louisiana|Vienna]], [[Louisiana]]&lt;ref&gt;Porter (2000), p. 1276.&lt;/ref&gt; and gained prominence at Lincoln High School in nearby [[Ruston, Louisiana|Ruston]] in both baseball and [[basketball]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Interview&quot;&gt;{{cite web

Richard|accessdate=2007-05-11|date=2001-01-31|last=Kerby|first=Ray|publisher=''The Astros Daily''}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the time he was a high school senior, Richard stood six&amp;nbsp;feet, eight&amp;nbsp;inches tall (2.03&amp;nbsp;m) and weighed {{convert|220|lb|kg st|1}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;p158&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last=Klawans | first=Harold L. | title=Why Michael Could not Hit: And Other Tales of the Neurology of Sports| publisher= W.

Klawans | page=158}}&lt;/ref&gt; That year, he was one of the starting pitchers for Lincoln High School and did not concede a run for the entire season. In one game Richard hit four consecutive [[home run]]s while pitching his team to a 48–0 victory against its local rival, [[Jonesboro, Louisiana|Jonesboro]]'s Jackson High School.&lt;ref name=&quot;AS&quot;&gt;{{cite web

|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/alltime/draft?year=1969|title=MLB First Round Draft Picks – 1969 |accessdate=2008-05-11|publisher=[[ESPN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Richard later recalled, &quot;There were other guys in my high school with as much ability as I had, but instead of working at a job, they wanted to drink wine on Saturday nights. They thought that was the in thing to do, and consequently our lives went in different directions. For some people it takes that to make a world. It does not for me.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reid|first=Ron|date=1978-09-04|title=Sweet whiff of success|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1135814/2/index.htm|journal=[[Sports Illustrated]]|volume=49|issue=10|pages=66–68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early minor league career==
After the Astros drafted Richard, they sent him to play for the Covington Astros, a [[Minor league baseball#Rookie|rookie-level]] [[minor league baseball]] team in the [[Appalachian League]]. Richard started 12&amp;nbsp;games for Covington, finishing with five wins and four [[loss (baseball)|losses]]. Despite accumulating an average of 11.41&amp;nbsp;[[Strikeouts per 9 innings pitched|strikeouts per nine innings]], Richard had trouble throughout the season with his pitching mechanics and [[strike zone|control]]. In 56&amp;nbsp;[[innings pitched|innings]], Richard struck out 71&amp;nbsp;batters but [[base on balls|walked]] 52 and gave up 41&amp;nbsp;[[earned run]]s, resulting in a 6.59 earned run average.&lt;ref name=&quot;AS&quot;/&gt;

The following year, at 20&amp;nbsp;years of age, Richard was promoted to the Cocoa Astros of the [[Florida State League]] in high-A minor league baseball. Richard again compiled a low hits per nine innings (H/9IP) ratio by giving up only 67&amp;nbsp;[[hit (baseball)|hits]] in 109 total innings pitched.&lt;ref name=&quot;AS&quot;/&gt; Despite his 4–11 win–loss record, Richard finished the season with a 2.39&amp;nbsp;ERA and even threw a [[no-hitter]] against the Daytona Beach Dodgers.&lt;ref name=&quot;AS&quot;/&gt; During the season, Richard was able to throw an accurate [[fastball]] which occasionally exceeded 100&amp;nbsp;miles per hour, and his [[slider]] 93&amp;nbsp;miles per hour, faster than those of most major-league pitchers.&lt;ref name=&quot;AS&quot;/&gt; During the 1970–71 off-season, the Astros again promoted Richard: this time to [[AAA (baseball)|Class-AAA baseball]], one step below the major leagues, with the [[Oklahoma City 89ers]] of the now-defunct [[American Association (20th century)|American Association]]. Richard wore number&amp;nbsp;50 and kept that number for the rest of his minor-league and major-league career. Richard started all but one of the games he pitched that season. He pitched eight [[complete game]]s and led the league with 202&amp;nbsp;strikeouts in 173&amp;nbsp;innings of work. He ended the season with twelve&amp;nbsp;wins and seven&amp;nbsp;losses before being called up by the Houston Astros.&lt;ref name=&quot;AS&quot;/&gt;

==Early major league career==
===1971 season===
Richard entered Major League Baseball with the Astros in 1971 as a [[Major League Baseball transactions#25-man and 40-man rosters|September call-up]]. On September 5, Richard made his major league debut at just 21&amp;nbsp;years of age, in the second game of a [[doubleheader (baseball)|doubleheader]] against the [[San Francisco Giants]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/w/willoji01.shtml|title=Jim Willoughby Statistics|accessdate=2007-05-15|publisher=Sports Reference, Inc}}&lt;/ref&gt; Richard used his fastball–slider combination to pick up the win and tied [[Karl Spooner]]'s 17-year-old major league record for striking out 15&amp;nbsp;batters in his first major league start.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Richard made his next start, after five days rest, against the [[Cincinnati Reds]],&lt;ref name=&quot;1971Logs&quot;&gt;{{cite web

In a September 16 match-up against the Astros' division rival, the third-place [[Atlanta Braves]], Richard pitched seven innings and surrendered four runs on seven hits. He struck out nine batters and even struck out the side in the first inning but also walked four batters. Furthermore, he threw two [[wild pitch]]es in the first and fifth innings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===In and out of the minors===
During the next few seasons, Richard split time between the minors and majors and did not become a regular starter with the Astros until 1975. After his &quot;cup of coffee&quot; with the Astros in 1971, Richard was sent back down to Class-AAA baseball to work on his pitching with the Oklahoma City 89ers for the 1972 season. He [[games started|started]] 19&amp;nbsp;games with the 89ers before being called back up to the Astros. In Triple-A baseball in the American Association, Richard finished with 10&amp;nbsp;wins and eight&amp;nbsp;losses in 128&amp;nbsp;innings of work.&lt;ref name=&quot;AS&quot;/&gt; His 3.02&amp;nbsp;ERA was slightly higher than that of the previous season, but he maintained approximately the same [[Bases on balls per 9 innings pitched|walks per nine innings ratio]] (BB/9IP) that he had the previous year. He recorded six complete games and finished with 169&amp;nbsp;strikeouts, for a ratio of 11.88&amp;nbsp;strikeouts per 9&amp;nbsp;innings. Richard re-entered the majors, starting a day game of a day-night doubleheader for the Astros against the [[San Diego Padres]] on July 30, 1972.&lt;ref name=&quot;1972Logs&quot;&gt;{{cite web

In two innings of relief, Richard gave up one hit, struck out three batters and garnered the win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1972/B08140HOU1972.htm|title=August 14, 1972 Game – Houston Astros vs. San Francisco Giants|accessdate=2007-05-17|publisher=Retrosheet}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his two final relief appearances of the season, Richard gave up five earned runs in just over one inning of work.&lt;ref name=&quot;1972Logs&quot;/&gt; He finished the season with a 13.50&amp;nbsp;ERA in only six innings of work and was again sent back down to Triple-A, this time with the Astros-affiliated [[New Orleans Zephyrs|Denver Bears]].

Richard started eight games with the Bears in 1973 and posted minor league career-worsts in ERA and hits allowed per nine innings. Despite his poor performance with the Bears, Richard was again called up by the Astros. Richard entered in the fourth inning of a June 16 game against the St. Louis Cardinals and his idol Bob Gibson. He pitched four innings of one-run ball and three innings of a two-hit game in his next relief outing. Afterwards, the Astros placed Richard in the starting rotation, and he made his first major league start since July 30 of the previous year. He pitched six solid innings of a one-run ballgame and struck out six while walking three batters. Richard would make his next start four days later.&lt;ref name=&quot;1973Logs&quot;&gt;{{cite web

After starting a July 4 game against the [[Atlanta Braves|Braves]] (which he won), Richard was sent into the bullpen to add [[Tom Griffin (baseball)|Tom Griffin]] into the Astros' starting rotation. He made three relief appearances against the [[Washington Nationals|Montreal Expos]] before making a start against the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] on July 27.&lt;ref name=&quot;1973Logs&quot;/&gt; Four days later, Richard threw his first [[shutout]] against the Dodgers, in which he gave up just five hits and struck out nine batters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

He finished with a 4.00&amp;nbsp;ERA, and struck out 75&amp;nbsp;batters in 72&amp;nbsp;innings. He walked 38&amp;nbsp;batters, giving him a ratio of 4.75&amp;nbsp;walks per nine innings, which was lower than the ratio he had had in his two previous minor league seasons.&lt;ref name=&quot;AS&quot;/&gt;

Despite his improved performance in the 1973 season, Richard was sent down to work on his pitching mechanics and ball control in Class-AA baseball with the [[Carolina Mudcats|Columbus Astros]] of the [[Southern League (baseball)|Southern League]]. He started 13&amp;nbsp;games with Columbus before being moved back up to Class-AAA with the Denver Bears. In four starts with the Bears, Richard threw three shutouts and pitched 33 scoreless innings with a 4–0 record and 26&amp;nbsp;strikeouts.&lt;ref name=&quot;AS&quot;/&gt; He was called back into the majors on July 13 and stayed with the Astros for the remainder of the season. He first pitched 14&amp;nbsp;innings of baseball in six relief appearances before being placed on the starting rotation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Richard finished with a 4.18&amp;nbsp;ERA in just over 64&amp;nbsp;innings of work during the 15&amp;nbsp;pitching appearances he made during the season.&lt;ref name=&quot;BR&quot;/&gt;

Even though Richard's statistics showed he bounced between Houston and the minors during his first four years with the Astros due to his wildness, he often told reporters that racism played a role in keeping him from becoming a regular with the big club sooner.&lt;ref name=&quot;TBT&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=The Team-by-Team Encyclopedia of Major League Baseball |last=Purdy |first=Dennis |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2006 |publisher=[[Workman Publishing Company|Workman]] |location=[[New York City]] |isbn=0761139435 |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mainstay with the Astros==
In the off-season, the Astros traded starting pitcher [[Claude Osteen]] to the Cardinals, and lost pitching ace [[Don Wilson (baseball)|Don Wilson]], who died from [[carbon monoxide poisoning]] at the age of 29 on January 5, 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Breakout season===
Richard entered the 1976 season as the pitching staff [[ace (baseball)|ace]] and took over Larry Dierker's position as the [[Opening Day]] starter for the Astros.

He had 18&amp;nbsp;wins and 12&amp;nbsp;losses in 267&amp;nbsp;innings pitched and posted a 2.97&amp;nbsp;ERA and 214&amp;nbsp;strikeouts. For the first time since becoming a permanent member of the Astros' starting rotation, Richard was not the league leader in walks allowed, but as he had done in 1976, he led the league in wild pitches. He finished fourth in the league with 13 complete games, and he improved his fielding from the previous season by going through an error-free season.&lt;ref name=&quot;BR&quot;/&gt;

Richard hit well for a pitcher, going 20-for-87 in the season with two triples, two home runs and seven runs batted in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In early 1978, he was a participant in [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC's]] [[Superstars]] all-around sports competition.&lt;ref name=&quot;AS&quot;/&gt;

===Record-setting year===
Richard entered the 1978 season as the Astros' [[Opening Day]] starter. In the first game of the season, he gave up seven runs on 11 hits and just made it into the fifth inning before being replaced in a loss to the Cincinnati Reds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

He struck out 67 and gave up only 39&amp;nbsp;hits in the 63&amp;nbsp;total innings he pitched. On a June 9 start against the Cardinals, Richard struck out 12&amp;nbsp;batters but also walked six and gave up five earned runs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

After the break, Richard threw an 11-inning, 10-strikeout game against the Expos and followed with two complete games and another nine-inning performance in a game that went into extra innings.&lt;ref name=&quot;1978Logs&quot;/&gt; He was selected as the National League [[Pitcher of the Month]] after going a perfect 4–0 with a 1.29&amp;nbsp;ERA and 58&amp;nbsp;strikeouts in 56&amp;nbsp;innings during July.&lt;ref name=&quot;AS&quot;/&gt; Throughout much of August, his season ERA hovered below 3.00, and he averaged well over a strikeout per inning. On August 21, in an 8–3 victory over the [[Chicago Cubs]], he broke Don Wilson's 1969 club record of 235&amp;nbsp;strikeouts. In the final two months of the season, Richard's strikeout average dramatically increased, and he struck out a double-digit number of batters in three of his last five starts.&lt;ref name=&quot;1978Logs&quot;/&gt; In his third-to-last start, Richard broke [[Tom Seaver]]'s NL record of 290&amp;nbsp;strikeouts by a right-hander when he struck out [[Bob Horner]]. In his final outing of the season, Richard reached the 300-strikeout pinnacle by striking out [[Rowland Office]] in a September 28 victory over the Braves. He also hit his seventh career home run, making him the Astros' career leader in home runs by a pitcher.&lt;ref name=&quot;AS&quot;/&gt; At that time, he became only the tenth pitcher, third National Leaguer and first NL right-hander in history to strike out more than 300&amp;nbsp;batters in a single season.&lt;ref name=&quot;AS&quot;/&gt;

Richard finished the season with 18&amp;nbsp;wins, 11&amp;nbsp;losses and a 3.11&amp;nbsp;ERA. He led the team's pitching staff in innings pitched, starts, complete games, shutouts, hits allowed, earned runs, walks allowed and strikeouts. He held batters to a .156 batting average at home&lt;ref name=&quot;AS&quot;/&gt; and a .196 average overall, which was the lowest in the NL.&lt;ref name=&quot;p159&quot;&gt;Klawans (1996), p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt; Richard again fared well in the field, finishing with three errors and a 0.957 fielding percentage, slightly higher than the 0.950 league average.&lt;ref name=&quot;BR&quot;/&gt; He finished fourth in the Cy Young Award voting, behind [[Gaylord Perry]], [[Burt Hooton]] and [[Vida Blue]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===1979 season===
In his second game of the 1979 season, Richard set the modern-day record for throwing six wild pitches in a single game against the Dodgers. Despite this, he finished the game with a 13-strikeout performance in a 2–1 Astros victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==1980 season and stroke==

In 1980, Richard was now teamed with seven-time [[American League]] strikeout champion Nolan Ryan, who had joined the Astros as a free agent.  During the first half of the season, Richard was virtually unhittable, starting the year with five straight wins, 48&amp;nbsp;strikeouts (including two starts with 12 and 13&amp;nbsp;strikeouts), and a sub-2.00 ERA.&lt;ref name=&quot;1980GL&quot;&gt;{{cite web

Richard 1980 Pitching Gamelogs|accessdate=2007-05-12|publisher=Sports Reference, Inc}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was named National League Pitcher of the Month for April. At one point, Richard threw three straight complete-game shutouts, two against the Giants and one against the Cubs.&lt;ref name=&quot;1980GL&quot;/&gt; On July 3, he broke Dierker's team record of 1487 career strikeouts in a 5–3 win over the Braves; it was to be Richard's last major league victory. After finishing the first half of the season with a 10–4 record, 115&amp;nbsp;strikeouts and a 1.96&amp;nbsp;ERA,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Richard 1980 Pitching Gamelogs: April 10&amp;nbsp;– July 3|accessdate=2007-05-12|publisher=Sports Reference, Inc}}&lt;/ref&gt; Richard was selected to be the National League's starting pitcher in the All-Star Game on July 8, but he pitched just two innings due to various back and shoulder problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;July1980&quot;/&gt; As the season progressed, Richard began to complain of a &quot;dead arm&quot;, citing discomfort in his shoulder and forearm.&lt;ref name=&quot;July1980&quot;/&gt; His concerns fell on deaf ears. Some in the media even interpreted these complaints as whining or malingering, citing Richard's reputation for moodiness.&lt;ref name=&quot;TBT&quot;/&gt;  Others theorized that Richard was egotistical and could not handle the pressure of pitching for the Astros,&lt;ref name=&quot;AS&quot;/&gt; while others suggested he was jealous of Ryan's $4.5 million contract.&lt;ref name=&quot;TBT&quot;/&gt;

During his next start on July 14 against the Braves, Richard was pitching well and even struck out the side in the second inning, but had trouble seeing [[catcher]] [[Alan Ashby]]'s signs and also had difficulty moving his arm. He left the game in the fourth inning after throwing a fastball and feeling his right arm go &quot;dead&quot;. He had numbness in the fingers of his right hand and could not grasp a baseball.&lt;ref&gt;Klawans (1996), p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt; The Astros placed Richard on the 21-day disabled list.&lt;ref name=&quot;July1980&quot;/&gt; As it turned out, it would be his last major league game.

Nine days later, he checked into [[The Methodist Hospital|Methodist Hospital]] in Houston for a series of physical and psychological tests to determine the cause of his mysterious arm problems. An [[angiogram]] revealed an obstruction in the distal [[subclavian artery|subclavian]] and [[axillary artery|axillary arteries]] of the right arm. Richard's blood pressure in his left arm was normal but pressure was nearly absent in his right arm due to the completely obstructed artery.&lt;ref name=&quot;p162&quot;&gt;Klawans (1996), p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt; On July 25, however, the arteries in his neck were studied, and the doctors reached a conclusion that all was normal and no surgical treatment needed to be performed.&lt;ref name=&quot;AS&quot;/&gt;

On July 30, Richard went to see a [[chiropractor]] who rotated his neck to fix the flow of blood in his upper torso region. Later that day, Richard was participating in warm-ups before the game when he suffered a major stroke and collapsed in the outfield. Before the stroke, he had a headache and a feeling of weakness through his body. Eventually, that progressed into vision problems and paralysis in the left side of his body.&lt;ref&gt;Klawans (1996), p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt; A massive blockage in his right carotid artery necessitated emergency surgery that evening. An examination by [[neurologist]] William S. Fields showed that Richard was still experiencing weakness in his extremities and on the left side of his face. He also had blurred vision through his left eye. A [[Computed tomography|CAT scan]] of Richard's brain later showed that Richard had experienced three separate strokes from the different obstructions in his arterial system. Furthermore, the arteries in his right arm were still obstructed.&lt;ref&gt;Klawans (1996), p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt; Later examinations showed that Richard was suffering from extensive [[thoracic outlet syndrome|arterial thoracic outlet syndrome]]. While pitching, his [[clavicle]] and first [[rib]] pinched his [[subclavian artery]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Robbins&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last=Robbins | first=Mike | title=Ninety Feet from Fame: Close Calls With Baseball Immortality| publisher= Carroll &amp; Graf Publishers| location= New York| year = 2004|isbn=0-7867-1335-6 | page=767 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this problem, Richard would feel normal for the first few innings of the game but after putting repeated pressure on his subclavian artery, his arm would start to ache in pain and eventually start to feel &quot;heavy&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Klawans (1996), p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt; His wife at the time, Carolyn, told reporters, &quot;It took death, or nearly death, to get an apology.

Richard underwent rehabilitation and missed the rest of the season. Meanwhile, the Astros recovered from the loss of one of their staff aces and qualified for the [[1980 National League Championship Series|playoffs]] for the first time in the club's 18-year history.

===Comeback attempt===
In 1981, Richard underwent a rehabilitation program with the aim of recovering from the effects of the stroke. He trained with the Astros and the [[Texas Southern University]] team, participating regularly in pitching and batting practice with both towards the end of the baseball season. After pitching in a few simulated games, Richard was placed on the 40-man [[Major League Baseball rosters|active roster]] on September 1, 1981. Astros manager [[Bill Virdon]] thought Richard was not ready to return, so Richard did not pitch with the team during the last two months of the season.&lt;ref name=&quot;AS&quot;/&gt;

The following year, Richard pitched in a single [[spring training]] game and then went into extended spring training in [[Sarasota, Florida|Sarasota]], [[Florida]], during the first two months of the season. There he registered three wins and two losses and a 3.38&amp;nbsp;ERA in seven starts with thirty-two total innings. Afterwards, he joined the major league rehabilitation program with the Daytona Beach Astros of the Florida State League.&lt;ref name=&quot;AS&quot;/&gt; In his six starts, Richard notched three wins, two complete games and posted a 2.79&amp;nbsp;ERA. He was then promoted to Triple-A baseball with the [[Tucson Toros]] of the [[Pacific Coast League]]. He struggled to control the ball, conceding a high number of runs to opposing teams. He took a loss on August 12 against the [[Phoenix Giants]] and on August 27 against the [[Salt Lake City Gulls]] in a 13–0 rout.&lt;ref name=&quot;AS&quot;/&gt; His longest outing as a starter—more than five innings—was an appearance against the Giants in the last game of the season on September 1. He then joined the Astros' extended roster but did not play in any games.

In 1983, Richard started to complain of pain in his left calf. The synthetic graft inserted in his July 1980 surgery had closed off, which meant that he needed a [[Coronary artery bypass surgery|surgical bypass]] in his left leg.&lt;ref&gt;Klawans (1996), p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt; Richard was granted free agency by the Astros on November 7, 1983, but the Astros still had faith in him, so he was re-signed on February 17 of the following year.&lt;ref name=&quot;BR&quot;/&gt; Just a little over two months later, he was released by the Astros, thus ending his baseball career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/HOU/1984_trans.shtml|title=1984 Houston Astros Trades and Transactions|accessdate=2007-05-18|publisher=Sports Reference, Inc}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite an almost complete recovery, the risk of future complications was so great that he never pitched again. His final major league record was 107–71, with 1,493&amp;nbsp;strikeouts and a 3.15&amp;nbsp;ERA in 238&amp;nbsp;games and 1,606&amp;nbsp;innings.&lt;ref name=&quot;AS&quot;/&gt; Nolan Ryan broke his Astros record for career strikeouts in 1987.

==After baseball==
After his professional baseball career ended, Richard returned to Louisiana and invested in some business ventures. He fell prey to an oil business scam, losing over US[[Dollar sign|$]]300,000 in the deal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robbins&quot;/&gt; A few years later, Richard paid US $669,000 in a divorce settlement to his ex-wife, Carolyn. He married and divorced again&lt;!--name of the woman?--&gt;, losing his suburban Houston home and most of his money.&lt;ref name=&quot;SN&quot;/&gt; In 1989, Richard was drafted into the [[Senior Professional Baseball Association]] and played for the [[Orlando Juice]] but was cut from the team in pre-season play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE6D9103FF934A15753C1A96F948260|title=Baseball Deals|accessdate=2007-05-18|date=1989-10-27|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the winter of 1994, Richard was homeless and destitute and lived under a bridge in Houston.&lt;ref name=&quot;AS&quot;/&gt; The savage pit of homelessness that Richard fell into was a tragic demise for a former Major League baseball star but he learned to deal with it with pride and dignity.

By 1995, Richard was eligible for his major league baseball [[pension]]. He  participated in the [[Old-Timers' Day]] game with the Astros in the same year. In the following months, after spending many nights under the overpass Highway 59 at Beechnut Road in Houston, he turned to the Now Testament Church and sought help from its minister, Reverend Floyd Lewis. Richard overcame his homelessness by working with this minister, with a belief that he &quot;always knew God was on his side&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;SN&quot;/&gt; Richard started working at an asphalt company and later returned to the church as a minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseballlibrary.com/chronology/flashback.php?date=1980_7_30|title=Stroke Ends Richard's Career|accessdate=2007-06-10|last=Hale|first=Nathan|publisher=Baseball Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard became involved in the Houston community and started working with local financial donors to help establish baseball programs for children.&lt;ref name=&quot;AS&quot;/&gt; A small-budget 2005 movie, ''Resurrection: The J.R. Richard Story'', depicted Richard's baseball career as well as his life after baseball.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astrosdaily.com/files/team/richard/richard.html|title=J.R.'s movie not really J.R.'s movie|accessdate=2007-05-18|date=2005-04-16|last=Herskowitz|first=Mickey|publisher=''[[Houston Chronicle]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;
