'''William McGregor''' ({{Nowrap|13 April}} 1846 – {{Nowrap|20 December}} 1911)&lt;ref name=&quot;grave&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.search.digitalhandsworth.org.uk/engine/resource/default.asp?txtKeywords=grave&amp;lstContext=&amp;lstResourceType=&amp;lstExhibitionType=&amp;chkPurchaseVisible=&amp;txtDateFrom=&amp;txtDateTo=&amp;originator=%2Fengine%2Fsearch%2Fdefault%5Fhndlr%2Easp&amp;page=&amp;records=&amp;direction=&amp;pointer=3447&amp;text=0&amp;resource=3826|title=Grave of William McGregor in St Mary's Graveyard|publisher=Birmingham City Council|work=Digital Handsworth|accessdate=16 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;L1&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=The Legends of Aston Villa|first=Tony|last=Matthews|publisher=Breedon Books Publishing Co. Ltd|year=2007|isbn=1-85983-580-5|page=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an [[association football]] administrator in the [[Victorian era]] who is regarded as the founder of [[the Football League]], the first organised association football league in the world.

After moving from [[Perthshire]] to [[Birmingham]] to set up business as a [[draper]], McGregor became involved with local football club [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]], which he helped to establish as one of the leading teams in England.  He served the club for over 20 years in various capacities, including president, director and chairman. In 1888, frustrated by the regular cancellation of Villa's matches, McGregor organised a meeting of representatives of England's leading clubs, which led to the formation of the Football League, giving member clubs a guaranteed fixture list each season.  This was instrumental in the transition of football from an amateur pastime to a professional business.

McGregor served as both chairman and president of the Football League and was also chairman of [[the Football Association]] (the FA).  He was recognised by the FA for his service to the game shortly before his death in 1911, and was posthumously honoured by the local football authorities and Aston Villa.

==Personal life==
Born in [[Braco]] in [[Perthshire]], Scotland, McGregor first became interested in [[association football|football]] after watching a match between locals and visiting artisans at [[Ardoch]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Inglis1&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=League Football and the Men Who Made It|first=Simon|last=Inglis|publisher=Willow Books|year=1988|isbn=0-00-218242-4|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PKC&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pkc.gov.uk/Education+and+learning/Libraries+archives+and+learning+centres/Libraries+-+local+and+special+collections/Local+Studies/Amazing+past+Perthshire/The+FA+and+Braco.htm|title=The FA and Braco|publisher=Perth and Kinross Council|accessdate=9 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He served an apprenticeship as a [[draper]] in [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]], and in 1870, following the example of his brother Peter, moved to [[Birmingham]],&lt;ref name=&quot;PKC&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Inglis31&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=League Football and the Men Who Made It|first=Simon|last=Inglis|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and opened his own drapery business in [[Aston]], an area just outside the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;stat&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.birminghammail.net/birmingham-sport/aston-villa-fc/aston-villa-news/2008/04/03/william-mcgregor-statue-a-step-closer-thanks-to-aston-villa-supporters-97319-20714293/|title=William McGregor statue a step closer thanks to Aston Villa supporters|work=Birmingham Mail|accessdate=16 July 2008|date=3 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Upon his arrival in the [[English Midlands]] he became involved with a local football club, Calthorpe, which had been formed by a fellow Scot, Campbell Orr.&lt;ref name=&quot;PKC&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;OND&quot;&gt;{{cite web|first=Tony|last= Mason|title=McGregor, William (1847–1911)|work=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2004|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/50401|accessdate=24 July 2008}} (accessible with a UK library card)&lt;/ref&gt;  McGregor was enthusiastic enough about the game to arrange for his shop to close early on Saturdays to allow him to watch matches, and he later sold football [[Kit (association football)|kits]] at the shop, which became a popular meeting place for football enthusiasts.&lt;ref name=&quot;OND&quot; /&gt;

McGregor was married to Jessie, and the couple had a daughter and a son, also named Jessie and William.&lt;ref name=&quot;OND&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Inglis363&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=League Football and the Men Who Made It|first=Simon|last=Inglis|page=363}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[teetotaller]], McGregor was a supporter of the [[Temperance movement]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Inglis108&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=League Football and the Men Who Made It|first=Simon|last=Inglis|page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was active in the local branch of the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] until his membership lapsed in 1882 due to the increasing amount of time he devoted to football.&lt;ref name=&quot;Inglis4&quot;/&gt;  He was involved in the early attempts to establish a baseball league in the United Kingdom, and served as the honorary treasurer of the Baseball Association of Great Britain and Ireland.&lt;ref name=&quot;baseball&quot; /&gt;  Despite his commitment to sport, he held desperately on to his drapery business throughout his life.&lt;ref name=&quot;L2&quot; /&gt;

McGregor was a committed [[Christian]] who was widely respected for his honesty and integrity. He worshipped for forty years at the Congregational church in Wheeler Street, Aston. His pastor, the Revd. W.G. Percival said that the best thing about him &quot;was not so much the genial, kindly, honest sportsman, but the Christian behind it all&quot;. He described him as &quot;a man of absolutely unblemished personal character&quot; .&lt;ref name=&quot;god&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Thank God for Football!|first=Peter|last=Lupson|publisher=[[Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge]]|year=2010|isbn=1-9026-9430-6|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Association with Aston Villa==

In 1877, McGregor was invited to become a committee member of [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]], a club formed three years earlier.  He also umpired matches for the club.{{ref label|ump|A|}}&lt;ref name=&quot;OND&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PL&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.premierleague.com/page/aston-villa|title=Club Profile: Aston Villa|publisher=The Premier League|accessdate=16 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the time the club played at [[Aston Park, Birmingham|Aston Park]], close to the premises of McGregor's business.&lt;ref name=&quot;HOF&quot; /&gt;  He became interested in joining Villa due to the strong Scottish contingent in the club's ranks,&lt;ref name=&quot;PKC&quot; /&gt; the team's exciting style of play, and the club's connection to a [[John Wesley|Wesleyan]] Chapel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Inglis3&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=League Football and the Men Who Made It|first=Simon|last=Inglis|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He quickly assumed the post of club administrator,&lt;ref name=&quot;L1&quot; /&gt; helping the impecunious club to survive its financial troubles.  After some of Aston Villa's possessions were seized by bailiffs, McGregor allowed the club to use his shop as a store to prevent further seizures.&lt;ref name=&quot;Inglis3&quot;/&gt; Under McGregor's leadership, Aston Villa won their first trophy, the [[Birmingham Senior Cup]], in 1880,&lt;ref name=&quot;BSC&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avfc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/VillaLegendsDetails/0,,10265~1107989,00.html|title=Villa Legends: George Ramsay|publisher=Aston Villa F.C|accessdate=24 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; shortly after which McGregor became the club's president.&lt;ref name=&quot;L1&quot; /&gt;

The following year McGregor became a member of the club's board of directors.&lt;ref name=&quot;L1&quot; /&gt;  Villa's standing within the game continued to grow, and in 1887 the club became the first from the [[English Midlands|Midlands]] to win the [[FA Cup]], defeating local rivals [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] in the final.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of British Football|first=Phil|last=Soar|coauthors=Martin Tyler|publisher=Willow Books|year=1983|isbn=0-00-218049-9|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1895, McGregor became vice-chairman, and went on to become the club's chairman in 1897.&lt;ref name=&quot;L1&quot; /&gt;  During his time at the club he was noted for his organisational skills and ambition,&lt;ref name=&quot;BB&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/west_midlands/4703991.stm|title=Demolition for Villa birthplace|publisher=BBC|date=21 July 2005|accessdate=24 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was responsible for adopting the lion rampant depicted on the [[Royal Standard of Scotland]], as the club's crest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Aston Villa Miscellany|first=Dave|last=Woodhall|publisher=Vision Sports Publishing Ltd|year=2007|isbn=1-905326-17-3|page=16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Founder of the Football League==
As the 1880s progressed, the balance of power within English football began to change. The first national competition, the FA Cup, had previously been dominated by amateur clubs from privileged backgrounds, such as [[Wanderers F.C.|Wanderers]] and [[Old Etonians F.C.|Old Etonians]]. However the [[1883 FA Cup Final]] saw the first victory by a working-class team, [[Blackburn Olympic F.C.|Blackburn Olympic]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Goldblatt&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Goldblatt |first=David |title=The Ball is Round: A Global History of Football |publisher=Penguin|location=London |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-14-101582-8|pages=37–47}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this time professionalism was not permitted. Clubs from urban areas in the north were strong advocates of the practice, but the southern amateur teams and the FA authorities were firmly opposed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goldblatt&quot;/&gt; Though not initially an advocate of professionalism, McGregor came to favour its introduction.&lt;ref name=&quot;Inglis4&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=League Football and the Men Who Made It|first=Simon|last=Inglis|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1885 the issue threatened to split the FA when a group of clubs, predominantly from [[Lancashire]], announced their intention to leave and form a rival British Football Association if professionalism was not accepted.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goldblatt&quot;/&gt; An emergency FA conference was called in response. Representing Aston Villa, McGregor spoke in favour of professionalism, the only delegate from the Midlands to do so, and was one of the few delegates to admit that his club had been paying players.&lt;ref name=&quot;Inglis4&quot;/&gt; Though not as outspoken as stronger proponents, such as Preston North End's [[William Sudell]], McGregor was well respected.&lt;ref name=&quot;Inglis4&quot;/&gt; The conference ended with the FA accepting professionalism, although each club was permitted only to pay players who had been born or lived for at least two years within six miles of its home stadium.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goldblatt&quot;/&gt;

Professionalism brought fresh complications for club administrators.  Many [[Exhibition match|friendlies]] were cancelled due to opponents' FA Cup or [[county cup]] matches taking precedence or clubs simply failing to honour a fixture in favour of a more lucrative match elsewhere.  This made it hard for the clubs to pay players' wages on a regular basis.&lt;ref name=&quot;PS1&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of British Football|first=Phil|last=Soar|coauthors=Martin Tyler|page=162}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;HD&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Boots, Balls and Haircuts: An Illustrated History of Football from Then to Now|first=Hunter|last=Davies|pages=39–41|publisher=Cassell Illustrated|year=2003|isbn=1-84403-261-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  McGregor took action after seeing Villa matches cancelled, to the increasing frustration of the club's fans, on five consecutive Saturdays.&lt;ref name=&quot;HD&quot; /&gt;  On {{Nowrap|2 March}} 1888,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=National Pastime: How Americans Play Baseball and the Rest of the World plays Soccer |first=Stefan |last=Szymanski|coauthors= Andrew S.

Lane Jackson, writing in 1899, stated that McGregor took his inspiration from the existing league set-up used in American [[baseball]],&lt;ref name=&quot;baseball&quot;&gt;{{cite book  |first=Stefan |last=Szymanski|coauthors=Andrew S. Zimbalist|title=National Pastime: How Americans Play Baseball and the Rest of the World Plays Soccer |pages=43–44}}&lt;/ref&gt; although McGregor himself cited the [[County Cricket Championship]] as his inspiration.&lt;ref name=&quot;Inglis7&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=League Football and the Men Who Made It|first=Simon|last=Inglis|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  McGregor's letter to the clubs read:&lt;ref name=&quot;11v11&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.11v11.com/index.php?pageID=478|title=The Football League – Part 17 of the History of Football|publisher=The Association of Football Statisticians|accessdate=16 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Every year it is becoming more and more difficult for football clubs of any standing to meet their friendly engagements and even arrange friendly matches. The consequence is that at the last moment, through cup-tie interference, clubs are compelled to take on teams who will not attract the public.&lt;/br&gt;
I beg to tender the following suggestion as a means of getting over the difficulty: that ten or twelve of the most prominent clubs in England combine to arrange home-and-away fixtures each season, the said fixtures to be arranged at a friendly conference about the same time as the International Conference.&lt;/br&gt;
This combination might be known as the Association Football Union, and could be managed by representative from each club. Of course, this is in no way to interfere with the National Association; even the suggested matches might be played under cup-tie rules. However, this is a detail.&lt;/br&gt;
My object in writing to you at present is merely to draw your attention to the subject, and to suggest a friendly conference to discuss the matter more fully. I would take it as a favour if you would kindly think the matter over, and make whatever suggestions you deem necessary.
I am only writing to the following – Blackburn Rovers, Bolton Wanderers, Preston North End, West Bromwich Albion, and Aston Villa, and would like to hear what other clubs you would suggest.&lt;/br&gt;
I am, yours very truly, William McGregor (Aston Villa F.C.)&lt;br /&gt;
P.S. How would Friday, 23rd March, 1888, suit for the friendly conference at Anderton's Hotel, London?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

McGregor chose 23 March as the date of his proposed meeting because it was the day before the [[1888 FA Cup Final|FA Cup final]] and representatives of the country's top clubs would be in [[London]].&lt;ref name=&quot;HD&quot; /&gt; Representatives from ten clubs attended, including the FA Cup finalists West Bromwich Albion and Preston North End,&lt;ref name=&quot;manchistory&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=James |first=Gary |title=Manchester – A Football History |publisher=James Ward |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-9558127-0-5|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it quickly became clear that clubs from the South of England were not interested in McGregor's proposal and none attended. A second meeting was held in [[Manchester]] on {{Nowrap|17 April}}, and details concerning the new competition were finalised.&lt;ref name=&quot;PS1&quot; /&gt;  McGregor's suggested name for the competition, &quot;The Association Football Union&quot; was rejected as too similar to that of the [[Rugby Football Union]] and &quot;[[The Football League]]&quot; was chosen, despite McGregor's opposition on the grounds that he felt it might invoke associations with the unpopular [[Irish Land League]].&lt;ref name=&quot;PS2&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of British Football|first=Phil|last=Soar|coauthors=Martin Tyler|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''English League'' was avoided, to leave the possibility of future applications from Scottish clubs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Inglis15&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=League Football and the Men Who Made It|first=Simon|last=Inglis|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  McGregor also proposed a rule that only one club from each town should be included.  The other founders agreed to this rule, which caused controversy, as it meant Birmingham team [[Birmingham St George's F.C.|Mitchell St. George's]] were denied membership in favour of McGregor's Aston Villa.&lt;ref name=&quot;manchistory&quot;/&gt; Twelve clubs kicked off the first season of League football in September 1888.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fchd.btinternet.co.uk/lghist/fl/fl1889.htm|title=Football League 1888–89|publisher=The Football Club History Database|accessdate=16 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:JJBentley.jpg|thumb|right|[[John Bentley (football manager)|John Bentley]], McGregor's successor as Football League president, criticised McGregor for his failure to attend many meetings during his later spell as League president.|alt=A head and shoulders view of a man with thinning hair and a moustache.  He is wearing a suit jacket and tie.]]
McGregor served as the first chairman of the League's Management Committee. One of the committee's main jobs was handling issues of discipline, but committee members were not barred from involvement in decisions involving their own clubs. In fact, the first disciplinary meeting saw fines issued to three of the four clubs with representatives on the committee.&lt;ref name=&quot;Inglis18&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=League Football and the Men Who Made It|first=Simon|last=Inglis|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; McGregor was re-elected unopposed in 1891.  Earlier he had spoken of his pleasure that &quot;of the 132 matches in which the League clubs have taken part and in which about 300 players have taken the field, not a single fatal accident has to be recorded&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Inglis23&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=League Football and the Men Who Made It|first=Simon|last=Inglis|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; A year later he oversaw the expansion of the Football League into two divisions when the rival [[Football Alliance]] was merged into the competition, but he relinquished his post later that year due to ill health, which caused him to miss meetings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Inglis26&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=League Football and the Men Who Made It|first=Simon|last=Inglis|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After stepping down as chairman, he was unanimously elected to an honorary position of president, a role he kept until 1894, and was named the first-ever life member of the League in 1895.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of British Football |first=Richard |last=Cox|coauthors= Dave Russell, Wray Vamplew|publisher=Routledge|year=2002|isbn=0-7146-5249-0|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The role was that of a figurehead with little actual authority, but he was used as a mediator to resolve league disagreements.&lt;ref name=&quot;Inglis32&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=League Football and the Men Who Made It|first=Simon|last=Inglis|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the second half of the decade McGregor's failure to attend many committee meetings led to criticism from [[John Bentley (football manager)|John Bentley]], his successor as president. Bentley's criticism achieved the desired effect; from 1899 until his health deteriorated in 1910, McGregor seldom missed a meeting.&lt;ref name=&quot;Inglis46&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=League Football and the Men Who Made It|first=Simon|last=Inglis|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period McGregor was noted for his reserved nature. He was silent for large parts of committee meetings, but would contribute enthusiastically on the occasions he felt his input was necessary.&lt;ref name=&quot;Inglis32&quot;/&gt;

Between 1888 and 1894 McGregor also served as chairman of [[The Football Association]] (the FA), English football's overall governing body, which had existed since 1863.&lt;ref name=&quot;L1&quot; /&gt;  He became known as a football celebrity, writing a weekly column for the ''[[Birmingham Gazette]]'' and endorsing products such as footballs,&lt;ref name=&quot;OND&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Inglis32&quot;/&gt; and a type of football boot which the manufacturer billed as the &quot;McGregor lace-to-toe boot&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Inglis85&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=League Football and the Men Who Made It|first=Simon|last=Inglis|page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though he held many different administrative posts in his lifetime, McGregor never played the sport competitively; his only on-pitch involvement was occasional goalkeeping during Aston Villa practices in the 1870s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Inglis3&quot;/&gt;

Although McGregor envisaged the League as a friendly union, within which clubs would share ticket revenues and work together in their mutual best interests, the immediate effect of its creation was that football came to be treated as a business for the first time, as opposed to something that players and officials simply regarded as a pastime.&lt;ref name=&quot;baseball&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;HD&quot; /&gt;  All the clubs involved experienced significant increases in their turnover, which at Aston Villa, McGregor's own club, increased more than sixfold between 1889 and 1899.&lt;ref name=&quot;baseball&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;HD&quot; /&gt;  The wages paid to players, however, remained low due to restrictions imposed by the FA, so clubs were able to use their increased profitability to build larger stadiums and accommodate ever larger crowds of spectators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=National Pastime: How Americans Play Baseball and the Rest of the World plays Soccer |first=Stefan |last=Szymanski|coauthors= Andrew S. Zimbalist|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the League initially contained a small number of clubs, all of which were based in the northern half of the country, by the early years of the twentieth century it included clubs from all parts of England.  At its peak nearly 100 clubs played in the Football League, and it remained the pre-eminent competition in English football until the 1990s, when the top clubs broke away to form the [[Premier League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fchd.btinternet.co.uk/lghist/fl/fl.htm|title=Football League|publisher=The Football Club History Database|accessdate=17 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In keeping with McGregor's views on mutual support and co-operation, gate receipts were shared amongst the clubs until the 1980s, which helped to ensure that a select few wealthy clubs were not able to dominate the competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of British Football |first=Richard |last=Cox|coauthors= Dave Russell, Wray Vamplew|page=173}}&lt;/ref&gt;  McGregor himself had little interest in the business aspect of football, and was adamant that the Football League should not challenge the longstanding authority of the FA.&lt;ref name=&quot;baseball&quot; /&gt;  The success of the Football League directly inspired the creation of similar competitions in other countries, beginning with Scotland, where the [[Scottish Football League]] was formed in 1890.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/sportscotland/asportingnation/article/0010/page02.shtml|title=A Sporting Nation – Scottish League formed|publisher=BBC|accessdate=17 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1910, McGregor was taken ill and later confined to a nursing home.&lt;ref name=&quot;L2&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=The Legends of Aston Villa|first=Tony|last=Matthews|page=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; His condition worsened towards the end of 1911.
