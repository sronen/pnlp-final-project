'''Ian Michael Chappell''' (born 26 September 1943) is a former [[cricket]]er who played for [[Southern Redbacks|South Australia]] and [[Australia national cricket team|Australia]].  He captained Australia between 1971 and 1975 before taking a central role in the breakaway [[World Series Cricket]] organisation. Born into a cricketing family&amp;mdash;his grandfather and brother also captained Australia&amp;mdash;Chappell made a hesitant start to international cricket playing as a right-hand middle-order [[batsman]] and [[Spin bowling|spin bowler]]. He found his niche when promoted to bat at [[Batting order (cricket)|number three]]. Known as &quot;Chappelli&quot;, he earned a reputation as one of the greatest captains the game has seen.&lt;ref name=MCG&gt;[http://www.mcg.org.au/default.asp?pg=toursdisplay&amp;articleid=119 MCG biography: Ian Chappell.] Retrieved 20 August 2007. {{Wayback | url=http://www.mcg.org.au/default.asp?pg=toursdisplay&amp;articleid=119 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; | date=20070904233752 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/133946.html Cricinfo: An Aussie to the core.] Retrieved 30 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://thehindu.com/2007/07/03/stories/2007070360362100.htm ''The Hindu'': ESPN-STAR sports sign Ian Chappell.] Retrieved 2 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SAHOF&gt;[http://www.sahof.org.au/hallOfFame/memberProfile/index.php?memberID=34&amp;memberType=athlete Sport Australia Hall of Fame: Ian Chappell.] Retrieved 12 November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Chappell's blunt verbal manner led to a series of confrontations with opposition players and cricket administrators; the issue of [[sledging (cricket)|sledging]] first arose during his tenure as captain and he was a driving force behind the professionalisation of Australian cricket in the 1970s.&lt;ref name=Cashman&gt;Cashman et al. (1996), p 103.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Arlott]] called him, &quot;a cricketer of effect rather than the graces&quot;.&lt;ref name=CricinfoProfile&gt;[http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/australia/content/player/4560.html Cricinfo: Ian Chappell player profile.] Retrieved 17 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; An animated presence at the batting crease, he constantly adjusted his equipment and clothing, and restlessly tapped his bat on the ground as the bowler ran in. Basing his game on a sound defence learned during many hours of childhood lessons, Chappell employed the drive and square cut to full effect.&lt;ref name=Cashman/&gt; He had an idiosyncratic method of playing back and across to a ball of full length and driving wide of [[Fielding (cricket)#Fielding position names and locations|mid on]],&lt;ref&gt;Simpson (1996), p 54.&lt;/ref&gt; but his trademark shot was the [[Batting (cricket)#Pull and hook|hook]], famously saying &quot;three bouncers an over should be worth 12 runs to me&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;p37, David Gower, Heros and Contemporaries, Granada Publishing Ltd, 1985&lt;/ref&gt; A specialist slip fielder, he was the fourth player to take one hundred Test catches.

Since his retirement in 1980, he has pursued a high-profile career as a sports journalist and cricket commentator, predominantly with [[Nine Network|Channel Nine]].&lt;ref name=SAHOF/&gt; He remains a major figure in Australian cricket: in 2006, [[Shane Warne]] called Chappell the biggest influence on his career.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/news/news/in-warnes-words/2006/12/21/1166290679297.html ''The Age'': In Warne's Words.] Retrieved 8 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Family and early career ==
The first of three sons born in [[Adelaide]] to Martin and Jeanne (née Richardson), Chappell was steeped in the game from an early age. His father was a noted Adelaide grade cricketer who put a bat in his hands as soon as he could walk,&lt;ref name=SAHOF/&gt; and his maternal grandfather was a famous all-round sportsman [[Vic Richardson]], who captained [[Australia national cricket team|Australia]] at the end of a nineteen-Test career.&lt;ref name=ADB&gt;[http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A110395b.htm?hilite=victor%3Brichardson ''Australian Dictionary of Biography'': Richardson, Victor York.] Retrieved 11 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Chappell was given weekly batting lessons from the age of five, as were younger brothers [[Greg Chappell|Greg]] and [[Trevor Chappell|Trevor]], who both went on to play for Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Mallett (2005), pp 7&amp;ndash;8.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Vic Richardson.jpg|125px|right|thumb|Chappell's maternal grandfather Vic Richardson]]
Chappell grew up in the beachside suburb of [[Glenelg, South Australia|Glenelg]] and attended the local St Leonard's Primary School where he played his first competitive match at the age of seven. He was later selected for the South Australian state schoolboys team.&lt;ref&gt;Mallett (2005), p 11.&lt;/ref&gt; He then enrolled at [[Prince Alfred College]], a private secondary school noted for producing many Test cricketers, including the Australian captains [[Joe Darling]] and [[Clem Hill]]. His other sporting pursuits included [[Australian rules football|Australian football]] and [[baseball]]: Chappell's performances for his state in the [[Claxton Shield]] won him All-Australian selection in 1964 and 1966 as a [[catcher]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.waclaxtonshieldclub.baseball.com.au/default.asp?Page=7931 WA Claxton Shield club.] Retrieved 18 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of 18, his form in [[South Australian Grade Cricket League|grade cricket]] for [[Glenelg Cricket Club|Glenelg]] led to his [[First-class cricket|first-class]] debut for [[Southern Redbacks|South Australia]] (SA) against [[Tasmanian Tigers|Tasmania]] in early 1962. Chappell replaced West Indian [[Gary Sobers]] who was selected for a Test match in the Caribbean.&lt;ref&gt;Chappell (1976), p 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

The aggressive style of Sobers and SA captain [[Les Favell]] heavily influenced Chappell during his formative years in major cricket.&lt;ref&gt;Chappell (1976), pp 40&amp;ndash;41.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1962&amp;ndash;63, Chappell made his initial first-class century against a [[New South Wales Blues|New South Wales]] team led by Australian captain [[Richie Benaud]], who was bemused by the young batsman's habit of gritting his teeth as he faced up; to Benaud, it looked as if he was grinning.&lt;ref&gt;Mallett (2005), p 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Chappell spent the northern summer of 1963 as a professional in England's [[Lancashire League (cricket)|Lancashire League]] with [[Ramsbottom#Sports|Ramsbottom]] and played a single first-class match for [[Lancashire County Cricket Club|Lancashire]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/sport/cricket/cricketheadlines/display.var.1711581.0.where_are_they_now_ian_chappell.php ''Lancashire Telegraph'': Where are they now? Ian Chappell.] Retrieved 13 November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

== International career ==
In 1963&amp;ndash;64, Chappell batted at number three for SA for the first time, in a match against [[Queensland Bulls|Queensland]] at [[Brisbane Cricket Ground|Brisbane]], and scored 205 not out.&lt;ref name=Brayshaw&gt;Brayshaw (1984), pp 30&amp;ndash;33.&lt;/ref&gt; He was the youngest member of the SA team that won the [[Sheffield Shield]] that season.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/137958.html Cricinfo: 1963&amp;ndash;64 Sheffield Shield winning team reunites.] Retrieved 19 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; A century against [[Victorian Bushrangers|Victoria]] early the following season resulted in Chappell's selection for a one-off Test against [[Pakistan national cricket team|Pakistan]] at [[Melbourne Cricket Ground|Melbourne]] in December 1964. He made 11 and took four catches,&lt;ref&gt;[http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/engine/match/62956.html ''Wisden, 1966 edition'': Australia v Pakistan scorecard.] Retrieved 17 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; but was dropped until the Fourth Test in the [[1965&amp;ndash;66 Ashes series]]. Chappell supplemented his aggressive batting with brilliant fielding in the [[Slip (cricket)|slips]], and he showed promise as a [[Leg spin|leg-spinner]].&lt;ref name=SAHOF/&gt; At this point, the selectors and captain [[Bob Simpson (cricketer)|Bob Simpson]] considered him an [[all-rounder]]: he batted at number seven and bowled 26 (eight-ball) overs for the match.&lt;ref name=Brayshaw/&gt;

===Hesitant start===
He retained his place for the following Test and for the tour of South Africa in summer 1966&amp;ndash;67. Playing in a side defeated 1&amp;ndash;3, Chappell struggled to make an impression. His highest score in ten Test innings was 49, while his five wickets cost 59 runs each.&lt;ref name=Statsguru&gt;[http://stats.cricinfo.com/guru?sdb=player;playerid=1243;class=testplayer;filter=basic;team=0;opposition=0;notopposition=0;season=0;homeaway=0;continent=0;country=0;notcountry=0;groundid=0;startdefault=1964-12-04;start=1964-12-04;enddefault=1980-02-06;end=1980-02-06;tourneyid=0;finals=0;daynight=0;toss=0;scheduledovers=0;scheduleddays=0;innings=0;result=0;followon=0;seriesresult=0;captain=0;keeper=0;dnp=0;recent=;viewtype=aro_series;runslow=;runshigh=;batposition=0;dismissal=0;bowposition=0;ballslow=;ballshigh=;bpof=0;overslow=;overshigh=;conclow=;conchigh=;wicketslow=;wicketshigh=;dismissalslow=;dismissalshigh=;caughtlow=;caughthigh=;caughttype=0;stumpedlow=;stumpedhigh=;csearch=;submit=1;.cgifields=viewtype Cricinfo Statsguru: Ian Chappell.] Retrieved 11 November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; On the advice of Simpson, he ceased playing the hook shot as it was often leading to his dismissal.&lt;ref&gt;Mallett (2005), p 26.&lt;/ref&gt; In the first Test of 1967&amp;ndash;68 against [[India national cricket team|India]], he failed twice batting in the middle order. Heading into the second Test at Melbourne, Chappell's place was in jeopardy, but he rode his luck to score 151 &amp;mdash; his innings contained five chances that the Indians failed to take.&lt;ref name=Brayshaw/&gt; However, in the remainder of the series, he managed only 46 runs in four innings,&lt;ref name=&quot;testlist&quot;/&gt; so his selection for the 1968 tour of England was based as much on potential as form.

In England, Chappell rewarded the faith of the selectors by scoring the most first-class runs on the tour (1,261 runs, including 202 not out against [[Warwickshire County Cricket Club|Warwickshire]]), leading the Australian Test aggregates with 348 runs (at 43.50).&lt;ref&gt;Mallett (2005), p 30.&lt;/ref&gt; His top score was 81 in the fourth Test at [[Headingley Stadium|Leeds]]. [[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack|''Wisden'']] lauded his play off the back foot and judged him the most difficult Australian batsman to dismiss.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/150223.html ''Wisden, 1969 edition'': The Australians in England 1968.] Retrieved 19 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In a summer severely affected by rain, Australia drew the series and retained [[The Ashes]].

===Promotion to number three===
A string of big scores and a record number of catches during the 1968&amp;ndash;69 season earned Chappell the Australian Cricketer of the Year award.&lt;ref&gt;Chappell (1976), p 80.&lt;/ref&gt; Against the touring [[West Indies cricket team|West Indies]], Chappell hit 188 not out, 123, 117, 180 and 165 before the New Year. Two of these centuries came in the Test series, when Chappell's average for 548 runs was 68.50.&lt;ref name=Statsguru/&gt; Chappell was elevated to number three in the batting order and became a less-frequent bowler; he was also appointed vice-captain of the team.&lt;ref name=Cashman/&gt;

Following up with a successful tour of India in late 1969, Chappell demonstrated his fluency against spin bowling by compiling Test innings of 138 at [[Feroz Shah Kotla|Delhi]] and 99 at [[Eden Gardens|Kolkata]]. His ability against both fast and slow bowling earned high praise,&lt;ref&gt;[http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/152445.html ''Wisden, 1971 edition'': The Australians in Ceylon and India 1969&amp;ndash;70.] Retrieved 20 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; including from his captain [[Bill Lawry]]. When the Australians arrived in South Africa in early 1970, following their victory over India, Lawry told the local media that Chappell was the best all-round batsman in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;kings&quot;&gt;[http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/231051.html Cricinfo: When they were kings.] Retrieved 17 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; His appraisal looked misguided when Chappell managed just 92 runs (at 11.5 average), with a top score of 34, as Australia lost 0&amp;ndash;4.&lt;ref name=&quot;kings&quot;/&gt;

On this tour, Chappell clashed with cricket administrators over pay and conditions for the first time.&lt;ref name=Brayshaw/&gt; The South African authorities requested that an extra Test be added to the fixture and the [[Cricket Australia|Australian Board of Control]] consented. Incensed that the players were not consulted about the change, Chappell led a group of his teammates in a demand for more money to play the proposed game. Eventually the match was cancelled after Chappell and his supporters refused to back down.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/392514.html Cricinfo: Australia's no pay, no play tour.] Retrieved 19 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Captaincy===
[[Image:Chappelli.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Ian Chappell in the early 1970s]]
Chappell became SA captain when the long-serving [[Les Favell]] retired at the start of the 1970&amp;ndash;71 season.&lt;ref&gt;Harte (1993), p 531.&lt;/ref&gt; His younger brother Greg made his debut in the second Test of the summer against [[English cricket team in Australia in 1970–71|Ray Illingworth's England]]. Facing an English attack led by the hostile fast bowling of [[John Snow (cricketer)|John Snow]], Chappell scored a half-century in each of the first two Tests, but failed to capitalise on good starts while Greg Chappell scored 108 in his initial innings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/150243.html ''Wisden, 1972 edition'': 2nd Test Australia v England, match report.] Retrieved 13 November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Rain caused the abandonment of the third Test without a ball bowled. Temporarily promoted to open the batting, Chappell failed in the fourth Test as Australia lost. In the fifth Test at Melbourne, he returned to number three and started nervously. Dropped on 0 and 14, Chappell found form and went on to post his maiden Ashes century (111 from 212 balls),&lt;ref&gt;[http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/150246.html ''Wisden, 1972 edition'': 5th Test Australia v England, match report.] Retrieved 17 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; which he followed with scores of 28 and 104 in the sixth Test.&lt;ref name=&quot;testlist&quot;/&gt;

The washed-out Test resulted in a late change to the schedule and an unprecedented seventh Test was played at Sydney in February 1971.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/story/150241.html ''Wisden, 1972 edition'': The MCC in Australia and New Zealand 1970&amp;ndash;71.] Retrieved 17 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Trailing 0&amp;ndash;1 in the series, Australia could retain The Ashes by winning this game. Australia's performances were hampered by playing slow, defensive cricket. In a radical attempt to breathe some aggression into the team, the selectors sacked captain Bill Lawry and appointed Chappell in his stead.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/272840.html Cricinfo: The end of a Victorian hero.] Retrieved 17 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Dismayed by the manner of Lawry's dismissal,&lt;ref name=ABCTV&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2002/s720418.htm ABC TV: 7.30 Report (transcript).] Retrieved 20 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Chappell responded with an attacking performance as captain, he won the toss, put England in and dismissed them for 184, and Australia led the first innings by 80 runs, but set 223 to win they folded for 160 and lost [[The Ashes]] after holding them for 12 years. Chappell gained some consolation at the end of a dramatic summer when he led SA to the Sheffield Shield, the team's first win for seven years.&lt;ref&gt;Mallett (2005), p 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chappell's battles against the short-pitched bowling of Snow during the season compelled him to reappraise his game. Following a conversation with [[Sir Donald Bradman]], he decided to reinstate the hook shot and spent the winter months practising the stroke by hitting baseballs thrown by his brother Greg.&lt;ref&gt;Chappell (1976), pp 74&amp;ndash;75.&lt;/ref&gt; Although he still regularly lost his wicket after playing the shot, Chappell felt that the psychological benefit of showing aggression to opposing bowlers offset the times that he was dismissed for a low score.

===A team in his own image===
{{Quote|Ian Chappell fashioned an Australian team in his own image between 1971 and 1975: aggressive, resourceful and insouciant.|[[Gideon Haigh]]&lt;ref name=CricinfoProfile/&gt;}}

Australia lost an unofficial Test series to a Rest of the World team led by [[Gary Sobers]] that toured in 1971&amp;ndash;72 as a replacement for the politically unacceptable South Africans.&lt;ref&gt;Harte (1993), p 532&amp;ndash;533.&lt;/ref&gt; Chappell was the outstanding batsman of the series, with four centuries included in his 634 runs, at an average of 79.25.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aus.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1970S/1971-72/WORLD-XI_IN_AUS/WORLD-XI_IN_AUS_NOV1971-FEB1972_TEST-STATS.html Cricinfo: World XI in Australia 1971&amp;ndash;72.] Retrieved 13 November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; He took the team to England in 1972 and was unlucky not to regain The Ashes in a rubber that ended 2&amp;ndash;2. The series began disastrously for Chappell when he was out hooking from the first ball he faced in the opening Test at [[Old Trafford Cricket Ground|Manchester]]. He fell the same way in the second innings and Australia lost the match.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/152473.html ''Wisden, 1973 edition'': 1st Test England v Australia, match report.] Retrieved 13 November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the team regrouped and had the better of the remaining matches, apart from the fourth Test at Leeds, played on a controversial pitch that the Australians believed was &quot;doctored&quot; to suit the England team.&lt;ref&gt;Mallett (2005), pp 75&amp;ndash;76.&lt;/ref&gt; Greg Chappell emerged as a prolific batsman during the series, batting one place below his brother in the order. The siblings shared several crucial partnerships,&lt;ref name=CricinfoProfile/&gt; most notably 201 at the Oval in the last Test when they became the first brothers to score centuries in the same Test innings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/152477.html ''Wisden, 1973 edition'': 5th Test England v Australia, match report.] Retrieved 17 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Australia won the game, an effort that Chappell later cited as the turning point in the team's performances.&lt;ref&gt;Mallett (2005), p 78.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972&amp;ndash;73, Australia had resounding victories against Pakistan (at home) and the West Indies (away). Chappell's leadership qualities stood out in a number of tight situations. He hit his highest Test score of 196 (from 243 balls) in the first Test against Pakistan at Adelaide. Pakistan &quot;appeared probable winners of the last two Tests on the second last day of each game&quot;, yet Chappell's team managed to win on both occasions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/152511.html ''Wisden, 1974 edition'': Pakistan in Australia 1972&amp;ndash;73.] Retrieved 8 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

On indifferent pitches in the Caribbean, Chappell was the highest-scoring batsman of the Test series with 542 runs (at 77.4 average).&lt;ref name=Statsguru/&gt; He hit 209 in a tour match against [[Barbados national cricket team|Barbados]], two Test centuries and a &quot;glorious&quot; 97 on a poor pitch at [[Queen's Park Oval|Trinidad]] in the third Test, batting with an injured ankle. This set up a dramatic last day when the West Indies needed just 66 runs to win with six wickets in hand at lunch. The home team collapsed against an inspired Australian bowling attack supported by Chappell's aggressive field-placements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/152522.html ''Wisden, 1974 edition'': 3rd Test West Indies v Australia, match report.] Retrieved 17 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Chappell's team would be the last to leave the West Indies as winners for 22 years.

===The ugly Australians===
Australia played six Tests against [[New Zealand national cricket team|New Zealand]] on both sides of the [[Tasman Sea|Tasman]] in 1973&amp;ndash;74. Chappell led his team to a 2&amp;ndash;0 victory in the three Tests played in Australia. During the third Test at Adelaide, he equalled the world record of six catches in a Test match by a fielder, which was beaten by his brother Greg the following season.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stats.cricinfo.com/ci/content/records/283561.html Cricinfo: Most catches in a match.] Retrieved 11 November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In the drawn first Test at [[Basin Reserve|Wellington]], the Chappells became the first brothers to each score a century in both innings of a Test match. The Australians lost to the Kiwis for the first time ever in the second Test at [[AMI Stadium|Christchurch]], when Chappell was involved in a verbal confrontation with the leading New Zealand batsman, [[Glenn Turner]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/extracover/content/story/142361.html Cricinfo: New Zealand's great day of fulfilment.] Retrieved 17 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The Australians then played an ill-tempered tour match at [[Carisbrook|Dunedin]] that didn't enhance the reputation of Chappell or his team, before winning the final Test at [[Eden Park|Auckland]].&lt;ref&gt;Chappell (1976), pp 138&amp;ndash;142.&lt;/ref&gt; On this tour, the behaviour of the team was questioned with some journalists labelling them &quot;ugly Australians&quot;.&lt;ref name=MCG/&gt; In 1976, Chappell wrote about his attitude to the opposition:
&lt;blockquote&gt;... although we didn't deliberately set out to be a 'bunch of bastards' when we walked on to the field, I'd much prefer any team I captained to be described like that than as 'a nice bunch of blokes on the field.' As captain of Australia my philosophy was simple: between 11.00am and 6.00pm there was no time to be a nice guy. I believed that on the field players should concentrate on giving their best to the team, to themselves and to winning; in other words, playing hard and fairly within the rules. To my mind, doing all that left no time for being a nice guy.&lt;ref&gt;Chappell (1976), p 33.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The increasing prevalence of verbal confrontation on the field (later known as [[sledging (cricket)|sledging]]) concerned cricket administrators and became a regular topic for the media.&lt;ref&gt;Harte (1993), Chapter 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Its instigation is sometimes attributed to Chappell. By his own admission, he was a frequent user of profanity who was often at &quot;boiling point&quot; on the field, but claims that the various incidents he was involved in were not a premeditated tactic. Rather, they were a case of him losing his temper with an opponent.&lt;ref name=Jeez&gt;[http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/143984.html Cricinfo: 'Jeez ... what have we got here?] Retrieved 15 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Sledging continues to cause controversy in the game; when the Australian team is involved, the phrase &quot;ugly Australians&quot; is still invoked in relation to the issue.

===The Ashes regained and the first World Cup===

The highlight of Chappell's career was Australia's 4&amp;ndash;1 win over England in 1974&amp;ndash;75 that reclaimed The Ashes. Strengthened by the new fast bowling partnership of [[Dennis Lillee]] and [[Jeff Thomson]], the Australians played aggressive cricket and received criticism for the amount of [[Bouncer (cricket)|short-pitched]] bowling they employed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/154334.html ''Wisden, 1976 edition'': The MCC in Australia and New Zealand 1974&amp;ndash;75.] Retrieved 18 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Chappell scored 90 on an &quot;unreliable&quot; pitch on the first day of the opening Test at Brisbane.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/153460.html ''Wisden, 1976 edition'': 1st Test Australia v England, match report.] Retrieved 18 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; He finished the six Tests with 387 runs at 35.18 average, and took 11 catches in the slips.&lt;ref name=Statsguru/&gt; The Test matches attracted big crowds and record gate takings, enabling Chappell to negotiate a bonus for the players from the [[Cricket Australia|Australian Cricket Board]] (ACB).&lt;ref name=Bulletin&gt;[http://bulletin.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=132856 ''The Bulletin'': Tight flows the Don.] Retrieved 8 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Although this more than doubled the players' pay, their remuneration amounted to only 4.5% of the revenue generated by the series.&lt;ref&gt;Harte (1993), p 560.&lt;/ref&gt;

Within months, Chappell was back in England leading Australia in the [[1975 Cricket World Cup|inaugural World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/cricket/items/s772864.htm ABC Sport: One-day cricket's tactical evolution.] Retrieved 11 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; His dislike of the defensive nature of limited-over cricket led to the Australians placing a full slips cordon for the new ball and employing Test-match style tactics in the tournament.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sportstaronnet.com/tss3010/stories/20070310014504800.htm ''The Hindu Sportstar Weekly'': Leading from the front.] Retrieved 13 November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the apparent unsuitability of this approach, Chappell guided the team to the final where they lost a memorable match to the West Indies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/150279.html ''Wisden, 1976 edition'': Prudential World Cup final, match report.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The workload of the captaincy was telling on Chappell and the four-Test Ashes series that followed the World Cup dampened his appetite for the game.&lt;ref&gt;Chappell (1976), p 120.&lt;/ref&gt; After winning the only completed match of the series, the first Test at [[Edgbaston Cricket Ground|Birmingham]], Australia's  retention of the Ashes was anti-climactic: the third Test at Leeds was abandoned due to vandalism of the pitch during the night before the last day's play.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/216592.html Cricinfo: Vandals stopped play.] Retrieved 13 November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In the last Test at the Oval, Chappell scored 192 from 367 balls to set up an apparent victory. However, England managed to bat for almost 15 hours to grind out a draw and Chappell announced his resignation from the captaincy on the final day of the match.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/153459.html ''Wisden, 1976 edition'': 4th Test England v Australia, match report.] Retrieved 13 November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In 30 Tests as captain, he scored 2,550 runs at an average of 50, with seven centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stats.cricinfo.com/guru?sdb=player;playerid=1243;class=testplayer;filter=basic;team=0;opposition=0;notopposition=0;season=0;homeaway=0;continent=0;country=0;notcountry=0;groundid=0;startdefault=1964-12-04;start=1964-12-04;enddefault=1980-02-06;end=1980-02-06;tourneyid=0;finals=0;daynight=0;toss=0;scheduledovers=0;scheduleddays=0;innings=0;result=0;followon=0;seriesresult=0;captain=0;keeper=0;dnp=0;recent=;viewtype=aro_summary;runslow=;runshigh=;batposition=0;dismissal=0;bowposition=0;ballslow=;ballshigh=;bpof=0;overslow=;overshigh=;conclow=;conchigh=;wicketslow=;wicketshigh=;dismissalslow=;dismissalshigh=;caughtlow=;caughthigh=;caughttype=0;stumpedlow=;stumpedhigh=;csearch=;submit=1;.cgifields=viewtype Cricinfo: IM Chappell career summary.] Retrieved 13 November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===First retirement===
Remaining available for Test cricket, he played in the 1975&amp;ndash;76 series against the West Indies under the captaincy of his brother Greg. Australia avenged their loss in the World Cup final by winning 5&amp;ndash;1, claiming the unofficial title of best team in the world.&lt;ref name=Wisden77&gt;[http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/153010.html ''Wisden, 1977 edition'': West Indies in Australia 1975&amp;ndash;76.] Retrieved 13 November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; During the season, Chappell incurred censure for his behaviour in a Sheffield Shield match and was warned not to continue wearing a pair of [[Adidas]] boots with the three stripes clearly visible. This breached the prevailing protocol of cricketers wearing all white.&lt;ref name=Wisden76&gt;[http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/154504.html ''Wisden, 1976 edition'': Cricketer of the year &amp;mdash; Ian Chappell.] Retrieved 19 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; His highest innings of the summer was 156 during Australia's only loss, at [[WACA Ground|Perth]] in the second Test. ''Wisden'' nominated him as the most influential player of the series for his 449 runs at an average of 44.90.&lt;ref name=Wisden77/&gt; Throughout the course of the series, Chappell passed two significant milestones when he became the fourth Australian to make 5,000 runs in Test cricket and the first player to hold one hundred Test catches for Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Chappell (1976), statistical appendix.&lt;/ref&gt; The summer ended in controversy and triumph in the domestic competition. During a dispute with the [[South Australian Cricket Association|SACA]] over team selection, he threatened a &quot;strike&quot; action by the SA team. After the matter was resolved, Chappell led the side to the Sheffield Shield title for the second time in his career and shared the inaugural Sheffield Shield player of the season award with his brother Greg.&lt;ref&gt;Mallett (2005), pp 126&amp;ndash;128.&lt;/ref&gt; He retired from first-class cricket at the end of the season, aged only 32.&lt;ref&gt;Mallett (2005), p 128.&lt;/ref&gt;

== World Series Cricket and aftermath ==
In 1976, Chappell toured South Africa with Richie Benaud's [[International cricket in South Africa from 1971 to 1981|International Wanderers]] team, released his autobiography ''Chappelli'' and was named as one of five [[Wisden Cricketers of the Year]].&lt;ref name=Wisden76/&gt; He was hired to spend the summer of 1976&amp;ndash;77 as a guest professional in the Melbourne [[Victorian Premier Cricket|district competition]] where he was paid more than he had been as Australian captain.&lt;ref name=Cashman/&gt; During the season, he was involved in a famous altercation with a young English all-rounder who was in Victoria on a cricketing scholarship, [[Ian Botham]]. Both men have put forward vastly different versions as to what happened during the physical confrontation in a Melbourne pub.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/extracover/content/story/279775.html Cricinfo: The feud that rumbles on.] Retrieved 17 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The animosity between them continues and [[Nine Network|Channel Nine]] used it as a marketing ploy when Botham temporarily partnered Chappell as a television commentator during the 1998&amp;ndash;99 season.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/76560.html Cricinfo: The Ashes &amp;mdash; sparks set to fly between Botham and Chappell.] (''link broken'') Retrieved 20 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Botham again revived the feud in his 2007 autobiography with another version of the incident.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bulletin.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=308214 ''The Bulletin'': Chappell &amp;mdash; My brawl with Botham.] Retrieved 14 November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rebel skipper===
Throughout his career, Chappell found the ACB obdurate in his attempts to make a living from the game. In 1969 and 1970, they refused his applications to play professionally in England.&lt;ref&gt;Harte (1993), p 519.&lt;/ref&gt; As Australian captain, he made several unsuccessful representations at ACB meetings in an effort to secure a more realistic financial deal for the Australian players.&lt;ref name=ABCTV/&gt; In consultations with the then-president of the [[Australian Council of Trade Unions|ACTU]], [[Bob Hawke]], he explored the possibility of unionising the players.&lt;ref&gt;Harte (1993), p 561.&lt;/ref&gt;

Approached to lead an Australian team in [[World Series Cricket]] (WSC), a breakaway professional competition organised by [[Kerry Packer]] for Channel Nine, Chappell signed a three-year contract worth A$75,000 in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;Mallett (2005), p 156.&lt;/ref&gt; His participation was, &quot;fundamental to the credibility of the enterprise&quot;.&lt;ref name=Cashman/&gt; Chappell devised the list of Australian players to be signed, and was involved in the organisation and marketing of WSC.&lt;ref name=ABCTV/&gt; His central role was the result of, &quot;years of personal disaffection with cricket officialdom&quot;,&lt;ref name=CricinfoProfile/&gt; in  particular [[Don Bradman]]. Recently, Chappell wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;While captaining Australia, I was approached on three separate occasions before WSC to play 'professional' cricket, and each time I advised the entrepreneurs to meet the appropriate cricket board because they controlled the grounds. On each occasion, the administrators sent the entrepreneurs packing and it quickly became clear they weren't interested in a better deal for the players.

That's why I say the players didn't stab the ACB in the back. The administrators had numerous opportunities to reach a compromise but displayed little interest in the welfare of the players. It wasn't really surprising then that more than 50 players from around the world signed lucrative WSC contracts and a revolution was born. About half of the WSC players were from Australia and this high ratio can, in part, be attributed to Bradman's tight-fisted approach to the ACB's money.&lt;ref name=Bulletin/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In WSC's debut season of 1977&amp;ndash;78, Chappell hit the first Supertest century and finished fifth in overall averages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Events/AUS/World_Series_Cricket_Supertests_1977-78/Batting_by_Average.html Cricket Archive: WSC Supertests 1977&amp;ndash;78.] Retrieved 13 November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The prevalence of short-pitched fast bowling and a serious injury to Australian [[David Hookes]] led to the innovation of batting helmets; Chappell was one of the many batsmen to use one. Following their 1975&amp;ndash;76 tour of Australia, the West Indies adopted a four-man fast bowling attack, while the World XI contained fast bowlers of the calibre of [[Imran Khan]], [[Mike Procter]], [[Garth Le Roux]], [[Clive Rice]] and [[Sarfraz Nawaz]]. The constant diet of pace bowling undermined the confidence of some batsmen during WSC. Chappell's form fell away during the second season and he scored only 181 runs at 25.85 in four Supertests.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Events/AUS/World_Series_Cricket_Supertests_1978-79/Batting_by_Average.html Cricket Archive: WSC Supertests 1978&amp;ndash;79.] Retrieved 13 November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; During the last six days of the season, the WSC Australians lost the finals of both the limited-overs competition (to the West Indies XI) and the Supertest series (to the World XI), thus forfeiting the winner-takes-all prize money. After the latter match, Chappell vented his frustrations on World XI captain [[Tony Greig]] by refusing to shake his hand and criticising Greig's inconsequential contribution to his team's victory.&lt;ref&gt;Haigh (1993), pp 255&amp;ndash;256.&lt;/ref&gt; The final act of the competition was a series between the WSC Australians and the WSC West Indies played in the Caribbean in the spring of 1979. After the Australians suffered a heavy defeat in the first Supertest at [[Sabina Park|Jamaica]], Chappell rallied his team to draw the five match series one-all. His best effort were scores of 61 and 86 at [[Kensington Oval|Barbados]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/1967826.stm BBC Sport: Supertest results.] Retrieved 13 November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Return to Tests===
Convinced to return to official cricket when WSC ended, Chappell resumed as captain of SA in 1979&amp;ndash;80, a decision he later regretted.&lt;ref&gt;Mallett (2005), p 179.&lt;/ref&gt; It was a season too far for the increasingly irascible Chappell. Reported by an umpire for swearing in a match against Tasmania, he received a three-week suspension. In his first match after the ban, he was again reported for his conduct in a game against the touring English team. Given a suspended ban by the ACB, he was then selected for Australia's last three Tests of the season.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/153581.html ''Wisden, 1981 edition'': 2nd Test Australia v England, match report.] Retrieved 18 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; His Test career finished with scores of 75 and 26 not out at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground|MCG]] against England in February 1980. In his final first-class match, SA needed to beat Victoria to win the Sheffield Shield. Although Chappell scored 112, SA lost the match and the shield. Ironically, the umpires voted him the competition's player of the season for a second time.&lt;ref&gt;Mallett (2005), p 185.&lt;/ref&gt;

===ODI record===
Chappell's aggressive approach suited [[Limited overs cricket|limited-overs]] cricket: he scored his runs at a strike-rate of 77 runs per hundred balls.&lt;ref name=CricinfoProfile/&gt; The timing of his career limited him to 16 [[One Day International|ODI]] matches, but he appeared in a number of historic fixtures such as the first ODI (at the MCG in 1971),&lt;ref&gt;[http://aus.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1970S/1970-71/ENG_IN_AUS/ENG_AUS_ODI_05JAN1971.html Cricinfo: Only ODI Australia v England, scorecard] Retrieved 30 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; the first World Cup final (at Lord's in 1975) and the first day/night match (during WSC, at [[Waverley Park|VFL Park]] in 1978).&lt;ref&gt;[http://aus.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1970S/1977-78/OTHERS+ICC/PACKER/INT-CUP/WSC-AUS_WSC-WI_INT-CUP_24JAN1978.html Cricinfo: International Cup match 13 WSC Australia v WSC West Indies, scorecard.] Retrieved 30 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; He passed fifty in half of his innings with a top score of 86 at Christchurch in 1973&amp;ndash;74. In his final season of international cricket, he scored 63 not out (from 65 balls) against the West Indies at the SCG to win the player of the match award; five days later he hit an unbeaten 60 from 50 balls in his penultimate ODI appearance, against England. As captain, he recorded six wins and five losses from 11 matches.

===Legacy===
The title of the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC's]] documentary ''The Chappell Era'', broadcast in 2002, encapsulated Chappell's significance to Australian cricket. Subtitled ''Cricket in the '70s'', it chronicled the rise of the Australian cricket team under Chappell, the fight for better pay for the players, and professionalisation of the game through WSC. During the program, Chappell reiterated his criticisms of cricket's administration at the time.&lt;ref name=ABCTV/&gt;

In ''Wisden'', Richie Benaud wrote, &quot;Chappell will be remembered as much for his bid to improve the players' lot as he will for his run-getting and captaincy&quot;.&lt;ref name=Wisden76/&gt; During the WSC period, he founded a players' association with a loan provided by Kerry Packer. Despite Chappell's continued support for the organisation after his retirement, apathy and a lack of recognition from the ACB led to its demise in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;Harte (1993), p 610.&lt;/ref&gt; Revived in 1997 as the [[Australian Cricketers' Association]] (ACA), it is now an important organisation within the structure of Australian cricket. In 2005, Chappell became a member of the ACA executive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.auscricket.com.au/html/s02_article/article_view.asp?id=233&amp;nav_cat_id=223&amp;nav_top_id=64&amp;dsb=819 Australian Cricketers' Association: News release 28 September 2005.] Retrieved 18 August 2007. {{Wayback | url=http://www.auscricket.com.au/html/s02_article/article_view.asp?id=233&amp;nav_cat_id=223&amp;nav_top_id=64&amp;dsb=819 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; | date=20070928210258 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chappell was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 1986,&lt;ref name=SAHOF/&gt; the [[Federation of International Cricketers' Associations|FICA]] Cricket Hall of Fame in 2000 and the [[Australian Cricket Hall of Fame]] in 2003.&lt;ref name=&quot;content-aus.cricinfo.com&quot;/&gt;  Two new grandstands at the Adelaide Oval were named the Chappell Stands; at the dedication ceremony in 2003, the SACA president [[Ian McLachlan]] called the Chappells, &quot;the most famous cricketing family in South Australia&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/125679.html Cricinfo: Chappell brothers and Clem Hill honoured at Adelaide Oval.] Retrieved 19 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, the Chappell family was again honoured with the creation of the [[Chappell–Hadlee Trophy]], an annual series of ODI matches played between Australia and New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cricket.com.au/default.aspx?s=newsdisplay&amp;id=33252 Cricket Australia: News release.] Retrieved 8 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Media career ==
Following the path of his grandfather Vic Richardson, who was a radio commentator for many years,&lt;ref name=ADB/&gt; Chappell entered the media in 1973 by writing ghosted magazine articles and a column for ''[[The Age]]''.&lt;ref name=SMH&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/news/cricket/ian-chappell-no-aggro-or-ego----just-the-bloody-brutal-truth/2006/09/23/1158431951681.html ''Sydney Morning Herald'': Ian Chappell &amp;mdash; no aggro or ego just the bloody brutal truth.] Retrieved 15 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; He did television commentary for the [[Network Ten|0&amp;ndash;10 Network]] and the [[BBC]] before playing WSC.&lt;ref name=Getannoyed&gt;[http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/303697.html Cricinfo: 'I get really annoyed with one-sided cricket'.] Retrieved 15 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1980s, Chappell spent eight years co-hosting with [[Mike Gibson (broadcaster)|Mike Gibson]], ''[[Nine's Wide World of Sport|Wide World of Sports]]'', an innovative magazine-style program broadcast by Channel Nine on Saturday afternoons and co-hosted a sister show, ''Sports Sunday'', for five years.&lt;ref name=Mallett&gt;Mallett (2005), p 188.&lt;/ref&gt; Early in his stint on the former program, he swore without realising that he was live to air.&lt;ref name=Getannoyed/&gt; A similar incident occurred during a live telecast of the 1993 Ashes series.&lt;ref name=Jeez/&gt; Channel Nine suspended him on both occasions.

===Leadership critiques===
Chappell began working as a commentator for Channel Nine's cricket coverage in the 1980&amp;ndash;81 season, a position he retains.&lt;ref name=Mallett/&gt; The major controversy of his first season was the [[Underarm bowling incident of 1981|Underarm Incident]], which involved his two younger brothers in an ODI played between Australia and New Zealand at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground|MCG]]. Chappell showed no fraternal bias and was vehement in his criticism of his brother Greg's tactic.&lt;ref name=Getannoyed/&gt; He wrote in a newspaper column on the matter: &quot;Fair dinkum, Greg, how much pride do you sacrifice to win $35,000?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;McGregor (1985), p 209.&lt;/ref&gt;

He supported the claims of [[Rod Marsh]] to the Australian captaincy over the incumbent, [[Kim Hughes]], in the early 1980s. The constant campaign against Hughes destabilised his authority. Compounding the situation, the ACB compelled Hughes to be interviewed by Chappell on a regular basis. When Hughes resigned in 1984, throwing Australian cricket into turmoil, Chappell received a share of the blame for the outcome.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/266824.html Cricinfo: The crying game.] Retrieved 12 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chappell had a direct influence on Hughes’ successor, [[Allan Border]]. Early in his captaincy tenure, Border was struggling with the burdens of the position so the ACB appointed Bob Simpson as team coach to assist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content-www.cricinfo.com/australia/content/story/235979.html Cricinfo: Buchanan tells Simpson to stay with the times.] Retrieved 15 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; This led to animosity between Chappell and Simpson as Chappell derided the need for a coach. Simpson responded by writing that the peer influence of older players helping younger players fell away during the era when the Chappell brothers led the team, and he was redressing the problem.&lt;ref&gt;Simpson (1996), pp 205&amp;ndash;206.&lt;/ref&gt; Chappell believed that the Border-Simpson leadership was too defensive and that Simpson usurped too much of Border's control of the team; Border heeded Chappell's assessment and adopted a more aggressive on-field approach later in his career.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/news/Cricket/Savour-dominance-Border/2005/01/08/1104832358959.html ''The Age'': Savour dominance &amp;mdash; Border] Retrieved 23 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mark Taylor (cricketer)|Mark Taylor]], who captained the team after Border, moved to dilute Simpson's authority. Chappell remains a long-standing critic of the use of coaches by national teams.&lt;ref&gt;[http://in.rediff.com/cricket/2003/nov/11inter.htm Rediff: Interview &amp;mdash; Ian Chappell.] Retrieved 2 October 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Books and writings===
Chappell's first book was an account of the 1972 Ashes tour, ''Tigers Among the Lions'', followed by a series of books of cricketing humour and anecdotes published in the early 1980s. The more analytical ''The Cutting Edge'', an appraisal of modern cricket, appeared in 1992.&lt;ref name=Cashman/&gt; [[Ashley Mallett]]'s biography, ''Chappelli Speaks Out'' (published in the UK as ''Hitting Out &amp;mdash; the Ian Chappell Story'') was written in collaboration with Chappell and released in 2005. It caused controversy due to Chappell's assessment of [[Steve Waugh]], who he described as &quot;selfish&quot; and as a captain, &quot;ran out of ideas very quickly&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Mallett (2005), chapter 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Waugh responded by writing, &quot;to say Chappell's criticism irked me would be an understatement.&quot; He categorised the criticisms as &quot;personal&quot; and noted that Chappell, &quot;always sweated on my blunders and reported them with an 'I told you so' mentality&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/news/cricket/waugh-betrayed-in-caribbean/2005/10/22/1129775998450.html ''The Age'': Waugh ‘betrayed’ in the Caribbean.] Retrieved 15 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, Chappell released an anthology of his cricket writings entitled ''A Golden Age''.&lt;ref name=SMH/&gt; He is a regular contributor to [[Cricinfo.com]].

== Personal life ==
After leaving school, Chappell spent two years as a [[clerk (position)|clerk]] in a sharebroker's office, which he left to play league cricket in England. He then worked as a promotions representative for [[Nestlé]] and, later, the cigarette manufacturer [[WD &amp; HO Wills Holdings|WD &amp; HO Wills]]. After eight years with Wills, Chappell capitalised on his fame as Australian captain by forming his own company specialising in advertising, promotion and journalism, which has remained his profession.&lt;ref&gt;Chappell (1976), p 47.&lt;/ref&gt; He is twice married, and has a daughter (Amanda) with his first wife Kay. Chappell now lives in Sydney with his second wife Barbara-Ann. In recent years, Chappell has been a high-profile activist for better treatment of [[asylum seeker]]s by the Australian government, in particular its [[Mandatory detention in Australia|policy of mandatory detention]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/austory/content/2003/s912440.htm ABC TV: Australian story &amp;mdash; The unusual suspect (transcript).] Retrieved 23 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; He supports Australia cutting ties with England and becoming a republic, being a founding member of the [[Australian Republican Movement]].&lt;ref&gt;http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/3294165&lt;/ref&gt;
