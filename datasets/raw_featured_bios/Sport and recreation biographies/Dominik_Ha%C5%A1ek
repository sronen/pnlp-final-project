'''Dominik Hašek''' ({{IPA-cs|ˈdomɪnɪk ˈɦaʃɛk}}, {{Audio|Dominik Hašek.ogg|audio}}; born January 29, 1965) is a retired [[Czech Republic|Czech]] [[ice hockey]] [[goaltender]]. In his 16-season [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) career, he played for the [[Chicago Blackhawks]], [[Buffalo Sabres]], [[Detroit Red Wings]] and the [[Ottawa Senators]]. During his years in Buffalo, he became one of the league's finest goaltenders, earning him the nickname &quot;'''The Dominator'''&quot;. His strong play has been credited with establishing European goaltenders in a league widely dominated by North Americans.&lt;ref name = &quot;return&quot;&gt;{{cite news

Hašek was one of the league's most successful goaltenders of the 1990s and early 2000s. From [[1992–93 NHL season|1993]] to [[2000–01 NHL season|2001]], he won six [[Vezina Trophy|Vezina Trophies]]. In [[1997–98 NHL season|1998]] he won his second consecutive [[Hart Memorial Trophy]], becoming the first goaltender to win the award multiple times. During the [[Ice hockey at the 1998 Winter Olympics|1998 Winter Olympics]] in [[Nagano]], Japan, he led the [[Czech national ice hockey team]] to its first and only Olympic gold medal. The feat made him a popular figure in his home country&lt;ref name=&quot;Popularity&quot;&gt;

In the process, he set a record for shutouts in a postseason year.

Hašek is considered an unorthodox goaltender, with a distinct style that has labeled him a &quot;flopper&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;MainBio&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hockeygoalies.org/bio/hasek.html|title=Dominik Hasek (1990–present)|publisher=hockeygoalies.org|accessdate=2007-04-24|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is best known for his concentration, foot speed, flexibility, and unconventional saves, such as covering the puck with his blocker rather than his [[Glove (hockey)|trapper]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MainBio&quot;/&gt;
Hašek holds the highest career save percentage of all time (0.9223) and is 7th in goals against average (1st in the modern era) (2.202), and the second-highest single-season save percentage (0.9366 in [[1998–99 NHL season|1998–99]]). The record was broken by [[Tim Thomas (ice hockey)|Tim Thomas]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Yerdon|first=Joe|title=Tim Thomas sets new single-season NHL record for save percentage|url=http://prohockeytalk.nbcsports.com/2011/04/09/tim-thomas-sets-new-single-season-nhl-record-for-save-percentage/|publisher=NBC Sports}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Yes, it's save /percentage/ but expressed as 0.###(#), typically rounded to three digits --&gt;

==Early life==
Hašek started playing hockey at the age of six in his native [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]]. As he explains:

{{cquote|They held a tryout for 5-year-old boys and my father took me there. I didn't even have real skates. I had those blades that you screwed onto the soles of your shoes, but I was tall, and the 9-year-olds didn't have a goalie, so they put me in with them and thats where I fell in love with the game of hockey.&lt;ref name=&quot;flex&quot;&gt;{{cite news

| accessdate = 2006-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1980, Hašek joined the top hockey league in the country, the [[Czechoslovak Extraliga]], with his hometown team, [[HC Pardubice]]. He became the youngest hockey player in history to play at the professional level at age 16. He helped to win two league titles in 1987 and 1989. The next year, he was drafted by the Czech army to play for [[Dukla Jihlava]]. After making his mark and eventually playing for the Czechoslovakian National team, Hašek entered the NHL draft and was drafted by the Chicago Blackhawks in [[1983 NHL Entry Draft|1983]]. At the time, NHL teams were wary of drafting players from behind the [[Iron Curtain]] who were often unwilling to play in the NHL or barred from doing so by their countries. Consequently, Hašek was picked in the 10th round (199th overall) and was the seventeenth goalie selected. Hašek did not even know he had been drafted until several months later.&lt;ref name=&quot;draft&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/SearchPlayer.jsp?player=18282|title=Dominik Hasek|publisher=legendsofhockey.net|accessdate=2006-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 1990, Hašek played in his native Czechoslovakia for [[HC Pardubice]] and [[HC Jihlava]]. He was named the [[Golden Hockey Stick (Czechoslovakia)|top ice hockey player]] of the Czechoslovak Extraliga in 1987, 1989 and 1990, and Goaltender of the Year from 1986 through 1990.&lt;ref name=&quot;TSNprofile&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tsn.ca/nhl/teams/players/bio/?id=126&amp;hubname=nhl-red_wings|title=TSN.ca player profile|publisher=[[The Sports Network]]|accessdate=2007-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; With [[Velvet Revolution|the end of communist rule]] in 1989, the borders of the Soviet Bloc countries opened, allowing Hašek to emigrate to the United States with aspirations of playing in the NHL.&lt;ref name=&quot;draft&quot;/&gt; His American career began with the [[Indianapolis Ice]] of the [[International Hockey League (1945-2001)|IHL]], where he played parts of two seasons. His NHL debut with the Blackhawks finally came in the [[1990–91 NHL season|1990–91 season]], eight years after the 1983 NHL Entry Draft.

==NHL career==
===Chicago Blackhawks (1990–1992)===
In Chicago, Hašek spent time as the backup to [[Ed Belfour]], and played only 25 games over two seasons with the Blackhawks, splitting time between the Blackhawks and the [[Indianapolis Ice]] of the [[International Hockey League (1945-2001)|IHL]]. On November 6, 1990, wearing the number 34 (31 was worn by Ed Belfour in his rookie year), Hašek made his first NHL start in a 1–1 tie against the [[Hartford Whalers]].&lt;ref name=&quot;detroit page&quot;&gt;{{cite web

His first victory came on March 8, 1991, in a 5–3 performance over the Buffalo Sabres, and on January 9, 1992, he recorded his first shutout in a 2–0 win against the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]].&lt;ref name=&quot;detroit page&quot;/&gt; During this time with the Blackhawks, his goaltending coach was [[Vladislav Tretiak]], who was drafted in the same draft as Hašek but never was able to play in the NHL for the same reasons that delayed Hašek's arrival until age 25. His finest performance with the Blackhawks came in game 4 of the 1992 Stanley Cup Finals when he replaced Ed Belfour and played very well in a losing effort.

===Buffalo Sabres (1992–2001)===

After the Stanley Cup finals loss to [[Mario Lemieux]] and the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]], Chicago decided to stay with Belfour and [[Jimmy Waite]]. Hašek was traded to the Buffalo Sabres for goalie [[Stephane Beauregard]] and future considerations, which later materialized into a draft pick used to obtain [[Éric Dazé]]. In Buffalo, wearing number 39, he was initially the backup goaltender, first playing behind [[Tom Draper]] and then [[Grant Fuhr]]. When Fuhr was injured partway through the season, Hašek was elevated to starter, where he soon developed into a top tier goaltender. In [[1993–94 NHL season|1994]], he won his first [[Vezina Trophy]], was runner-up for the [[Hart Trophy]] and shared the [[William M. Jennings Trophy]] with Fuhr. Hašek played 58 games with a league-best 1.95 [[goals against average]] (GAA), seven shutouts, and a .930 [[save percentage]]. He followed this feat by again winning the Vezina Trophy and again placing as a Hart finalist in [[1994–95 NHL season|1995]].

Hašek's continued success in the [[1996–97 NHL season|1996–97 season]] was overshadowed by a conflict with then-head coach [[Ted Nolan]]. The conflict created a tense, clique-like atmosphere in the Sabres' clubhouse.&lt;ref name=&quot;rattling&quot;&gt;{{cite news

However, the media and some teammates speculated that Hašek was using his injury to bail out on the team.&lt;ref name=&quot;rattling&quot;/&gt; One such individual was ''[[Buffalo News]]'' columnist [[Jim Kelley]], who wrote a column which detailed Hašek's injury and his conflict with Nolan, and questioned the goaltender's mental toughness.&lt;ref name=&quot;kelley&quot;&gt;{{cite news

With Steve Shields in goal, the Sabres fought back against the Senators and took the series in seven games. However, Hašek claimed his knee was still injured and did not play in the five-game loss in the following series against the [[Philadelphia Flyers]].

Though General Manager [[John Muckler]] was named &quot;Executive of the Year&quot;, he was fired for his constant feuding with Nolan. Hašek, who sided with Muckler, stated in an interview during the 1997 NHL Awards Ceremony that it would be better if Nolan was not rehired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Despite winning the [[Jack Adams Award]] as top coach and being popular with the Sabres fanbase, Nolan was only offered a one-year contract extension by replacement GM [[Darcy Regier]]. He rejected this under the grounds that it was too short, and decided to part ways with the franchise.

As the season progressed, Hašek played well and won back many fans. He won the Vezina Trophy again, as well as the [[Lester B. Pearson Award]] and the [[Hart Trophy]] for league MVP. He became one the few goaltenders in NHL history to win the Hart, alongside [[Al Rollins]] and [[José Théodore]], and Hall of Famers [[Jacques Plante]], [[Chuck Rayner]] and [[Roy Worters]].

Hašek played a career high 72 games in the [[1997–98 NHL season|1997–98 season]], and set a team record with 13 shutouts. Six of these shutouts came in December, which tied the all-time NHL record for most in one month.&lt;ref name=&quot;HockeydCentral&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hockeydraftcentral.com/1983/83199.html|title=Dominik Hasek Bio at HockeyDraftCentral|publisher=hockeydraftcentral.com|accessdate=2007-04-24|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He again won the Lester B. Pearson Award, the Hart Trophy, and the Vezina Trophy, becoming the first goalie in NHL history to win the Hart twice. He donated the $10,000 prize money after winning the Pearson Award in 1998 to the ''Variety Club of Buffalo''.&lt;ref name=&quot;HockeydCentral&quot;/&gt; In the off-season he signed a $26 million deal, the highest goaltender salary contract at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PREVIOUS NEWS UPDATES from the Goaltender Home Page

He was also a finalist for the Hart and Pearson trophies. Though the Sabres did not have a stellar regular season and finished with the seventh seed in the [[Eastern Conference (NHL)|Eastern Conference]], they defeated the Ottawa Senators, [[Boston Bruins]] and Toronto Maple Leafs in the playoffs en route to a best-of-seven Stanley Cup Final against the [[Presidents' Trophy]]-winning [[Dallas Stars]]. The Sabres eventually lost the series four games to two, with the decisive sixth game being one of the longest Stanley Cup playoff games in NHL history. Hašek and Ed Belfour made 50 and 53 saves, respectively, in a sudden-death [[overtime (ice hockey)|triple-overtime]] duel that only ended when [[Brett Hull]] scored a controversial Cup-winning goal with his foot in the [[Crease (hockey)|goal crease]].&lt;ref name=&quot;HullGoal&quot;&gt;{{cite news

However, after Detroit's first round loss to the [[Anaheim Ducks|Mighty Ducks of Anaheim]] in the [[2002–03 NHL season|following season]], he expressed his desire to play again. This created a difficult situation for the Red Wings, who had two years left on [[Curtis Joseph]]'s three-year $24 million contract, which had a no-trade clause. Detroit was also under pressure knowing that the rival Colorado Avalanche would be looking for a goalie to replace [[Patrick Roy]] after his retirement.&lt;ref name=&quot;comeback&quot;/&gt; With [[Manny Legacé]] also on the Wings' roster, Detroit now had three potential starting goalies.

In the [[2003–04 Detroit Red Wings season|2003–04 season]] Hašek injured his groin after playing just 14 games. On January 9, he and the team agreed he should rest his injury for two to four weeks. Hašek privately told general manager [[Ken Holland]] that he would not accept any pay while he was injured. On February 10, he announced that he was not going to continue to play that season, surprising the Red Wings management.&lt;ref&gt;

===Ottawa Senators (2005–2006)===
After his contract with the Wings expired, Hašek announced his intention to play for a Stanley Cup contender, and specifically named the Ottawa Senators as a possibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

During the [[2004–05 NHL lockout]], Hašek toured with the [[Primus Worldstars]]. Similar to the [[Ninety Nine All Stars Tour|tour]] Wayne Gretzky and [[IMG (business)|IMG]] formed during the [[1994–95 NHL lockout]], the Primus Worldstars Tour ran December 7–23, playing in seven different countries (Riga, Latvia; Moscow and St Petersburg, Russia; Bratislava, Slovakia; Bern, Switzerland; Karlstad, Jonkoping and Linkoping, Sweden; Oslo, Norway; Katowice, Poland) in ten scheduled games. The tour competed against all-star teams or club teams of each country.&lt;ref name=&quot;Worldstars&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imgworld.com/press_room/fullstory.sps?iType=13708&amp;iNewsid=126891&amp;iCategoryID=12543|title=IMG Announces Primus Worldstars Tour Brought to you by Reebok Hockey|accessdate=2012-03-18|publisher=IMGWorld.com|year=2004|work=Press Release|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070927074043/http://www.imgworld.com/press_room/fullstory.sps?iType=13708&amp;iNewsid=126891&amp;iCategoryID=12543|archivedate=2007-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hašek played increasingly well for the Senators up until the [[2006 Winter Olympics]] in [[Turin]]. During the season, he reached [[List of NHL goaltenders with 300 wins|300 career wins]], and his GAA and save percentage were the second-best in the league. Upon departure to Turin, Hašek's equipment was accidentally left behind in [[Ottawa]]. This caused Hašek to miss a number of practices with the [[Czech Republic men's national ice hockey team|Czech National team]]. At the Winter Olympics, he injured his right [[adductor muscles of the hip|adductor muscle]] while making a save in the first qualifying match against [[Germany at the 2006 Winter Olympics#Ice hockey|Germany]], forcing him to leave the game after only 9 minutes and 25 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

time for [[2006 Stanley Cup Playoffs|the playoffs]]. He said that if he were to be re-signed, he would play for a base salary of

After the Senators were eliminated in the second round, they opted not to re-sign Hašek, despite Hašek's willingness to take a pay cut.

===Detroit Red Wings (2006–2008)===
On July 31, 2006, at the age of 41, Hašek joined the Red Wings for the second time. He signed a one-year $750,000 US
contract, with added bonuses if the team succeeded in the playoffs. He posted 38 wins and a 2.05 GAA while leading the Red Wings to
the number one seed in the [[Western Conference (NHL)|Western Conference]]. He also broke his own personal record by going 181 minutes and 17 seconds without allowing a goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Hašek won both games, clinching the series for Detroit. In the next round against the [[San Jose Sharks]], the Red Wings were on the road and down two games to one, but Hašek held the Sharks to three goals in the next three games. His 28-save shutout in game six tied him for sixth place on the all-time NHL playoff shutouts list and sent the Red Wings to the Western Conference finals against the [[Anaheim Ducks]]. However, Hašek and the Red Wings lost in six games to the Ducks, who eventually defeated the Ottawa Senators for the Stanley Cup.

Hašek contemplated retirement in the 2007 offseason, but on July 5, 2007, he signed a one-year contract with Detroit worth $2 million with up to $2 million in bonuses,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

During the [[2007–08 NHL season|2007–08 season]], he was replaced by backup [[Chris Osgood]]. When Hašek recovered and got back into his stride, Detroit chose to alternate goaltenders in tandem instead of designating either as the backup. Detroit coach [[Mike Babcock]] announced Hašek to start in the [[2008 Stanley Cup Playoffs|2008 playoffs]]. Through the first two games against the [[Nashville Predators]], the Red Wings were victorious, but after a lackluster performance in the next two, Osgood was declared as the number one goaltender for the playoffs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usatoday.com/sports/hockey/nhl/wings/2008-06-04-osgood_N.htm &quot;Red Wings' Osgood perseverance pays off with another Cup&quot;] A.J.

On June 9, 2008, Hašek announced his retirement from the NHL, only five days after winning his second [[Stanley Cup]] with the [[Detroit Red Wings]], saying he lacked the motivation for another year in the NHL. With Osgood, the two were awarded the William Jennings Trophy for least goals against on a team in the season. Hašek is expected to be inducted into the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]] in his first year of eligibility.&lt;ref name=&quot;CP HHOF&quot; /&gt;

==Out of retirement in Europe==

Hašek's most memorable international performance came in the [[Ice hockey at the 1998 Winter Olympics|1998 Winter Olympics]], where he led the [[Czech Republic men's national ice hockey team|Czech national team]] to the gold medal. He allowed six goals in total, with only two of them coming in the medal round. Against Team Canada in the semifinals, Hašek stopped [[Theoren Fleury]], [[Ray Bourque]], [[Joe Nieuwendyk]], [[Eric Lindros]] and [[Brendan Shanahan]] in a dramatic shootout win. He then shut out the [[Russia men's national ice hockey team|Russian team]] 1–0 in the final game, stopping 20 shots. He was later announced as the best goaltender in the Olympics. After he won the gold, he was quoted as saying:&lt;ref name=&quot;OlympicQuote&quot;&gt;

His play made him one of the most popular figures in the Czech Republic, so much so that residents chanted &quot;Hašek to the castle!&quot; in the streets. In response to this, Hašek called the country's president [[Václav Havel]] and jokingly told him that his job was not in jeopardy.&lt;ref&gt;

In order to cover the bottom of the net, where most goals are scored, Hašek drops down on almost every [[shot (ice hockey)|shot]]. His &quot;flopping&quot; style is derived from him flailing in the crease, using every part of his body, including his head, to stop the puck. Hašek occasionally drops his stick and covers the puck with his stick hand, whereas most goaltenders would use the glove hand instead.&lt;ref name=&quot;MainBio&quot;/&gt;
In response to the speculation he receives from his style, Hašek explained:

{{cquote|They say I am unorthodox, I flop around the ice like some kind of fish. I say, who cares as long as I stop the puck?&lt;ref name=&quot;flex&quot;/&gt;}}

Throughout his long career, Hašek has been represented by agent [[Ritch Winter]].&lt;ref name=&quot;HockeydCentral&quot;/&gt;

===Inline hockey game incident===
During an inline hockey game on May 18, 2003, Hašek was accused of assaulting another player. He was playing as a defender for Bonfire Střída when he crosschecked [[Martin Šíla]]. The prosecutor in the case, Lenka Strnadová, ruled two months later that there was no evidence that Hašek intended bodily harm and recommended the case be treated as a misdemeanor, punishable only by fine ($95 USD maximum), rather than a felony where jail time would have been possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

In October 2003, the country's top prosecutor overruled Strnadová, saying her ruling was unlawful because the case had not been properly investigated. The Pardubice prosecution then investigated the case again, and reached the same decision as Strnadová.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Legacy==
===Milestones===
Hašek earned his 300th National Hockey League win on October 15, 2005, in a 5–1 home victory with the Ottawa Senators over the Boston Bruins. He stopped 34 of 35 shots and was holding a shutout until Bruins forward [[Pat Leahy (ice hockey)|Pat Leahy]] jammed a loose puck under him three minutes into the third period. He became the twenty-second goaltender to reach the milestone.&lt;ref name=&quot;MainBio&quot;/&gt; He is the oldest goaltender in NHL history to post a 30-win season, and in 1997, he became the first goaltender to win the Lester B. Pearson Award for most outstanding player in the league. He is also the only goaltender to win the Hart Trophy twice for most valuable player, and was only one Vezina Trophy away from tying Jacques Plante's record of seven. Hašek's personal best shutout streak is 181 minutes, 17 seconds.

===Records===
In nine seasons with the Buffalo Sabres, Hašek acquired over 25 franchise records, including most all-time games played, wins, shutouts and lowest goals against average.&lt;ref name=&quot;HockeydCentral&quot;/&gt; He also holds the Sabres' record for most shutouts in a single season with 13 in 1997–98, and lowest goals against average in a single season with a total of 1.87 in 1998–99. During the Detroit Red Wings' championship run in 2002, Hašek set franchise records for most games played, minutes played, wins and shutouts in a playoff year. He holds several notable NHL records:

&lt;div style=&quot;float:left; margin-right:1.5em;&quot;&gt;
;&lt;u&gt;General&lt;/u&gt;
;Before retirement

* 3rd place – Most shutouts of all active players
* 4th place – Most wins of all active players

;All-time
* 1st place – Highest career save percent (.922)
* 1st place – Most games played by a European &lt;br /&gt; born goaltender (735)
* 6th place – Most shutouts (81)
* 8th place – Lowest goals against average (2.20)
* 11th place – Most wins (389)
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;float:left; margin-right:1.5em;&quot;&gt;
;&lt;u&gt;Regular season&lt;/u&gt;
* First European goalie to lead the NHL in GAA (1993–94)
* First goalie since 1974 to have a GAA below 2.00 (1993–94)
* Most shutouts in one month (six in 97–98)
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;float:left;&quot;&gt;
;&lt;u&gt;Playoffs&lt;/u&gt;
;Before retirement
* 3rd place – Most shutouts of all active players (15)
* 4th place – Most wins of all active players (61)
;All-time
* 2nd place – Most shutouts in one season (6)
* 3rd place – Most shutouts (15)
* 10th place – Most wins (61)
&lt;/div&gt;{{-}}

Possibly the most impressive single-game performance by any player in NHL history came on April 27, 1994. Hašek made 70 saves in a 4OT shutout. The opposing goalie was Martin Brodeur, then a rookie, who made 49 saves before being beaten by Dave Hannan and the Sabres beat New Jersey 1–0. Hašek's 70 saves set a record, which still stands, for the most saves without allowing a goal.
