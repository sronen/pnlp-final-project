'''Sanford &quot;Sandy&quot; Koufax''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|k|oʊ|f|æ|k|s}}; born '''Sanford Braun''', December 30, 1935) is an American former [[left-handed]] [[baseball]] [[pitcher]] who played his entire 12-year [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) career for the [[Los Angeles Dodgers|Brooklyn/Los Angeles Dodgers]] (1955–1966). Retiring at the peak of his career, he became, at age 36 and 20 days, the youngest player ever elected to the [[Baseball Hall of Fame]] in 1972.&lt;ref name=&quot;kirbypuckett&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Retired Numbers – Kirby Puckett | work = minnesota.twins.mlb.com | url=http://minnesota.twins.mlb.com/min/history/puckett.jsp| accessdate = February 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Koufax's career peaked with a run of six outstanding seasons from {{By|1961}} to 1966, before arthritis in his left elbow ended his career prematurely at age 30. He was named the [[National League]]'s [[MLB Most Valuable Player award|Most Valuable Player]] in {{By|1963}}. He also won the 1963, {{By|1965}}, and 1966 [[Cy Young Award]]s by unanimous votes, making him the first 3-time Cy Young winner in baseball history and the only one to win 3 times when the award was for all of baseball, not just one league. In each of his Cy Young seasons, Koufax won the [[triple crown (baseball)|pitcher's triple crown]] by leading the NL in [[win (baseball)|wins]], [[strikeout]]s, and [[earned run average]].  Koufax's totals would also have led the American League in those seasons.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbref-skoufax&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Sandy Koufax Statistics | work = www.baseball-reference.com | url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/k/koufasa01.shtml | accessdate = February 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = 1963 Major League Leaders | url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/ML_1963_t.shtml | accessdate=February 17, 2007}} {{cite web | title = 1965 Major League Leaders | url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/ML_1965_t.shtml | accessdate=February 17, 2007}}  {{cite web | title = 1966 Major League Leaders | url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/ML_1966_t.shtml | accessdate=February 17, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Koufax was the first major leaguer to pitch four [[no-hitter]]s (including the eighth [[perfect game]] in baseball history).  Despite his comparatively short career, Koufax's 2,396 career strikeouts ranked 7th in history as of his retirement, trailing only [[Warren Spahn]] (2,583) among left-handers. 

Koufax is also remembered as one of the outstanding [[Jew]]ish athletes in American sports. His decision to not pitch Game 1 of the [[1965 World Series]] because it fell on [[Yom Kippur]] garnered national attention as an example of conflict between social pressures and personal beliefs.&lt;ref name=&quot;yomkippur&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title = Yom Kippur and Sandy Koufax | work = JewishSports.com | first=Sandor | last=Solomvits | url=http://www.jewishsports.com/reflections/koufax_yom.htm | accessdate = August 2, 2010 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061018193520/http://www.jewishsports.com/reflections/koufax_yom.htm |archivedate = October 18, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Koufax was born in [[Brooklyn]], New York, to a Jewish family, and raised in [[Borough Park]].&lt;ref name=&quot;jewishvirtuallibrary.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title = Koufax Biography | work = jewishvirtuallibrary.org | first=Seymour | last=Brody | url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/Koufax.html | accessdate = November 15, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His parents, Evelyn (née Lichtenstein) and Jack Braun, divorced when he was three years old; his mother was remarried when he was nine, to Irving Koufax.&lt;ref name=&quot;hickocksports.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title = Koufax Biography | work = www.hickoksports.com | url=http://www.hickoksports.com/biograph/koufaxsandy.shtml | accessdate = November 15, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Shortly after his mother's remarriage, the family moved to the [[Long Island]] suburb of [[Rockville Centre, New York|Rockville Centre]]. Before tenth grade, Koufax's family moved back to the [[Bensonhurst, Brooklyn|Bensonhurst]] section of Brooklyn.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Koufax and Linn|Koufax and Linn]], pp. 19–22.&lt;/ref&gt;

Koufax attended Brooklyn's [[Lafayette High School (New York City)|Lafayette High School]], where he was better known for [[basketball]] than for baseball. At the time, school sports were not available because New York's teachers were refusing to supervise extracurricular activities without monetary compensation. As an alternative, Koufax started playing basketball for the [[Edith and Carl Marks Jewish Community House of Bensonhurst]] local community center team. Eventually, Lafayette had a basketball team; Koufax became team captain in his senior year, and ranked second in his division in scoring, with 165 points in 10 games.&lt;ref name=&quot;jewishvirtuallibrary.org&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Koufax and Linn|Koufax and Linn]], pp. 22–28; [[#Leavy|Leavy]], pp. 37–40.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1951, at the age of 15, Koufax also joined a local youth baseball league known as the &quot;Ice Cream League.&quot; He started out as a left-handed catcher before moving to first base. While playing first base for Lafayette High School's baseball team with teammate and friend [[Fred Wilpon]]&lt;ref&gt;http://espn.go.com/new-york/mlb/story/_/id/7680912/sandy-koufax-bernard-madoff-new-york-mets-trial-witness-list&lt;/ref&gt;, he was spotted by Milt Laurie, the father of two Lafayette teammates and a baseball coach. Laurie recognized that Koufax might be able to pitch, and recruited the 17-year old Koufax to pitch for the Coney Island Sports League's Parkviews.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Koufax and Linn|Koufax and Linn]], pp. 32–39.&lt;/ref&gt;

Koufax attended the [[University of Cincinnati]] and was a walk-on on the freshman basketball team, a complete unknown to coach Ed Jucker.&lt;ref name=&quot;hickocksports.com&quot;/&gt;  In spring 1954, he made the college baseball [[varsity team]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Koufax and Linn|Koufax and Linn]], pp. 43–44.&lt;/ref&gt; That season, Koufax went 3–1 with &lt;!--Koufax's autobiograph didn't include the ERA so I'm commenting it out until another source can be found a 2.81 [[earned run average|ERA]],--&gt; 51 [[strikeout]]s and 30 [[base on balls|walks]], in 31 innings.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Koufax and Linn|Koufax and Linn]], p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bill Zinser]], a scout for the Brooklyn Dodgers, sent the Dodgers front office a glowing report that apparently was filed and forgotten.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Koufax and Linn|Koufax and Linn]], pp. 44–45.&lt;/ref&gt;

After trying out with the [[San Francisco Giants|New York Giants]] at the [[Polo Grounds]],&lt;ref&gt;[[#Koufax and Linn|Koufax and Linn]], pp. 46–48.&lt;/ref&gt; Koufax did the same for the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] at [[Forbes Field]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Koufax and Linn|Koufax and Linn]], pp. 56–57.&lt;/ref&gt; During his Pirates tryout, Koufax's fastball broke the thumb of [[Sam Narron (catcher)|Sam Narron]], the team's bullpen coach. [[Branch Rickey]], then the [[general manager (baseball)|general manager]] of the Pirates, told his scout [[Clyde Sukeforth]] that Koufax had the &quot;greatest arm [he had] ever seen.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Leavy|Leavy]], p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; The Pirates, however, failed to offer Koufax a contract until after he was already committed to the Dodgers.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Koufax and Linn|Koufax and Linn]], pp. 70–74.&lt;/ref&gt;  Dodgers scout [[Al Campanis]] heard about Koufax from a local sporting goods store owner. After seeing Koufax pitch for Lafayette, Campanis invited him to an [[Ebbets Field]] tryout. With Dodgers manager [[Walter Alston]] and scouting director [[Fresco Thompson]] watching, Campanis assumed the hitter's stance while Koufax started throwing. Campanis later said, &quot;There are two times in my life the hair on my arms has stood up: The first time I saw the ceiling of the [[Sistine Chapel]] and the first time I saw Sandy Koufax throw a fastball.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Leavy|Leavy]], p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; The Dodgers signed Koufax for a $6,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|6000|1954|r=-3}}}} today) salary, with a $14,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|14000|1954|r=-3}}}} today) [[signing bonus]]. Koufax planned to use the signing bonus as tuition to finish his university education, if his baseball career failed.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Koufax and Linn|Koufax and Linn]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional career==
===Early years (1955–60)===
Because Koufax's signing bonus was greater than $4,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|4000|1954|r=-3}}}} today), he was known as a [[bonus rule|bonus baby]]. This forced the Dodgers to keep him on the major league roster for at least two years before he could be sent to the [[minor league baseball|minors]]. To make room for him, the Dodgers optioned their future manager, [[Tommy Lasorda]], to the [[Montreal Royals]] of the [[International League]]. Lasorda would later joke that it took Koufax to keep him off the Dodger pitching staff.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Koufax and Linn|Koufax and Linn]], pp. 42, 75–94.&lt;/ref&gt;

Koufax made his major league debut on June 24 {{By|1955}} against the [[1955 Milwaukee Braves season|Milwaukee Braves]], with the Dodgers trailing 7–1 in the fifth inning. [[Johnny Logan (baseball player)|Johnny Logan]], the first batter Koufax faced, hit a bloop single. [[Eddie Mathews]] bunted, and Koufax threw the ball into center field. Koufax walked [[Hank Aaron]] on four pitches to load the bases, then struck out [[Bobby Thomson]] on a [[full count]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Koufax and Linn|Koufax and Linn]], pp. 95–97.&lt;/ref&gt;

Koufax's first start was on July 6. He lasted only {{frac|4|2|3}} innings, giving up eight walks.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Koufax and Linn|Koufax and Linn]], pp. 98–99.&lt;/ref&gt; He did not start again for almost two months, but on August 27, Koufax threw a two-hit, 7–0 [[complete game]] [[shutout]] against the [[1955 Cincinnati Redlegs season|Cincinnati Reds]] for his first major league win.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Koufax and Linn|Koufax and Linn]], pp. 99–100, 295.&lt;/ref&gt; Koufax made only 12 appearances in 1955, pitching {{frac|41|2|3}} innings and walking almost as many men (28) as he struck out (30). His only other win in 1955 was also a shutout.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Koufax and Linn|Koufax and Linn]], p. 295.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the fall, he enrolled in the [[Columbia University School of General Studies]], which offered night classes in architecture. The [[1955 Brooklyn Dodgers season|Dodgers]] won the [[1955 World Series]] for the first title in franchise history, but Koufax did not appear in the series. After the final out of Game Seven, Koufax drove to Columbia to attend class.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Koufax and Linn|Koufax and Linn]], pp. 3, 105–107.&lt;/ref&gt;

The year 1956 wasn't very different from 1955 for Koufax. Despite the blazing speed of his fastball, Koufax continued to struggle with control problems. He saw little work, pitching only 58.7 innings with a 4.91 ERA, walking 29 and striking out 30. He was rarely allowed to work out of a jam. As soon as Koufax threw a couple of balls in a row, Alston would signal for a replacement to start warming up in the bullpen. [[Jackie Robinson]], in his final season, clashed with Alston on several different subjects, including Koufax. Robinson saw that Koufax was talented and had flashes of brilliance, and objected to Koufax being benched for weeks at a time.

Koufax had arthritis in his left elbow.
To prepare for the {{By|1957}} season, the [[1957 Brooklyn Dodgers season|Dodgers]] sent Koufax to [[Puerto Rico]] to play winter ball. On May 15, the restriction on sending Koufax down to the minors was lifted. Alston gave him a chance to justify his place on the major league roster by giving him the next day's start. Facing the [[1957 Chicago Cubs season|Chicago Cubs]] at [[Wrigley Field]], Koufax struck out 13 while pitching his first complete game in almost two years. For the first time in his career, he was in the starting rotation, but only for two weeks. Despite winning three of his next five with a 2.90 ERA, Koufax didn't get another start for 45 days. In that start, he struck out 11 in seven innings, but got a no-decision. On September 29, Koufax became the last man ever to pitch for the Brooklyn Dodgers before their move to Los Angeles, by throwing an inning of relief in the final game of the season.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Koufax and Linn|Koufax and Linn]], pp. 117–124; [[#Leavy|Leavy]], pp. 87–90.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the next three seasons, Koufax was in and out of the Dodger starting rotation due to injuries. In 1958, he began 7–3, but sprained his ankle in a collision at first base, finishing the season at 11–11 and leading the NL in wild pitches. In June 1959, Koufax set the record for a night game with 16 strikeouts. On August 31, 1959, he surpassed his career high with 18 strikeouts, setting the NL record and tying [[Bob Feller]]'s major league record for strikeouts in one game.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Koufax and Linn|Koufax and Linn]], pp. 125–138; [[#Leavy|Leavy]], pp. 90–92; {{cite web | title = Box score and play by play | url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/B08310LAN1959.htm | accessdate=February 17, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In {{By|1959}}, the Dodgers won a close pennant race against the [[1959 Milwaukee Braves season|Braves]] and the [[1959 San Francisco Giants season|Giants]], then beat the [[1959 Chicago White Sox season|Chicago White Sox]] in the [[1959 World Series|World Series]]. Koufax pitched two perfect relief innings in the Series opener, though they came after the Dodgers were already behind 11–0. Alston gave him the start in the fifth game, at the [[Los Angeles Coliseum]] in front of 92,706 fans. Koufax allowed only one run in seven innings, but lost the 1–0 game when [[Nellie Fox]] scored on a double play. Returning to Chicago, the Dodgers won the sixth game and the Series.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Koufax and Linn|Koufax and Linn]], pp. 139–141; {{cite web | title = Box score and play by play | url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/B10060LAN1959.htm | accessdate=February 17, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early {{By|1960}}, Koufax asked Dodgers GM [[Buzzie Bavasi]] to trade him because he wasn't getting enough playing time. By the end of [[1960 Los Angeles Dodgers season|1960]], after going 8–13, Koufax was thinking about quitting baseball to devote himself to an [[electronics]] business that he'd invested in. After the last game of the season, he threw his gloves and spikes into the trash. Nobe Kawano, the clubhouse supervisor, retrieved the equipment to return to Koufax the following year (or to somebody else if Koufax did not return to play).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Koufax and Linn|Koufax and Linn]], pp. 142–147; [[#Leavy|Leavy]], pp. 93–95.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Domination (1961–64)===
====1961 season====
[[File:Sandy Koufax 1961.png|thumb|180px|Koufax in 1961.]]
Koufax decided to try one more year of baseball and showed up for the 1961 season in better condition than he had in previous years. Years later he recalled, &quot;That winter was when I really started working out. I started running more. I decided I was really going to find out how good I can be.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Leavy|Leavy]], p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt; During spring training, Dodger scout Kenny Myers discovered a hitch in Koufax's windup: he'd rear back so far that his vision was obstructed and he couldn't see the target.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Leavy|Leavy]], p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

A day later, Koufax was pitching for the &quot;B team&quot; in [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]]. Teammate Ed Palmquist missed the flight, so Koufax was told he would need to pitch at least seven innings. In the first inning, Koufax walked the bases loaded on 12 straight pitches. Catcher [[Norm Sherry]] reminded Koufax to take something off the ball to get better control. The advice worked, as Koufax struck out the side, going on to pitch seven no-hit innings.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Koufax and Linn|Koufax and Linn]], pp. 153–155; [[#Leavy|Leavy]], pp. 102–103.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was the beginning of Koufax's breakout season.  Posting an 18–13 record, Koufax led the league with 269 strikeouts, breaking [[Christy Mathewson]]'s 58-year-old NL mark of 267.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Koufax and Linn|Koufax and Linn]], pp. 157–159; [[#Leavy|Leavy]], pp. 115–116.&lt;/ref&gt; Koufax made his first two [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Game]] appearances (two All-Star games were played per year at that time), pitching two scoreless innings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = First game box score and play by play | url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/B07110NLS1961.htm | accessdate=February 17, 2007}} {{cite web | title = Second game box score and play by play | url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/B07310ALS1961.htm | accessdate=February 17, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====1962 season====
In {{By|1962}}, the Dodgers moved from Los Angeles Coliseum, which had a 250-foot left field line, to pitcher-friendly [[Dodger Stadium]]. The new park had a large foul territory and a comparatively poor hitting background. Koufax was an immediate beneficiary of the change, lowering his home ERA from 4.29 to 1.75.&lt;ref&gt;[[#James|James]], p. 233; [[#Koufax and Linn|Koufax and Linn]], pp. 127–128; [[#Leavy|Leavy]], p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt;  On June 30 against the expansion [[New York Mets]], Koufax threw his first no-hitter. In the first inning of that game, Koufax struck out three batters on nine pitches to become the sixth National League pitcher and the 11th pitcher in Major League history to accomplish a [[pitchers who struck out three batters on nine pitches|nine-pitch/three-strikeout half-inning]]. With the no-hitter and a 1.23 ERA for June, he was named [[Player of the Month]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Koufax and Linn|Koufax and Linn]], pp. 167–169; [[#Leavy|Leavy]], p. 119; {{cite web | title = Player of the Month Award | url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/awards/player_of_the_month_award.shtml | accessdate=February 17, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;9pitch9strike&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = 9-Pitches, 9-Strikes, Side Retired | url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/feats/feats17.shtml | accessdate=February 17, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Koufax had his strong season despite an injured pitching hand. While batting in April, Koufax had been jammed by a pitch from [[Earl Francis]]. A numbness developed in Koufax's index finger on his left hand, and the finger became cold and white. Koufax was pitching better than ever, however, so he ignored the problem, hoping that the condition would clear up. By July, though, his entire hand was becoming numb and he was unable to complete some games. In a start in Cincinnati, his finger split open after one inning. A vascular specialist determined that Koufax had a crushed artery in his palm. Ten days of experimental medicine successfully reopened the artery. Koufax finally was able to pitch again in September, when the team was locked in a tight pennant race with the Giants. But after the long layoff, Koufax was ineffective in three appearances as the Giants caught the Dodgers at the end of the regular season, forcing a three-game playoff.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Koufax and Linn|Koufax and Linn]], pp. 165–176; [[#Leavy|Leavy]], pp. 120–121.&lt;/ref&gt;

The night before the National League playoffs began, Manager [[Walter Alston]] asked Koufax if he could start the first game the next day. With an overworked pitching staff, there was no one else, as [[Don Drysdale]] and [[Johnny Podres]] had pitched the prior two days. Koufax obliged. Koufax later said, &quot;I had nothing at all.&quot; He was knocked out in the second inning, after giving up home runs to Hall of Famer [[Willie Mays]] and [[Jim Davenport]]. After winning the second game of the series, the Dodgers blew a 4–2 lead in the ninth inning of the deciding third game, losing the pennant.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Koufax and Linn|Koufax and Linn]], pp. 176–177; [[#Neyer|Neyer]], pp. 111–118.&lt;/ref&gt;

====1963 season====
In 1963, Major League Baseball expanded the [[strike zone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/articles/strike_zone_rules_history.shtml |title=The Strike Zone : A Chronological Examination of the Official Rules by Baseball Almanac |publisher=Baseball-almanac.com |date= |accessdate=January 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to the previous season, National League walks fell 13 percent, strikeouts increased six percent, the league batting average fell from .261 to .245, and runs fell 15 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=1962 National League Team Statistics and Standings | url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/NL/1962.shtml | accessdate=June 20, 2010}}{{cite web | title=1963 National League Team Statistics and Standings | url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/NL/1963.shtml | accessdate=June 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Koufax, who had reduced his walks allowed per nine innings to 3.4 in 1961 and 2.8 in 1962, reduced his walk rate further to 1.7 in 1963, which ranked fifth in the league.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbref-skoufax&quot;/&gt; The top pitchers of the era &amp;ndash; Don Drysdale, [[Juan Marichal]], [[Jim Bunning]], [[Bob Gibson]], [[Warren Spahn]], and above all Koufax &amp;ndash; significantly reduced the walks-given-up-to-batters-faced ratio for 1963, and subsequent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/ |title=Baseball Encyclopedia of MLB Players |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com |date= |accessdate=January 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 11, Koufax [[no-hit]] the [[San Francisco Giants]] and outdueled future Hall of Fame pitcher [[Juan Marichal]].  Koufax carried a [[perfect game]] into the eighth inning against the powerful [[1963 San Francisco Giants season|Giants]] lineup, including future Hall of Famers Willie Mays, [[Willie McCovey]], and [[Orlando Cepeda]]. He walked [[Ed Bailey]] on a 3-and-2 pitch, but preserved the no-hitter by closing out the ninth.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Koufax and Linn|Koufax and Linn]], pp. 181–183; [[#Leavy|Leavy]], pp. 122–123.&lt;/ref&gt; As the Dodgers won the pennant, Koufax won the pitchers' [[Triple crown (baseball)|Triple Crown]], leading the league in wins (25), strikeouts (306) and ERA (1.88).  Koufax threw 11 shutouts, setting a new record for shutouts by a left-handed pitcher that stands to this day (the previous record of 9 shutouts had been held by Babe Ruth for nearly 50 years). Only [[Bob Gibson]], a right-hander, has thrown more shutouts (13) since, and that was in 1968, &quot;the year of the pitcher.&quot;

Koufax won the NL [[MLB Most Valuable Player award|MVP Award]], the [[Hickok Belt]], and was the first-ever unanimous selection for the [[Cy Young Award]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = 1963 National League Statistics and Awards | url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/NL_1963.shtml | accessdate=February 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;hickokbelt&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = The Hickok Belt | url=http://www.hickoksports.com/history/hickbelt.shtml | accessdate=February 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Facing the [[1963 New York Yankees season|Yankees]] in the [[1963 World Series]], Koufax beat [[Whitey Ford]] 5-2 in Game 1 and struck out 15 batters, breaking [[Carl Erskine]]'s decade-old record of 14 (Gibson would break Koufax's record by striking out 17 [[1968 Detroit Tigers season|Detroit Tigers]] in the [[1968 World Series]] opener).

====1964 season====
Koufax's {{By|1964}} season started with great expectations. On April 18, he struck out three batters on nine pitches in the third inning of a 3–0 loss to the [[1964 Cincinnati Reds season|Cincinnati Reds]], becoming the only National League pitcher to have two [[pitchers who struck out three batters on nine pitches|nine-pitch/three-strikeout half-inning]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;9pitch9strike&quot;/&gt;  On April 22, however, he felt something &quot;let go&quot; in his arm. Koufax ended up getting three [[cortisone]] shots for his sore elbow, and missed three starts.

On June 4, playing at [[Shibe Park|Connie Mack Stadium]] against the [[1964 Philadelphia Phillies season|Phillies]], Koufax [[base on balls|walked]] [[Dick Allen|Richie Allen]] on a very close full-count pitch in the fourth inning. Allen, who was thrown out trying to steal second, was the first and last Phillie to reach base that day. With his third no-hitter in three years, Koufax became only the second pitcher of the modern era (after [[Bob Feller]]) to pitch three no-hitters.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Koufax and Linn|Koufax and Linn]], pp. 219–221; [[#Leavy|Leavy]], pp. 151–153.&lt;/ref&gt;

Koufax jammed his pitching arm in August while diving back to second base to beat a pick-off throw. He managed to pitch and win two more games. However, the morning after his 19th win, a shutout in which he struck out 13 batters, he could not straighten his arm. He was diagnosed by Dodgers' team physician [[Robert Kerlan]] with traumatic [[arthritis]]. With the Dodgers out of the pennant race, the book was closed on Koufax and his 19–5 record.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Koufax and Linn|Koufax and Linn]], pp. 222–228; [[#Leavy|Leavy]], pp. 155–157.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Playing in pain (1965–66)===
====1965 season====
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Koufax mag.jpg|thumb|Sandy Koufax on the cover of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', March 4, 1963]] --&gt;
The 1965 season brought more obstacles for Koufax. On March 31, the morning after pitching a complete [[spring training]] game, Koufax awoke to find that his entire left arm was [[bruise|black and blue]] from [[hemorrhage|hemorrhaging]]. Koufax returned to Los Angeles to consult with Kerlan, who advised Koufax that he would be lucky to be able to pitch once a week. Kerlan also told Koufax that he would eventually lose full use of his arm. Koufax agreed not to throw at all between games—a resolution that lasted only one start. To get himself through the games he pitched in, Koufax resorted to Empirin with [[codeine]] for the pain, which he took every night and sometimes during the fifth inning.  He also took [[Phenylbutazone|Butazolidin]] for inflammation, applied [[capsaicin]]-based Capsolin ointment (called &quot;atomic balm&quot; by baseball players) before each game, and soaked his arm in a tub of ice afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Koufax and Linn|Koufax and Linn]], pp. 228–239; [[#Leavy|Leavy]], pp. 157–160.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the constant pain in his pitching elbow, Koufax pitched 335⅔ innings and led the [[1965 Los Angeles Dodgers season|Dodgers]] to another pennant. He finished the year by winning his second pitchers' Triple Crown, leading the league in wins (26), ERA (2.04) and strikeouts (382; the highest modern day total at the time. [[Nolan Ryan]] struck out 383 batters in {{By|1973}}). Koufax captured his second unanimous Cy Young Award. Koufax held batters to 5.79 hits per nine innings, and allowed the fewest base runners per 9 innings in any season ever: 7.83, breaking his own record (set two years earlier) of 7.96. Koufax had 11-game winning streaks in both 1964 and 1965.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbref-skoufax&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Koufax and Linn|Koufax and Linn]], pp. 234–240; [[#Leavy|Leavy]], p. 160; {{cite web | title = Single-Season Leaders for Strikeouts | url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/leaders/SO_p_season.shtml | accessdate=February 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Koufax garnered headlines by declining to pitch Game 1 of the [[1965 World Series|World Series]] due to his observance of Yom Kippur.  [[Don Drysdale]] pitched the opener, but was hit hard by the [[1965 Minnesota Twins season|Minnesota Twins]]. In Game 2, Koufax pitched six innings, giving up two runs, but the Twins won the Game 5–1 and took an early 2–0 lead in the series. The Dodgers fought back in Games 3 and 4, with wins by [[Claude Osteen]] and Drysdale.  With the Series tied at 2 to 2, Koufax pitched a complete game shutout in Game 5 for a 3–2 Dodgers lead as the Series returned to [[Metropolitan Stadium|Minnesota's Metropolitan Stadium]] for Game 6.  The Twins won Game 6 to force a seventh game. Starting Game 7 on just two days of rest, Koufax pitched through fatigue and arthritic pain.  Despite giving up on his curveball early in the game after failing to get it over for strikes in the first two innings and pitching the rest of the game relying almost entirely on fastballs, he threw a three-hit shutout to clinch the Series. The performance earned him his second World Series MVP award. Koufax also won the [[Hickok Belt]] a second time, the first (and only) time anyone had won the belt more than once. He was awarded ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' magazine's [[Sportsman of the Year]] award.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbref-skoufax&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;hickokbelt&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Koufax and Linn|Koufax and Linn]], pp. 256–268; [[#Leavy|Leavy]], pp. 169–195; {{cite web | title = 1965 World Series box scores and play by play | url=http://retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1965/YPS_1965.htm | accessdate=February 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Perfection====
{{Main|Sandy Koufax's perfect game}}

On September 9, 1965, Koufax became the sixth pitcher of the modern era, and eighth overall, to throw a perfect game, the first by a left-hander since 1880. The game was Koufax's fourth no-hitter, setting a Major League record (subsequently broken by [[Nolan Ryan]]). Koufax struck out 14 batters, the most recorded in a perfect game. The game also featured a quality performance by the opposing pitcher, [[Bob Hendley]] of the [[1965 Chicago Cubs season|Cubs]]. Hendley pitched a one-hitter and allowed only two batters to reach base. Both pitchers had no-hitters intact until the seventh inning.

This remains the only nine-inning major league game where the teams combined for just one hit. The game's only run, scored by the Dodgers, was [[earned run|unearned]].&lt;ref name=&quot;baseballlibrary&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Sandy Koufax | work = www.baseballlibrary.com | url=http://www.baseballlibrary.com/baseballlibrary/ballplayers/K/Koufax_Sandy.stm | accessdate = February 15, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Attiyeh | first = Mike | title = The five best pitching duels ever | url=http://baseballguru.com/attiyeh/analysismikeattiyeh04.html | accessdate=February 18, 2007 | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070214143847/http://baseballguru.com/attiyeh/analysismikeattiyeh04.html &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt; | archivedate=February 14, 2007}} {{cite web | title = Box score and play by play | url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1965/B09090LAN1965.htm | accessdate=February 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Dodger run was scored without a recorded at bat—[[Lou Johnson]] walked, reached second on a sacrifice bunt, stole third, and scored when the throw to get him out at third went wild.

====Holdout====
Before the 1966 season began, Koufax and Drysdale met separately with Dodger GM [[Buzzie Bavasi]] to negotiate their contracts for the upcoming year. After Koufax's meeting, he met Drysdale for dinner and complained that Bavasi was using Drysdale against him in the negotiations, asking, &quot;How come you want that much when Drysdale only wants this much?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Leavy|Leavy]], p. 205&lt;/ref&gt; Drysdale responded that Bavasi did the same thing with him, using Koufax against him. Drysdale's first wife, Ginger Drysdale, suggested that they negotiate together to get what they wanted. They demanded $1 million (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1000000|1966|r=-4}}}} today), divided equally over the next three years, or $167,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|167000|1966|r=-3}}}} today) each for the next three seasons. Both players were represented by an entertainment lawyer, J. William Hayes, which was unusual during an era when players were not represented by agents.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Leavy|Leavy]], pp. 200–207.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=STT&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,835304,00.html|title=Sic Transit Tradition|accessdate=April 30, 2008|date=April 8, 1966|publisher=[[Time, Inc.]]|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, Willie Mays was [[Major League Baseball]]'s highest paid player at $125,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|125000|1966|r=-3}}}} today) per year and multi-year contracts were very unusual.&lt;ref name=DP&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,842547,00.html|title=Double Play|accessdate=April 30, 2008|date=March 25, 1966|publisher=[[Time, Inc.]]|work=Time}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Koufax and Drysdale didn't report to spring training in February. Instead, they both signed to appear in the movie ''[[Warning Shot]]'', starring [[David Janssen]]. Drysdale was to play a TV commentator and Koufax a [[detective]]. Meanwhile, the Dodgers waged a [[public relations]] battle against them. After four weeks, Koufax gave Drysdale the go-ahead to negotiate new deals for both of them. Koufax ended up getting $125,000 and Drysdale $110,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|110000|1966|r=-3}}}} today). They rejoined the team in the last week of spring training.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Leavy|Leavy]], pp. 207–210.&lt;/ref&gt;

====1966 season====
In April 1966, Kerlan told Koufax it was time to retire, that his arm could not take another season. Koufax kept Kerlan's advice to himself and went out every fourth day to pitch. He ended up pitching 323 innings and had a 27–9 record with a 1.73 ERA. Since then, no left-hander has had more wins, nor a lower ERA, in a season (Phillies pitcher [[Steve Carlton]] did match the 27-win mark in 1972). In the final game of the regular season, the Dodgers had to beat the Phillies to win the pennant. In the second game of a doubleheader, Koufax faced [[Jim Bunning]] for the second time that season,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/LAN/LAN196607270.shtml |title=July 27 box score |publisher=Baseball-reference.com |date=July 27, 1966 |accessdate=January 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a match-up between perfect game winners. Koufax, on two days rest, pitched a complete game, 6–3 victory to clinch the pennant.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Leavy|Leavy]], pp. 222–236.&lt;/ref&gt; He started 41 games (for the second year in a row); only two left-handers started as many games in any season over the ensuing years through 2010.

The [[1966 Los Angeles Dodgers season|Dodgers]] went on to face the [[1966 Baltimore Orioles season|Baltimore Orioles]] in the [[1966 World Series]]. Game 2 marked Koufax's third start in eight days. Koufax pitched well enough—Baltimore first baseman [[Boog Powell]] told Koufax's biographer, Jane Leavy, &quot;He might have been hurtin' but he was bringin'&quot;—but three errors by Dodger center fielder [[Willie Davis (baseball player)|Willie Davis]] in the fifth inning produced three unearned runs. Baltimore's [[Jim Palmer]] pitched a four-hitter and the Dodgers ended up losing the game 6–0. Alston lifted Koufax at the end of the sixth inning with the idea of getting him extra rest before pitching a potential fifth Series game. It never happened; the Dodgers were swept in four, not scoring a single run in the last three. After the World Series, Koufax announced his retirement due to his arthritic condition.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Leavy|Leavy]], pp. 236–239; {{cite web | title = Box score and play by play | url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1966/B10060LAN1966.htm | accessdate=February 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Career overall===
In his 12-season career, Koufax had a 165–87 record with a 2.76 ERA, 2,396 strikeouts, 137 complete games, and 40 shutouts. He was the first pitcher to average fewer than seven [[hit (baseball)|hits]] allowed per nine [[innings pitched]] in his career (6.79) and to strike out more than nine batters (9.28) per nine innings pitched in his career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = No Hitter Records | url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/recbooks/rb_noh1.shtml | accessdate=February 17, 2007}} {{cite web | title = Progressive Leaders for Hits Allowed/9IP | url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/leaders/Hp9_progress.shtml | accessdate=February 17, 2007}} {{cite web | title = Progressive Leaders for Strikeouts/9IP | url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/leaders/SOp9_progress.shtml | accessdate=February 17, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also became the 2nd pitcher in baseball history to have two games with 18 or more strikeouts, and the first to have eight games with 15 or more strikeouts.  In his last ten seasons, from 1957 to 1966, batters hit .203 against Koufax, with a .271 [[on base percentage]] and a .315 [[slugging percentage|slugging average]].&lt;ref&gt;The play-by-play data from which these averages were calculated are available starting in 1957. See {{cite web|title= .|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/leaders/earned_run_avg_career.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Koufax's postseason record is impressive: a 4–3 won-lost record with a 0.95 earned run average, in four World Series. He is on the very short list of pitchers who retired with more career strikeouts than innings pitched. Koufax was selected for seven consecutive [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]] games (twice in 1961 -- the last season with two All-Star Games -- then 1962 to 1966).

Koufax was the first pitcher to win multiple Cy Young Awards, as well as the first pitcher to win a Cy Young Award by a unanimous vote. He is also the only pitcher to win three Cy Young Awards in the era in which the award was presented to one pitcher across the board, rather than one in each major league, and one of three Dodgers pitchers to win the one-across-the-board Cy Young Award. (The others were [[Don Newcombe]], the first Cy Young winner in 1956, and [[Don Drysdale]] in 1962.) Each of Koufax's three Cy Young Awards were by unanimous vote.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbref-skoufax&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = MVP and Cy Young Awards | work = www.baseball-reference.com | url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/awards/mvp_cya.shtml | accessdate = February 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Koufax and Juan Marichal are the only two pitchers in the post-war era (1946-date) to have more than one 25-win season, with each pitcher recording three.

Among NL pitchers with at least 2,000 innings pitched who have debuted since {{By|1913}}, he has the highest career winning percentage (.655) and had the lowest career ERA (2.76) until surpassed by [[Tom Seaver]], whose NL career mark is 2.73. While Seaver ended his career with an overall career ERA of 2.86, this included three seasons in the American League. Seaver passed Koufax's record in 1974 when he ended the season with more than 2,000 NL innings and an ERA of 2.47. Koufax is currently second on the list of overall career ERA in the live-ball era, surpassed only by Whitey Ford (2.75). Through 2010, he was first all-time in career strikeouts (ahead of [[Ken Holtzman]]), second in wins (behind Holtzman) and ERA (behind [[Barney Pelty]]), and seventh in games pitched (behind [[Alan Levine]]) among Jewish major league baseball players.&lt;ref name=JML&gt;{{cite web|title=Career Pitching Leaders |url=http://www.jewishmajorleaguers.org/|work=Career Leaders|publisher=Jewish Major Leaguers|accessdate=February 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pitching style==
Whereas many pitchers throw with a three-quarter or sidearm motion, Koufax threw with a pronounced over-the-top arm action. This may have increased his [[velocity]], but reduced the lateral movement on his pitches, especially movement away from left-handed hitters. Most of his velocity came from his strong legs and back, combined with a high kicking wind-up and long forward stretch toward the plate. Throughout his career, Koufax relied mostly on two pitches: his [[four-seam fastball]] had a &quot;rising&quot; motion due to underspin{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}, and not only appeared to move very late but also might move two or three distinct times; his overhand [[curveball]], spun with the middle finger, dropped vertically 12 to 24&amp;nbsp;inches due to his arm action. He also occasionally threw a [[changeup]] and a [[forkball]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Neyer and James|Neyer and James]], pp. 270–271; [[#Leavy|Leavy]], pp. 6–15.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote box |width=20em |bgcolor= |align=right  |quote=&quot;I knew every pitch he was going to throw and still I couldn't hit him.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Koufax and Linn|Koufax and Linn]], p. 153; [[#Leavy|Leavy]], p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;
 | source= —[[Willie Mays]]}}
At the beginning of his career, Koufax worked with coaches to eliminate his tendency to &quot;tip&quot; pitches (i.e. reveal which pitch was coming due to variations in his wind-up). Late in his career, and especially as his arm problems continued, this variation—usually in the position he held his hands at the top of the wind-up—became even more pronounced. Good hitters could often predict what pitch was coming, but were still unable to hit it.

In 1967, he signed a ten-year contract with [[Major League Baseball on NBC|NBC]] for [[United States dollar|$]]1 million (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1000000|1967|r=-3}}}} today) to be a broadcaster on the ''[[Major League Baseball Game of the Week|Saturday Game of the Week]]''. He quit after six years, just prior to the start of the {{By|1973}} season.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Leavy|Leavy]], p. 251.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;espn65series&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last = Schwartz | first = Larry | title = ESPN Classic – Koufax dominating in '65 Series | url=http://espn.go.com/classic/biography/s/koufaxsandyadd.html | publisher = espn.com | accessdate = February 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Koufax married Anne Widmark, daughter of movie star [[Richard Widmark]], in 1969; the couple was divorced in the 1980s. He then remarried and divorced again in the 1990s.&lt;ref name=&quot;espn65series&quot;/&gt;

In his first year of eligibility in {{By|1972}}, Koufax was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame, just weeks after his 36th birthday. His election made him the Hall's youngest member ever, five months younger than [[Lou Gehrig]] upon his induction in 1939.&lt;ref name=&quot;kirbypuckett&quot;/&gt; On June 4 of that same year, Koufax's uniform number 32 was [[Los Angeles Dodgers#Retired numbers|retired]] alongside those of Dodger greats [[Roy Campanella]] (39) and Jackie Robinson (42).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Dodgers Retired Numbers | work = mlb.mlb.com | url=http://mlb.mlb.com/la/history/retired_numbers.jsp | accessdate = February 15, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dodgers hired Koufax to be a minor league pitching coach in {{By|1979}}. He resigned in {{By|1990}}, saying he wasn't earning his keep, but most observers blamed it on his uneasy relationship with manager Tommy Lasorda.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Leavy|Leavy]], pp. 255–258.&lt;/ref&gt; In {{By|2003}}, Koufax discontinued his relationship with the Dodgers when the ''[[New York Post]]'' (which, like the Dodgers, had become part of [[Rupert Murdoch]]'s business empire) published a story reporting rumors about his [[sexual orientation]], and implying that Koufax was gay. Koufax returned to the Dodger organization in {{By|2004}} when the Dodgers were sold to [[Frank McCourt (executive)|Frank McCourt]].&lt;ref name=&quot;baseballlibrary&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Koufax returns to Dodgertown | work = Addict Baseball and Football Forum | url=http://www.addictsports.com/baseball/archive/index.php/t-33921.html | accessdate = February 15, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In {{By|1999}}, ''[[The Sporting News]]'' placed Koufax at number 26 on its list of &quot;The 100 Greatest Baseball Players.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = TSN Presents – Baseball's 100 Greatest Players | work = sportingnews.com | url=http://archive.sportingnews.com/baseball/100/ | accessdate = February 15, 2007}}{{dead link|date=September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, he was named as one of the 30 players on the [[Major League Baseball All-Century Team]]. Although he rarely makes public appearances, he went to [[Turner Field]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]] for the introduction ceremony before Game 2 of the [[1999 World Series]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The All-Century Team | work = mlb.mlb.com | url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/history/mlb_history_moreinfo.jsp | accessdate = February 15, 2007}} {{cite news | title = Koufax makes appearance at World Series | work = CNN/SI | url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/baseball/mlb/1999/postseason/world_series/news/1999/10/24/koufax_appearance_ap/ | accessdate = February 15, 2007 | date=October 24, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Koufax threw out a ceremonial first pitch at opening day 2008 at Dodger Stadium, to help commemorate the Dodgers' 50th Anniversary in Los Angeles.

Koufax was the final player chosen in the inaugural [[Israel Baseball League]] draft in April 2007. Koufax, 71, was picked by the [[Modi'in Miracle]]. &quot;His selection is a tribute to the esteem with which he is held by everyone associated with this league,&quot; said [[Art Shamsky]], who managed the Miracle. &quot;It's been 41 years between starts for him. If he's rested and ready to take the mound again, we want him on our team.&quot; Koufax declined to join the Miracle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://humbug.baseballtoaster.com/archives/642563.html |title=Baseball Toaster: Humbug Journal : He'll be working on 14,875 days rest |publisher=Humbug.baseballtoaster.com |date= |accessdate=August 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Font size Print E-mail Share 7 Comments By Lloyd de Vries |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/04/27/sportsline/main2735685.shtml |title=Koufax Drafted By Israeli Baseball Team |publisher=CBS News |date=April 27, 2007 |accessdate=August 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, Koufax serves as a member of the advisory board of the [[Baseball Assistance Team]], a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization dedicated to helping former Major League, Minor League, and Negro League players through financial and medical difficulties.

===White House recognition===

On May 27, 2010, Koufax was included among a group of prominent Jewish Americans at the first White House reception in honor of [[Jewish American Heritage Month]].  President [[Barack Obama]] recognized how well known Koufax's decision not to play on the Jewish holy day of Yom Kippur was in a humorous mention in his welcome remarks. Saying that he had &quot;something in common&quot; with Koufax, President Obama continued:  &quot;He can't pitch on [[Yom Kippur]]. I can't pitch.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;JAHM&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Knoller |first=Mark |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20006236-503544.html |title=&quot;Obama Honors Jewish Americans at White House Reception,&quot; May 27, 2010 |publisher=Cbsnews.com |date=May 27, 2010 |accessdate=January 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The President also directly acknowledged the high esteem in which Koufax is held:

:&quot;This is a pretty fancy ... pretty distinguished group,&quot; he said of the invited guests, which included members of the House and Senate, two justices of the Supreme Court, Olympic athletes, entrepreneurs, Rabbinical scholars, &quot;and Sandy Koufax.&quot; The mention of his name brought the biggest cheer at the event.&lt;ref name=&quot;JAHM&quot;/&gt;
