Gilchrist put the disappointment of India behind him in the First Test at [[Edgbaston Cricket Ground|Edgbaston]], scoring 152 from only 143 balls.

--&gt;[[Netherlands national cricket team|the Netherlands]] and [[South Africa national cricket team|South Africa]].&lt;ref name=o/&gt; Australia won all six of their matches in the Super8 stage with little difficulty&amp;mdash;the margins of victory were exceeded 80 runs or six wickets in every instance.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; They topped the table and thus qualifying for a semi-final rematch against fourth-placed South Africa. Gilchrist opened the Australian batting in each match, taking a [[Pinch hitter (cricket)|pinch-hitting]] role in the opening [[Power play (sporting term)|powerplay]]s. Initially successful in the group matches, scoring 46, 57 and 42, he failed in the first Super8 match against [[West Indian cricket team|West Indies]] (7), but bounced back to scored a second half-century (59 not out) in a ten-wicket victory against [[Bangladeshi cricket team|Bangladesh]] in a match drastically shortened due to rain. After a run of middling scores, he failed again in the final Super8 match against [[New Zealand cricket team|New Zealand]].&lt;ref name=o/&gt;

As a batsman, Gilchrist was dismissed for a single run in the semi-final against South Africa, despite which Australia won by seven wickets.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; As wicket-keeper, however, he took four catches, equalling the most dismissals in one match in the tournament and bringing his total for the tournament to 14, second behind Sri Lanka's [[Kumar Sangakkara]].

Gilchrist opened the batting against [[Sri Lankan cricket team|Sri Lanka]] in the final. This was Gilchrist's third successive World Cup final, and the third time he scored at least a 50 runs in World Cup finals and the only century he'd ever scored in a world cup match.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; Gilchrist went on to score 149 runs off 104 balls with thirteen fours and eight sixes, the highest individual score in a World Cup final, eclipsing his captain Ricky Ponting's score of 140 in the 2003 final. Australia won and he was named the [[man of the match]]. Subsequently there has been some controversy over Gilchrist's use of a squash ball inside his glove during this innings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

===Indian Premier League===
Gilchrist was contracted by the Hyderabad-based [[Deccan Chargers]] in the inaugural season's player auction for US$700,000. In Deccan's fourth match of the inaugural 2008 season, Gilchrist hammered the second fastest hundred in the IPL, off just 42 balls, as Deccan recorded their first win, against Mumbai. Gilchrist led the [[Deccan Chargers]] in the second half of the IPL in the absence of regular captain [[VVS Laxman]], who was ruled out for the rest of the tournament due to injury. Deccan came last, winning only two of 14 matches.

In the second season, Gilchrist was installed as captain in place of Laxman by new coach and former Australian teammate [[Darren Lehmann]]. The team started well and won their first four matches but stumbled and won only three of their remaining ten qualifying matches. They qualified fourth into the semifinals and Gilchrist led the team to the final by striking 85 off just 35 balls against the [[Delhi Daredevils]]. Although made a duck in the final against the [[Bangalore Royal Challengers]], Deccan won by six runs to take the title. Gilchrist was named the Player of The Tournament.

In the fourth season, Gilchrist was contracted by [[Kings XI Punjab]] for US$900,000. He was chosen the captain for the team as [[Kumar Sangakkara]] (former captain of Punjab) had moved to Deccan Chargers. In March 2012 he was named &quot;player-coach&quot;, replacing his friend and former Australia teammate [[Michael Bevan]], whose contract as head coach was not renewed.&lt;ref&gt;{{citenews|title=Adam Gilchrist to coach and lead Kings XI Punjab|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/indian-premier-league-2012/content/current/story/558442.html|publisher=[[Cricinfo]]|date=23 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middlesex===
He signed a short-term contract in November 2009 to play English Twenty20 cricket for [[Middlesex County Cricket Club|Middlesex]] between 3 and 24 June 2010. He was appointed interim captain on 11 June upon the sudden resignation of [[Shaun Udal]]. In addition to the seven Twenty20 fixtures, he is also captaining the county versus the touring Australians in a fifty-over friendly.

In addition to this he will be taking part in the major sporting events Titans of Cricket in October 2011 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.titansofcricket.com|title=2011 Titans of Cricket events|work=Cricket Event|accessdate=21 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; - an evening of exciting challenges for famous sportsmen, touring across the UK in Manchester and Birmingham, with the grand finale in London's O2

In this role, Gilchrist is perhaps disadvantaged by his relatively tall stature for a pure wicket-keeper. However, while perhaps not as elegant as some, he has successfully kept wicket for [[spin bowling|spin bowler]] [[Shane Warne]] and [[fast bowling|fast bowler]]s [[Glenn McGrath]] and [[Brett Lee]] for most of his international career.

== Walking and discipline ==
Cricket has for many years debated whether batsmen should &quot;[[List of cricket terms#W|walk]]&quot;, that is to agree that they have been dismissed and leave the field of play without waiting for (or contrary to) an umpire's decision. Gilchrist reignited this debate by walking during a high-profile match, the [[2003 cricket World Cup|2003 World Cup]] semi-final against Sri Lanka, after the umpire ruled him to be not out.&lt;ref name=&quot;WCWalk&quot;&gt;{{cite news

--&gt;On one occasion against [[Bangladesh cricket team|Bangladesh]], Gilchrist walked but TV replays failed to suggest any contact between his bat and the ball. Without such contact, he could not have been caught out.&lt;ref name=&quot;BangWalk&quot;/&gt;

Gilchrist's actions have sparked debate amongst current and former players and umpires.&lt;!--when? this has been mentioned at the beginning if it is in general--&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Walking&quot;&gt;{{cite web

--&gt;While no other Australian top order batsmen have expressly declared themselves to be walkers, lower-order batsmen [[Jason Gillespie]] and [[Michael Kasprowicz]] both walked during Test matches in [[Australian cricket team in India in 2004-05|India in 2004]].&lt;ref name=&quot;walking&quot;&gt;{{cite web

Opinion among commentators and the general public has also been divided: many have lauded Gilchrist's honesty, while some commentators are of the opinion that walking is disrespectful to the umpire.&lt;ref name=&quot;walking&quot;/&gt;
--&gt;In 2004, New Zealand captain [[Stephen Fleming]] accused Gilchrist of conducting a &quot;walking crusade&quot; when [[Craig McMillan]] refused to walk after Gilchrist had caught him off an edge from the bowling of [[Jason Gillespie]] in the First Test in Brisbane.&lt;ref name=&quot;NZwalk&quot;&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--

--&gt;After the appeal was turned down by the umpire, who did not hear the edge, Gilchrist goaded McMillan about the edge, and McMillan's angry response was picked up by the stump microphone: &quot;...not everyone is walking, Gilly ... not everyone has to walk, mate...&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;NZwalk&quot;/&gt; The [[Sledging (cricket)|taunt]] was effective, however, as McMillan, perhaps distracted, missed the next ball and was given out [[leg before wicket]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NZwalk&quot;/&gt; Gilchrist said in his autobiography that he had &quot;zero support in the team&quot; for his stance and that he felt that the topic made the dressing room uncomfortable.&lt;ref name=walkauto&gt;Gilchrist, pp. 578&amp;ndash;579.&lt;/ref&gt; He added that he &quot;felt isolated&quot; and &quot;silently accused of betraying the team. Implictly I was made to feel selfish, as if I was walking for the sake of my own clean image, thereby making everyone else look dishonest.&quot;&lt;ref name=walkauto/&gt;

During the 2003 World Cup, Gilchrist accused Pakistani wicketkeeper [[Rashid Latif]] of making a racist remark towards him while the latter was batting in their group match. Latif who was cleared by match referee [[Clive Lloyd]], threatened to sue Gilchrist for this claim.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.buzzle.com/editorials/2-13-2003-35453.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

== Charity, media and political work ==

Outside cricket, Gilchrist is an ambassador for the charity [[World Vision]] in [[India]], a country in which he is popular due to his cricketing achievements,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

He made his debut on the program in March 2008,&lt;ref name=&quot;nine network&quot;/&gt; and commentates on Nine's cricket coverage during the Australian summer.&lt;ref name=&quot;nine network&quot;/&gt;

Gilchrist has been approached by the ruling [[Australian Labor Party]] to contest the [[Division of Stirling]] (in Perth's northern suburbs) at the upcoming federal election.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Inside Cover&quot;, ''The West Australian'', 14 Feb 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Stirling is a marginal seat, currently held by the opposition [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]].

As [[Amway Australia]] Ambassador, Gilchrist has played a role in many of their charity events. In August 2010, he presented the Freedom Wheels program, an intiative to provide modified bikes to kids with disabilities, a cheque for $20,000. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Adam Gilchrist scores hearts at Castle Hill|url=http://hills-shire-times.whereilive.com.au/news/story/adam-gilchrist-scores-hearts-at-castle-hill/ |publisher=Hills Shire Times |date=6 August 2010 |accessdate=4 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Gilchrist supported debate on whether [[Australia Day]] should be moved to a new date because the current date marks European settlement and is offensive to many Aboriginal Australians.&lt;ref name=&quot;ausday&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Andrew [sic] Gilchrist backs debate to move Australia Day|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/gilly-backs-australia-day-debate/story-fna7dq6e-1111118672763|publisher=news.com.au|date=27 January 2009|accessdate=2009-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gilchrist is considered to have left-wing views; Australian captain [[Ricky Ponting]] commented in his annual Captain's Diary that his deputy had a penchant for reading [[Karl Marx]] while on tour.&lt;ref&gt;Ponting, R: ''Captain's Diary 2006'', p75, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Gilchrist was made a [[Order of Australia|Member of the Order of Australia]] for his services to cricket and the community.&lt;ref name=&quot;AM&quot; /&gt;

== Autobiography ==

Gilchrist's autobiography ''True Colours'', published in 2008, was the subject of much controversy. Gilchrist questioned the integrity of leading Indian batsman [[Sachin Tendulkar]] in relation to the evidence he presented in the [[Monkeygate]] dispute, which was about allegations of racism against [[Harbhajan Singh]].&lt;ref name=autobio/&gt;&lt;ref name=g588&gt;Gilchrist, p. 588.&lt;/ref&gt; The autobiography said that Tendulkar told the first hearing that he could not hear what Harbhajan said to [[Andrew Symonds]]; Gilchrist said he was &quot;certain he [Tendulkar] was telling the truth&quot; because he was &quot;a fair way away&quot;.&lt;ref name=autobio/&gt;&lt;ref name=g588/&gt; Gilchrist then questioned why Tendulkar then agreed with Harbhajan's claim at the second hearing that the exchange was an obscenity, and concluded that the process was &quot;a joke&quot;.&lt;ref name=g588/&gt; He also raised questions over Tendulkar's sportsmanship and said he was &quot;hard to find for a changing-room handshake after we have beaten India&quot;.&lt;ref name=autobio&gt;{{cite web

There was a backlash in India, which forced Gilchrist to clarify his position. Gilchrist later insisted that he did not accuse Tendulkar of lying in his testimony. He also denied calling the Indian a &quot;bad sport&quot; in regards to the handshake issue.&lt;ref name=autobio/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'[Nowhere did I accuse Sachin of lying']http://content-www.cricinfo.com/australia/content/story/375276.html&lt;/ref&gt; Tendulkar responded by saying that &quot;those remarks came from someone who doesn't know me enough. I think he made loose statements...I reminded him that I was the first person to shake hands after the Sydney defeat.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
