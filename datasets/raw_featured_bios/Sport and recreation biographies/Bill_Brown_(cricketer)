'''William Alfred''' &quot;'''Bill'''&quot; '''Brown''', [[Order of Australia|OAM]] (31 July 1912 &amp;ndash; 16 March 2008) was an Australian [[cricket]]er who played 22 [[Test cricket|Tests]] between 1934 and 1948, [[captain (cricket)|captaining]] [[Australia national cricket team|his country]] in one Test. A right-handed [[opening batsman]], his partnership with [[Jack Fingleton]] in the 1930s is regarded as one of the finest in Australian Test history. After the interruption of [[World War II]], Brown was a member of [[Don Bradman]]'s [[Australian cricket team in England in 1948|''Invincibles'']], who toured England in 1948 without defeat. In a match in November 1947, Brown was the unwitting victim of the first instance of &quot;[[Run out#Mankaded|Mankading]]&quot;.

Raised in [[New South Wales]], Brown initially struggled in both work and cricket, before gradually rising through the cricket ranks. He made his [[first-class cricket|first-class]] debut for [[New South Wales Blues|New South Wales]] in the 1932&amp;ndash;33 season and forced his way into the national side during the [[Australian cricket team in England in 1934|1934 tour of England]]. When long-term openers [[Bill Ponsford]] and [[Bill Woodfull]] retired at the end of the tour, Brown and his state opening partner Fingleton took over. After poor form made his selection for the [[Australian cricket team in England in 1938|1938 tour of England]] controversial, Brown responded with a total of 1,854 runs, including an [[Not out|unbeaten]] 206 that saved Australia from defeat in the second Test, and was honoured as one of the five [[Wisden Cricketers of the Year]].

The outbreak of the Second World War cost Brown his peak years, which he spent in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]]. Cricket resumed in 1945&amp;ndash;46 and Brown, in Bradman's absence, captained an Australian eleven in a match that was retrospectively awarded Test status. Brown missed the entirety of the following season because of injury. Upon his return, he was unable to repeat his previous success and was ousted from the opening positions by [[Arthur Morris]] and [[Sid Barnes]]. Selected for the ''Invincibles'' tour, he performed reasonably well in the tour matches but, with Morris and Barnes entrenched as openers, he batted out of position in the [[Batting order (cricket)#Middle order|middle order]] during the first two Tests. He struggled and was dropped from the Test team, never to return. Upon returning to Australia, Brown continued playing for Queensland until the end of the 1949&amp;ndash;50 season. 

In retirement, Brown briefly served as a Test [[selector (sport)|selector]] and sold cars and, later, sports goods. In 2000, he was awarded the Medal of the [[Order of Australia]] for his services to cricket and, at the time of his death, was Australia's oldest Test cricketer.

==Early years==
The son of a dairy farmer and hotel owner, Brown was born in [[Toowoomba]], [[Queensland]]. Aged three, business failure hit the family, and they moved to [[Marrickville, New South Wales|Marrickville]] in inner [[Sydney]].&lt;ref name=&quot;az&quot;&gt;Cashman, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=r197&gt;Robinson, p. 197.&lt;/ref&gt; The family's poor financial position meant that they lived in a one-bedroom home, with Brown and his brother sharing a bed.&lt;ref name=&quot;funeral&quot;&gt;{{Cite news

He was on the verge of leaving Sydney when an innings of 172 for his [[Sutherland Shire|Shire]] team reinvigorated his career. He progressed through the grades and reached the club's [[First XI]], where he performed steadily to earn selection for [[New South Wales Blues|New South Wales]] in 1932&amp;ndash;33.&lt;ref name=&quot;wisden&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title= Wisden 1939 - Bill Brown |url=http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/154647.html| publisher=[[Wisden]] |year=1939|accessdate=2007-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pre-war career==
[[Image:BillBrownNSW.jpg|right|thumb|Brown during his days with New South Wales.]]
Making his first-class debut for New South Wales in a [[Sheffield Shield]] match against [[Queensland Bulls|Queensland]] on 11 November 1932, Brown was [[run out]] for a [[Duck (cricket)|duck]] without facing a ball, while opening with [[Jack Fingleton]].&lt;ref name=&quot;az&quot;/&gt; however, the match ended happily with Brown's team winning decisively by an innings and 274 runs.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; The highlights of Brown's first season were his 79 against [[Southern Redbacks|South Australia]], and 69 against [[Douglas Jardine]]'s [[England cricket team|England]].&lt;ref name=&quot;wisden&quot;/&gt; However, neither [[Harold Larwood]] nor [[Bill Voce]], the ''[[Bodyline]]'' spearheads,  played in the match. During his first season, Brown earned the ire of [[Don Bradman]], who was displeased with Brown's poor communication with batting partners when running between the wickets, with the ensuing risk of falling foul of run outs.&lt;ref name=&quot;tel&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;im&quot;/&gt; Brown ended his debut season with 269 runs at 29.88.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Australian First-Class Season 1932/33: Batting - Most Runs |url=http://aus.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1930S/1932-33/AUS_LOCAL/STATS/FC_1932-33_BAT_MOST_RUNS.html |accessdate=2007-12-05|publisher=[[Cricinfo]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following season, in the opening match of the season against Queensland at [[Brisbane]] in November 1933,&lt;ref name=o/&gt; Brown made 154, partnering Bradman in a stand of 294 in just three hours.&lt;ref name=&quot;wisden&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;times&quot;/&gt; This set up at total of 4/494 declared and an innings victory.

It was the start of a barren month for Brown, who passed 30 only once in 11 first-class innings, totalling 171 runs at 15.55. He ended the unproductive sequence with an unbeaten 100 against [[Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club|Nottinghamshire]].&lt;ref name=o/&gt; This came after [[Bill Voce]] had bowled Bodyline at the start of the Australian innings, in contravention of a prior agreement. After an Australian protest, Voce missed the remainder of the match and Brown's innings was punctuated by angry heckling by the local supporters.&lt;ref name=h85&gt;Haigh and Frith, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harte, p. 356.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=r164&gt;Robinson, p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt; 

He was unable to pass 20 in the final two Tests and ended the series with 300 runs at 33.33.

== Opening in Tests with Fingleton ==

[[Image:Fingleton brown.jpg|Jack Fingleton ''(left)'' and Brown walk to the crease to open for Australia during a Test against England in 1936&amp;ndash;37.|thumb]]
With the retirement of Woodfull and Ponsford after the tour of England, Brown and his state partner Fingleton became Australia's opening pair for the 1935&amp;ndash;36 tour of South Africa.&lt;ref name=az/&gt; It was one the most productive phases of both men's career. In Australia's warm-up match against Western Australia before sailing across the [[Indian Ocean]], Brown struck 55 in an innings win.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;

Brown started the tour consistently, scoring 148, 58, 31 and 28 not on out in the three warm-up matches.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; In the first match of the tour against [[Natal cricket team|Natal]], both Brown and Fingleton made centuries; the first two matches were won by an innings and the third by ten wickets.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;

Brown scored three consecutive half-centuries in the first two Tests in [[Durban]] and [[Johannesburg]].&lt;ref name=&quot;testlist&quot;/&gt; Australia won the first by nine wickets and were 124 runs from victory with eight wickets in hand in the second when bad light stopped play.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; In the Third Test at [[Cape Town]], the pair set a new Australian opening record of 233, which laid the foundation for a large Australian total and an innings victory.&lt;ref name=&quot;az&quot;/&gt; It was Australia's first double-century opening stand in Test cricket,&lt;ref name=&quot;g&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=r199&gt;Robinson, p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt; and remains an Australian Test record for the first wicket against South Africa.&lt;ref name=&quot;times&quot;/&gt; Brown posted 121, his highest Test score at the time. He scored 34 and 84 in Australia's only innings of the Fourth and Fifth Tests in Johannesburg and Durban, making solid opening stands with Fingleton, who scored three consecutive centuries. The pair laid the platform for two further innings victories, as Australia took the five-Test series 4&amp;ndash;0.&lt;ref name=&quot;auslist&quot;/&gt; His compiled 417 runs at 59.57 for the series.&lt;ref name=&quot;testlist&quot;/&gt; Brown scored a further four fifties in the remaining tour matches to end with 1065 runs at 62.65.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; 

In 1936, Brown accepted a coaching position and employment as a car salesman to move back to Queensland, representing his state of birth from 1936&amp;ndash;37 onwards.&lt;ref name=&quot;times&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=r199/&gt; He was appointed captain the following season.&lt;ref name=az/&gt; Brown started the new season strongly, scoring 111 for [[Victor Richardson]]'s XI in a testimonial match against Bradman's XI, in the opening match of summer.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; In November, Brown played for an Australian XI and Queensland in two matches against the touring England team, scoring 71 and 74 the two drawn matches.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;

His 1936&amp;ndash;37 season was interrupted by injury and he appeared in only the Third and Fourth Tests against England.&lt;ref name=&quot;az&quot;/&gt; They were relatively unsuccessful, yielding only 95 runs at 23.75 in four innings without passing fifty.&lt;ref name=&quot;testlist&quot;/&gt; Nevertheless, Australia won the two matches.&lt;ref name=auslist/&gt; His debut season for Queensland was moderately successful, with 557 runs at an average of 37.13, including one century and four fifties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Australian First-Class Season 1936/37: Batting - Most Runs |url=http://aus.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1930S/1936-37/AUS_LOCAL/STATS/FC_1936-37_BAT_MOST_RUNS.html |accessdate=2007-12-05|publisher=[[Cricinfo]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brown did not taste victory with his home state during the season; the closest Queensland came was a one-wicket loss to New South Wales.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;

== Wisden Cricketer of the Year ==
Brown's form started to deteriorate in 1937&amp;ndash;38; scoring only 400 runs at 36.36 for the season.&lt;ref name=f3738/&gt; Queensland played five matches under his watch, losing three, and went without victory.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; Of the two draws, one was washed out and in the other, Queensland hung on with two wickets in hand when time ran out.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;

Although Brown compiled two centuries, he was only twelfth in the aggregates during an Australian season with no international tours. As a result, his selection for the 1938 tour to England was criticised in some quarters.&lt;ref name=&quot;tel&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=f3738&gt;{{cite web|title=Australian First-Class Season 1937/38: Batting - Most Runs |url=http://aus.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1930S/1937-38/AUS_LOCAL/STATS/FC_1937-38_BAT_MOST_RUNS.html |accessdate=2007-12-05|publisher=[[Cricinfo]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brown's most celebrated innings came in the Second Test at Lord's, carrying his bat to score 206 in the first televised Test match.&lt;ref name=&quot;ind&quot;/&gt; England batted first and amassed 494, largely on the back of [[Wally Hammond]]'s 240. Brown featured in an opening stand of 69 before Fingleton was dismissed.&lt;ref name=&quot;p173&quot;&gt;Perry (2002), p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hedley Verity]] then bowled Bradman for 18, leaving the score at 101, before [[Stan McCabe]] fell after a quickfire 38 with the score at 3/152. Brown registered his century in 193 minutes, during an innings highlighted by his [[Batting (cricket)#Drive|driving]] on both sides of the wicket. After [[Lindsay Hassett]] was dismissed for 56 following a 134-run partnership, Australia reached stumps at 5/299, with Brown on 140.&lt;ref name=&quot;p174&quot;/&gt; The following day, Brown set about ensuring that Australia would avoid the [[follow on]], featuring in an aggressive eighth-wicket stand with tailender [[Bill O'Reilly (cricketer)|Bill O'Reilly]]. The pair added 85 runs in just 46 minutes, with Brown recalling &quot;It was a nice day, and a nice wicket. O'Reilly came in, and I told him I'd take the quicks&amp;mdash;[[Arthur Wellard|Wellard]] and [[Ken Farnes|Farnes]]&amp;mdash;and Tiger [O'Reilly] took Verity.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;old&quot;/&gt; Brown continued past his double century and remained unbeaten on 206 from just 375 minutes when his last partner fell, leaving Australia all out for 422.&lt;ref name=&quot;old&quot;/&gt; Brown's innings was the 100th century by an Australian against England,&lt;ref name=&quot;old&quot;/&gt; and the highest Test score for batsman carrying his bat; it stood until [[Glenn Turner]] made an unbeaten 223 in 1972.&lt;ref name=r199/&gt; [[Ray Robinson (cricket writer)|Ray Robinson]] quipped that Brown's performance &quot;did not cause smoke to rise from the back of those [television] sets but the charm of his style gave viewers a favourable impression of Australian batsmanship&quot;.&lt;ref name=r199/&gt; They went on to draw the match,&lt;ref name=&quot;p174&quot;&gt;Perry (2002), p. 174.&lt;/ref&gt; which was crucial in Australia's eventual retention of the Ashes.&lt;ref name=&quot;g&quot;/&gt; Brown's uninterrupted batting meant that he was on the field from the first morning until late on the fourth day.&lt;ref name=&quot;tel&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;g&quot;/&gt;

Immediately after the making his highest Test score at Lord's, Brown recorded his highest first-class score of 265 not out against [[Derbyshire County Cricket Club|Derbyshire]],&lt;ref name=az/&gt;&lt;ref name=o/&gt; in six hours of batting.&lt;ref name=r199/&gt; Australia amassed 4/441 declared and won by an innings and 234 runs.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; He then made it three centuries in a row, scoring 101 against [[Warwickshire County Cricket Club|Warwickshire]], setting up another innings win.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; 

The Third Test was washed out without a ball being bowled, and Australia won the Fourth Test by five wickets in a low-scoring match to retain The Ashes.&lt;ref name=&quot;testlist&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;auslist&quot;/&gt; Brown made 22 and nine as Australia scored 242 and 5/107.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; It was the start of a quiet month for the opener, who scored only 194 runs in eight completed innings.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; He was the top Australian scorer in both innings of the Fifth Test at [[The Oval]], scoring 69 and 15. This was the match in which [[Len Hutton]] scored a world Test record 364 and England compiled 7/903, before winning by an innings and 579 runs, which remains a world record winning margin in a Test match.&lt;ref name=&quot;tel&quot;/&gt; Throughout the Tests, Brown aggregated 512 runs at 73.14,&lt;ref name=&quot;testlist&quot;/&gt; totaling 1854 runs at 59.57 in all first-class matches for the tour. This placed Brown second to Bradman in both aggregates and average.&lt;ref name=&quot;az&quot;/&gt; He was named as one of the [[Wisden Cricketers of the Year]] for his performances in 1938. [[Wisden Cricketers Almanack|Wisden]] described him as a &quot;cricketer of remarkable powers&quot; who batted with &quot;a charming skill, coolness, thoughtfulness and certainty&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;wisden&quot;/&gt;

Upon returning to Australia, Brown scored 1,057 runs at 105.70 in the 1938&amp;ndash;39 Australian season, including 990 at 110.00 in six Sheffield Shield matches.&lt;ref name=az/&gt;&lt;ref name=o/&gt;&lt;ref name=p176/&gt; Brown started the season well, scoring 84 as Queensland amassed 501 against New South Wales. His old state were still 27 runs from making Queensland bat again, but time ran out with one wicket intact, with Brown yet to taste victory with his new state.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; Nevertheless, he continued to perform strongly as passed 50 in each of his first four innings.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; In the fourth of these, he was out for 99 and then declared at 5/510 to leave Victoria a victory target of 319. Brown then narrowly missed out on a milestone for the second time in the match when Victoria scraped home by three wickets to deny him a maiden victory with his home state.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; In the next match, he carried his bat to make an unbeaten 174 against [[Southern Redbacks|South Australia]] at the [[Adelaide Oval]],&lt;ref name=&quot;p176&quot;/&gt; as his team fell to an innings defeat.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; 

After twelve matches for his state of origin, Brown was still to end up on the winning side. This changed in the next match against New South Wales. After their opponents had made 214, Brown top-scored with 95 as Queensland replied with 200. New South Wales made 264 to leave Brown's men 279 for victory. The captain led the way, combining with [[Geoff Cook]] in Queensland's then record first-wicket partnership of 265. Brown was out for 168, but his team held on to secure an eight-wicket victory over New South Wales.&lt;ref name=&quot;az&quot;/&gt; It was Brown's first win in Queensland colours.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; He then scored 81 in a ten-wicket defeat to South Australia, before adding a second victory, this time over Victoria. Brown ended the season by amassing 215 as Queensland reached 7/575 declared before completing an innings win.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; Brown topped the aggregates with 1,057 runs and was the only player to pass 1,000 runs for the season.&lt;ref name=f3839&gt;{{cite web|title=Australian First-Class Season 1938/39: Batting - Most Runs |url=http://aus.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1930S/1938-39/AUS_LOCAL/STATS/FC_1938-39_BAT_MOST_RUNS.html |accessdate=2007-12-05|publisher=[[Cricinfo]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Second World War and post-war career ==
[[Image:BillBrownQLD.jpg|left|thumb|Cigarette card of Brown in the Queensland colours]]

Due to [[World War II]], cricket in Australia was scaled down and in a shortened season in 1940&amp;ndash;41, Brown made 307 runs at 30.70 in five matches, with two half-centuries.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; In 1941&amp;ndash;42, he played his one match, his last first-class fixture during the war, scoring 56 and 69 in a narrow 19-run win over New South Wales.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;

Brown was a [[flight lieutenant]] with the [[Royal Australian Air Force]], serving in [[New Guinea campaign|New Guinea]] and the [[Philippines]] during the [[World War II|Second World War]],&lt;ref name=&quot;old&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/70460.html| title='What did you do at Lord's, Grandpa?'| first=David |last=Frith|authorlink=David Frith (author)|accessdate=2007-12-06|work=Wisden Cricket Monthly |year=1987|publisher=[[Cricinfo]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; losing his prime years from the age of 27 to 33.&lt;ref name=&quot;az&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;tel&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;g&quot;/&gt; During the pre-war years, he had averaged 49.02 in Test cricket.&lt;ref name=&quot;testlist&quot;/&gt; 

First-class cricket resumed in 1945&amp;ndash;46 after the Allied victory, and Brown began the post-war phase of his career with a steady season, scoring 604 runs at 46.46 with five half-centuries in seven matches. This placed him second to [[Sid Barnes]] in the run-scoring aggregates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aus.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1940S/1945-46/AUS_LOCAL/STATS/FC_1945-46_BAT_MOST_RUNS.html| title=Australian First-Class Season 1945/46: Batting - Most Runs| accessdate=2007-12-06|publisher=[[Cricinfo]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; His best effort was a 98 against South Australia, denied a century by a run out. Queensland lost more than they won, with two victories and three losses.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;

At the end of the season, Brown captained an Australian side on a tour of New Zealand,&lt;ref name=&quot;g&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=nztour/&gt; and all five matches resulted in convincing victories.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;&lt;ref name=nztour/&gt;

New Zealand managed to reach 4/37 at lunch, before the sun emerged and caused the wicket to turn into a sticky with unpredictable bounce.&lt;ref name=&quot;nztour&quot;/&gt; [[Leg spin]]ner Bill O'Reilly&amp;mdash;in his last Test&amp;mdash;and debutant [[Ernie Toshack]], took 5/14 and 4/12 respectively as New Zealand were bowled out for only 42, losing their last six wickets for five runs.&lt;ref name=&quot;nztour&quot;/&gt; In reply, Australia were 1/9 when [[Ken Meuleman]] was dismissed.

Brown missed the entire 1946&amp;ndash;47 Test series against England due to a thumb injury.&lt;ref name=&quot;az&quot;/&gt; This allowed young New South Wales opener [[Arthur Morris]] to make his Test debut. Morris' performance in the series eventually displaced Brown from his position as a first-choice opening batsman alongside Barnes.&lt;ref name=&quot;tel&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;morris&quot;/&gt; The injury meant that Brown was unable to play a single match for Queensland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aus.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1940S/1946-47/AUS_LOCAL/STATS/FC_1946-47_BAT_MOST_RUNS.html| title=Australian First-Class Season 1946/47: Batting - Most Runs| accessdate=2007-12-06|publisher=[[Cricinfo]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mankad ==
Brown returned to first-class cricket in 1947&amp;ndash;48, scoring 192 runs at 38.40 in the first three matches of the season.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; The season saw an [[Indian cricket team in Australia in 1947-48|Indian tour of Australia]]. The selectors initially dropped Barnes to pair Brown with Morris to open the batting.&lt;ref name=&quot;testlist&quot;/&gt; Apart from two Tests during the 1936&amp;ndash;37 season against England, Brown had not played Test cricket on Australian soil.&lt;ref name=&quot;testlist&quot;/&gt; He had only one opportunity with the bat in the First Test in Brisbane, making 11 as India fell to an innings defeat.&lt;ref name=&quot;testlist&quot;/&gt; It was to be his only innings and Test match on his home ground.&lt;ref name=&quot;funeral&quot;/&gt; Brown's participation in the series was overshadowed by his controversial [[run out]] by Indian [[left arm orthodox spin]]ner [[Vinoo Mankad]] in the Second Test at the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]] in December 1947.&lt;ref name=&quot;im&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;g&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p176&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=d/&gt; Brown was run out for 18,&lt;ref name=o/&gt; when in the act of delivering the ball, Mankad held on to it and whipped the [[Bail (cricket)|bail]]s off at the non-striker's end. Brown was well out of his crease while he was [[List_of_cricket_terms#B|backing-up]] the striker, so that he could get a head start in case he attempted a run. This was the second time during the season that Mankad had dismissed Brown in this fashion&amp;mdash;as he had previously done so a match against an Australian XI in November.

For his part, Brown took full blame and made light of the incident through humorous gestures in later matches, which referred to the event.&lt;ref name=r200/&gt; After this incident, if a batsman is given out this way, he is said to have been &quot;Mankaded&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;im&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;g&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p176&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=d&gt;{{cite web|title=Ten controversial dismissals |url=http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/allrounder/content/story/226675.html |date=2005-12-06 |accessdate=2007-12-06|publisher=[[Cricinfo]] |first=Will |last=Luke}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:WABrown.jpg|right|thumb|Bill Brown flicks a ball to the leg side.]] Brown was regarded as a cautious starter who was reluctant to use his full array of strokes.&lt;ref name=&quot;ind&quot;/&gt; He had an upright stance and was known for his trademark leg glancing and placement of the ball.&lt;ref name=&quot;az&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;wisden&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;times&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=r198&gt;Robinson, p. 198.&lt;/ref&gt; He hooked occasionally and scored the majority of his off-side runs with the cut shot.&lt;ref name=r198/&gt; Johnnie Moyes said that &quot;even when slow, he never wearied, as some do, because his style was cultured and free from jarring faults&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;p177&quot;/&gt; Moyes felt that Brown's superior record on English soil was a result of the crowd attitude, which was more respectful.&lt;ref name=&quot;p175&quot;/&gt; At Australian grounds, impatient spectators who disliked Brown's cautious batting frequently heckled him, blaming Brown for delaying Bradman's arrival to the crease.&lt;ref name=&quot;im&quot;/&gt;  Moyes felt that the more serene English gallery allowed Brown to play to his game plan without hastening to placate impatient spectators. &quot;A placid chap was Brown, and he liked to play in peaceful surroundings. When on the job he was as emotionless as a stoic.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;p175&quot;/&gt; Moyes said that Brown was &quot;always cool and thoughtful, he preferred finesse to force&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ind&quot;/&gt; The English journalist [[Neville Cardus]] commented &quot;His cricket is perpetually keeping an appointment leisurely with moments to spare. Does the bat have an engagement this over with a half-volley? Very well, then, put it down in the book. We'll be there for it. Plenty of time.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;g&quot;/&gt; Bradman also noted Brown's ability to quickly get into position to play the ball, writing &quot;One hallmark of good batting is that the player appears to have plenty of time in which to play his strokes. Bill Brown was an outstanding case of one who never seemed to be in a hurry for any stroke.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;times&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title=Bill Brown: Accomplished batsman who scored handsomely for Australia before and after the war |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article3570490.ece | first=Derek |last=Hodgson |date=2008-03-18 |accessdate=2008-06-24 |work = [[The Times]] | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ray Robinson (cricket writer)|Ray Robinson]] said that Brown was &quot;the most serene batsman I ever saw play for Australia&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;tel&quot;/&gt; Robinson said that &quot;for artistry, Brown's leg-glancing could be mentioned in the same breath as [[Archie Jackson]]'s&quot;.&lt;ref name=r198/&gt; Brown's placid nature extended to his observations of modern cricket&amp;mdash;he disliked the emotional displays made by contemporary players.&lt;ref name=&quot;tel&quot;/&gt;

Brown's partnership with Fingleton was regarded as one of the great opening pairings in Australian Test cricket history.&lt;ref name=&quot;old&quot;/&gt; In ten Tests as an opening combination, the pair averaged 63.75 for the first wicket, higher than any other Australian duo with more than 1000 runs.&lt;ref name=&quot;im&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title=Invincible memories | first=Peter |last=English |url=http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/magazine/content/current/story/338064.html | date=2008-02-23 |accessdate=2008-06-24 |publisher=[[Cricinfo]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brown was known for his self-effacing nature and was well liked among teammates and opponents alike.&lt;ref name=&quot;tel&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;g&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ind&quot;/&gt; Of his batting, Brown joked that &quot;My wife said you could always tell when I was batting by the number of people leaving the ground&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;im&quot;/&gt; During a domestic match at the [[Adelaide Oval]] in December 1938, he deflected a ball onto his stumps without dislodging a bail. He added a further 147 runs to end unbeaten on 174, eternally apologising for his luck.&lt;ref name=&quot;g&quot;/&gt;

In addition to his batting, Brown was a highly regarded fieldsman known for his fitness.&lt;ref name=&quot;tel&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ind&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title=Bill Brown: One of Bradman's 'Invincibles' |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/bill-brown-one-of-bradmans-invincibles-797159.html | first=Derek |last=Hodgson |date=2008-03-18 |accessdate=2008-06-24 |work = [[The Independent]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He developed his skills through persistent training with professional sprinters in order to improve his anticipation and speed off the mark.&lt;ref name=&quot;ind&quot;/&gt; Brown often fielded at slip or in the covers. With Australia boasting the [[leg spin]] pairing of O'Reilly and Grimmett in the 1930s, close-catchers were frequently used. Along with Fingleton, Brown often fielded in the leg trap position.&lt;ref name=&quot;times&quot;/&gt;

== Off the field ==
In 1940, Brown married Barbara Hart, a [[receptionist]].&lt;ref name=&quot;times&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p176&quot;/&gt; The couple had three sons, whom Brown self-deprecatingly noted were &quot;well spaced&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;like my centuries&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;g&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=r200/&gt; Outside cricket, Brown worked in a variety of jobs. When Bradman relocated from New South Wales to South Australia in 1935, Brown took his job at the men's clothing store FJ Palmer. Following his relocation to Queensland, Brown was a Brisbane car salesman, selling [[Chevrolet]]s for Egars, later running a sports store.&lt;ref name=&quot;tel&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;times&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;g&quot;/&gt;

Brown was a Queensland selector from 1950&amp;ndash;51 to 1959&amp;ndash;60,&lt;ref name=az/&gt; and an Australian selector in 1952&amp;ndash;53 after defeating New South Wales' [[Chappie Dwyer]] in an election.&lt;ref&gt;Haigh and Frith, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; He was the first Queenslander in 23 years to serve as a national selector.&lt;ref name=r201&gt;Robinson, p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt; His brief tenure as a national selector was marked by abuse and harassment from parochial Queenslanders, upset that he did not include his fellow statesmen in the Test team.&lt;ref name=&quot;ind&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p177&quot;&gt;Perry (2000), p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt; Brown's sports store was vandalised and he resigned as a selector within a year.&lt;ref name=r201/&gt; In 1992, Brown was elected a life member of the [[Queensland Cricket Association]], and in 2000 was awarded the Medal of the [[Order of Australia]] for his services to cricket.&lt;ref name=&quot;az&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;tel&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;times&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;profile&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/ci/content/player/4225.html |title=Players and officials - Bill Brown |accessdate=2007-12-06|publisher=[[Cricinfo]]|first=David |last=Liverman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon Bradman's death in February 2001, Brown became the oldest living Australian Test cricketer, greatly amused by the fame that came with the title. Highly regarded by Australian cricketers of the modern era, [[Steve Waugh]] invited Brown to present Test debutant [[Adam Gilchrist]] with his [[baggy green]].&lt;ref name=&quot;im&quot;/&gt; The humble Brown was surprised, thinking himself an unworthy choice.  Waugh disagreed, opining that &quot;Bill is a baggy green icon who represents all that is good about playing for your country. He is humble, self-effacing and respectful, proud to have been afforded the honour of being an Australian Test cricketer, and a man who always looks for the positive in people.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;g&quot;&gt;{{cite news| authorlink=Gideon Haigh |last=Haigh |first=Gideon |date=2008-03-18 |accessdate=2008-06-10 | title=Obituary: Bill Brown: Australian batsman with a light touch | url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/mar/18/cricket.obituaries |work = [[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2008, Brown died in Brisbane at the age of 95.&lt;ref name=&quot;death&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://content-www.cricinfo.com/baggygreen/content/story/342858.html | title = Bill Brown dies aged 95 |publisher = [[Cricinfo]] | accessdate = 2008-03-17 |date=2008-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the last surviving ''Invincible'' to have played Test cricket before World War II and his death leaves only four living members of Bradman's 1948 team.&lt;ref name=&quot;ind&quot;/&gt;
