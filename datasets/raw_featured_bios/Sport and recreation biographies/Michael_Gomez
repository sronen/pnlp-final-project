'''Michael Gomez''' (born '''Michael Armstrong''', 21 June 1977), also known as ''&quot;The Irish Mexican&quot;'' or ''&quot;The Predator&quot;'',  is a former [[professional boxing|professional boxer]]. He was born to an [[Irish Traveller]] family in [[Longford]], [[County Longford]], Ireland, spending his early years in [[Dublin]] before moving to London and later [[Manchester]], England, with his family at the age of nine. 

Gomez finished his career fighting in the [[Lightweight#Professional boxing|lightweight]] division; however, he is more notable for his fights in the [[Featherweight#Professional boxing|featherweight]] and [[super featherweight]] divisions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boxrec&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Michael Gomez |publisher=BoxRec | url=http://www.boxrec.com/boxer_display.php?boxer_id=9358| accessdate=2007-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his career he has amassed a number of [[Championship belt|championship title belts]]: the [[IBF]] Inter-Continental featherweight title; and the [[British Boxing Board of Control|British]], [[World Boxing Organization|WBO]] Inter-Continental, [[World Boxing Association|WBA]] Inter-Continental and [[World Boxing Union|WBU]] super featherweight titles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boxrec&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lonsdale Belt&quot;&gt;{{cite web | first=Eamonn |last=O'Hara| title=Gomez bags belt to make history | work=[[The Irish News]] | url=http://66.102.9.104/search?q=cache:09oh-WGwcDAJ:www.irishnews.com/pageacc.asp%3Ftser1%3Dser%26par%3Dben%26sid%3D319522+%22Michael+Gomez%22+%22Gary+Thornhill%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=17&amp;gl=uk| date=2000-12-13|accessdate=2007-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gomez, who has been compared to [[Johnny Tapia]], has lived a turbulent life and has often been involved in controversial fights.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bragging Arthur&quot;&gt;{{cite web | first=Stephen |last=Jones | title=Alex Arthur v Michael Gomez, Amazing Fighters, Amazing Fight | publisher=Bragging Rights| url=http://www.braggingrightscorner.com/jonesarthur.html| accessdate=2008-05-31|date=2003-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Gomez's initial matches he suffered a number of losses to [[Journeyman (boxing)|journeyman]] opposition but then went on a run of victories which stretched for almost four years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boxrec&quot;/&gt; Of his 17 fights between February 2001 and March 2008, 16 ended in [[knockout]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boxrec&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bragging Arthur&quot;/&gt; Concerns arose about his drinking and failure to adhere to his [[diet regime|diet]] and [[Boxing training|training]] regimes after a 2001 loss to [[Laszlo Bognar]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Back on track&quot;&gt;{{cite web | first=Stuart |last=Brennan | title=Back on track| publisher=''[[Manchester Evening News]]''| url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/s/25/25033_back_on_track.html| accessdate=2008-05-31|date=2002-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gomez appeared to be &quot;back on track&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Back on track&quot;/&gt; in 2003, with his high-profile fight against [[Edinburgh]]-based fighter, [[Alex Arthur|''&quot;Amazing&quot;'' Alex Arthur]] for the British and WBA Inter-Continental super featherweight titles, which Gomez won by delivering a knockout blow to Arthur in the fifth round.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bragging Arthur&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Back on track&quot;/&gt; 

In 2006, Gomez suffered a controversial loss to [[Peter McDonagh]] when, in the middle of a round, he dropped his guard and walked out of the ring, later saying he had retired from boxing.&lt;ref name=&quot;No Mas&quot;&gt;{{cite web | author=Craig Phillips | title=Gomez returns from No Mas fight | work=[[Eurosport]]| url=http://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/27042007/58/gomez-returns-mas-fight.html| accessdate=13 December 2007 }} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to the ring after a 15&amp;ndash;month interval.

==Background==
Michael Armstrong was born into an [[Irish traveller]] family in Longford, Ireland. His mother went into labour with him while driving, so his [[partially sighted]] father took over the wheel but crashed the car into a lamp post on the way to the hospital; Michael was delivered in the back seat. The Armstrong family moved to [[Ballymun]], [[Dublin]], and, when Michael was age nine, to Manchester, England.&lt;ref name=&quot;Derick Allsop&quot;&gt;{{cite news | first=Derick |last=Allsop | title=Boxing: Born in back seat of crashed car| work=[[Sunday Mirror]] |publisher=Find Articles | url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4161/is_20031019/ai_n12883043|date=2003-10-19| accessdate=2007-06-13}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Irish Mexican&quot;&gt;{{cite news | first=Paul |last=Howard | title=Self defence; Michael Gomez endured the loss of his parents| work=[[The Sunday Herald]]|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-19059681.html| date=2000-12-10|accessdate=2008-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Allan Stevenson - Gomez (1).JPG|right|thumb|Padwork with Bobby Rimmer]]
Following the family's move to England, Armstrong's father's eyesight failed further due to [[retinitis pigmentosa]]. By that time, there were ten children in the Armstrong family. After his younger sister, Louise, died from [[sudden infant death syndrome]], his mother left the family to live with another woman.&lt;ref name=&quot;Telegraph Davies&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Irish Mexican&quot;/&gt; Armstrong subsequently spent much of his youth in various [[orphanage|children's homes]], and was a serial [[truancy|truant]] from school. His mother had taught him to [[shoplifting|shoplift]] as a child, and he was involved in [[Misdemeanor|petty crime]] throughout his youth in Manchester.&lt;ref name=&quot;Derick Allsop&quot;/&gt; At nine years old, he began [[Boxing training|training]] at Brian Hughes' Collyhurst and Moston Boys' Club. He also played [[association football|football]] for a local North Manchester team until the club received so many fines for Armstrong's fighting on the pitch that they were unable to pay them. At this point, he stopped playing football to concentrate on his training in the ring.&lt;ref name=&quot;Derick Allsop&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Irish Mexican&quot;/&gt;&lt;!--&lt;ref name=&quot;Born in a car&quot;&gt;{{cite web | first=Jerome |last=Reilly | title=&quot;Born in a car, dead for 48 seconds, he's a real fighter&quot;| work=[[Irish Independent]]|publisher=| url=http://www.independent.ie/opinion/analysis/born-in-a-car-dead-for-48-seconds-hes-a-real-fighter-126325.html| date=2006-02-05|accessdate=2008-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt; During his time in the children's home Armstrong met Alison, who has remained his companion (and later his wife) throughout his professional career; they were parents by the time Armstrong was 17.&lt;ref name=&quot;Derick Allsop&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;TOL family&quot;&gt;{{cite news | author=Ron Lewis | title=Michael Gomez: beating Amir Khan is last shot for glory | work=[[The Times]]| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/more_sport/article4159310.ece| accessdate=2008-06-20 | date=2008-06-18 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early professional career==
Armstrong boxed as an [[amateur boxing|amateur]] before turning professional in June 1995. He chose the professional surname &quot;Gomez&quot; when the [[British Boxing Board of Control]] (BBBoC) required him to select another name at the time of his registration as a professional; there was another boxer in the same weight division using the name &quot;Michael Armstrong&quot;. He chose his ring name in honour of [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] boxer [[Wilfredo Gómez]], whose videotaped fights Armstrong had studied intently as a youth.&lt;ref name=&quot;Derick Allsop&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BP Khan&quot;/&gt; The name, combined with Gomez's &quot;[[Boxing#Brawler/slugger|brawl]]ing style&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;ESPN&quot;&gt;{{cite web | first=Dan |last=Rafael |title=Rematches don't get any better than Vazquez-Marquez II | work=ESPN.com | url=http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/boxing/columns/story?id=3173659| date=2008-01-01 |accessdate=2008-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; earned him the nickname of &quot;the Irish Mexican&quot;. He developed a ring persona based on this nickname, which has remained popular with fans throughout his career. His ring entrance music is that of a [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[Mariachi]] band, a reference to his [[Spanish language|Hispanic-sounding]] chosen name, and many of his supporters wear [[sombrero]]s to his fights and wave Irish flags. Gomez also wears long Mexican-style boxing shorts in the colours of the [[flag of Ireland]] and often has the shape of a [[shamrock]] shaved into the hair on the back of his head.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sizzles and Simmers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BP Khan&quot;&gt;{{cite web | first=Rob|last=Tanner| title=Gomez aims to provide Amir Khan with toughest test | publisher=''[[Birmingham Post]]''| url=http://www.birminghampost.net/midlands-birmingham-sport/west-midlands-sports/other-sport/2008/05/08/gomez-aims-to-provide-amir-khan-with-toughest-test-65233-20874217/| accessdate=2008-05-08|date=2008-05-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Elliot Worsell&quot;&gt;{{cite web | first=Elliot |last=Worsell| title=Britain's most exciting fighters: 10 to 4 | publisher=SecondsOut.com| url=http://www.secondsout.com/UK/news.cfm?ccs=228&amp;cs=17005| accessdate=2007-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--&lt;ref name=&quot;close call&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=A close call for Ireland’s Gomez| publisher=[[The Irish Post]]| url=http://www.irishabroad.com/news/irishpost/sport/closecallforGomez.asp| accessdate=2008-05-31|date=2004-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

In his debut fight at the [[Manchester Central (Conference Centre)|G-Mex Leisure Centre]], Manchester, England, Gomez beat previously undefeated Danny Ruegg on the [[undercard]] of a [[boxingcard|bill]] that included [[Robin Reid (boxer)|Robin Reid]] and [[Michael Brodie]]. Despite this initial win, Gomez's early career was littered with losses to journeyman fighters such as Greg Upton and Chris Williams.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boxrec&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Jickells&quot;&gt;{{cite web | first=Eamonn |last=O'Hara| title=Gomez in line for title shot | work=[[The Irish News]] | url=http://66.102.9.104/search?q=cache:c56rR5ZNZ1QJ:www.irishnews.com/pageacc.asp%3Ftser1%3Dser%26par%3Dben%26sid%3D344853+%22Michael+Gomez%22+Jickells&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=14&amp;gl=uk| date=2000-09-27|accessdate=2007-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Image:Allan Stevenson - Gomez (2).JPG|right|thumb|Training on bodywork with Bobby Rimmer]]In 1996, Gomez was charged with [[murder]] after a [[gang]] fight outside a nightclub in Manchester. Gomez had hit one of his attackers, Sam Powell, who died after  his head hit the pavement as a result of the blow. The charge was later reduced to [[manslaughter]] and Gomez was cleared after it was ruled that he had acted in [[self-defense|self-defence]].&lt;ref name=&quot;The Irish Mexican&quot;/&gt; 

After this shaky beginning in the professional ranks, Gomez had a run of victories from September 1997 to February 1999. During this period Gomez won seven straight fights before challenging for his first title belt, the vacant British Central Area featherweight title against Chris Jickells on 27 February 1999 in [[Oldham]]. Gomez won the title with a fifth round knockout. He followed his first title win by adding another championship, the [[IBF]] Inter-Continental
featherweight title, with a second round knockout over Nigel Leake.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jickells&quot;/&gt;

===Move to super featherweight===
Later that year, Gomez relinquished his championship belts in a bid to move up to the super featherweight division. His first fight in the division, in September 1999, was for the vacant British super featherweight title, against the experienced and much heralded [[Liverpudlian]] fighter [[Gary Thornhill]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Boxer of the week&quot;&gt;{{cite web | author=Julian Wilson | title=Boxer of the week - Michael Gomez | work=Britishboxing.net | url=http://www.britishboxing.net/news_532-Boxer-of-the-week-Michael-Gomez.html| accessdate=13 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gomez defeated Thornhill with a second round knockout.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boxrec&quot;/&gt; In November 1999, Gomez faced off against [[Mexican people|Mexican]] Jose Manjarrez for the [[WBO]] Inter-Continental super featherweight title, walking away with the title based on the judges' scores after the full twelve rounds. In 1999, Gomez won four title belts, was undefeated during the year and was also named &quot;Young Boxer of the Year&quot; by the British Boxing Writers' Club.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lonsdale Belt&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Jickells&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC Thornhill&quot;&gt;{{cite news| title=Stylish Gomez retains title | work=[[BBC]] | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/low/other_sports/825889.stm| accessdate=13 June 2007 |date=2000-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; He continued his winning form into 2000 with another run of six wins, and successfully defended his British super featherweight title against [[Dean Pithie]], Carl Greaves and [[Ian McLeod (boxer)|Ian McLeod]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Boxrec&quot;/&gt;

==Bognar and Lear fights==
Gomez's first fight in 2001 was on 10 February against [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] boxer [[Laszlo Bognar]] for the WBO Inter-Continental super featherweight title, in [[Widnes]], [[Cheshire]]. Gomez had Bognar on the [[boxing ring|canvas]] in the fifth round, but Bognar recovered from this knockdown and used his [[southpaw]] jab to keep Gomez from closing in.  In the ninth round referee Dave Paris stopped the fight following a double left from Bognar, which had Gomez stricken against the ropes. Gomez felt the fight had been stopped prematurely and that he should have been allowed to continue. Gomez later stated that he was suffering from [[influenza|flu]] and should not have taken the fight. The ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' reported after the match that the pre-fight weigh-in and medical examination were not carried out in accordance with BBBC regulations: the volunteer inspector left before Bognar and Gomez had weighed in, and the medical examiner had not detected that Gomez was ill.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boxer of the week&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Fighting for control&quot;&gt;{{cite news | first=Bob |last=Mee | title=Fighting for control| publisher=''[[Daily Telegraph]]''| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?xml=/sport/2001/02/14/soboxi15.xml| accessdate=2008-05-31|date=2001-02-14 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC Hatton&quot;&gt;{{cite news |  title=Hatton makes devastating defence | work=[[BBC]] | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/boxing/1427661.stm| accessdate=13 June 2007 |date=2001-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gomez sought a rematch against Bognar, and five months later in July 2001 the pair met again, this time in Manchester, resulting in a victory for Gomez. The fight started badly for Gomez when he suffered a [[Knockout#Knockdown|flash knockdown]] in the first round and was down again in the second.  Gomez came back to knock Bognar down near the end of the second round. Gomez came out firing at the start of the third round and finished the fight with a fourth and final knockdown to avenge his earlier defeat.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC Hatton&quot;/&gt; He followed up his victory over Bognar with a second round knockout of [[Scotland|Scottish]] fighter [[Craig Docherty]] for another British  super featherweight title win.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boxrec&quot;/&gt; 

His next opponent was unbeaten [[West Ham]]-based fighter [[Kevin Lear]] on 1 June 2002, again in Manchester, on the undercard of the [[Ricky Hatton]] vs. [[Eamonn Magee]] fight.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boxrec&quot;/&gt; Lear, a former [[Amateur Boxing Association of England|Amateur Boxing Association of England (ABA)]] champion, kept a one-dimensional Gomez at bay with his sharp [[jab]] from the outset of the fight. Gomez took several punches to the face, and his nose began to bleed heavily starting in the sixth round. By the eighth round Gomez was slowing, suffering the effects of Lear's continuing barrage of combinations. At the end of the eighth round Gomez's trainer Brian Hughes retired his fighter, giving Lear a surprise victory.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sporting Life Lear&quot;&gt;{{cite web | author=Mark Staniforth | title=Lear Claims Memorable Win | work=[[Sporting Life (newspaper)|Sporting Life]] | url=http://www.sportinglife.com/boxing/news/story_get.cgi?STORY_NAME=boxing/02/06/01/BOXING_Manchester.html| accessdate=13 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The defeat to Lear, and the manner in which the fight ended, prompted Hughes, Gomez's longtime mentor and trainer, to ask Gomez to retire from boxing. This event signalled the end of the relationship between Gomez and Hughes; soon after, Gomez crossed Manchester to join Ricky Hatton and former Collyhurst gym stablemate [[Anthony Farnell]] at the rival Phoenix Gym run by [[Billy Graham (boxing trainer)|Billy Graham]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MEN Gomez switch&quot;&gt;{{cite web | author=Stuart Brennan | title=Boxing: Gomez switches camps | work=Manchester Evening News | url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/s/10/10562_boxing_gomez_switches_camps.html| accessdate=13 June 2007 |date=2002-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;frenchman&quot;&gt;{{cite news | title=Gomez to fight Frenchman | work=[[BBC]] | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/boxing/3668099.stm| accessdate=13 July 2007 |date=2004-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gomez followed the defeat to Lear with a string of three wins, all by knockout.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boxrec&quot;/&gt; 

During the period between the first Bognar fight and the loss to Lear, Gomez's life spun out of control. He was &quot;boozing, brawling and womanising&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Derick Allsop&quot;/&gt; and was convicted of four [[Drunk driving (United Kingdom)|drink-drive]] offenses.&lt;ref name=&quot;Back on track&quot;/&gt; During a [[street fighting|street fight]], Gomez was stabbed and badly injured—his heart stopped beating for 148&amp;nbsp;seconds while on the [[Surgery|operating table]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Back on track&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Fighting for control&quot;/&gt;&lt;!--&lt;ref name=&quot;ind&quot;&gt;{{cite news | first=Alan|last=Hubbard| title=&quot;BOXING: `Wild child' Gomez set to test Arthur's mettle&quot;| work=[[The Independent on Sunday]]|publisher=Find Articles | url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4159/is_20031019/ai_n12748740 |date=2003-10-19|accessdate=2007-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;gamble backfires&quot;&gt;{{cite news | first=Bob |last=Mee | title=&quot;Alexander's gamble backfires&quot;| publisher=''[[Daily Telegraph]]''| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?xml=/sport/2001/02/11/soboxx12.xml| accessdate=2008-05-31|date=2001-02-11 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Preacher has faith&quot;&gt;{{cite web | first=Stuart |last=Brennan | title=&quot;Preacher has faith in Mike&quot; | publisher=''[[Manchester Evening News]]''| url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/boxing/s/136/136075_preacher_has_faith_in_mike_.html| accessdate=2008-05-31|date=2004-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  --&gt;

==Alex Arthur fight==
[[Image:Allan Stevenson - Gomez (6).JPG|left|thumb|Gomez [[sparring]] with headgear]]
Following his change in trainer, Gomez was contracted for the highest profile fight of his career against [[Edinburgh]]-based fighter &quot;Amazing&quot; Alex Arthur for the British and [[World Boxing Association|WBA]] Inter-Continental super featherweight titles. The fight took place in a sold-out [[Meadowbank Stadium]] in October 2003, in what was the first professional boxing card in Edinburgh in almost 20&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boxing Monthly Amazing&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title=Amazing All-Round | work=Boxing Monthly| url=http://www.boxing-monthly.co.uk/content/0310/two.htm| accessdate=13 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the fight, Arthur had opined during interviews that &quot;looking deep into Gomez’s eyes at the press conference, I’m not sure even he believes he can win. He’ll be so fired up I expect it’ll take me eight or nine rounds but, if his resistance has gone as people are saying, it could be a lot sooner.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Boxing Monthly Amazing&quot;/&gt; With respect to his approach to the fight, Arthur added &quot;I see about 20 ways to beat him. I'm just looking forward to shutting him up.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC Arthur&quot;&gt;{{cite news |  title=Arthur shrugs off trainer blow | work=[[BBC]] | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/boxing/3193606.stm| accessdate=13 June 2007 |date=2003-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arthur, who was looking to retain the [[BBBofC]] [[Lonsdale Belt]], was seen as a rising star in British boxing. He was a strong favourite to win the bout against Gomez, who was perceived to have been through too many battles and abused his body too much, and the fight was seen as a stepping stone on Arthur's way to a future world championship.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bragging Arthur&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Boxer of the week&quot;/&gt; However, [[Freddie Roach (boxing)|Freddie Roach]], Arthur's trainer, was criticised when he remained in the [[USA|United States]] to coach another boxer instead of continuing to work with Arthur to prepare for his championship match.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC Arthur&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot; BBN Kizza Preview&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Alex Arthur v Michael Kizza Preview | publisher=BritishBoxing.net| url=http://www.britishboxing.net/news_598-Alex-Arthur-v-Michael-Kizza-Preview.html| accessdate=2008-05-31|date=2004-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gomez proved his critics wrong when he arrived at the fight in prime condition and with aggression, determination and desire.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bragging Arthur&quot;/&gt; The first two rounds started at a furious pace, with Arthur keeping Gomez at bay with stiff jabs and Gomez working inside with hooks and body punches. The match was turning into a clash of opposing styles, Arthur displaying control and boxing technique and Gomez storming forward with wild ferocity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bragging Arthur&quot;/&gt; From the third round the fight began to turn Gomez's way. Gomez cut Arthur in the third and silenced the home crowd, who were not used to seeing the home-town hero being battered in this manner. Gomez dominated the fourth round and was in full control of the fight—he exposed Arthur's weak defence and at one stage landed 28 punches without reply.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bragging Arthur&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gomez stuns&quot;&gt;{{cite news | title=Gomez stuns Arthur | publisher=[[BBC Sport]]| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/boxing/3214701.stm| accessdate=2008-05-31|date=2003-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gomez knocked down his opponent twice before delivering a jarring left hook to Arthur, knocking Arthur to the canvas for the third time. Referee John Coyle stopped the fight, and Gomez won with the resulting [[knock out|TKO]] in the fifth round.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bragging Arthur&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gomez stuns&quot;/&gt; The match was hailed as one of the best fights in Britain for a decade. Boxing promoter [[Frank Warren (promoter)|Frank Warren]] called the fight &quot;the greatest contest seen on these shores since [[Nigel Benn]] beat [[Gerald McClellan]] in 1995&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kizza Preview&quot;&gt;{{cite web | author=K MacInnes | title=This England | work=[[New Statesman]] | url=http://www.newstatesman.com/200311240012| accessdate=13 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Retired Scottish boxer [[Ken Buchanan]] said it was one of the best fights he had ever seen.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bragging Arthur&quot;/&gt;

Gomez attended Arthur's next fight against [[Uganda]]n Michael Kizza in Meadowbank, [[Scotland]], but Arthur did not appear when Gomez fought Ben Odamattey for the [[WBU]] super featherweight title in Manchester a few weeks later. Gomez pointed this out when being interviewed shortly afterward, adding &quot;Sky Television want a return. Frank Warren, Arthur's manager, wants a re-match. And most of all so do I.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;GOMEZ BOXING CLEVER&quot;&gt;{{cite web | author=Hugh Keevins | title=Gomez Boxing Clever | work=[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]|url= http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/tm_objectid=14120854&amp;method=full&amp;siteid=89488&amp;headline=boxing--gomez-boxing-clever-name_page.html|archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20040426092850/http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/tm_objectid=14120854&amp;method=full&amp;siteid=89488&amp;headline=boxing--gomez-boxing-clever-name_page.html|archivedate= 2004-04-26  | accessdate=9 June 2008|date=2004-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arthur responded by saying &quot;the fight (with Gomez) is definitely going to happen. Hopefully I'll get another warm-up fight in June and then take on Gomez in September.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;GOMEZ BOXING CLEVER&quot;/&gt; Despite the rhetoric, the two fighters did not meet each other in the ring again.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boxrec&quot;/&gt;

==WBU world title==
In March 2004, Gomez fought [[Ghana]]ian Ben Odamattey for the [[WBU]] super featherweight title at the MEN Arena in Manchester, winning the championship by stopping Odamattey in the third round.&lt;ref name=&quot;frenchman&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GOMEZ BOXING CLEVER&quot;/&gt; He retained his WBU title in his next two fights against Justin Juuko and Leva Kirakosyan with knockout wins. Gomez then faced [[Argentinia]]n boxer &quot;El Vikingo&quot; Javier Osvaldo Alvarez in February 2005, once again fighting at the MEN Arena in Manchester. WBO super middleweight title holder [[Joe Calzaghe]] had been scheduled to top the bill but pulled out of his arranged fight, and Gomez and Alvarez were slotted as the main attraction.&lt;ref name=&quot;porter&quot;&gt;{{cite web | author=Mark Porter | title=Alvarez Stops Brave Gomez in Six | work=BritishBoxing.net | url=http://www.britishboxing.net/news_163-Alvarez-Stops-Brave-Gomez-in-Six.html| accessdate=13 July 2007 |date=2005-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ind Bunce&quot;&gt;{{cite news | author=Steve Bunce | title=Alvarez hammer blows put Gomez career on ropes | work=[[The Independent]] | url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/boxing-alvarez-hammer-blows-put-gomez-career-on-ropes-1530365.html| date=12 February 2005 |accessdate=13 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pair clashed at the weigh in, and this antagonism carried into the ring; from the outset of the fight Gomez tried to draw Alvarez into a [[Boxing#Brawler/slugger|brawl]]. Gomez appeared to win the first two rounds behind stinging jabs, but Alvarez seemed unruffled.  In the third round, Alvarez started to take control of the fight and landed several blows to Gomez's face. Gomez began quickly in the fourth round, attacking Alvarez from behind his jab and working his way through his opponent's defense.&lt;ref name=&quot;porter&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ind Bunce&quot;/&gt; Alvarez appeared content to catch Gomez as he moved forward.  Despite Gomez's strong start, Alvarez dazed Gomez with a stiff right hand shot in the fourth round, after which the Argentinian launched into a furious onslaught.  Gomez steadied in the fifth but was visibly tired. Two minutes into the sixth round, Alvarez floored Gomez with a right hook. Gomez [[Professional boxing#Scoring|beat the count]] and Alvarez then moved in to continue his attack. Referee [[Mickey Vann]] stopped the fight after 2&amp;nbsp;minutes 25&amp;nbsp;seconds of the round with Gomez pinned to the ropes and taking significant punishment.&lt;ref name=&quot;porter&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ind Bunce&quot;/&gt;

==Peter McDonagh controversy==
Gomez was out of the ring for almost a year following the Alvarez fight and was next due to fight [[Willie Limond]] for the WBU lightweight title, but turned down the opportunity for a chance to fight for an Irish title. Gomez then signed up to fight fellow English-based [[Irishman]], [[Peter McDonagh]], for the Irish lightweight title on the undercard of a [[Bernard Dunne]] fight on 28 January 2006 at the [[National Stadium, Dublin]]. After the fight was signed Gomez stated &quot;I just can’t wait to get my hands on that Irish title because I’ve been desperate to fight in Ireland for years.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Born in a car&quot;&gt;{{cite web | first=Jerome |last=Reilly | title=Born in a car, dead for 48 seconds, he's a real fighter| work=[[Irish Independent]]|publisher=| url=http://www.independent.ie/opinion/analysis/born-in-a-car-dead-for-48-seconds-hes-a-real-fighter-126325.html| date=2006-02-05|accessdate=2008-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= | title=Bernard Dunne Back In Action On Jan 28 In Dublin! | work=Eastside Boxing| url=http://www.eastsideboxing.com/news.php?p=5585&amp;more=1| accessdate=13 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leading up to the fight McDonagh was making visits to see [[paranormalist]] [[Uri Geller]] as &quot;mind coach&quot; to help him prepare mentally for the fight, and Geller also travelled with him to Dublin for the fight. Gomez commented that &quot;I’m not sure Uri Geller will be of much use to him though because there won’t be any spoons in that ring for him to bend. The only thing I plan on bending is some of McDonagh’s ribs with my body punches.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |  title=Uri Geller in McDonagh's corner for Irish title fight | work=Irish Independent| url=http://www.independent.ie/sport/boxing-uri-geller-in-mcdonaghs-corner-for-irish-title-fight-119275.html| accessdate=9 June 2008 |date=2006-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first four rounds were relatively close, with Gomez leading according to pundits, but the fight ended in the fifth round under bizarre circumstances when for no apparent reason Gomez stopped fighting and failed to defend himself. He then received a number of unanswered punches from McDonagh before being floored. Gomez rose from the canvas immediately but appeared to ignore the referee and walk towards his corner while the referee continued with his count.  Gomez then left the ring as the referee was waving the fight off. [[RTÉ]] commentator [[Steve Collins]] said &quot;I smell a rat, something's not right here.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;No Mas&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Times Foley&quot;&gt;{{cite news | author=Michael Foley  | title=Gomez controversy a body blow to boxing | work=[[The Sunday Times]]| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/article726946.ece| accessdate=13 July 2007 |date=2006-02-05 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC mcdonagh&quot;&gt;{{cite news |  title=Gomez trainer slams fixing slur | work=[[BBC]]| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/boxing/4666246.stm| accessdate=13 July 2007 |date=2006-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Boxing Union of Ireland]] (BUI) initially suspended both fighters' [[Prize money|purses]], and investigated reports of unusual betting patterns, with large sums of money being placed on McDonagh to win [[Boxing#Rules|inside the distance]] and more specifically in the fifth round.  Odds on McDonagh to win the fight in the fifth round had been cut from 125–1 to 18–1 by the afternoon of the bout.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC mcdonagh&quot;/&gt; Following their investigation, the BUI released the purses to each of the fighters, stating &quot;Michael Gomez and Peter McDonagh confirmed that neither they, their families, nor any person in their camp, as far as they were aware, betted on the fight.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;BUI invest&quot;&gt;{{cite web |  title=Union awards purses to McDonagh and Gomez | work=[[The Irish Examiner]] (archived at Breakingnews.ie)| url=http://www.breakingnews.ie/archives/?c=SPORT&amp;jp=cweyojcwcwmh&amp;d=2006-02-17| accessdate=9 June 2008 |date=2006-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BUI did express disappointment that the [[bookmaker]], [[Boylesports]], who had suspended wagering on the bout due to the unusual betting patterns, had chosen not to reply to the investigators' queries.&lt;ref name=&quot;BUI invest&quot;/&gt;
Gomez later explained the loss by saying that &quot;it was all very simple, I just came to a decision in there that I need to retire from boxing full stop&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Tomas Rohan | title=Gomez - I'm happy with my decision | work=irish-boxing.com |url= http://irish-boxing.com/january06/31_January_2006_Gomez.htm |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070509185818/http://irish-boxing.com/january06/31_January_2006_Gomez.htm |archivedate= 2007-05-09| accessdate=9 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gomez further indicated that he planned to pursue a career in bodybuilding. McDonagh, meanwhile, claimed that he had won because of Gellar's assistance leading up to the bout.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC mcdonagh&quot;/&gt;

Gomez sought a second opportunity to fight McDonagh; in April 2007, he offered to fight for only his training costs.&lt;ref name=&quot;MEN Gunning&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title=Gomez goes gunning for Amir | work=[[Manchester Evening News]]| url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/boxing/s/1004/1004142__gomez_goes_gunning_for_amir.html|  accessdate=2008-04-11 | date=2007-04-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, their rematch for the Irish lightweight title, to be billed as ''&quot;Redemption&quot;'', was set for 23 May 2008,&lt;ref name=&quot;Saddo McDonagh rematch&quot;&gt;{{cite web | author=Jane Warburton | title=Michael Gomez gets rematch with Peter McDonagh | work=Saddo Boxing| url=http://www.saddoboxing.com/7106-michael-gomez-peter-mcdonagh.html| accessdate=2008-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; but McDonagh pulled out of the scheduled bout.&lt;ref name=&quot;saddochange&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last= Warburton| first =Jane | title = British Boxing: Michael Gomez gets call to face Commonwealth champion Amir Khan June 21 | work = Saddo Boxing  | publisher = saddoboxing.com | url = http://www.saddoboxing.com/7311-amir-khan-vs-michael-gomez.html

==Return to the ring==
[[Image:Allan Stevenson - Gomez (3).JPG|right|thumb|Gomez working the pads]]
Gomez found himself once again drawn to boxing after watching a fight between Alex Arthur and [[Carl Johanneson]], and resumed training. In May 2007, fifteen months after his fight with McDonagh, he returned to the ring to face Daniel Thorpe at the Altrincham Leisure Centre, Manchester.&lt;ref name=&quot;feeling the fear&quot;&gt;{{cite web | author=Terry Dooley | title=Michael Gomez is feeling the fear but coming back anyway  | work=Britishboxing.net| url=http://www.britishboxing.net/news_2551-Michael-Gomez-is-feeling-the-fear-but-coming-back-anyway.html | accessdate=2008-06-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gomez had left the Phoenix Gym and was now training at Bobby Rimmers' Boxing Academy in [[Stalybridge]], Manchester,  and had returned to fight in the [[super featherweight]] division. The fight was billed as ''&quot;The Last Stand&quot;'', and the venue was sold out with fellow fighters Ricky Hatton and his brother [[Matthew Hatton]] cheering him on from ringside. Gomez won the fight with a stoppage in the third round.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Jane Warburton | title=Ringside boxing report: Michael Gomez—Daniel Thorpe | work=Saddo boxing| url= http://www.saddoboxing.com/5241-michael-gomez-daniel-thorpe.html| accessdate=9 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The following month Gomez also beat Youssef Al Hamidi, again with a third round stoppage.&lt;ref name=&quot;feeling the fear&quot;/&gt; Following two comeback fights against journeyman opposition Gomez was rumoured to be in line for fights against many of Britain and Ireland's top level super featherweights and lightweights including [[Kevin Mitchell (professional boxer)|Kevin Mitchell]], [[Amir Khan (boxer)|Amir Khan]], and Carl Johanneson; Gomez himself was seeking a rematch against Peter McDonagh.&lt;ref name=&quot;feeling the fear&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MEN Khan&quot;&gt;{{cite web | first=Stuart |last=Brennan | title=Khan you believe it? | publisher=[[Manchester Evening News]] | url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/boxing/s/1006/1006293_khan_you_believe_it.html| date=2007-05-05|accessdate=2007-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He then signed up to face Leeds's Johanneson on 19 October 2007 at the [[Doncaster Dome]], [[Doncaster]], [[England]] for the British super featherweight title.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boxrec&quot;/&gt; Johanneson had just come off his second defeat to [[Armenia]]n [[Leva Kirakosyan]], whom Gomez had knocked out in October 2004.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boxrec&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Nowhere to hide&quot;&gt;{{cite web | author=Jim Watt | title=Nowhere to hide | work=[[SKY Sports]] | url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,12067_2807920,00.html | accessdate=2007-10-19|date=2007-10-19 | authorlink=Jim Watt (boxer) }}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the fight, Gomez was confident, stating &quot;You can't outbox me. I'll jab your head off. If he comes to have a fight with me it is going to be early Christmas for everyone because I don't know who's going to go but someone's going to go and it's not going to be me.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;jab yer head off&quot;&gt;{{cite web | author=Terry Dooley | title=Michael Gomez's considered reflections | work=Britishboxing.net| url=http://www.britishboxing.net/news_2747-Michael-Gomez-s-considered-reflections.html |  accessdate=2007-10-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the pre-fight [[press conference]] in [[Doncaster]] both fighters squared up to each other and promised to knock each other out; during the highly charged face off both fighters had to be kept apart  by their promoter and trainers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Head To Head&quot;&gt;{{cite web |  title=Johanneson And Michael Gomez Clash Head To Head | work=Eastside Boxing| url=http://www.eastsideboxing.com/news.php?p=12833&amp;more=1 |accessdate=2007-10-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As many expected, the highly anticipated domestic clash was a savage brawl from round one. Gomez won the opening rounds and threatened to overpower Johanneson from the opening seconds. The Leeds fighter then gained the upper hand as the fight went on, flooring Gomez in the sixth round only for the &quot;Irish Mexican&quot; to rise from the canvas. Soon after, with Gomez appearing unsteady on his feet, referee Mickey Vann stopped the fight.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=&quot;Johanneson Stops Gomez&quot;&gt;{{cite web |  title=&quot;Johanneson Stops Gomez In A Thriller!&quot; | work=Eastside Boxing| url=http://www.eastsideboxing.com/news.php?p=12918&amp;more=1| accessdate=20 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;I deserve&quot;/&gt;--&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ruthless Johanneson&quot;&gt;{{cite news |  title=Ruthless Johanneson retains title | work=[[BBC Sport]]| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/boxing/7053918.stm | accessdate=2007-10-20 | date=2007-10-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mail Johanneson&quot;&gt;{{cite news |  title=Johanneson retains British super-featherweight title | work=[[Daily Mail]]| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/othersports/article-488669/Johanneson-retains-British-super-featherweight-title.html|  accessdate=2007-10-20 | date=2007-10-19 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gomez said that Vann had stopped the fight early, adding, &quot;When the stoppage came, I wasn't wobbling or staggering, and I only dropped my hands in the fight to show Johanneson that he couldn't hurt me. But the referee simply got the wrong message. It was bad refereeing. I told him straight away I was fine, but he insisted on showing me to my corner.&quot; The former champion was clear that he wanted another opportunity to fight for the British title.&lt;ref name=&quot;I deserve&quot;&gt;{{cite web | author=Thomas Myler | title=Gomez: 'I deserve another title shot'  | work=[[Irish Independent]]| url=http://www.independent.ie/sport/other-sports/boxing-gomez-i-deserve-another-title-shot-1208649.html |  accessdate=2007-10-31 | date=2007-10-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Amir Khan fight==
Gomez fought [[Amir Khan (boxer)|Amir Khan]] for the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] lightweight title at the [[National Indoor Arena]], [[Birmingham]], on 21 June 2008, Gomez's thirty-first birthday.  Khan said that &quot;there is no way he will be as fit as me, so I expect a spectacular stoppage&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Telegraph Khan&quot;&gt;{{cite news | author=Gareth A Davies | title=Michael Gomez vows to beat Amir Khan | work=[[Daily Telegraph]]| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/othersports/boxingandmma/2299688/Michael-Gomez-vows-to-beat-Amir-Khan.html| accessdate=2008-05-07 | date=2008-05-07 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gomez did not attend the scheduled pre-fight press conference, prompting Khan to deride him, and promoter Frank Warren accused Gomez of failing to show respect to Khan and the media.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bolton June&quot;&gt;{{cite web | author=David Magilton | title=Khan fuming at Gomez no-show | work=[[The Bolton News]]| url=http://www.theboltonnews.co.uk/sport/amirkhan/display.var.2350893.0.khan_fuming_at_gomez_noshow.php| accessdate=2008-06-20 | date=2008-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

During the fight Khan knocked Gomez to the canvas in the first round with a barrage of hooks and uppercuts. In the second round, Gomez caught Khan with a left hook, knocking down the younger fighter and exposing his defensive weakness; however, Khan steadied himself after the mandatory eight-count, and cut Gomez above the left eye before the round ended.&lt;ref name=&quot;TeleKhan&quot;&gt;{{cite news | first=Mike|last=Lewis | title=Amir Khan given a test by Michael Gomez | publisher=''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/othersports/boxingandmma/2303807/Amir-Khan-given-a-test-by-Michael-Gomez.html | accessdate=2009-08-02|date=2009-06-22 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gomez caught Khan in the ribs with a left hook in the fourth round which left Khan unstable for a moment, but Khan responded with a flurry of hooks and jabs. Khan landed a &quot;cracking left hook&quot; in the fifth,&lt;ref name=&quot;Doogan Khan&quot;/&gt; but Gomez beat the count. At 2:32 of the fifth round, referee John Keane stopped the fight when Gomez was knocked into the ropes by a Khan left uppercut.&lt;ref name=&quot;IndepKhan&quot;&gt;{{cite news | first=Alan|last=Hubbard | title=Khan cuts loose after early blow | publisher=''[[The Independent|The Independent on Sunday]]''|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/general/others/boxing-khan-cuts-loose-after-early-blow-852093.html | accessdate=2008-05-22|date=2009-06-22 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the fight, Khan said he felt he had moved up a level by &quot;fighting world class fighters like Gomez.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;SkyKhan&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Tough test for Khan | publisher=''[[Sky Sports]]''| url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,12183_3720594,00.html | accessdate=2008-05-22|date=2009-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Before the fight, sports writers considered Gomez a tough opponent for Khan, with his &quot;knockout punch&quot; and his success against Alex Arthur in similar circumstances,&lt;ref name=&quot;Telegraph Davies&quot;/&gt; despite having lost three of his last six fights.&lt;ref name=&quot;skynews june&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Gomez next up for Amir | work=[[Sky Sports]]| url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,12183_3529531,00.html| accessdate=2008-06-20 | date=2008-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gomez saw the fight as an opportunity to reignite his career; in an interview shortly before the fight he spoke of how &quot;&lt;nowiki&gt;[t]&lt;/nowiki&gt;his fight really is my last chance to set myself up for life and become known in every household in Britain&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Telegraph June&quot;&gt;{{cite news | author=Gareth A Davies | title=Amir Khan contest 'surprises' Michael Gomez | work=[[Daily Telegraph]]| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/othersports/boxingandmma/2303517/Amir-Khan-contest-surprises-Michael-Gomez.html| accessdate=2009-08-02 | date=2008-06-17 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, he reflected on the positive effects of his career in the ring, saying  &quot;Boxing kept my feet on the ground and gave me a focus. It’s got me through the bad times and calmed me down. If it wasn’t for boxing, I wouldn’t have my beautiful wife and family&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;TOL family&quot;/&gt; Gomez lives with his wife Alison and their three children in Manchester.&lt;ref name=&quot;TOL family&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MEN Khan&quot;/&gt;
