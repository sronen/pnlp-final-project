'''Hugh Trumble''' (12 May 1867 – 14 August 1938) was an [[Australian]] [[cricket]]er who played 32&amp;nbsp;[[Test cricket|Test matches]] as a [[all-rounder|bowling all-rounder]] between  1890 and 1904. He [[captain (cricket)|captained]] the [[Australia national cricket team|Australian team]] in two Tests, winning both.  Trumble took 141&amp;nbsp;[[Wicket (dismisal)|wickets]] in Test cricket—a world record at the time of his retirement—at an [[bowling average|average]] of 21.78&amp;nbsp;[[run (cricket)|runs]] per wicket.  He is [[Test cricket hat-tricks|one of only three bowlers]] to twice take a [[Hat-trick (cricket)|hat-trick]] in Test cricket. Observers in Trumble's day, including the authoritative ''[[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack]]'', regarded him as ranking among the great Australian bowlers of the [[Golden Age of cricket]]. He was named as one of the [[Wisden Cricketers of the Year|''Wisden'' Cricketers of the Year]] in 1897 and the [[Australian Cricket Hall of Fame]], established in 1996, inducted him in 2004.

A tall and thin [[off spin]]ner, Trumble delivered the ball at a quicker pace than most spin bowlers, using his height and uncommonly long fingers to his greatest advantage.  He was at his best on the softer [[cricket pitch|pitches]] of England, but his accuracy and variations in pace enabled him to take wickets on the harder pitches of Australia. He was a dependable [[batting order (cricket)|lower order]] batsman and a fine [[fielding (cricket)|fielder]] in the [[slip (cricket)|slips]].  He was recognised as a shrewd thinker about the game and was popular with team-mates and opponents, with a penchant for practical jokes.

Trumble made his Test debut during the [[Australian cricket team in England in 1890|Australian cricket team's tour of England in 1890]], but was unable to secure a permanent place in the Australian side until the [[Australian cricket team in England in 1896|1896 tour of England]]. When the [[Australian cricket team in England in 1899|Australian team next toured England in 1899]], Trumble scored 1,183&amp;nbsp;runs and took 142&amp;nbsp;wickets; only [[George Giffen]] before him had achieved the &quot;double&quot; of 1,000&amp;nbsp;runs and 100&amp;nbsp;wickets as part of a touring team in England.  He was appointed [[Australian national cricket captains|captain of Australia]] in 1901–02, when [[Joe Darling]] was unavailable due to farming commitments.  He retired after the 1902 Australian tour of England but was coaxed back in 1903–04.  In his last Test match, Trumble took a hat-trick, his second, in front of his home town supporters in Melbourne.

Off the field, Trumble worked for the  [[National Australia Bank|National Bank of Australasia]], rising to the position of manager of a local branch despite his cricket commitments interrupting his banking career.  In 1911, he was appointed secretary of the [[Melbourne Cricket Club]], overseeing the development of the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] (MCG) into a stadium capable of holding over 70,000&amp;nbsp;spectators.  He held this post until his death in 1938 from a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]], aged&amp;nbsp;71.

== Early life and career ==
Trumble was born in the inner [[Melbourne]] neighbourhood of [[Collingwood, Victoria]] in 1867, the son of William, born in [[Northern Ireland]] and superintendent of an [[psychiatric hospital|insane asylum]], and [[Scotland|Scottish]]-born Elizabeth (née Clark).&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last = Pierce | first = Peter | year = 1990 | url = http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A120301b.htm | title =  Trumble, Hugh (1867–1938) | work = Australian Dictionary of Biography, Online Edition | publisher = Australian National University | accessdate = 2008-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ADBThomas&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last = Hyslop| first = Robert| year = 1990 | url = http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A120302b.htm | title =  Trumble, Thomas (1872–1954) | work = Australian Dictionary of Biography, Online Edition | publisher = Australian National University | accessdate = 2008-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His elder brother, [[John Trumble|John]], also played Test cricket for Australia and his younger brother, [[Thomas Trumble|Thomas]], was a [[Australian Public Service|public servant]] who served as Secretary for the [[Department of Defence (Australia)|Department of Defence]] from 1918–27,&lt;ref name=&quot;Secretary&quot;&gt;In the Australian government, a departmental secretary such as the Secretary of the Department of Defence is the senior public servant in a government department; as opposed to the [[Minister for Defence (Australia)]], a political position. See [[Australian Public Service#Organisational Structure]] for further detail on the split between the two roles.&lt;/ref&gt; and then official secretary to the [[High Commissioner (Commonwealth)|High Commissioner]] for Australia in London.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ADBThomas&quot;/&gt;

Trumble spent part of his early life in the western Victorian town of [[Ararat, Victoria|Ararat]] before returning to Melbourne, settling in suburban [[Camberwell, Victoria|Camberwell]]. He was educated at Hawthorn Grammar School and played his early cricket for Kew Cricket Club.&lt;ref name=&quot;PremierCricket&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last = Fiddian | first = Marc | year = 1992 | url = http://premier.cricketvictoria.com.au/page/hugh_trumble.html | title = Hugh Trumble | work = extract from Australian All-Rounders - From Giffen to Gilmour | publisher = [[Victorian Premier Cricket]] | accessdate = 2008-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Encouraging his sons' early love of cricket, William Trumble—a keen cricketer who bowled [[leg break]]s for [[Casey-South Melbourne Cricket Club|South Melbourne Cricket Club]]—set out a [[cricket pitch]] at the family home.&lt;ref name=&quot;Perry&quot;&gt;Perry, pp. 90–93.&lt;/ref&gt;  He placed a feather on a [[line and length|good length]] and urged his sons to aim at it when bowling.  Known for his accuracy, Hugh later said, &quot;Of course I couldn't repeatedly hit the feather, but I soon reached the stage when I was always pretty close to it&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Reese&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Reese|first=Daniel|title=Was It All Cricket?| url = http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-ReeWasI-t1-body-d5.html|year=1948|page=71|publisher=George Allen and Unwin|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trumble transferred to the [[Melbourne Cricket Club]] for the 1887–88 cricket season and was an immediate success. He took 36&amp;nbsp;wickets that season, finishing with an [[Bowling average|average]] of 6.77&amp;nbsp;runs per wicket; the best in the club, beating his teammate and Australian Test bowler [[Fred Spofforth]].&lt;ref name=&quot;PremierCricket&quot;/&gt;  He made his [[first-class cricket]] debut for [[Victorian Bushrangers|Victoria]] that same season, selected to play against a touring English [[First XI|XI]] led by [[Middlesex County Cricket Club|Middlesex]] batsman [[George Vernon]].&lt;ref name=&quot;FCDebut&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/3/3278.html | title = Victoria v GF Vernon's XI: GF Vernon's XI in Australia 1887/88  | publisher = CricketArchive | accessdate = 2008-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first match for Victoria against Australian opposition was against [[New South Wales Blues|New South Wales]] at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]].  Bowling with Spofforth, in the first innings Trumble took seven wickets for 52&amp;nbsp;runs.&lt;ref name=&quot;NSWDebutSeason&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/3/3284.html | title = Victoria v New South Wales: Other First-Class matches 1887/88  | publisher = CricketArchive | accessdate = 2008-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Test cricket ==
=== Early struggle ===
Early in the 1889–90 Australian season, Trumble endured a period where he was not able to take wickets consistently.  With selection of the Australian team to tour England in 1890 due at this time, Trumble was anxious about this poor run of form. Noting his anxiety while playing, a friend offered him a beer during the [[list of cricket terms#L|lunch break]] to revive his spirits.  Previously a [[Teetotalism|teetotaler]], Trumble enjoyed his first taste and ordered another before re-entering the field of play.  Feeling relaxed, although wondering about his steadiness of step, Trumble took a succession of wickets to ensure his selection in the Australian team.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robinson&quot;&gt;Robinson, pp. 88–94.&lt;/ref&gt;  Trumble finished the season with 27&amp;nbsp;wickets at an average of 14.20 per wicket.&lt;ref name=&quot;FCseasonbowling&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/0/140/f_Bowling_by_Season.html | title =  First-class Bowling in Each Season by Hugh Trumble | publisher = CricketArchive | accessdate = 2008-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1890 Australian team touring England was relatively inexperienced.&lt;ref name=&quot;7thAustralians&quot;&gt;Pollard (1988), p. 405.&lt;/ref&gt;  The team missed the [[all-rounder|all-round]] ability of [[George Giffen]], who had refused to join the squad, thinking it unlikely the tour would be a sporting or financial success.&lt;ref name=&quot;Giffen&quot;&gt;Robinson, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Australians won 13&amp;nbsp;matches on tour, losing&amp;nbsp;16 and [[result (cricket)|drawing]]&amp;nbsp;9.&lt;ref name=&quot;7thAustralians&quot;/&gt; Trumble made his Test cricket debut in the First Test against the [[England cricket team|English team]] at [[Lord's Cricket Ground]].  He took only one [[wicket]], dismissing [[Bobby Peel]] [[caught (cricket)|caught and bowled]] for 1.&lt;ref name=&quot;TestDebut&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/3/3605.html | title = England v Australia: Australia in England 1890 (1st Test) | publisher = CricketArchive | accessdate = 2008-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Batting at [[Tail-end|number eleven]] in the first [[innings]] he made 1&amp;nbsp;[[not out]] and in the second, 5&amp;nbsp;runs batting at number ten.  Despite this lack of success, he retained his spot in the team for the Second Test at [[The Oval]] where he failed to take a wicket.&lt;ref name=&quot;SecondTest&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/3/3623.html | title = England v Australia: Australia in England 1890 (2nd Test) | publisher = CricketArchive | accessdate = 2008-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was selected for the Third Test at [[Old Trafford Cricket Ground|Old Trafford]] but continuous rain saw the match abandoned without a ball being bowled.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wisden18903rdTest&quot;&gt;{{cite web | year = 1891 | url = http://content-www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/engine/match/64135.html| title = The Ashes – 3rd Test 1890 season: England v Australia| publisher = Cricinfo| accessdate = 2008-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Trumble played 28&amp;nbsp;first-class matches during the tour, scoring 288&amp;nbsp;runs at an average of 8.47 and took 52&amp;nbsp;wickets at an average of 21.75.&lt;ref name=&quot;1890batting&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Events/ENG/Australia_in_England_1890/f_Australians_Batting.html | title = First-class Batting and Fielding for Australians: Australia in England 1890 | publisher = CricketArchive | accessdate = 2008-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;1890bowling&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Events/ENG/Australia_in_England_1890/f_Australians_Bowling.html | title = First-class Bowling for Australians: Australia in England 1890 | publisher = CricketArchive | accessdate = 2008-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack]]'' wrote, &quot;Reports from Australia had led us to expect a great deal of&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;Trumble&quot; but his &quot;straightness and regular [[line and length|length]] [were] insufficient to compensate for an obvious lack of 'devil' and variety&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wisden1890&quot;&gt;{{cite web | year = 1891 | url = http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/154325.html | title = The Australians in England, 1890 | work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack - online archive | publisher = John Wisden &amp; Co. | accessdate = 2008-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trumble was not selected for the Australian team to play [[Henry Holroyd, 3rd Earl of Sheffield|Lord Sheffield]]'s touring English team in 1891–92.  He did not return to the Australian team until his selection in [[Australian cricket team in England in 1893|the squad to tour England in 1893]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Wisden1894&quot;&gt;{{cite web | year = 1894 | url = http://content-www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/150149.html | title = The Australians in England, 1893 | work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack - online archive | publisher = John Wisden &amp; Co. | accessdate = 2008-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Before the Test matches he took 14&amp;nbsp;wickets for 116&amp;nbsp;runs (14/116) against the [[Gentlemen v Players|Players]] followed by 12/84 against [[Kent County Cricket Club|Kent]] at [[Gravesend, Kent|Gravesend]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Players1894&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/3/3969.html | title = Players v Australians: Australia in England 1893 | publisher = CricketArchive | accessdate = 2008-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kent1894&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/3/3972.html | title = Kent v Australians: Australia in England 1893 | publisher = CricketArchive | accessdate = 2008-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He played in all three Test matches in 1893, taking 6&amp;nbsp;wickets at an average of 39.00.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tests1894&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Events/ENG/Australia_in_England_1893/t_Australia_Bowling.html | title = Test Bowling for Australia: Australia in England 1893 | publisher = CricketArchive | accessdate = 2008-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trumble scored 58&amp;nbsp;runs in the Tests with a highest score of 35 but had more success in the other matches, scoring 774&amp;nbsp;runs, including one [[century (cricket)|century]] in all first-class matches on tour.&lt;ref name=&quot;1893Testbatting&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Events/ENG/Australia_in_England_1893/t_Australia_Batting.html| title = Test Batting and Fielding for Australia: Australia in England 1893| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate = 2008-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;1893FCbatting&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Events/ENG/Australia_in_England_1893/f_Australians_Batting.html| title = First-class Batting and Fielding for Australia: Australia in England 1893| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate = 2008-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Wisden'' noted that &quot;An immense improvement on his form of three years before was shown by Hugh Trumble, who bowled consistently well all through the tour&quot; and &quot;...&amp;nbsp;the reports of Hugh Trumble's improvement in batting were amply borne out, his hitting in many matches being remarkably fine&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wisden1894&quot;/&gt;

When [[Andrew Stoddart]]'s [[English cricket team in Australia in 1894-95|English team]] visited Australia in 1894–95, Trumble played only one Test, the Second at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]]. In the first innings, England scored 75&amp;nbsp;runs with Trumble taking 3&amp;nbsp;wickets.  England fought back in their second innings, scoring 475&amp;nbsp;runs to win the Test by 94&amp;nbsp;runs; Trumble failed to take a wicket.&lt;ref name=&quot;9495series&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/4/4255.html| title = Australia v England: AE Stoddart's XI in Australia 1894/95 (2nd Test)| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate = 2008-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Established cricketer ===
Trumble was selected in the [[Australian cricket team in England in 1896|Australian team to tour England in 1896]], despite a poor domestic season in 1895–96 that saw his place in the touring squad seriously questioned by pundits.&lt;ref name=&quot;1896WCOTY&quot;&gt;{{cite web

''Wisden'' said of Trumble when listing him as one of its [[Wisden Cricketers of the Year|Cricketers of the Year]], &quot;...it was not until his third visit, during the past season, that Trumble convinced Englishmen he was entitled to rank among the great bowlers of Australia&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;1896WCOTY&quot;/&gt;  In that season, Trumble took 148&amp;nbsp;wickets at an average of 15.81.&lt;ref name=&quot;1896FCAverage&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Events/ENG/Australia_in_England_1896/f_Australians_Bowling.html|title = First-class Bowling for Australians: Australia in England 1896| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate = 2008-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was seen as Australia's leading bowler who &quot;was able to inspire [the English] batsmen with a feeling of apprehension&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;1896tour&quot;/&gt;  ''Wisden's'' summary of the 1896 Australian tour said of Trumble, &quot;His great strength lay in the combination of spin with extreme accuracy&quot; and &quot;he was on all wickets distinctly the best bowler on the [Australian] side&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;1896tour&quot;/&gt;

=== Hat-tricks and captaincy ===
At the age of 34, Trumble was chosen to [[captain (cricket)|captain]] the Australian team against England in 1901–02 when [[Joe Darling]] withdrew to manage his farm in Tasmania after the first three Tests.

Trumble's last cricketing [[Australian cricket team in England in 1902|tour of England was in 1902]], with Darling returning to captain the Australian team.

Trumble was tall and thin, {{convert|6|ft|4|in|cm|0}} in height. His long face featured prominent ears and a large nose, while his long arms and uncommonly long and strong fingers assisted his bowling.&lt;ref name=&quot;PollardTrumble&quot;&gt;Pollard (1988), pp. 1069–1071.&lt;/ref&gt;  The cricket writer [[Ray Robinson (cricket writer)|Ray Robinson]] said of Trumble: &quot;[[El Greco]], with his lengthening touch would have liked to draw Trumble.  Hugh's lantern shaped head set on a column of a neck would have given the Spaniard a halfway start.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Robinson&quot;/&gt;  English cricketer and author [[Plum Warner]] called him &quot;That great camel, Hughie Trumble.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;PollardTrumble&quot;/&gt;
[[Image:TrumbleinAction.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Trumble demonstrating his bowling action, using his height and long arms to advantage]]

When bowling, Trumble made the most of his height, bringing the ball over the full extent of his right arm.&lt;ref name=&quot;Obit&quot;&gt;{{cite web|year = 1939|url = http://content-www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/233709.html|title = Obituary: Hugh Trumble|work = [[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack]] – online archive|publisher = John Wisden &amp; Co.|accessdate = 2008-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His action was described by his team-mate and bowling partner, [[Monty Noble]], as &quot;sidelong and insinuating, with his neck craned like a gigantic bird&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robinson&quot;/&gt; He bowled [[off spin]]ners with an impeccable [[line and length|length]] at [[medium pace]] and was able to [[swing bowling|swing]] the [[new ball]].&lt;ref name=&quot;PollardTrumble&quot;/&gt;  He had a well-disguised slower ball, hoodwinking batsmen such as [[Stanley Jackson]], who said, &quot;You old devil. You get me [[Caught (cricket)|caught-and-bowled]] whenever you like but I'll pick that slow one sooner or later.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Robinson&quot;/&gt;  He preferred English pitches, saying he hardly saw one on which he could not get some turn and the temperate weather allowed him to bowl all day.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robinson&quot;/&gt;  In Australia, Trumble had to work harder for his wickets on firmer pitches, relying on his change of pace and consistent accuracy; he claimed he could land the ball on a saucer {{convert|17|m|yd|0}} away five times out of six.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robinson&quot;/&gt;  [[Johnnie Moyes]] named him as an &quot;immortal of the art&quot; who succeeded by &quot;attacking the batsman's strength&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;PollardTrumble&quot;/&gt;  [[W. G. Grace]] called him &quot;the best bowler Australia has sent us&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;  While Trumble was able to score 1,183&amp;nbsp;runs during the 1899 tour of England, the demands of bowling did not allow him to consistently score heavily.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robinson&quot;/&gt;  His long,  [[wikt:prehensile|prehensile]] fingers helped him make a reputation as a fine [[slip (cricket)|slips]] fieldsman and he was the first to take 20&amp;nbsp;catches in an Australian season.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robinson&quot;/&gt; English cricketer [[Johnny Douglas]] said, &quot;Trumble should not be allowed on the cricket field—his natural place would be up trees in the bush.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Robinson&quot;/&gt;  He practised slip fielding by catching a tennis ball thrown against a brick wall; he believed this practise trained him not to &quot;snatch&quot; at the ball but allow it to fall into his safe hands.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reese&quot;/&gt; 

Trumble was known for his cleverness on the field.  [[C. B. Fry]] said of him, &quot;He is the most long-headed, observant and acute judge of the game, a perfect master of the whole art of placing fieldsmen and changing bowlers.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;PollardTrumble&quot;/&gt;  On one occasion when captaining his state side, Victoria, he deliberately bowled two [[wide (cricket)|wide]]s that his fieldsmen allowed to roll to the [[boundary (cricket)|boundary]] to score four runs for his opponents. This was done in order to save his tired bowlers from having to bowl again immediately, as his opponents would have been required to [[follow-on]] (bat twice in a row), at the time compulsory.  When questioned by an onlooker about the dubious [[sportsmanship]] of the action, he replied, &quot;I had to do it, old chap, but I wonder what my father will think of it?&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Robinson&quot;/&gt;  Trumble was respected by his teammates and opponents; [[New Zealand]] cricketer, [[Dan Reese]], who played against and alongside Trumble said, &quot;His subtle humour, his fund of cricket stories, his kindness, and, above all, his judgment, made him a man of exceptional character.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Reese&quot;/&gt;

He was popular with team-mates and opponents alike, with a weakness for practical jokes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robinson&quot;/&gt;  On board a ship travelling to England, Trumble offered to coach unsuspecting fellow travellers in various deck sports such as [[quoits]].  Accepting Trumble's advice, they were made to contort themselves into a number of ludicrous positions to the amusement of his team-mates and other onlookers [[wikt:in the know|in the know]].  To prolong the joke, in his own games Trumble would adopt the same peculiar stance and method he advocated.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robinson&quot;/&gt;

He took 929&amp;nbsp;wickets, including 5&amp;nbsp;wickets in an innings on 69&amp;nbsp;occasions, and as a batsman, he made 5,395&amp;nbsp;runs with three [[century (cricket)|centuries]] and a highest score of 107.&lt;ref name=&quot;Profile&quot;/&gt;  For [[Melbourne Cricket Club]], he took just under 400&amp;nbsp;wickets and scored more than 3,000&amp;nbsp;runs; winning the club best bowling average on six occasions and the best batting average once.&lt;ref name=&quot;MCC&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last = Williams|first = Ken|year = 2000|url = http://www.mcc.org.au/content/document/00000131-src.pdf|title = For Club and Country|format = PDF|pages = 27–28.|publisher = Melbourne Cricket Club|accessdate = 2008-04-06|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080527221446/http://www.mcc.org.au/content/document/00000131-src.pdf |archivedate = 27 May 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trumble was particularly effective in England.  After taking 52&amp;nbsp;wickets on his first tour of England in 1890, his other four visits to England—in 1893, 1896, 1899 and 1902—saw him take over 100&amp;nbsp;wickets in first-class matches.&lt;ref name=&quot;MCC&quot;/&gt;  In 1899, he scored 1,183&amp;nbsp;runs making him one of only four Australians, with [[George Giffen]], [[Warwick Armstrong]] (both three times) and [[Jack Gregory (cricketer)|Jack Gregory]], to take over 100&amp;nbsp;wickets and make over 1,000&amp;nbsp;runs on a tour of England.&lt;ref name=&quot;MCC&quot;/&gt;    

The [[ICC player rankings]] have been applied retrospectively to cricket history and Trumble achieved the top ranking as a bowler. By June 1896, he was ranked fifth in the world and never again slipped lower; from 1899 until his retirement he was the first or second best bowler in the world according to the ratings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.lgiccrankings.com/test/bowling/player-display.php?id=798&amp;graph=ranking|title = Hugh Trumble Bowling Test Ranking Statistics|publisher = LG ICC Rankings|accessdate = 2008-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a batsman, Trumble's ranking peaked at twelfth in the world after the Third Test in Adelaide in 1901–02.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.lgiccrankings.com/test/batting/player-display.php?graph=ranking&amp;id=798|title = Hugh Trumble Batting Test Ranking Statistics|publisher = LG ICC Rankings|accessdate = 2008-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Trumble was the first player to take two [[Hat-trick (cricket)|hat-tricks]] in Test cricket.  Both hat-tricks were taken against England at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]], where Trumble played his club cricket.&lt;ref name=&quot;6thHattrick&quot;/&gt; Hat-tricks are extremely rare; in over 131&amp;nbsp;years of Test cricket to March 2008, there had only been [[Test cricket hat-tricks|37 Test hat-tricks]] and only [[Jimmy Matthews]] and [[Wasim Akram]] been able to repeat Trumble's feat of taking a second.&lt;ref name=&quot;6thHattrick&quot;/&gt;

Trumble joined the [[National Australia Bank|National Bank of Australasia]] in 1887 to begin a career in banking.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; While the bank often allowed him time to practice, his frequent absences with cricket meant his career progression was slow; after each of his five tours of England he returned to find junior bank officers promoted over him.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robinson&quot;/&gt;  Nevertheless, he was appointed [[accountant]] at the [[Richmond, Victoria|Richmond]] branch in 1903 and after his retirement from cricket in 1908, manager of the [[Kew, Victoria|Kew]] branch.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;

A loyal clubman, Trumble served on the committee of the [[Melbourne Cricket Club]] (MCC) from 1900–01 to 1910–11 and was made a life member in 1904.&lt;ref name=&quot;MCC&quot;/&gt; In 1911 he resigned from the bank to become MCC club secretary; a position he held for 27&amp;nbsp;years until his death.  In this role, he played a leading part in reconciling the club and the [[Cricket Victoria|Victorian Cricket Association]] after a period of some friction between the two bodies.&lt;ref name=&quot;DAB&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last = Searle|first = Percival|year = 1949|url = http://gutenberg.net.au/dictbiog/0-dict-biogT-V.html#trumble1|title = Trumble, Hugh (1867–1938)|work = Dictionary of Australian Biography|publisher = Angus and Robertson|accessdate = 2008-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was instrumental in attracting quality cricketers to the club including [[Bert Ironmonger]], whom Trumble saw play on a visit to [[Queensland]].&lt;ref name=&quot;PollardTrumble&quot;/&gt; During his term as secretary, the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] was expanded to a capacity of over 70,000&amp;nbsp;spectators.&lt;ref name=&quot;Perry&quot;/&gt;

Trumble was a prominent writer about and elder statesman of the game and was conspicuous in his support for journalists calling at any hour.&lt;ref name=&quot;PollardTrumble&quot;/&gt;  From time to time, Trumble acted as a [[selector (sport)|selector]] of the [[Victorian Bushrangers|Victorian cricket team]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Haigh&quot;&gt;Haigh, p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2001, Trumble was selected in the Melbourne Cricket Club [[Team of the Century]],&lt;ref name=&quot;TeamofTheCentury&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.mcc.org.au/default.asp?pg=sectionscricket&amp;articleid=789 | title = 2000–01 Cricket News - MCC Team of the Century | publisher = [[Melbourne Cricket Club]] | accessdate = 2008-04-17|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060821073655/http://www.mcc.org.au/default.asp?pg=sectionscricket&amp;articleid=789 |archivedate = 21 August 2006|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2004 he was inducted into the [[Australian Cricket Hall of Fame]] for his contribution to the sport in Australia.&lt;ref name=&quot;ACHOF&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.mcg.org.au/History/Cricket/Australian%20Cricket%20Hall%20of%20Fame/Inductees.aspx|title = Australian Cricket Hall of Fame: Inductees|publisher = [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]]|accessdate = 2008-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1899, aged 31, Trumble met and fell in love with Florence Christian, aged 19 from Queensland.  The couple were married in 1902, with the wedding timed to allow a honeymoon trip accompanying the Australian cricket tour of England.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robinson&quot;/&gt;  An injury to his thumb freed Trumble from cricket commitments for a while, to his new wife's delight.&lt;ref name=&quot;Perry&quot;/&gt; Together, the couple had eight children; six sons and two daughters.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; One son, [[Robert Trumble|Robert]], a renowned musician and writer, dedicated his first book, ''The Golden Age of Cricket'', to his father.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robert&quot;&gt;{{cite news | first = Anne | last = Thompson| title = A past master | url = http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/03/14/1079199093391.html?from=storyrhs | work = [[The Age]] | date = 2004-03-15|accessdate = 2008-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trumble died aged&amp;nbsp;71, from a [[heart attack]] in his home in the Melbourne eastern suburb of [[Hawthorn, Victoria|Hawthorn]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PollardTrumble&quot;/&gt;
