'''Orval Leroy Grove''' (August 29, 1919&amp;nbsp;– April 20, 1992) was an American [[pitcher]] in [[Major League Baseball]] who played for ten seasons in the [[American League]] with the [[Chicago White Sox]]. In 207 career games, Grove pitched 1,176 [[innings pitched|innings]] and posted a [[win (baseball)|win–loss record]] of 63–73, with 66 [[complete game]]s, 11 [[shutout]]s, and a 3.78 [[earned run average]] (ERA).

The only freshman on the [[Proviso East High School]] varsity baseball team, Grove's pitching ability attracted the attention of the White Sox. After signing with the team in 1937, Grove moved between the major leagues and [[minor league baseball|minor leagues]] for a few seasons until 1943, when he found a solid place in the White Sox's pitching rotation. Grove had a career-year in 1943, finishing the season with career-bests in ERA, wins, and complete games; in 1944, he made his only [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]] appearance.

Grove spent four more full seasons with the White Sox, and after pitching one game in 1949, was sent to the [[Sacramento Solons]] of the [[Pacific Coast League]]. After playing four seasons with them, he formally retired from professional baseball. After retirement, he worked with his uncle in a trucking business in Chicago while continuing to pitch at the [[semi-professional|semi-pro]] level. In 1992, Grove died at the age of 72.

==Early life==
Grove was born in [[West Mineral, Kansas|West Mineral]], Kansas, on August 29, 1919, and was raised in [[Maywood, Illinois|Maywood]], Illinois. By eighth grade, Grove developed a fondness for baseball and began pitching for the Proviso East High School baseball team.&lt;ref name=vaughan&gt;{{cite news|first=Irving|last=Vaughan|title=Knee-Patching Put Grove Into Pitching Groove|work=[[The Sporting News]]|page=5|date=September 9, 1943}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became the first freshman member of the varsity team in school history.&lt;ref name=proviso&gt;{{cite news|first=Miller|last=Hollingsworth|title=Minors Worth Watching: Orval Grove of Longview Cannibals|work=The Sporting News|date=August 18, 1938|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; During a high school pitching career of three years, Grove lost only two games and pitched a [[no-hitter]] and two one-hitters.&lt;ref name=proviso/&gt; Over the summer of 1937, Grove attracted the attention of Chicago White Sox talent scout Doug Minor, who requested that he &quot;come and workout with the Sox.&quot;&lt;ref name=vaughan/&gt; Later that year, Grove was signed by the White Sox for $2,500 and began his minor league career, foregoing his senior season of high school.&lt;ref name=proviso/&gt;

==Minor league career==
Grove began his career with the [[Dallas Steers]] of the [[Texas League]] at the start of the 1938 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dallas in the Spring – Tra, La!|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=November 14, 1937|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; He played with the Steers until management began to replace young players with veterans due to the team's struggling form and moved Grove to the [[Longview Cannibals]].&lt;ref name=proviso/&gt; As his first minor league season drew to a close, Grove planned on returning to Proviso High School to complete his education.&lt;ref name=proviso/&gt; At the end of the season, the [[St. Paul Saints#History|St. Paul Saints]] purchased Grove's contract to replenish their pitching staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Gordon|last=Gilmore|title=Saints Buy Hurler, Choose New Camp|work=The Sporting News|date=November 10, 1938|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the 1939 season had begun, Grove became part of the [[Oklahoma City Indians]] of the Texas League; St. Paul did not see much potential in him.&lt;ref name=vaughan/&gt; Grove played well enough over the course of the season to receive votes for Most Valuable Player, which ultimately went to [[Nick Cullop (outfielder)|Nick Cullop]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Veteran Shows Way to Youth in Texas Loop|work=The Sporting News|date=October 12, 1939|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1939, Grove had a peculiar game while pitching against the [[Tulsa Oilers (baseball)|Tulsa Oilers]]. Playing in a night game with virtually no light due to storms, Grove did not allow a hit during his time on the mound, but earned  the loss because he walked three men in a row, which allowed a run to score.&lt;ref name=vaughan/&gt; As the [[1940 Major League Baseball season|1940 season]] began, Grove became a part of the White Sox roster and began his Major League career.

==Transition to the majors==
During [[spring training]] in 1940, Hall of Fame pitcher [[Ted Lyons]] said that Grove would have a great career, stating, &quot;They'll never drive that sinker very far.&quot;&lt;ref name=james&gt;{{cite book|first=Bill|last=James|coauthors=Rob Neyer|title=The Neyer/James Guide to Pitchers|year=2004|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=0-7432-6158-5|page=226}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grove was an official part of the [[40-man roster]] as the 1940 season began (teams started rather than ended the season with 40 men at this time), but had not made an appearance after a month on the roster.&lt;ref name=cubs&gt;{{cite news|first=Ed|last=Burns|work=The Sporting News|title=Mortality on Bags Mortifying to Cubs|date=May 30, 1940|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The White Sox planned to use three rookie pitchers, including Grove, during the final week of May, as they had three [[doubleheader (baseball)|doubleheaders]] that week.&lt;ref name=cubs/&gt; Grove made his Major League debut on May 28, 1940.&lt;ref name=br&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/g/groveor01.shtml|title=Orval Grove Statistics|work=Baseball-Reference.com|publisher=Sports Reference, LLC|accessdate=May 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He pitched in two more games for the White Sox that season before being sent back to Oklahoma City. Grove finished 1940 with six innings of major league work over three games, allowing two [[earned run]]s.&lt;ref name=br/&gt; The highlight of Grove's 1940 season came on August 11 against the Oilers; he pitched a complete game that lasted 12 innings, winning 1–0 against [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Hall of Famer]] [[Dizzy Dean]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=John|last=Cronley|title=Okla. City Sells Skeets Dickey, Brother of Bill, to White Sox|work=The Sporting News|date=August 22, 1940|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grove finished the minor league season with nine wins and eight losses, but the team saw issues with his control, and as a result he spent most of the next season in the minor leagues.&lt;ref name=vaughan/&gt;

In 1941, Grove played two games for the White Sox, pitching seven innings and allowing eight runs during the two outings.&lt;ref name=br/&gt; He spent the start of the 1941 season at Oklahoma City, though on May 19 he was sent to the [[Shreveport Sports]] of the Texas League, where he spent the rest of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Vitter Makes Self Valuable to Sports|work=The Sporting News|date=May 22, 1941|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grove concluded the year at Oklahoma City with a 17–7 record, an improvement over the previous season. However, Grove received a knee injury late in the season, which he did not think much of at the time.&lt;ref name=vaughan/&gt; In October, Grove injured his other knee when he was involved in an automobile accident in Missouri.&lt;ref name=accident&gt;{{cite news|title=$310 Awarded Orval Grove in Accident Suit|work=Chicago Daily Tribune|date=January 28, 1945|page=A3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following season, Grove was provided an opportunity to be a [[starting pitcher]] for the White Sox. Over the course of the season, he started eight games and played in four more en route to a 4–6 record and a 5.16 ERA.&lt;ref name=br/&gt; In the middle of July, Dr. Philip Kruescher discovered that Grove had torn cartilage in his left knee, a result of the same injury which caused him problems for most of the season and the previous [[off-season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cubs Work Out After 13–2 Lacing|work=The Sporting News|page=10|date=April 15, 1943}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grove was scheduled for knee surgery, which necessitated two months of recovery, effectively ending his season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=White Sox Lose Orval Grove|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=July 16, 1942|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Issues with his knee drew concern both during and after the season. Dr. Kruescher stated that Grove had a &quot;1 in 100&quot; chance of playing again, but the surgery was a success, and by season's end Grove was able to test the knee and do light workouts.&lt;ref name=vaughan/&gt; Complications arose shortly thereafter as an [[abscess]] developed on the back of his knee, prompting another operation in December to correct the problem.&lt;ref name=vaughan/&gt;

==Prime years==
As the [[1943 Major League Baseball season|1943 season]] began, the White Sox held strong doubts about Grove's status as a pitcher. They were so doubtful of his recovery from knee surgery that Grove was signed to a $1 contract until he could prove that his playing ability was back on par with the abilities of the other White Sox pitchers.&lt;ref name=vaughan/&gt; After Grove proved himself in spring training, manager [[Jimmy Dykes]] gave him his first major test of the season against the [[New York Yankees]] in relief of [[Eddie Smith]].&lt;ref name=vaughan/&gt; He won the game in extra innings, and was placed in the starting rotation. In 1943, Grove had to deal with issues related to World War II and the selective service. He was originally classified as [[Selective Service System#Classifications|3-A]], meaning that registration was deferred due to hardship to dependents, but was ordered to take the selective service screening examination in Cleveland in mid-May.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Army Test for Orval Grove|work=The New York Times|page=S4|date=May 2, 1943}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the examination, Grove was classified as 4-F, making him ineligible for military service, which meant that he could continue his baseball career.

Grove took advantage of his place in Chicago's starting rotation by winning nine consecutive decisions to start his season and by not losing a game until a contest against the Yankees, which he lost as the result of a [[balk]].&lt;ref name=vaughan/&gt; At the time, Grove became the second member of the White Sox to win nine consecutive decisions to start a season. The first pitcher to win nine straight games for the team was [[Lefty Williams]] in 1917, and the only one to do it since Grove was [[LaMarr Hoyt]] in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chicago.whitesox.mlb.com/cws/history/season_records.jsp|title=White Sox Season Records|publisher=[[Major League Baseball]]|accessdate=November 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 8, 1943, Grove nearly became one of the few pitchers in baseball history to pitch a no-hitter. In a game against the Yankees, he was one out away from pitching a no-hitter when [[Joe Gordon]] came up to bat. Gordon hit a [[double (baseball)|double]] to left field that was fair by inches, ending Grove's closest bid for a Major League no-hitter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sutton|first=Keith|year=1983|title=With Two Out in the Ninth&amp;nbsp;— The Almost No-Hitters|journal=Baseball Research Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grove finished the season with career bests in ERA (2.75), wins (15), and complete games (18).&lt;ref name=br/&gt; He led the White Sox that season in ERA, wins, innings pitched, complete games, and strikeouts; at the time, Grove was the youngest pitcher on the team's staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/CHW/1943.shtml|title=1943 Chicago White Sox Statistics and Roster|publisher=Baseball-Reference|accessdate=November 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grove's personal life improved along with his career. On January 8, 1944, he married Catherine Sloan, having met her at a party thrown for the White Sox by her father, Francis Sloan, a year and a half earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Oscar|last=Ruhl|title=Purely Personal|work=The Sporting News|page=10|date=December 16, 1943}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grove started the [[1944 Major League Baseball season|1944 season]] with an interesting honor: he was assigned to the 4-F All-Star team, a group of 25 major league players who were the best of those exempt from military service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Tom|last=Swope|title=All-Star Squad of 25 4-F Players|work=The Sporting News|date=March 16, 1944|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grove was given the job of being the [[Opening Day]] starting pitcher for the White Sox. He pitched the first game of the season against the [[Cleveland Indians]] and their starting pitcher, [[Al Smith (left-handed pitcher)|Al Smith]], on April 19, 1944, and won 3–1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1944/VCHA01944.htm|title=The 1944 Chicago White Sox Game Log|publisher=[[Retrosheet]]|accessdate=November 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grove also managed to shut out the Yankees on May 18; it was the first time the Yankees had not scored a run in 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Edward|last=Burns|title=Champions Get Only 5 Hits Off Orval Grove|work=[[Chicago Daily Tribune]]|date=May 18, 1944|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; By mid-season, Grove had seven wins, six losses, five complete games, and a 3.40 ERA. Because of these statistics, he was selected to the [[American League]] All-Star team, his first and only career appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cardinals Lead in All-Star Selections With Six|work=The Sporting News|date=July 6, 1944|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five American League pitchers pitched in the All-Star Game on July 11, although Grove was one of the four on the roster who did not; therefore, his lone All-Star appearance was indeed only an appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/NLS/NLS194407110.shtml|title=Jul 11, 1944, All-Star Game Box Score and Play by Play|publisher=Baseball-Reference|accessdate=November 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the second half of the season, Grove performed well at [[Comiskey Park]], but struggled on the road, at one point losing five straight games despite good run support from the White Sox.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Ed|last=Burns|title=Nick's Knocks Spur Cub Hope After Hun Skid|work=The Sporting News|page=8|date=July 27, 1944}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grove finished the season with 14 wins, 15 losses, an ERA of 3.72, two shutouts, and a career best of nearly 235 innings pitched.&lt;ref name=br/&gt;

There was a sense of closure for Grove before the beginning of the [[1945 Major League Baseball season|1945 season]], as he was awarded $310 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|310|1945|r=0}}}} today) in damages for the auto accident in 1941.&lt;ref name=accident/&gt; He held out for a new contract in the off-season, and finally signed with the White Sox a couple weeks before the beginning of the season after becoming the last remaining holdout.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Ed|last=Burns|title=Big Four of Sox Sign and Big 5 of Cubs Shine|work=The Sporting News|date=April 5, 1945|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grove was the workhorse of the White Sox, leading the team in games pitched (33) and started (30), while remaining the youngest pitcher on the roster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/CHW/1945.shtml|title=1945 Chicago White Sox Statistics and Roster|publisher=Baseball-Reference|accessdate=November 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He finished the season with 217 pitched innings, a career best four shutouts, a 14–12 record, and a 3.44 ERA.&lt;ref name=br/&gt;

The [[1946 Major League Baseball season|1946 season]] saw Grove persist as a stable part of the White Sox pitching rotation. He pitched in 33 games during the season, second to [[closer (baseball)|closer]] [[Earl Caldwell]], and started in 26, second to [[Ed Lopat]]'s 29.&lt;ref name=br/&gt; His best outing of the season occurred on August 3 against the [[Minnesota Twins|Washington Senators]]. Grove pitched a complete game and threw to the minimum 27 batters, allowing three hits and a walk, all of which were negated by [[double play]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=White Sox 1, Nats 0|work=[[The Hartford Courant]]|page=C1|date=August 4, 1946}}&lt;/ref&gt; He finished the season with more losses than wins because he was eager to succeed and was trying too hard, and because of this the coaching staff planned to make Grove into &quot;as good a pitcher most of the time as he is some of the time&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Ed|last=Burns|title=Over Eagerness Handicaps Grove|work=The Sporting News|date=September 25, 1946|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the 1946 season, Grove had eight wins and 13 losses, a 3.02 ERA, 10 complete games, and a league-leading 10 [[wild pitch]]es.&lt;ref name=br/&gt;

==Later career==
During the off-season, while preparations were underway for the [[1947 Major League Baseball season|1947 season]], Grove was the subject of trade discussions. Most notably, White Sox manager Ted Lyons and Cleveland Indians president [[Bill Veeck]] discussed trading him for Indians pitcher [[Steve Gromek]], but the deal was nixed when they could not come to an agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lake Plays All Games|work=The Sporting News|date=October 16, 1946|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the season began, Grove remained part of the rotation, which was led by Lopat and included [[Joe Haynes (baseball)|Joe Haynes]] and [[Frank Papish]]. While Grove started off the season well, he struggled through the middle of the year, going from May 18 to August 2 without winning a game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Ed|last=Burns|title=Papish Shows Relish for Sox Starting Roles|work=The Sporting News|date=August 13, 1947|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, he was benched, and finished the season with 19 starts in 25 pitching appearances. For the first time, Grove finished a full season with an ERA above 4.00. He ended the season with six wins, eight losses, a 4.44 ERA, and six complete games.&lt;ref name=br/&gt; Grove spent the off-season working in the men's furnishings department of [[Henry C. Lytton]]'s department store in Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Major League Flashes|work=The Sporting News|date=November 26, 1947|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[1948 Major League Baseball season|1948 season]], the White Sox faced difficult decisions regarding their pitching staff and starting rotation. In the midst of Caldwell's departure and Papish's absence for most of the preseason, Grove remained a starter heading into the season, having pitched decently during spring training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Ed|last=Burns|title=Haynes to Pitch Sox Opener&amp;nbsp;— But Who'll Be Next Starter?|work=The Sporting News|date=April 14, 1948|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his final exhibition matchup of the season against [[Johnny Schmitz]], Grove pitched the full nine innings and the White Sox defeated the [[Chicago Cubs]] 1–0, making Grove the only White Sox pitcher to throw a complete game during the preseason.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Chicago City Set Finishes in Draw|work=The Sporting News|date=April 28, 1948|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of May, Grove was the lone White Sox pitcher with a complete game through the first several weeks of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Ed|last=Burns|title=Sox at Least Have One Man of Distinction|work=The Sporting News|date=May 26, 1948|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Grove eventually lost his starting job, and by the end of the season, he had two wins, 10 losses, a 6.16 ERA, and had started 11 games out of 32 total pitching appearances.&lt;ref name=br/&gt;

As the [[1949 Major League Baseball season|1949 season]] began, Grove was again the subject of trade rumors. The [[Detroit Tigers]] agreed to trade an outfielder, presumably [[Don Lund]] or [[Jimmy Outlaw]], in exchange for Grove, although the Tigers denied the existence of such a deal, stating &quot;We need pitching, but I don't think Grove would help us.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rumored Deal for Grove Brings Denial From Rolfe|work=The Sporting News|date=May 4, 1949|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grove pitched one game during the season on April 27, 1949, allowing four runs in two-thirds of an inning.&lt;ref name=br/&gt; In his one appearance against the Indians, he hit [[Lou Boudreau]] with a pitch, which prompted concern until X-rays revealed Boudreau's left elbow was only bruised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Ed|last=McAuley|title=Boudreau Throws Switch on Main-Line Outfielders|work=The Sporting News|date=May 4, 1949|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly afterward, Grove was demoted to the Sacramento Solons of the Pacific Coast League, having pitched his final major league game. During his inaugural season at Sacramento, he was part of a pitching quartet that included [[Ken Holcombe]], [[Bob Gillespie]], and [[Frank Dasso]], and was declared by ''Sporting News'' sportswriter John B. Old as &quot;the best any Coast League club ever had.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=John B.|last=Old|title=Scouts Eye Cookie's Jarful of Prospects|work=The Sporting News|date=August 31, 1949|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the course of the next three seasons, Grove continued to pitch for the Solons. He was one of the workhorses of the 1950 squad, finishing the season with 17 victories.&lt;ref name=pcl&gt;{{cite news|title=Sacramento – Pacific Coast League|work=The Sporting News|date=September 12, 1951|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His contract with the Solons promised him part of the purchase price if he was sold to the majors. When this did not occur, he considered quitting baseball and devoting himself full time to his uncle's trucking business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Orval Grove Threatens to Quit|work=The Sporting News|date=January 24, 1951|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Grove continued to play, and pitched 159 innings in 1951, compiling an 8–9 record.&lt;ref name=pcl/&gt; There was talk of his retiring in the off-season; however, Grove ended up playing part of the 1952 season, making his season debut on June 10 and playing for the rest of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sacramento – Pacific Coast League|work=The Sporting News|date=June 25, 1952|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the season ended, Grove was traded to the [[Portland Beavers]], and refused to report, choosing instead to pitch at the semi-pro level. Grove stated, &quot;I'm now pitching for Earl Smith Motors Pontiac sales service,&quot; signaling the end of his professional baseball career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=American Association&amp;nbsp;— Sacramento|work=The Sporting News|date=April 29, 1953|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
After his retirement from baseball, Grove continued to work with his uncle. His legacy lived on in his nephew, Wayne Grove. While playing for the Bellwood Lions of the Chicago Little League, Wayne pitched a no-hitter and struck out 15, and narrowly missed a perfect game when a runner got on base with two outs in the bottom of the ninth inning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Caught on the Fly|work=The Sporting News|date=July 28, 1953|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite an unimpressive Major League career, Grove earned a few votes for induction into the Hall of Fame, receiving five votes in the [[Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1958|1958 balloting]] (1.9% of the required votes needed) and seven in the [[Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1960|1960 balloting]] (2.6% of the required votes needed).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://baseballhall.org/hall-famers/bbwaa-voting/player?player=Grove%2C++Orval|title=BBWAA Results by Player|publisher=[[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum]]|accessdate=December 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grove had four children and four grandchildren, and later was the co-owner of a car wash in [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]], California for 20 years.&lt;ref name=digest&gt;{{cite journal|last=DuVall|first=Bob|year=1973|month=November|title=Whatever Became Of ?|journal=[[Baseball Digest]]|volume=32|issue=11|page=84|url=http://books.google.com/?id=RzIDAAAAMBAJ|issn=0005-609X|accessdate=December 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became close friends with Joe Gordon, the player who broke up Grove's no-hitter, after moving to Sacramento.&lt;ref name=digest/&gt; Grove died in [[Carmichael, California|Carmichael]], California on April 20, 1992, and is buried alongside his wife, Catherine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Orval Grove is Dead at 72|work=[[The Sacramento Bee]]|date=April 22, 1992|page=E5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
