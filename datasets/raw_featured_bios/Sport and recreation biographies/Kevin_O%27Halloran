'''Kevin O'Halloran''' (3 March 1937&amp;nbsp;– 5 July 1976) was an Australian [[freestyle swimming|freestyle]] swimmer of the 1950s who won a gold medal in the 4&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;200&amp;nbsp;m freestyle relay at the [[1956 Summer Olympics]] in [[Melbourne]]. The first Western Australian to win Olympic gold, O'Halloran learnt to swim in his home town of [[Katanning]]. He moved to [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] to attend secondary schooling at [[Guildford Grammar School]], where he became more committed to swimming. Competitive swimming was not well developed in Western Australia: races were held in muddy river pools; hence, in late 1955, O'Halloran moved to the east coast to support his attempt to qualify for the Olympics. His new coach, [[Frank Guthrie (Australia)|Frank Guthrie]], overhauled his training regimen and within a year O'Halloran had reduced his times by approximately 10%. He gained Olympic selection in the relay and the 400&amp;nbsp;m freestyle. O'Halloran led off the Australian quartet on the way to a new [[List of world records in swimming|world record]], before placing sixth in the 400&amp;nbsp;m. Thereafter, O'Halloran's career was beset by ear problems, and he retired in 1958 after failing to qualify for the [[1958 British Empire and Commonwealth Games]]. In 1976, O'Halloran died after tripping and accidentally shooting himself.

==Early years==
Born in [[Katanning]],&lt;ref name=&quot;bio&quot;/&gt; O'Halloran grew up on his family's {{convert|9000|acre|km2|sing=on}} sheep property at [[Kojonup]]—{{convert|40|km|mi|abbr=on}} to the west of his birthplace—on a property established by his grandfather in 1900. He had two brothers and a sister. After his father enlisted during the [[Second World War]], his mother could no longer run the farm and raise the children by herself, so the family moved to Katanning for seven years.&lt;ref name=&quot;h139&quot;&gt;Howell, p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt;

Katanning was one of the few country towns in Western Australia that had a public swimming pool. Along with his siblings, O'Halloran learned to swim there, often defeating local boys who were four years his senior. At the age of eight, he was taught to swim competitively by his teacher at Katanning State Primary School, who was an age group champion in her youth. The boom in wool prices at the time of the [[Korean War]] inflated his family's income, allowing them to send O'Halloran to [[Guildford Grammar School]] in [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]],&lt;ref name=&quot;h139&quot;/&gt; the state's capital city. At the age of 14, he won five events in the school championships, and led the school to its first state championship in 29 years. He also competed for his school in [[Australian rules football]] and [[sport rowing|rowing]].&lt;ref name=&quot;h139&quot;/&gt;

O'Halloran attracted the attention of the leading Western Australian coach Don Gravenall, but his schoolwork limited him to a few weeks of intense training over Christmas. In 1952, at the age of 15, O'Halloran began to make his mark at the state level. He played a major role in Guildford's win at the interschool championships, placing second in the individual points tally. He won the 100&amp;nbsp;m freestyle, 50&amp;nbsp;m breaststroke and 400&amp;nbsp;m freestyle.&lt;ref name=&quot;h139&quot;/&gt;

Competitive swimming was slow to develop in Western Australia and O'Halloran's state debut came in 1952, only the second time the Western Australian Championships had been held. He won the junior 110&amp;nbsp;yd freestyle and [[butterfly swimming|butterfly]] and the 220&amp;nbsp;yd freestyle and was second in the open 110&amp;nbsp;yd freestyle, in a muddy pool on the [[Swan River (Western Australia)|Swan River]] in the Perth suburb of [[Crawley, Western Australia|Crawley]]. The arena was such that the bottom could not be seen and [[jellyfish]] lurked in the area,&lt;ref name=&quot;h140&quot;/&gt; sometimes climbing onto the swimmers' bodies. When O'Halloran returned to his home, he often trained in a muddy waterhole.&lt;ref name=&quot;h140&quot;&gt;Howell, p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Swimming career==
In 1953, O'Halloran placed second in the 110&amp;nbsp;yd and 440&amp;nbsp;yd freestyle events at the Western Australian Championships in the open division and won the 110&amp;nbsp;yd breaststroke and the 110 and 220&amp;nbsp;yd freestyle in the junior division. In the process, he cut six seconds from the state record in the 440&amp;nbsp;yd event. He was selected for the Western Australian team for the Australian Championships, but his parents and headmaster decided that his schooling was more important, much to Gravenall's chagrin. In 1954, O'Halloran was the state champion in the 110&amp;nbsp;yd and 220&amp;nbsp;yd freestyle, and in 1955 he added the 440&amp;nbsp;yd individual [[medley swimming|medley]] title to the successful defence of his freestyle crowns. In his final year at Guildford, O'Halloran was the School Captain, led the swimming and shooting team, and was a member of the rowing eights in the [[Head of the River (Western Australia)|Head of the River]]. O'Halloran made his national debut at the 1955 Australian Championships in [[Adelaide]]; he finished fifth in the 110&amp;nbsp;yd freestyle behind future Olympians [[Jon Henricks]] and [[John Devitt]].&lt;ref name=&quot;h140&quot;/&gt;

Upon the recommendation of his parents, O'Halloran moved to Sydney in late 1955 to train with [[Frank Guthrie]] in an attempt to qualify for the [[1956 Summer Olympics]] in [[Melbourne]], Australia.&lt;ref name=&quot;a&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;g453&quot;/&gt; O'Halloran boarded with a host family and worked in a wool store to pay his expenses. O'Halloran's initiation into Guthrie's training program was difficult. After seeing O'Halloran's freestyle technique for the first time, Guthrie asked him &quot;Can you swim any other stroke? If you are going to swim for me you'll have to learn all over again.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;h140&quot;/&gt; O'Halloran refined his style and increased his workload to around 10&amp;nbsp;km a day, something that was normal for competitive swimmers in the eastern states, but uncommon in Western Australia.&lt;ref name=&quot;h140&quot;/&gt; In one month, he cut 17&amp;nbsp;s off his personal best time in the 440&amp;nbsp;yd freestyle, reducing it to 4&amp;nbsp;min 55&amp;nbsp;s. At the 1956 New South Wales Championships, he finished third in the 220&amp;nbsp;yd freestyle behind [[Gary Chapman (swimmer)|Gary Chapman]] and Devitt; his time of 2&amp;nbsp;min 12.6&amp;nbsp;s was 10&amp;nbsp;s faster than the times he had recorded in Western Australia. He came fourth in both the 110&amp;nbsp;yd and 440&amp;nbsp;yd; his time in the latter event was more than 30&amp;nbsp;s faster than his best time in Western Australia, and in the former event he breached the 60&amp;nbsp;s barrier for the first time. At the Australian Championships, he came third in the 440&amp;nbsp;yd freestyle in a time of 4&amp;nbsp;min 37.8&amp;nbsp;s behind [[Murray Rose]] and Murray Garretty. He did this despite suffering from ear trouble, making him the fifth fastest swimmer in the world for the calendar year, which earned him an individual berth in the 400&amp;nbsp;m event at the Olympics.&lt;ref name=&quot;h141&quot;&gt;Howell, p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt; O'Halloran came fourth in the 220&amp;nbsp;yd in a time of 2&amp;nbsp;min 9.2&amp;nbsp;s to earn a berth on the 4&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;200&amp;nbsp;m freestyle relay squad. With Rose, Henricks and Chapman regarded as certain selections for the final quartet, O'Halloran was expected to battle for the fourth relay position. At the end of the trials, Guthrie claimed that O'Halloran was &quot;the find of the recently held Australian Championships and the future swimmer for Australia. I am confident that we did not see Kevin's best times this season.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;h141&quot;/&gt;

==1956 Melbourne Olympics==

&lt;!-- [[Image:Melbourne olmpic pool (lexus centre).jpg|The 1956 Olympic pool|thumb]] --&gt;
Having arrived in Melbourne, O'Halloran was rested—along with Rose and Henricks—in the heats of the relay.&lt;ref name=&quot;h141&quot;/&gt; Devitt, Chapman, [[Graham Hamilton]] and Garretty finished third in their heat behind Great Britain and the [[Soviet Union]], and qualified fifth fastest behind Japan and the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;h138&quot;&gt;Howell, p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt; Australia led from the start and reached the midpoint of the race with a lead of 4.5&amp;nbsp;s. Hamilton swam a very slow third leg of 2&amp;nbsp;min 15.4&amp;nbsp;s and conceded 8.8&amp;nbsp;s to the British.&lt;ref name=&quot;relay&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/summer/1956/SWI/mens-4-x-200-metres-freestyle-relay.html |title=Swimming at the 1956 Melbourne Summer Games:Men's 4 × 200 meters Freestyle Relay |publisher=Sports Reference |accessdate=2008-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Australia's final quartet was much stronger, with Rose winning the 400&amp;nbsp;m freestyle, and Henricks and Devitt winning the gold and silver medals respectively in the 100&amp;nbsp;m freestyle.&lt;ref name=&quot;h139&quot;/&gt; Devitt had forced his way into the team with his heat swim of 2&amp;nbsp;min 7.5&amp;nbsp;s, which was the second fastest among all of the swimmers in the heats.&lt;ref name=&quot;relay&quot;/&gt; With four of the five fastest individual swimmers in the calendar year for the event,&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt; Australia was heavily favoured to win the relay; ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' predicted a world record and a victory margin of around 14 metres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1128519/index.htm |title=The Host Is Best |work=[[Sports Illustrated]] |date=19 November 1956 |accessdate=2008-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

O'Halloran's inclusion at the expense of Chapman was the subject of controversy, because Chapman had won bronze in the 100&amp;nbsp;m event and was the national 220&amp;nbsp;yd freestyle champion.&lt;ref name=&quot;h139&quot;/&gt; O'Halloran's selection also broke up the team of Devitt, Rose, Chapman and Henricks, which had won the relay for New South Wales at the Australian Championships.&lt;ref name=&quot;a&quot;/&gt; O'Halloran led off and put Australia in the lead with an Olympic record time of 2&amp;nbsp;min 6.8&amp;nbsp;s,&lt;ref name=&quot;bio&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/oh/kevin-ohalloran-1.html |title=Kevin O'Halloran |publisher=Sports Reference |accessdate=2008-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; opening a gap of 0.7&amp;nbsp;s over the Soviet Union and 1.2&amp;nbsp;s over the United States. The fourth-placed Italians were already a full three seconds in arrears. Australia never relinquished the lead and steadily increased it, as Devitt, Rose and Henricks set the three fastest splits in the race, quicker than all the non-Australian swimmers. O'Halloran's split was the fifth fastest in the race; the Soviet anchor swimmer was the only non-Australian to swim faster, and only by 0.1&amp;nbsp;s despite having the benefit of a flying start. This resulted in Australia winning gold in a world record time of 8&amp;nbsp;min 23.6&amp;nbsp;s, almost eight seconds ahead of the second-place Americans and 13 ahead of the Soviets.&lt;ref name=&quot;h139&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;relay&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;gord&quot;&gt;Gordon, p. 218.&lt;/ref&gt; The win made O'Halloran the first Western Australian to win any Olympic medal.&lt;ref name=&quot;h141&quot;/&gt;

In his only individual event, O'Halloran qualified for the 400&amp;nbsp;m final, having won his heat in a time of 4&amp;nbsp;min 36.8&amp;nbsp;s,&lt;ref name=&quot;gord&quot;/&gt; 0.5&amp;nbsp;s ahead of Japan's [[Koji Nonoshita]]. However, his heat was relatively slow, meaning that he was the sixth fastest qualifier.&lt;ref name=&quot;400free&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/summer/1956/SWI/mens-400-metres-freestyle.html |title=Swimming at the 1956 Melbourne Summer Games:Men's 400 metres Freestyle |publisher=Sports Reference |accessdate=2008-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Swimming from lane seven, O'Halloran cut almost 4&amp;nbsp;s off his personal best to lose the bronze medal to the United States' [[George Breen]] by 0.4&amp;nbsp;s, in a race won by Rose.&lt;ref name=&quot;a&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, p. 489.&lt;/ref&gt; O'Halloran reduced Breen's margin by 1.3&amp;nbsp;s in the last 100&amp;nbsp;m, but it was not enough as he finished in a time of 4&amp;nbsp;min 32.9&amp;nbsp;s.&lt;ref name=&quot;h141&quot;/&gt; O'Halloran returned to Perth after the Olympics to be welcomed by a motorcade and a civic reception. He was named as one of the five Western Australian Sportspeople of the Year in recognition of his winning performance. Despite his achievements, the state government ignored calls for Western Australia to build an Olympic standard swimming pool, until constructing one for the [[1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Games]] in Perth.&lt;ref name=&quot;h141&quot;/&gt;

==Later years==
In 1958, O'Halloran's parents traveled across the continent to watch him swim at the Australian Championships in Sydney, but a recurring ear infection hindered his performances. He missed selection for the [[1958 British Empire and Commonwealth Games]] in [[Cardiff]] and retired after the long car journey back across the [[Nullarbor]]. Upon arriving in Kojonup, O'Halloran was reported to have said, &quot;I've had enough&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;h141&quot;/&gt; O'Halloran then worked full-time on the family property.&lt;ref name=&quot;a&quot;/&gt;

In 1976, his body was discovered next to a rifle, near a fence on the property; he had tripped as he climbed through the fence, and accidentally shot himself.&lt;ref name=&quot;bio&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;a&quot;&gt;Andrews, pp. 328–329.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;g453&quot;&gt;Gordon, p. 453.&lt;/ref&gt; O'Halloran had never married. The 50&amp;nbsp;m pool at Kojonup was named the Kevin O'Halloran Memorial Pool in his honour,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shire of Kojonup—Swimming Pool |url=http://www.kojonup.wa.gov.au/community_facilities/swimmingpool |publisher=Shire of Kojonup |accessdate=2008-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he was posthumously inducted into the Western Australian Hall of Champions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WA Hall of Champions |url=http://www.wais.org.au/other/wais/hallofchampions.asp |publisher=[[Western Australian Institute of Sport]] |accessdate=2008-10-21| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080719013609/http://www.wais.org.au/other/wais/hallofchampions.asp| archivedate = 19 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
