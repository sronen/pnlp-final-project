'''Arthur Howey''' &quot;'''Art'''&quot; '''Ross''' (January 13, 1886 – August 5, 1964) was a Canadian [[ice hockey]] [[Defenceman (ice hockey)|defenceman]] and [[corporate officer|executive]] from 1905 until 1954. Regarded as one of the best defenders of his era by his peers, he was one of the first to skate with the puck up the ice rather than pass it to a forward. He was on [[Stanley Cup]] championship teams twice in a playing career that lasted thirteen seasons; in [[1907 ECAHA season#Stanley Cup challenges|January 1907]] with the [[Kenora Thistles]] and [[1908 ECAHA season#Stanley Cup challenges|1908]] with the [[Montreal Wanderers]]. Like other players of the time, Ross played for several different teams and leagues, and is most notable for his time with the Wanderers while they were members of the [[National Hockey Association]] (NHA) and its successor, the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL). In 1911 he led one of the first organized player strikes over increased pay. When the Wanderers' home arena burned down in January 1918, the team ceased operations and Ross retired as a player.

After several years as an [[on-ice official]], he was named head coach of the [[Hamilton Tigers (ice hockey)|Hamilton Tigers]] for one season. When the [[Boston Bruins]] were formed in 1924, Ross was hired as the first coach and general manager of the team. He would go on to coach the team on four separate occasions until 1945 and stayed as general manager until his retirement in 1954. Ross helped the Bruins finish first place in the league ten times and to win the Stanley Cup three times; Ross personally coached the team to one of those victories. After being hired by the Bruins, Ross, along with his wife and two sons, moved to a suburb of Boston, and became an American citizen in 1938. He died near Boston in 1964.

Outside of his association with the Bruins, Ross also helped to improve the game. He created a style of [[Puck (sports)|hockey puck]] still used today, and advocated an improved style of goal nets, a change that lasted forty years. In 1947 Ross donated the [[Art Ross Trophy]], awarded to the leading scorer of the NHL regular season. Ross was inducted into the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]] in 1949.&lt;ref name=&quot;1949-ssp&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;1949-oc&quot;/&gt;

==Early life==
Ross was born January 13, 1886, in [[Naughton, Ontario]]. His father, Thomas B. Ross, was the head of a [[Hudson's Bay Company]] trading post in the area. The twelfth of thirteen children, Ross grew up speaking both English and [[Ojibwe language|Ojibwe]], a [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|native Canadian]] language.&lt;ref name=&quot;McKinley 38&quot;/&gt; &lt;!-- He first learned to skate as a child on [[Whitefish Bay]], part of [[Lake Superior]], using blades clamped onto his shoes. | Dubious, see talkpage --Maxim --&gt; Ross moved to [[Montreal]] in 1902 to play in organized hockey leagues, living in the affluent [[Westmount]] district. He played high school and junior hockey with [[Lester Patrick|Lester]] and [[Frank Patrick (ice hockey)|Frank Patrick]], both of whom were later inducted into the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Weir 125&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Weir|Chapman|Weir|1999|p=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McKinley|2009|p=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Goyens 14&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Goyens|Orr|2000|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ross and Lester had a financially successful [[ticket resale]] business at the [[Montreal Arena]], buying tickets for thirty-five cents and selling them for up to a dollar.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McKinley|2000|p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Playing career==
===1905–09===
[[Image:KenoraThistles1907January.jpg|thumb|The Kenora Thistles posing for a photo with the Stanley Cup in 1907. Ross is in the front row, far right.]]
The best hockey players on their high school team, Ross and the Patrick brothers were invited to play occasional games for local league teams in Montreal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goyens 14&quot;/&gt; Ross first played in an organized league in 1905, joining Montreal Westmount of the [[Canadian Amateur Hockey League]] (CAHL), the top amateur league in Canada. He scored ten goals in eight games during the [[1905 CAHL season|season]]. His opponents regarded him as one of the best rushing defencemen. Most defenders at the time either shot the puck down the ice or passed to a forward; in contrast, Ross skated up the ice, taking the puck into the offensive zone.{{Sfn|Hockey Hall of Fame|2010}} Later that year, wishing to pursue a career in banking, he moved to [[Brandon, Manitoba]], where he joined the Brandon Elks of the [[Manitoba Hockey Association|Manitoba Hockey League]], the senior league in the province. In 1906, his first season, he scored six goals in seven games while he recorded six goals in ten games in 1906. Around this time, the [[Kenora Thistles]], the Manitoba League champions, wanted to strengthen their team for the [[Stanley Cup]] challenge against the [[Montreal Wanderers]] in Montreal during [[1907 ECAHA season#Wanderers vs. Kenora at Montreal|January 1907]]. They paid Ross [[Canadian dollar|$]]1,000 to play both matches, a common practice at the time, and the Thistles won the Cup. While failing to score, Ross started many plays and proved an important part of the team. Although he played for the opposing team, he received a good reception from the Montreal crowd.{{Sfn|Hockey Hall of Fame|2010}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Diamond 1964&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Diamond|2002|p=1964}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two teams played for the Cup again in March, and without Ross and other temporary players, the Thistles lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McKinley|2009|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following year Ross moved back to Montreal. He joined the Wanderers, the team he had helped to defeat, who played in the [[Eastern Canada Amateur Hockey Association]] (ECAHA), the successor league to the CAHL as the premier league in the country. He scored eight goals in ten games over the two month season that lasted from January to March. He helped the team to finish first in the ECAHA and retain the Cup in 1908 with challenges from [[Ottawa Victorias|Ottawa]], [[Winnipeg Maple Leafs|Winnipeg]] and [[Toronto (OPHL)|Toronto]].{{Sfn|Hockey Hall of Fame|2010}} The Wanderers were Cup champions throughout these challenges, so Ross became the second player to win the Cup with different teams in consecutive years, after [[Jack Marshall (ice hockey)|Jack Marshall]] in 1901 and 1902.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Podnieks|2004|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1908, he participated in the first [[all-star game]] in sports history, a benefit for the family of former Wanderer defender [[Hod Stuart]], who died the previous summer.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Podnieks|2000|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from his time with the Wanderers, Ross repeated his practice of playing for other teams who paid for his services in important matches.&lt;ref name=&quot;Diamond 1964&quot;/&gt; For the [[1909 ECAHA season|1909 season]] Ross demanded a salary of $1,600. Although he settled for $1,200, the average salary of hockey players at the time was $600. Ross received a cash bonus of $400 to play in a Stanley Cup challenge against a team from Edmonton in December 1908, in which the Wanderers won the two-game, total-goal series 13–10. He finished the season with two goals in nine games.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goyens|Orr|2000|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1909–18===
A new league, the [[Canadian Hockey Association (1909–1910)|Canadian Hockey Association]], was formed late in 1909. One of the teams, the All-Montreal Hockey Club, hired Ross as a playing-manager, but the league lasted just a few weeks in 1910 before disbanding. Ross, who scored four goals in four games in the CHA, then signed with the [[Haileybury Comets]] of the [[National Hockey Association]] (NHA), another newly formed league and the successor to the ECAHA as highest level in Canada. He received $2,700 to play in the [[1910 NHA season|1910 season]], which lasted from January to March, playing twelve games for the team and finishing with six goals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Diamond 1964&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McKinley|2009|p=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the following season, the NHA imposed a [[salary cap]] of $5,000 per team. The players, including Ross, were unhappy as this would result in a pay decrease, and began looking to form their own league without a cap. Ross wrote to the ''Montreal Herald'', stating &quot;all the players want is a fair deal ... The players are not trying to bulldoze the NHA, but we want to know where we get off at.&quot; The plans were abandoned when they realized all the suitable arenas would be unavailable as they were owned or leased by the NHA.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McKinley|2009|pp=62–63}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ross scored four goals in eleven games with the Wanderers, who finished fourth in the five team league. During a match against the [[Quebec Bulldogs]] on February 25, 1911, Ross knocked out [[Eddie Oatman]] in a fight, provoking a massive brawl between the two teams, which the police had to break up. The fight helped to increase the reputation Ross had as a tough player unwilling to back down from any opponent.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hughes 23&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Hughes|Fischler|Romain|Duplacey|2003|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[1912–13 NHA season|following season]] Ross had eleven goals in nineteen games as the Wanderers improved to second in the league.{{Sfn|Hockey Hall of Fame Stats|2010}}

[[Image:Ottawa Senators, 1914-1915.jpg|thumb|right|The Ottawa Senators during the [[1914–15 NHA season]]. Ross is in the back row, fourth from left.]]
Prior to the [[1913–14 NHA season]], Ross refused to sign a contract for the Wanderers, requesting a salary increase. As one of the top players on the team, the Wanderers agreed to his demands of $1,500 for the forthcoming season, in which he finished with four goals and nine points in eighteen games.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weir|Chapman|Weir|1999|p=91}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[1914–15 NHA season|next season]] Ross, again concerned with his salary, began negotiating with other players in the NHA to leave their teams and form a new league that would offer higher wages. These actions resulted in his suspension in November 1914 by [[Emmett Quinn]], president of the NHA.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weir 92&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Weir|Chapman|Weir|1999|p=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ross responded by declaring himself a free agent and claiming his contract with the Wanderers was no longer valid. Consequently, although having no technical power to do so, Quinn suspended Ross from all organized hockey.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weir 92&quot;/&gt; The proposed new league failed to materialize and Ross applied for reinstatement to the NHA, which was granted at a meeting of the team owners on December 18, 1914.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weir 92-93&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Weir|Chapman|Weir|1999|pp=92–93}}&lt;/ref&gt; The owners realized if they suspended Ross, they would also have to suspend all those he signed, hurting the league.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kitchen|2008|p=180}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Ross's actions led to his release by the Wanderers. At first he trained with the [[Montreal Canadiens]], then joined the [[Ottawa Senators (original)|Ottawa Senators]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Weir 92-93&quot;/&gt;

At the conclusion of the 1914–15 season, the Senators and Wanderers finished with identical records of fourteen wins and six losses. A two game, total goal series was played to determine the NHA league champion who would contest the Stanley Cup with the [[Pacific Coast Hockey Association]] winner, the [[Vancouver Millionaires]]. Ross, who finished with three goals in sixteen games in the season, scored one goal in the first match against the Wanderers, a Senators 4–0 victory, and though Ottawa lost the second game 1–0, they won the series, 4–1.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weir|Chapman|Weir|1999|p=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; To help the Senators stop the Wanderers, who were known for their speed, Ross created a new system of defence. Termed &quot;kitty bar the door&quot;, it required three defenders to align themselves across the ice 30 feet in front of the goaltender to stop offensive rushes.&lt;ref name=&quot;McKinley 38&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|McKinley|1993|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; This style of defence would later be used in a modified version known as the [[neutral zone trap]], later used widely to stop opposition offensive chances.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weir 125&quot;/&gt;

The following year Ross, who had eight goals and eight assists in twenty-one games, was the second highest paid player on the team; his salary of $1,400 was $100 less than [[Frank Nighbor]] made. Even so, Ross left the team in 1916, returning to Montreal in order to look after his sporting-goods store, and rejoining the Wanderers. He scored six goals and had two assists in sixteen games for the team.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kitchen 192&quot;/&gt; The Wanderers, along with the Montreal Canadiens, [[Toronto Arenas]], Quebec Bulldogs and Ottawa Senators dissolved the NHA and founded the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) in November 1917. Ross became coach of the Wanderers, but a fire on January 2, 1918, destroyed their home, the Montreal Arena, and forced them to fold after four games. However, the NHL insisted the team continue to play, and recorded two additional scheduled matches as defaulted losses for the Wanderers, even though the matches were not played.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Holzman|Nieforth|2002|pp=169–70}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the Wanderers disbanded, Ross retired as a player. His NHL career yielded one goal in three games played.&lt;ref name=&quot;Diamond 1964&quot;/&gt;

==Managerial career==
===1918–36===
Following his playing career, Ross became a NHL referee.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Diamond|2002|p=194}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was hired to coach the [[Hamilton Tigers (ice hockey)|Hamilton Tigers]] for the [[1922–23 NHL season|1922–23 season]], and adopted new methods in training camp that emphasized physical fitness, including work off the ice.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wesley|Wesley|2005|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Tigers finished with a record of six wins and eighteen losses, last in the NHL for the third successive year, and Ross did not return the next season.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wesley|Wesley|2005|p=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; His next coaching appointment arose from meeting Boston grocery store magnate [[Charles Adams (ice hockey)|Charles Adams]] during the [[1924 Stanley Cup Finals]]. Before the [[1924–25 NHL season|1924 season]], the NHL awarded Adams an [[expansion team]], which he named the [[Boston Bruins]]. He hired Ross as general manager, coach and scout.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goyens|Orr|2000|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Diamond 203&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Diamond|2002|p=203}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ross utilized his many hockey connections throughout Canada and the United States to sign players. Even so, the team started poorly.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goyens|Orr|2000|p=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early in the first season the [[Varsity Blues men's ice hockey team|University of Toronto hockey team]] was in Boston for matches against local universities. The team's manager, [[Conn Smythe]], who later owned and managed the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]], said that his team could easily defeat the Bruins&amp;mdash;Ross's team had won only two of their first fifteen NHL games. This began a feud between Smythe and Ross which lasted until Ross's death; while mostly confined to newspaper reports, they refused to speak to each other at NHL Board of Governor meetings.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McKinley|2000|p=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bruins finished their [[1924–25 NHL season|first season]] with six wins in thirty games, one of the worst records in the history of the league. Several records were set over the course of the season; the three home wins are tied for the second fewest ever, and an eleven game losing streak from December 8, 1924, until February 17, 1925, set a record for longest losing streak, surpassed in 2004 and now second longest in history.&lt;ref name=&quot;NHL 164&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|National Hockey League|2009|p=164}}&lt;/ref&gt; With 17 wins in 36 games the [[1925–26 NHL season|following season]], the team greatly improved, and finished one point out of a playoff spot.&lt;ref name=&quot;Diamond 203&quot;/&gt;

In 1926 the [[Western Canada Hockey League|Western Hockey League]], the other top professional hockey league, was in decline. The Patrick brothers, who controlled the league, offered to sell the remaining five teams for $300,000. Ross realized the potential talent available and convinced Adams to pay the money. As a result, the Bruins acquired the rights to several future [[Hockey Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] players, the most notable being defender [[Eddie Shore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goyens|Orr|2000|pp=57–58}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ross signed goaltender [[Cecil &quot;Tiny&quot; Thompson]] in 1928, who was with a team in [[Minneapolis Millers (AHA)|Minnesota]], despite never watching him play;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hughes|Fischler|Romain|Duplacey|2003|p=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ralph &quot;Cooney&quot; Weiland]] was also brought over from Minnesota.&lt;ref name=&quot;Diamond 204&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Diamond|2002|p=204}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ross acquired [[Cy Denneny]] from Ottawa and made him a player-coach while he assumed the role of team manager. On November 20, 1928, the Bruins moved to a new arena when the [[Boston Garden]] opened. The team played the Canadiens who won the match 1–0 in front of 16,000 fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goyens|Orr|2000|p=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; The players signed by Ross helped the Bruins to improve quickly, and they won the Stanley Cup in [[1929 Stanley Cup Finals|1929]]. Denneny retired after the Cup win and Ross resumed his role as coach,&lt;ref name=&quot;Diamond 203&quot;/&gt; guiding the team to several league records in the [[1929–30 NHL season|1929–30 season]]. The team won 38 of 44 games for an .875 winning percentage, the highest in league history; the five losses tied a record for fewest ever, and the four road losses tied a record for second fewest. The Bruins also only finished one game in a tie, a record for fewest ties in a season since the NHL began recording the record in 1926.&lt;ref name=&quot;NHL 164&quot;/&gt; One of the longest winning streaks was also set during the season. From December 3, 1929, until January 9, 1930, the team won fourteen games in a row, a record that lasted until 1982 and now tied for third longest, as of October 2010. A home winning streak began the same day and lasted for twenty games, until March 18, 1930, which was tied for the longest of its kind in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|National Hockey League|2009|p=165}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[1930–31 NHL season|1930–31]], the Bruins again lost only one home game, which equalled their previous record.&lt;ref name=&quot;NHL 164&quot;/&gt;

In a playoff game against the Montreal Canadiens on March 26, 1931, Ross substituted goaltender [[Tiny Thompson]] for a sixth skater in the final minute of play. Although the Bruins lost the game 1–0, Ross became the first coach to replace his goaltender with an [[extra attacker]], a tactic which became widespread practice in hockey.&lt;ref name=&quot;Diamond 204&quot;/&gt; Stepping aside as coach in 1934 to focus on managing the team, Ross hired Frank Patrick as coach with a salary of $10,500, which was high for such a role.&lt;ref name=&quot;Diamond 204&quot;/&gt; However rumours spread during the season that Patrick, a [[Methodist]], was drinking heavily and not being as strict with the players as Ross wanted. After the Bruins lost their playoff series with the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] in the 1936 playoffs, the result of a 8–1 score in the second game, a newspaper claimed that Patrick had been drinking the day of the game and had trouble controlling the team. Several days later, Ross relieved Patrick of his duties and once again assumed the role of coach.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goyens|Orr|2000|p=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1936–54===
[[Image:Artrosstrophy.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The [[Art Ross Trophy]]. Ross donated the trophy in 1947 to be awarded to the leading scorer in the NHL regular season.]]
Ross took over an improved team. He had recently signed three players, [[Milt Schmidt]], [[Bobby Bauer]] and [[Woody Dumart]], who all grew up together in [[Kitchener, Ontario]], and had them play on the same line, soon nicknamed the [[Kraut Line]] in reference to the German heritage of all three.&lt;ref name=&quot;Diamond 204&quot;/&gt; Along with them, Ross had acquired a new goaltender in 1938, [[Frank Brimsek]]; after Brimsek earned six [[shutouts]] in his first eight games, the Bruins traded away Tiny Thompson to allow Brimsek to play. With these players the Bruins finished first in the league in [[1937–38 NHL season|1937–38]]; Ross was named as the second best coach in the league, selected for the end of season [[NHL All-Star Team|All-Star Second Team]]. The [[1938–39 NHL season|next season]] the Bruins won 36 of 48 games, and won the Stanley Cup in the [[1939 Stanley Cup Finals|playoffs]]; Ross was named to the First All-Star Team as the best coach in the league for the season and the team only tied two games, which is tied for the second fewest in a season.&lt;ref name=&quot;NHL 164&quot;/&gt; He hired the recently retired Cooney Weiland to coach the Bruins for the [[1939–40 NHL season]]. The Bruins would win the Cup again in [[1941 Stanley Cup Finals|1941]], and tied their record of only four away losses all season.&lt;ref name=&quot;NHL 164&quot;/&gt; Ross once again took over as coach of the team before the [[1941–42 NHL season|1941–42 season]] began, as Weiland became coach of the [[Hershey Bears]] of the [[American Hockey League]], and led the team to 25 wins in 48 games, which was enough to earn third place in the league.{{Sfn|Associated Press|1941|p=29}} By this time the [[Second World War]] had caused several Bruins players, including the entire Kraut Line and goaltender Brimsek, to enlist in their respective armed forces.&lt;ref name=&quot;Diamond 204&quot;/&gt; The Bruins finished second in the NHL during the [[1942–43 NHL season|1942–43 season]] with 24 wins in 50 games and Ross was again named in the Second NHL All-Star Team as second best coach in the league. The Bruins missed the playoffs in [[1943–44 NHL season|1943–44]], the first time in ten years they failed to qualify, but returned to the playoffs the next season, something they did for five straight years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Diamond 204&quot;/&gt;

In 1949, Ross had signed [[Georges Boucher]] as coach, but Boucher did not work well with Ross and team president [[Weston Adams]].{{Sfn|Associated Press|1950|p=21}} Looking to hire a new coach in the summer of 1950, Ross phoned [[Lynn Patrick]], the son of Lester, who had just resigned from the New York Rangers after coaching the team to the [[1950 Stanley Cup Final|Stanley Cup Final]]. Lynn had moved his family back to [[Victoria, British Columbia]], where he grew up as a child, with the intention of coaching the Victoria Cougars, a team in the minor professional [[Pacific Coast Hockey League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goyens|Orr|2000|p=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though reluctant to move back to the eastern United States, Lynn was hired by Ross after he was offered a salary of $12,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goyens|Orr|2000|p=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; He would coach the team for the next four seasons and become the second general manager of the Bruins when Ross retired at the end of October 1954.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goyens|Orr|2000|p=113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legacy===
Aside from his career in hockey, Ross was interested in improving the game. Prior to the start of the [[1927–28 NHL season|1927–28 season]], the NHL adopted a new style of goal net created by Ross. With the back molded into a  B-shape, it was better designed to catch pucks and the net was used until 1984, when a modified version was adopted.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hughes|Fischler|Romain|Duplacey|2003|p=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also improved the design of the puck, which was made of synthetic, rather than natural, rubber. It had [[bevel]] edges, which prevented it bouncing too much.{{Sfn|Hockey Hall of Fame|2010}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Diamond 1964&quot;/&gt; Along with [[New York Rangers]] coach [[Frank Boucher]], Ross helped  to create the [[Ice hockey rink#Lines|red line]], which was introduced to help speed up the game by removing the ability for defenders to pass the puck from the defensive to offensive zone; until 2006 it was against the rules of hockey to make a [[offside (ice hockey)|two line pass]]. More scoring chances resulted as teams could not simply send the puck down the ice.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McKinley|2009|p=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to help tell the red line and blue lines apart on television, Ross suggested that the red line be striped.&lt;ref name=&quot;HHOF 16&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Hockey Hall of Fame|2003|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarded throughout his playing career as one of the best defenders in hockey, Ross was named to the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]] in 1949,&lt;ref name=&quot;1949-ssp&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;1949-oc&quot;/&gt; selected for his playing career rather than his work as an executive.{{Sfn|Hockey Hall of Fame|2010}} A ceremony for his induction was held prior to a Bruins game on December 2, 1949, where he was given his Hall of Fame scroll and a silver tray with the emblems of the six NHL teams on it.&lt;ref name=&quot;HHOF 16&quot;/&gt; In 1975 he was inducted into the [[Canadian Sports Hall of Fame]].{{Sfn|Canadian Sports Hall of Fame|2010}} Along with his two sons he donated the [[Art Ross Memorial Trophy|Art Ross Trophy]] to the NHL in 1947, to be awarded to the leading scorer in the league's regular season.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Podnieks|2005|p=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984 he was posthumously awarded the [[Lester Patrick Trophy]] for service to hockey in the United States.{{Sfn|Hockey Hall of Fame Stats|2010}}

==Personal life==
Ross also excelled in [[baseball]], [[Canadian football|football]], [[lacrosse]] and [[motorcycle racing]]. Before he became a hockey executive, he had a career as a bank clerk and ran a sporting-goods store in Montreal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kitchen 192&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Kitchen|2008|p=192}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|Canadian Press|1964|p=13}} Ross had moved to [[Brandon, Manitoba]], in 1905 at the advice of his parents so he could get a job with a bank, with a salary of $600 per year. He gave that career up when he began playing hockey professionally.{{Sfn|Associated Press|1938|p=12}} He was married to Muriel, a native of Montreal, and had two sons, Art and John. During the Second World War, both sons served in the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]]. After the war Ross made his son Art the business manager for the Bruins.{{Sfn|Canadian Press|1964|p=13}} Ross was named coach and manager of the [[Boston Bruins]] in 1924 and moved his family to [[Brookline, Massachusetts]], a suburb of Boston, after being hired.{{Sfn|Canadian Press|1964|p=13}} In 1928, he served as the traveling secretary of the [[Atlanta Braves|Boston Braves]] baseball team, which was owned by Bruins owner Charles Adams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Second Term As Manager|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=VsFEAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=O7oMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4181,2335882&amp;dq|accessdate=5 February 2012|newspaper=The Border Cities Star|date=May 23, 1928}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He became a [[United States nationality law|naturalized American citizen]] on April 22, 1938.{{Sfn|Associated Press|1938|p=12}} On August 5, 1964, Ross died at a nursing home in [[Medford, Massachusetts]], a suburb of Boston, at the age of 78.
