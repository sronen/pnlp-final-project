In his sophomore NHL season, Linden finished second on the team in goals, with 21, and points, 51, and finished third in assists with 30. The following year, he was one of three Canucks to share a rotating captaincy (the others being [[Doug Lidster]] and [[Dan Quinn]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Canuck Legends&quot;/&gt; Linden led the team with 37 assists and 70 points, and made his first appearance in an [[42nd National Hockey League All-Star Game|NHL All-Star Game]], where he was the youngest player.&lt;ref name=&quot;Numbers and notables&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://canucks.nhl.com/team/app/?service=page&amp;page=NewsPage&amp;articleid=395948|title=Numbers and notables|accessdate=2008-12-04|publisher=Canucks.com|year=2008|author=Barbosa, Brian}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of 21, he was made sole captain of the team,&lt;ref name=&quot;Young Captains&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/statitudes/news/2000/03/23/lecavalier_youngcaptain/|title=Youth is serving|accessdate=2008-03-18|publisher=CNN/SI|year=2000|author=Hunt, Ryan}}&lt;/ref&gt; becoming the youngest Canucks captain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fans, peers honour Trevor Linden's 19-year hockey career|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Hockey/NHL/Vancouver/2008/04/07/5213956-cp.html|publisher=The Canadian Press|year=2008|accessdate=2008-04-29}} {{dead link| date=June 2010 | bot=DASHBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; That season, Linden led the Canucks in scoring for a second straight year with 75 points (31 goals and 44 assists), leading the Canucks to their first division title since the [[1974–75 NHL season|1974–75 season]].&lt;ref name=&quot;2006–07 Media Guide&quot;/&gt;

A natural [[winger (ice hockey)|winger]] early in his career, Linden began learning to play at the [[center (ice hockey)|center]] position during the Canucks training camp in October 1992. Canucks head coach [[Pat Quinn (ice hockey)|Pat Quinn]] initiated the switch in response to the losses of centers [[Anatoli Semenov]] and [[Petr Nedved]] during the off-season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Rossiter, Sean|publisher=Opus Productions Inc.|location=Vancouver|page=15|year=1994|unused_data=Vancouver Canucks: The Silver Edition}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Canucks repeated as [[Smythe Division]] champions that year, setting franchise records for wins and points with 46 and 101, respectively.{{#tag:ref|The wins record was surpassed in [[2006–07 NHL season|2006–07]] by three, while the points record was broken in [[2002–03 NHL season|2002–03]] by three.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Standings for the Vancouver Canucks of the NHL|url=http://www.hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/display_standings.php?tmi=8756|accessdate=2011-06-10|publisher=Hockeydb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=notes}} For the third straight season, Linden surpassed 30 goals and 70 points, finishing with totals of 33 goals and 72 points.&lt;ref name=&quot;Recordbook&quot;/&gt;

In the [[1993–94 NHL season|1993–94 season]], Linden scored 32 goals, the fifth time in six seasons he had scored at least 30, but his points total fell to 61 as the Canucks finished 12 points behind the division leader. Although they were the seventh seed in the playoffs, the Canucks reached the Stanley Cup Finals for the first time in 12 years and second time in team history. Considered the underdogs against the [[Presidents' Trophy|first place]] [[New York Rangers]] captained by [[Mark Messier]], the Canucks initially fell behind three games to one but pushed the series to seven games. In game seven, Linden scored twice (the next player to get two goals in a game seven was [[Alex Tanguay]] in 2001) but the Canucks lost, 3–2.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fan Guide&quot;&gt;{{cite book  | last = MacKinnon | first = John | title = NHL Hockey: The Official Fans' Guide |publisher = Raincoast Books | year = 1996  | location = Vancouver |isbn = 1-55192-047-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Linden finished second on the team in playoff scoring, with 12 goals and 25 points.&lt;ref name=&quot;2006–07 Media Guide&quot;/&gt; It was revealed afterwards that Linden had played through the finals with broken ribs and torn rib cartilage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Linden heroic in 1994 Stanley Cup Final|url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=397641|accessdate=2010-06-02|date=2008-12-15|publisher=[[National Hockey League]]|author=John McGourty}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[1995–96 NHL season|1995–96 season]], Linden had 33 goals, 47 assists and 80 points, the most he has ever collected in all three statistical categories.&lt;ref name=&quot;1997 NHL Yearbook&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = National Hockey League  | title = 1997 NHL Yearbook | year = 1996 | publisher = Worldsport Properties | location = Toronto | pages = 232}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 27, 1996, he played in his 437th consecutive game, breaking the team record previously held by [[Don Lever]].&lt;ref name=&quot;this day&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=On This Day|url=http://canucks.nhl.com/club/page.htm?id=40197|accessdate=2011-12-24|publisher=[[Vancouver Canucks]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following season marked the end of Linden's ironman streak; between October 4, 1990 and December 3, 1996, he appeared in 482 consecutive games, the longest in the league at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;1998 NHL Yearbook&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = National Hockey League  | title = 1998 NHL Yearbook | year = 1997 | publisher = Worldsport Properties | location = Toronto | pages = 240}}&lt;/ref&gt; His team record was later broken in 2007 by [[Brendan Morrison]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Morrison Ironman&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Morrison's game milestone|url=http://www.canada.com/theprovince/news/sports/story.html?id=858bf4fc-6eb2-4da2-8c4f-e97315fb7191|author=Willes, Ed|publisher=[[The Province]]|date=2007-02-23|accessdate=2008-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 49 games that season, he scored nine goals and 31 assists. At the conclusion of the season, the NHL recognized Linden's contributions to the Vancouver community and awarded him the King Clancy Memorial Trophy.&lt;ref name=&quot;1998 NHL Yearbook&quot;/&gt;

At the start of the [[1997–98 NHL season|1997–98 season]], the Canucks added free agent Mark Messier, a six-time Stanley Cup winner, and manager/coach [[Mike Keenan]], who were, respectively, captain and coach, of the New York Rangers when they defeated Vancouver in the 1994 Stanley Cup finals. Keenan's hiring was as a result of Pat Quinn being dismissed as general manager, and Keenan also assumed the title of bench boss by firing head coach [[Tom Renney]] early in the season. According to some accounts, Linden initially gave up the team captaincy to Messier out of respect, but later regretted the move as he felt that Messier's invasion of the dressing room was hostile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/hockey/nhl/news/2001/08/08/sayitaintso_canucks/ | work=CNN | accessdate=2010-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Friction developed between Linden and Keenan early in the season.&lt;ref name=&quot;Captain Vancouver&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vanmag.com/articles/07apr/Captainvancouver.shtml|title=Captain Vancouver|accessdate=2008-01-29|publisher=Vancouver Magazine|year=2007|author=McKinley, Michael|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080615025618/http://www.vanmag.com/articles/07apr/Captainvancouver.shtml |archivedate = June 15, 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As the relationship worsened, Keenan claimed that it was evident that Linden would be traded.&lt;ref name=&quot;Captain of Islanders&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Spots of The Times; Here's How A Captain Operates|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0DE7DB113AF932A25751C1A96E958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=1|author=Vecsey, George|publisher=[[New York Times]]|date=1998-12-11|accessdate=2008-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a 5–1 loss to the [[St. Louis Blues (ice hockey)|St. Louis Blues]], Keenan openly blamed Linden for the loss, a moment Linden refers to as his &quot;darkest time&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Darkest time&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title =Linden outlasts 'darkest time' trade from Canucks|url =http://www.canada.com/theprovince/news/sports/story.html?id=8f587dcd-243b-41da-9aeb-accd1d1d46ac|author =Pratt, Dave|publisher =[[The Province]]|date =2008-02-05|accessdate =2008-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Playing in 42 games with the Canucks before the February Olympic break, Linden had seven goals and 21 points.

Linden was traded to the [[New York Islanders]] on February 6, 1998, for [[Todd Bertuzzi]], [[Bryan McCabe]], and the Islanders' third round choice (used to select [[Jarkko Ruutu]]) in the [[1998 NHL Entry Draft]].

He scored 10 goals and seven assists for 17 points to finish the season, with a combined 17 goals and 21 assists for 38 points in 67 games. The following year, his first full season in three years, Linden was second on the team with 47 points, and third with 18 goals; however, on May 29, 1999, the Islanders traded Linden to the [[Montreal Canadiens]] for a first round draft pick in the [[1999 NHL Entry Draft]] ([[Branislav Mezei]]), for mostly financial reasons.&lt;ref name=&quot;Trade to Canadiens&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title =Strapped Islanders Trade Linden To Montreal for a Draft Pick|url =http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9906E6DB1530F933A05756C0A96F958260|author =El-Bashir, Tarik|publisher =[[New York Times]]|date =1999-05-30|accessdate =2008-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The thrill of playing in Montreal, the &quot;centre of hockey,&quot; was an exciting prospect to Linden after his time spent with the Islanders, where the arena was usually half-filled when he played there.&lt;ref name=&quot;2000 NHL Yearbook&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = National Hockey League  | title = 2000 NHL Yearbook | year = 1999 | publisher = Worldsport Properties | location = Toronto | pages = 256}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With Montreal, Linden was often injured, and only appeared in 50 games during his first season with the Canadiens, scoring 30 points, while the next year he appeared in 57 games, scoring 33 points. While with the Canadiens, he signed a four-year contract worth $15 million;&lt;ref name=&quot;Canuck Legends&quot;/&gt; however, he was traded for the third time in his career, this time to the [[Washington Capitals]], going with [[Dainius Zubrus]], and [[New Jersey Devils|New Jersey's]] 2nd round choice in the [[2001 NHL Entry Draft]] (later traded to Tampa Bay who picked [[Andreas Holmqvist]]) in exchange for [[Richard Zednik]], [[Jan Bulis]], and Washington's 1st round choice in the 2001 Draft ([[Alexander Perezhogin]]).
