'''Susianna''' &quot;'''Susi'''&quot; '''Levonovna Kentikian''' (''Սյուզի Կենտիկյան'', born '''Syuzanna Levonovna Kentikyan''' on September 11, 1987)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boxrec.com/list_bouts.php?human_id=292211&amp;cat=boxer Susi Kentikian]. Boxrec. Accessed April 16, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[Armenians|Armenian]] professional [[Boxing|boxer]] [[HyeFighters|HyeFighter]] now residing in [[Germany]]. She was born in [[Yerevan]], [[Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic|Armenian SSR]], but she left the country with her family at the age of five because of the [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]]. Kentikian has lived in [[Hamburg]] since 1996 and began boxing when she was twelve years old. Following a successful amateur career, she turned professional in 2005 when she signed with the Hamburg boxing promoter Spotlight Boxing. Kentikian won her first world championship fight in February 2007, and she is the current [[World Boxing Association]] (WBA), [[World Boxing Organization]] (WBO) and [[Women's International Boxing Federation]] (WIBF) world [[flyweight]] champion, and is considered Top Female fighter pound for pound.

Kentikian is undefeated, having won 16 of her 26 professional fights by knockout. The German television station [[ZDF]] broadcasts her fights since July 2009. She had previously headlined fight cards for the television station [[ProSieben]] from 2007 to 2009. Kentikian has gained minor celebrity status in Germany, and she hopes to reach a popularity similar to that of the retired German female boxing star [[Regina Halmich]].

==Early life==
Susianna  Kentikian was born in [[Yerevan]], [[Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic|Armenian SSR]], the daughter of veterinary doctor Levon Kentikian and his wife Makruhi.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wm-Titel&quot;&gt;Jensen, Björn. [http://www.abendblatt.de/daten/2007/02/19/691561.html?s=1 &quot;Killer Queen&quot; krönt sich mit WM-Titel]. ''Hamburger Abendblatt''. February 19, 2007. Accessed May 26, 2008. {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of five, she left Armenia with her parents and her nine-year-old brother, Mikael, because her father was called up to serve in the military during the [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ich bin ein Killer, ich kämpfe wie ein Mann&quot;&gt;Bösecke, Ina.

Accessed May 1, 2007. {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, the family first moved to [[Berlin]], [[Germany]], and stayed at [[asylum seeker]]s' homes. However, due to the violence at these facilities and their poor knowledge of the German language, they left Berlin and moved to [[Moldova]] and later to [[Russia]], where Kentikian went to school for a short period of time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ein Fliegengewicht boxt sich nach oben&quot;&gt;Treptow, Julia.

Several times, she and her family were taken to the airport for deportation, but the intervention of local friends such as her amateur trainer, Frank Rieth, who called lawyers, the media, and local politicians, prevented their final expulsion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Die starke Susi&quot;/&gt; Her family received a permanent residence permit in 2005 when she signed a three-year professional boxing contract that established a stable income.&lt;ref name=&quot;Susi Kentikian - Hamburgs Million Dollar Baby&quot;&gt;Hardt, Andreas.

Accessed May 1, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the age of 16, Kentikian began working as a [[cleaner]] in a local [[fitness center]] to help her family financially.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ein Fliegengewicht boxt sich nach oben&quot;/&gt; She graduated from high school (''[[Realschule]]'') in the summer of 2006,&lt;ref name=&quot;Ich wollte schon als Siebenjährige Großes schaffen&quot;&gt;[http://www.abendblatt.de/daten/2007/04/07/720463.html?prx=1 &quot;Ich wollte schon als Siebenjährige Großes schaffen&quot;].

==Amateur career==
Kentikian discovered her enthusiasm for boxing when she was twelve years old after accompanying her brother to his [[boxing training]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Durchgeboxt&quot;/&gt; She started with regular training herself and stated that boxing had allowed her to forget the difficulties of her life for a short time: &quot;I could let everything out, my whole energy. If you have so many problems like our family, you need something like that.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ich bin ein Killer, ich kämpfe wie ein Mann&quot;/&gt;

Kentikian won the Hamburg Championships for juniors from 2001 to 2004. She also won the Northern German Championships for juniors in 2003 and 2004, and in October 2004, she had her biggest amateur success by winning the International German Women's Amateur Championships in the [[featherweight]] division for juniors. Kentikian found it increasingly difficult to find opponents in the amateur ranks, as few boxers wanted to face her in the ring, and her status as an asylum seeker did not allow her to box outside Hamburg.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taz.de/dx/2003/01/02/a0166.1/text Susi Kentikian]. ''taz Hamburg''. January 2, 2003. Accessed June 21, 2008. {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kentikian's final amateur record stood at 24 wins and one loss. She later blamed overeagerness for her single loss, having fought despite health problems at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Kötter, Andreas.

==Professional career==
Kentikian was discovered as a professional boxer at an exhibition fight during qualifications for the [[World Amateur Boxing Championships]]. At the beginning of 2005, she signed a three-year contract with the Hamburg boxing promoter Spotlight Boxing, a joint venture of Universum Box-Promotion, focusing on young athletes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Susi Kentikian - Hamburgs Million Dollar Baby&quot;/&gt; Since then, she has been coached by Universum trainer Magomed Schaburow.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wm-Titel&quot;/&gt; Kentikian started her professional career on January 15, 2005, with a win by [[unanimous decision]] over Iliana Boneva of [[Bulgaria]] on the [[undercard]] of German female boxing star [[Regina Halmich]]. Over the next 14&amp;nbsp;months, Kentikian won nine of her eleven fights by knockout. Her unusually high knockout percentage, rarely seen in lower female weight classes, began to draw attention.&lt;ref name=&quot;Die starke Susi&quot;/&gt; On July 25, 2006, she won her first belt, the International German flyweight title, against Daniela Graf by unanimous decision. In her first international title fight on September 9, 2006, Kentikian beat [[Maribel Zurita]] from the United States with a fourth round [[technical knockout]] for the [[Women's International Boxing Federation|WIBF]] InterContinental flyweight title; the fight was stopped when Zurita was cut over the left eyebrow.&lt;ref name=&quot;Die starke Susi&quot;/&gt;

===2007===
In her 15th professional bout, Kentikian fought for her first world championship in [[Cologne]], Germany, on February 16, 2007; it was also her first time headlining a [[fight card]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Die starke Susi&quot;&gt;Monheim, Gert.

Accessed April 16, 2008. {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; She won by a ninth round technical knockout against Carolina Alvarez of [[Venezuela]], and thereby won the vacant [[World Boxing Association|WBA]] flyweight title. Alvarez took unanswered punches in most of the rounds and was bleeding heavily from her nose, and the referee eventually stopped the fight in round nine in concern for Alvarez's health.&lt;ref&gt;Drexel, Fritz.

Accessed June 21, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Six weeks later, on March 30, 2007, Kentikian made her first title defense. Before a crowd of 19,500 in the [[Kölnarena]], she fought on the undercard of the popular exhibition bout between German comedian [[Stefan Raab]] and WIBF world champion Regina Halmich. Kentikian beat María José Núñez from [[Uruguay]] with a third round technical knockout. Núñez was knocked down in round two and Kentikian finished the fight one round later with a right [[Cross (boxing)|cross]] followed up by combinations that left Núñez defenseless on the ropes, causing the referee to step in.&lt;ref&gt;Drexel, Fritz.

[[Image:Kentikian-hokmi.png|thumb|Kentikian (right) in her rematch with Nadia Hokmi, December 2007]]

Kentikian next faced Nadia Hokmi of [[France]] in her second title defense on May 25, 2007. Hokmi, using her height and reach advantage, proved to be the first test of Kentikian's professional career, and both boxers fought a competitive bout. While Hokmi started out slower, she managed to win several of the later rounds by landing repeated combinations. Kentikian won through a [[split decision]] for the first time in her career.&lt;ref&gt;Drexel, Fritz.

WomenBoxing.com. Accessed March 18, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; On September 7, 2007, Kentikian defended her title against Shanee Martin from the United Kingdom, winning by a third round technical knockout. Kentikian controlled her opponent from the opening bell and the referee stopped the fight after Martin was knocked down from a straight right hand in round three.&lt;ref&gt;Drexel, Fritz.

Following the retirement of long-standing WIBF belt holder Regina Halmich, Kentikian unified the WBA and vacant WIBF flyweight titles in her hometown of Hamburg on December 7, 2007. She met Nadia Hokmi in a rematch of their contest six months earlier. The French boxer again proved to be a tough opponent and the fight developed very similarly to their first encounter. Once more, Kentikian had the better start, but Hokmi scored during the second half of the fight, again making it a close bout. This time however, Kentikian was ahead on all three of the judges' scorecards, winning by unanimous decision.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eastsideboxing.com/news.php?p=13591&amp;more=1 Susi Kentikian wins Halmich's belt].

===2008===
Kentikian successfully defended her titles against Sarah Goodson of the [[Philippines]] by a third round technical knockout on February 29, 2008. Goodson, who had fought almost exclusively in lower weight classes before, was overpowered by Kentikian and the referee ended the fight after a series of body punches in round three.&lt;ref&gt;Dower, Jim.

Accessed June 21, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In her next title defense on May 10, 2008, Kentikian beat Mary Ortega from the United States with a first round technical knockout. Ortega, who had previously fought against well-known opponents such as [[Elena Reid]] and [[Hollie Dunaway]], was knocked down twice by straight right hands during the first 90&amp;nbsp;seconds of the fight. When Kentikian had Ortega pinned against the ropes again, the referee stepped in shortly before the end of round one. The quick stoppage came as a surprise to many, including television commentator Regina Halmich, who had expected a hard-fought bout.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, Erik.

In her next title defense on August 29, 2008, Kentikian met Hager Finer of [[Israel]], Halmich's last opponent before retiring. Following a close opening round, the boxing match turned into a brawl, and Finer scored during the first half of the fight. From round five onwards, Kentikian managed to take over the bout by landing the cleaner punches and she won by unanimous decision.&lt;ref&gt;Swiecznik, Sebastian.

During the uncharacteristic tactical fight, Kentikian managed to control her opponent from the middle of the ring in most of the rounds. The three judges all scored the bout in favor of Kentikian.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, Erik. [http://www.boxingnews24.com/2008/12/kentikian-defeats-toktaulova/ Kentikian Defeats Toktaulova]. Boxing News 24.

Kentikian retained her WIBF and WBA belts with a unanimous decision win over [[Elena Reid]] from the United States on March 20, 2009. Reid, who was well known in Germany after two controversial bouts with Halmich in 2004 and 2005, remained largely passive from the opening bell and Kentikian controlled her through the majority of the fight. Reid did not win a single round on the official scorecards.&lt;ref&gt;Persson, Ake. [http://www.eastsideboxing.com/news.php?p=19150&amp;more=1 Kentikian Dominates Reid]. East Side Boxing.

==In the media==
At the beginning of her professional career, Kentikian was primarily featured in the local media in Hamburg and occasionally in national [[German newspapers]]; in particular, her difficult childhood and her long-time uncertain asylum status sparked interest in the press and led to comparisons with the boxing film ''[[Million Dollar Baby]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Durchgeboxt&quot;/&gt; Her height of {{height|m=1.54|precision=0}} also drew attention, and she was dubbed &quot;Germany's smallest professional boxer&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot; Die kleinste Profiboxerin Deutschlands&quot;&gt;Jensen, Björn.
