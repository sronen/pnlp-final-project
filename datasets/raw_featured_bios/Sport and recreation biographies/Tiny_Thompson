'''Cecil Ralph &quot;Tiny&quot; Thompson''' (May 31, 1903&amp;nbsp;– February 9, 1981) was a [[Canada|Canadian]] professional [[ice hockey]] [[goaltender]]. He played 12 seasons in the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL), first for the [[Boston Bruins]], and later for the [[Detroit Red Wings]]. A four-time [[Vezina Trophy]] winner, Thompson was inducted into the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]] in 1959. He was a member of one [[Stanley Cup]]-winning team, as a rookie in the [[1928–29 NHL season|1928–29 season]] with the Boston Bruins. At the start of the [[1938–39 NHL season|1938–39 season]], after ten full seasons with Boston, he was traded to the Detroit Red Wings, where he completed the season, and played another full one before retiring. During his NHL career, he recorded 81&amp;nbsp;shutouts, the sixth highest of any goaltender. After retiring from playing, he coached lower-league teams before becoming a noted professional scout. Thompson helped popularize the technique of catching the [[hockey puck|puck]] as a method of making a [[save (ice hockey)|save]]. A competent puckhandler, he was the first goaltender in the NHL to record an [[Assist (ice hockey)|assist]] by passing the puck with his [[Ice hockey stick|stick]] to a fellow player.

==Early life==
Thompson grew up in Calgary, [[Alberta]], where his brother, [[Paul Thompson (ice hockey b. 1906)|Paul]]—who also became a professional ice hockey player—was born in 1906.&lt;ref name=&quot;b50&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Allen|Duff|Bower|2002|p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a child, he enjoyed playing [[baseball]] and ice hockey.&lt;ref name=&quot;b50&quot;/&gt; Initially, Thompson was not a goaltender, though he agreed to play the position to get into games.&lt;ref name=&quot;b133&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Fischler|2001|p=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a teenager playing competitive ice hockey, he acquired the nickname &quot;Tiny&quot; as a joke, as he was the tallest player on the team, standing {{convert|5|ft|10|in|m|abbr=on}}; the nickname stuck with him for the rest of his career.&lt;ref name=&quot;b51&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Allen|Duff|Bower|2002|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thompson began his junior career playing for the Calgary Monarchs in 1919 at the age of 16. He competed for the [[Memorial Cup]], awarded to the Canadian [[junior hockey]] champions that year, playing in two games and surrendering 11 goals, a respectable amount in that era. After spending the 1920–21 season playing for Calgary Alberta Grain, Thompson played three seasons in [[Bellevue, Alberta|Bellevue]], Alberta. In the 1924–25 season, he joined the Duluth Hornets, playing 40 games, recording a shutout in 11 of them.&lt;ref name=&quot;stats&quot;/&gt; The following season, Thompson joined the [[Minneapolis Millers (AHA)|Minneapolis Millers]] of the [[American Hockey Association (1926–1942)|American Hockey Association]] (AHA). In his three seasons with the Millers, he appeared in 118&amp;nbsp;games, recording 33&amp;nbsp;shutouts with a 1.37&amp;nbsp;[[goals against average]] (average of goals surrendered in a span of sixty minutes).&lt;ref name=&quot;stats&quot;&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/LegendsMember.jsp?mem=p195903&amp;page=statsawards&amp;list=ByName#photo|title=Tiny Thompson—Career statistics|publisher=Hockey Hall of Fame|accessdate=2008-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bio&quot;&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/LegendsMember.jsp?mem=p195903&amp;type=Player&amp;page=bio&amp;list=ByName#photo|title=Tiny Thompson—Biography|publisher=Hockey Hall of Fame|accessdate=2008-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==NHL career==
===Boston Bruins===
Thompson began his [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) career with the [[Boston Bruins]] in the [[1928–29 NHL season|1928–29 season]] after his contract was purchased by Boston manager [[Art Ross]], who had never seen him play before, owing to his good reputation in Minnesota.&lt;ref name=&quot;b51&quot;/&gt; In his first game he posted a shutout, becoming the only [[Hockey Hall of Fame]] goaltender to accomplish this feat.&lt;ref name=&quot;b49&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Allen|Duff|Bower|2002|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his first season, he appeared in all 44 of the Bruins' games, posting 12&amp;nbsp;shutouts and a 1.15&amp;nbsp;goals-against average, the second lowest goals-against average in NHL history until the 2008 season, after [[George Hainsworth]]'s 0.98 the same season.&lt;ref name=&quot;stats&quot;/&gt; Placing first in the American Division, the Bruins had a perfect record in the playoffs en route to their first Stanley Cup victory, defeating the [[Montreal Canadiens]] and the [[New York Rangers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.hockey-reference.com/teams/BOS/1929.html|title=1928–29 Boston Bruins statistics|publisher=Sports Reference, LCC|accessdate=2008-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thompson recorded three shutouts in the five playoff games, and allowed only three goals.&lt;ref name=&quot;stats&quot;/&gt;

The following [[1929–30 NHL season|season]], Thompson again appeared in all of the Bruins' 44&amp;nbsp;games, posting three shutouts and a 2.19&amp;nbsp;goals-against average. The league changed its rules on forward passing, which resulted in a sharp increase in goalscoring.&lt;ref name=&quot;stats&quot;/&gt; Boston won all but six games, finishing with a 38–5–1 record, the best winning percentage for any team in a season.&lt;ref name=&quot;bos&quot;&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.hockey-reference.com/teams/BOS/|title=Boston Bruins season|publisher=Sports Reference, LCC|accessdate=2008-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Surrendering only 98 goals, Thompson bested [[Chicago Black Hawks|Chicago]] goaltender [[Charlie Gardiner (ice hockey)|Charlie Gardiner]] to win the first of his four [[Vezina Trophy|Vezina Trophies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/SilverwareTrophyWinner.jsp?tro=VZT&amp;year=1929-30|title=1929–30 Vezina Trophy Winner—Tiny Thompson|publisher=Hockey Hall of Fame|accessdate=2009-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Vezina Trophy is awarded to the league's top goaltender, which was determined prior to the [[1981–82 NHL season|1981–82 season]] by number of goals surrendered by goaltenders who had played a minimum number of games.&lt;ref name=&quot;vez&quot;&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.nhl.com/trophies/vezina.html|title=Vezina Trophy|publisher=NHL|accessdate=2008-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the playoffs, however, they suffered their first two-game losing streak, as they were swept 2–0 by the Canadiens in the Stanley Cup finals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.hockey-reference.com/teams/BOS/1930.html|title=1929–30 Boston Bruins statistics|publisher=Sports Reference, LCC|accessdate=2008-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier in the playoffs, Thompson's winning streak of seven playoff games was snapped; it remains, as of 2008, the longest playoff winning streak to start a career.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weekes|Banks|2004|p=187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[1930–31 NHL season|1930–31 season]], he played all 44&amp;nbsp;games again,&lt;ref name=&quot;stats&quot;/&gt; and was named to the Second All-Star team.&lt;ref name=&quot;hg&quot;&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/player.htm?id=8450127&amp;view=notes|title=Tiny Thompson: Notes|publisher=NHL|accessdate=2008-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the playoffs, Boston lost the semifinals to the [[Montreal Canadiens]]; during game two of the series Thompson became the first goaltender to be pulled for a sixth attacker at the end of a game to give his team a higher chance to score a goal. Even though Boston still lost, coach [[Art Ross]]' maneuver was described as &quot;amazing&quot; the following day, and this technique, known as &quot;open net&quot;, caught on with the rest of the league.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Duplacey|Diamond|2000|p=187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bruins missed the playoffs for the first time in Thompson's career in the [[1931–32 NHL season|1931–32 season]]. He won only 13 games while appearing in 43 out of Boston's 48 games, which was the only time he missed games as a member of the Bruins.&lt;ref name=&quot;stats&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bos&quot;/&gt; The next [[1932–33 NHL season|season]], Boston made the playoffs once more, losing to the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]]. The final game of the playoff series was described as Thompson's most memorable.&lt;ref name=&quot;b134&quot;/&gt; During that game, Toronto and Boston were tied after regulation time and over 100 minutes of overtime proceeded, with Thompson dueling Toronto's goaltender [[Lorne Chabot]]. After the end of the fifth overtime period, managers [[Conn Smythe]] of the Maple Leafs and [[Art Ross]] of the Bruins asked league president [[Frank Calder]] to suspend the game, but Calder refused. Early in the sixth overtime period, a pass from Boston defenseman [[Eddie Shore]] was intercepted, and [[Ken Doraty]] skated in on a breakaway, cleanly beating Thompson at 4:46 of the period. The losing goaltender in the second-longest NHL game, Thompson received a standing ovation from fans at the [[Maple Leaf Gardens]].&lt;ref name=&quot;b134&quot;/&gt; Thompson finished the playoff series with 1.23 goals-against average, despite a losing record.&lt;ref name=&quot;stats&quot;/&gt;

Thompson became the second goaltender to win his second Vezina Trophy in [[1932–33 NHL season|1932–33]] since its inception in the [[1926–27 NHL season|1926–27 season]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/SilverwareTrophyWinner.jsp?tro=VZT&amp;year=1932-33|title=1932–33 Vezina Trophy Winner—Tiny Thompson|publisher=Hockey Hall of Fame|accessdate=2009-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; as he recorded 11&amp;nbsp;shutouts and a 1.76&amp;nbsp;goals-against average.&lt;ref name=&quot;vez&quot;/&gt; After missing the playoffs in the [[1933–34 NHL season|1933–34 season]], they rebounded to first place in the American Division the following season,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.hockey-reference.com/teams/BOS/1935.html|title=1934–35 Boston Bruins statistics|publisher=Sports Reference, LCC|accessdate=2008-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; as Thompson was named to the Second All-Star team for the second time.&lt;ref name=&quot;hg&quot;/&gt; In the playoffs, the Bruins won only one of their four games; their only win was on the strength of Thompson's shutout, who finished the playoffs with a 1.53 goals-against average.&lt;ref name=&quot;stats&quot;/&gt;

In the [[1935–36 NHL season]], Thompson recorded 10 shutouts, but Boston managed to win only 22 out of their 48 games. During the season, he recorded an assist, a rarity for goaltenders.&lt;ref name=&quot;b51&quot;/&gt; At the end of the season, he was named to the First All-Star team for the first time,&lt;ref name=&quot;hg&quot;/&gt; and won the Vezina Trophy for the third time, tying [[George Hainsworth]]'s all-time mark with three victories.&lt;ref name=&quot;vez&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/SilverwareTrophyWinner.jsp?tro=VZT&amp;year=1935-36|title=1935–36 Vezina Trophy Winner—Tiny Thompson|publisher=Hockey Hall of Fame|accessdate=2009-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ensuing two-game, total-goal playoff series against the Toronto Maple Leafs was series of contrasts, as the Bruins lost 8–6. In one game, the Bruins shut out Toronto 6–0, while they lost the other game 8–0.&lt;ref name=&quot;stats&quot;/&gt;  In [[1937–38 NHL season|1937–38]], his final full season with the Bruins, he won 30 out of the 48 games, but Boston lost to the Maple Leafs once again in the playoffs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.hockey-reference.com/teams/BOS/1938.html|title=1937–38 Boston Bruins statistics|publisher=Sports Reference, LCC|accessdate=2008-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thompson set a new record by winning his fourth and final Vezina Trophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/SilverwareTrophyWinner.jsp?tro=VZT&amp;year=1937-38|title=1937–38 Vezina Trophy Winner—Tiny Thompson|publisher=Hockey Hall of Fame|accessdate=2009-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also named to the First All-Star team for the second time.&lt;ref name=&quot;hg&quot;/&gt;

===Detroit Red Wings===
Thompson appeared in only five games for the Bruins in the [[1938–39 NHL season|1938–39 season]],&lt;ref name=&quot;stats&quot;/&gt; as Boston decided to replace the aging goaltender with the substantially younger [[Frank Brimsek]]. Brimsek would go on to lead the Bruins to a Stanley Cup victory that season, earning the nickname &quot;Mister Zero&quot; while picking up 10 regular season shutouts, the Vezina Trophy, First All-Star Team honours, and the [[Calder Memorial Trophy]], which is given &quot;to the player selected as the most proficient in his first year of competition&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.nhl.com/trophies/calder.html|title=Calder Memorial Trophy|accessdate=2007-08-21|publisher=nhl.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fischler|2003|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; To make space for Brimsek, Thompson was traded to the [[Detroit Red Wings]] for [[Normie Smith]] and $15,000; Thompson also received a $1,000 bonus from Boston.&lt;ref name=&quot;drw&quot;&gt;{{Citation|url=http://redwings.nhl.com/team/app?service=page&amp;page=NHLPage&amp;bcid=his_wol_wol-cecilthompson|title=Cecil (Tiny) Thompson 1939–40|publisher=Detroit Red Wings|accessdate=2008-08-25}} {{Dead link|date=March 2012|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boston manager Art Ross predicted that Thompson, now 35, would play for the Red Wings for at least another five seasons; however, Thompson remained with the team for only two seasons before retiring from playing. The Red Wings posted a losing record in both of these seasons, although they made the playoffs both times. Overall, Thompson appeared in 85 regular season games for Detroit, recording a 32–41–12 record, seven shutouts, and a 2.54&amp;nbsp;goals-against average,&lt;ref name=&quot;drw&quot;/&gt; and in 11 playoff games, posting a 5–6, with one shutout and a 2.41 goal-against average.&lt;ref name=&quot;stats&quot;/&gt;

==Post-NHL career==
After retiring from professional play, Thompson became the head coach of the [[Buffalo Bisons (AHL)|Buffalo Bisons]] of the [[American Hockey League]] (AHL) in the [[1940–41 AHL season|1940–41 season]].&lt;ref name=&quot;drw&quot;/&gt; He coached 56 games in two seasons. The Bisons missed the playoffs both times.&lt;ref name=&quot;hdb&quot;&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/pdisplay.php3?pid=5387|title=Cecil &quot;Tiny&quot; Thompson|publisher=hockeydb.com|accessdate=2008-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; He appeared in one game as goaltender in the 1940–41 season. During [[World War II]], Thompson served in the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] and doubled as the coach of the Calgary RCAF Mustangs of the Alberta Senior Hockey League. He led the Mustangs to the league championship series in 1942–43 against the Calgary Currie Army team where injuries to the Mustangs' goaltenders brought him back onto the ice in March 1943. With Thompson in goal, the Mustangs defeated Currie Army 8–4 to tie the best-of-five series at two wins apiece.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Mustangs flying high for 8–4 victory to deadlock series |work=Calgary Herald |date=1943-03-18 |page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; He played the deciding game, but his team fell short of winning the Alberta title with a 3–1 loss to Currie Army.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Currie gives classy display to win provincial title |work=Calgary Herald |date=1943-03-19 |page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the war, Thompson became chief Western Canada scout for the [[Chicago Blackhawks|Chicago Black Hawks]].&lt;ref name=&quot;b134&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Fischler|2001|p=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of few scouts who sought to discover a player's personality along with their playing ability, often conversing with players as part of efforts to learn about the players he was watching.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Tennant |first=Jack |title=In memory of Tiny Thompson |work=Calgary Sun |date=1981-02-13 |page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Playing style==
Thompson was a stand-up goaltender, rarely falling on both knees to stop a puck. He was one of the first NHL goaltenders to catch the puck with his hand to make a save, and helped popularize the technique. Using gloves that were smaller than those of other players, he was among the best puck-catchers of his era. He stood in the way of the puck with minimal padding, risking being struck when moving to catch it instead of simply deflecting it away from the net. His signature technique, very often featured in photographs of him, involved dropping to one knee with the paddle of his goalstick covering the [[five-hole]], and extending his glove to cover the left side of the net. Although he caught the puck with his glove, he did so without gloves resembling the modern [[blocker (ice hockey)|blocker]] and [[trapper (ice hockey)|trapper]] glove combination. Thompson was described by [[Johnny Bower]], a former goaltender who was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame, as a good puckhandler, and one of the best of his time at forward passing. In the [[1935–36 NHL season|1935–36 season]], Thompson became the first goaltender to get an assist by intentionally passing the puck with his stick to a fellow player.&lt;ref name=&quot;b50&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;b51&quot;/&gt;

==Legacy==
Thompson's points percentage in a season of .875, recorded in the [[1929–30 NHL season|1929–30 season]], still remains a record.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.hockey-reference.com/leaders/points_pct_goalie_season.html|title=Season Leaders and Records for Points Percentage (Goalie)|publisher=Sports Reference, LCC|accessdate=2008-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; His 38 wins during that season was a Boston record that was eclipsed only in the [[1982–83 NHL season|1982–83 season]], by [[Pete Peeters]] (who won 40 of 62 games played); since then, no Bruins goaltender has had more than 37 wins in a season.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.hockey-reference.com/teams/BOS/leaders_season.html|title=Boston Bruins Season Leaders|publisher=Sports Reference, LCC|accessdate=2008-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thompson is the all-time Bruins leader for games, wins, shutouts and goals-against average.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.hockey-reference.com/teams/BOS/leaders_career.html|title=Boston Bruins Career Leaders|publisher=Sports Reference, LCC|accessdate=2008-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout his entire NHL career, Thompson accrued 81&amp;nbsp;shutouts, which is sixth all-time in NHL history,&lt;ref name=&quot;b49&quot;/&gt; and was second to only [[George Hainsworth]] (who had 94) when Thompson retired.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.hockey-reference.com/leaders/shutouts_career.html|title=Career Leaders and Records for Shutouts|publisher=Sports Reference, LCC|accessdate=2008-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also posted seven shutouts in the playoffs.&lt;ref name=&quot;hrtt&quot;&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.hockey-reference.com/players/t/thompti01.html|title=Tiny Thompson|publisher=Sports Reference, LCC|accessdate=2008-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is fifth all-time in goals-against average, allowing on average only 2.08 per a 60-minute span.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.hockey-reference.com/leaders/goals_against_avg_career.html|title=Career Leaders and Records for Goals Against Average|publisher=Sports Reference, LCC|accessdate=2008-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; He led all goaltenders in regular season games played 10 times, and in regular season wins five times.&lt;ref name=&quot;hrtt&quot;/&gt;

In 1959, Thompson was inducted into the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]]. He died in Calgary on February 9, 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0CE5DD1639F931A25751C0A967948260|title=Cecil (Tiny) Thompson|publisher=''New York Times''|date=1981-02-12|accessdate=2008-08-25}} &lt;br/&gt; The article was published on Thursday, February 12, 1981, with a dateline of February 11; the article reports his death as having occurred on Monday, making it February 9, which agrees with the Hockey Hall of Fame.&lt;/ref&gt; He was survived by his wife, Edith, and his daughter, Sandra.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Obituaries |work=Calgary Sun |date=1981-02-11 |page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;
