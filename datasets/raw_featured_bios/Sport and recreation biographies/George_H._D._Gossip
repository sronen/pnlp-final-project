'''George Hatfeild Dingley Gossip''' (December 6, 1841 – May 11, 1907) was a minor [[English American|American-English]] [[chess]] [[chess master|master]] and writer. He competed in [[chess tournament]]s between 1870 and 1895, playing against most of the world's leading players, but with only modest success. The writer [[G. H. Diggle]] calls him &quot;the King of [[Wooden Spoon (award)|Wooden Spoonists]]&quot; because he usually finished last in strong tournaments.
Gossip was also a noted writer. His [[treatise]] ''The Chess-Player's Manual—A Complete Guide to Chess'', a 900-page tome published in 1874 after several years of work, was harshly received by the critics, largely because he had included a number of informal [[Glossary of chess#Skittles|skittles]] games that he had (atypically) won against stronger players. As a result, Gossip developed a lifelong enmity toward chess critics, whom he often attacked ferociously in his books. However, his 1879 book ''Theory of the Chess Openings'' was well received. [[Wilhelm Steinitz]], the first [[World Chess Championship|World Chess Champion]], wrote that the 1888 edition of ''The Chess-Player's Manual'' was one of the best available books on the game. Thanks in part to a 122-page appendix by [[S. Lipschütz]] in 1888, it became one of the standard [[Chess opening|opening]] works of the time.

Gossip made his living primarily as a journalist, author, and translator. He wrote for publications in England, France, Australia, and the United States. At various times he resided in each of those countries, as well as in Germany and Canada. In 1898 and 1899, two publishers issued Gossip's sole book about a subject other than chess, ''The Jew of [[Chamant]]''. Published under the [[pseudonym]] &quot;Ivan Trepoff&quot;, it was virulently [[antisemitic]].

Chess writers have often mocked Gossip's play, calling him a [[Glossary of chess#Patzer|&quot;grandpatzer&quot;]] and the like. However, [[Kenneth Whyld]], one of his previous critics, suggests that history may have judged him unfairly.

== Early life and education ==

Gossip was born in New York City on December 6, 1841, to George Hatfeild Gossip, an Englishman, and his wife Mary Ellen Dingley Gossip, of New York.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gaigep.146&quot;&gt;Gaige 1987, p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Whyld May 2001, p. 265&quot;&gt;Whyld May 2001, p. 265.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Winter August 6, 2007, discusses the unusual &quot;Hatfeild&quot; spelling.&lt;/ref&gt; When he was sixteen months old, his mother died; about two years later, he and his father moved to England.&lt;ref name=&quot;WinterGossipCCC&quot;&gt;Winter 2004 (quoting ''Columbia Chess Chronicle'', August 18, 1888, pp. 55–56).&lt;/ref&gt; His aunt, Mrs. Reaston Rodes, raised him, apparently with little involvement by his father.&lt;ref name=&quot;Whyld May 2001, p. 265&quot;/&gt; Gossip grew up at [[Barlborough Hall]], [[Derbyshire]] (the Rodes family seat) and at [[Hatfield,_South_Yorkshire#Hatfield|Hatfield]], in [[Yorkshire]].&lt;ref name=&quot;WinterGossipCCC&quot;/&gt; Both the Gossip and Rodes families are listed in ''[[Burke's Landed Gentry]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Whyld May 2001, p. 265&quot;/&gt; He was educated at Windermere College, [[Westmorland]], and won a scholarship to [[Oxford University]], but was unable to attend as his father, uncle, and aunts lost a lawsuit that ruined them financially. As a result, Gossip had to support himself through his own labors.&lt;ref name=&quot;WinterGossipCCC&quot;/&gt;

== Non-chess adult life ==
Gossip made his living primarily as a writer and translator, writing for newspapers and magazines on three continents. His profession is described in the 1871, 1881, and 1891 [[Census in the United Kingdom|United Kingdom censuses]], respectively, as a &quot;translator of languages&quot;, an &quot;author of work on chess&quot;, and a member of the &quot;literary profession&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;WinterGossip&quot;/&gt; He lived for over five years in Paris, contributing to French publications. From 1879 to 1880 he was &quot;employed occasionally as translator and otherwise&quot; in ''[[The Times]]'' of London's office in Paris.&lt;ref name=&quot;WinterGossipCCC&quot;/&gt; He also lived in Germany.&lt;ref name=&quot;WinterGossipDiggle&quot;&gt;Winter 2004 (quoting article by [[G. H. Diggle]] in ''Newsflash'', April 1983, later republished in G. H. Diggle, ''Chess Characters: Reminiscences of a Badmaster'', Chess Notes, Geneva, 1984, pp. 93–94).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:George H. D. Gossip The Jew of Chamant.jpg|left|thumb|200px|''The Jew of Chamant'', Gossip's only non-chess book]]
Gossip married Alicia (the name is sometimes given as &quot;Alice&quot;), a music teacher from Dublin, in [[Jersey]] in 1868.&lt;ref name=&quot;WinterGossip&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WhyldJuly&quot;&gt;Whyld July 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; As of 1871, they were living in London with their 11-month-old son George and two servants.&lt;ref name=&quot;WinterGossip&quot;/&gt; By 1881, Gossip and his wife had moved to [[Ipswich]], and had three more children: Helen (born ''c.'' 1872), Harold (''c.'' 1874), and Mabel (''c.'' 1879).&lt;ref name=&quot;WinterGossip&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Whyld May 2001, p. 263.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A photograph of the Gossips' house appears at Winter March 8, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; After Gossip's father died in 1882, the Gossips and their four children emigrated to Australia, arriving in January 1883.&lt;ref name=&quot;WhyldJuly&quot;/&gt; While in that country, Gossip wrote articles for the ''Sydney Star'', ''Sydney Globe'', ''Sydney Evening News'', ''Town and Country Journal'', ''[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|The Advertiser]]'' ([[Adelaide]]), and other publications. He contributed literary articles to ''Once a Month'' magazine (Melbourne) and the ''Sydney Quarterly Magazine''.&lt;ref name=&quot;WinterGossipCCC&quot;/&gt;

Gossip moved to the United States in 1888, departing in April from Sydney on the steamship ''Alameda''.&lt;ref name=&quot;WhyldJuly&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Digglep.2&quot;&gt;Diggle 1969, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MICC&quot;&gt;Mechanics' Institute Chess Club 2007 (quoting G. H. D. Gossip, ''[[International Chess Magazine]]'', June 1888, pp. 170–71).&lt;/ref&gt; In May, the ship arrived in San Francisco, where, Gossip wrote, &quot;I first set foot on my native soil after an absence of over forty years.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;MICC&quot;/&gt; He wrote articles for the ''[[San Francisco Examiner]]'' on the &quot;Chinese Question in Australia&quot; and the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' on &quot;Protection and Free Trade in New South Wales&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;WinterGossipCCC&quot;/&gt;

His family apparently remained in Australia, where Alicia died of cancer in October 1888.&lt;ref name=&quot;WhyldJuly&quot;/&gt; In 1894, Gossip's children Helen and Harold both married, in [[Victoria, Australia|Victoria]] and Melbourne, respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;WhyldJuly&quot;/&gt; Gossip's grandson, George Hatfield Dingley Gossip, born in Sydney in 1897, was a [[World War I]] [[flying ace]] for Australia, &quot;shooting down six enemy aircraft while flying his [[Sopwith Camel]] along the Belgian coast&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;WhyldJuly&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Winter 2004 (citing [http://www.theaerodrome.com/aces/australi/gossip.php George Hatfield Dingley Gossip – The Aerodrome – Aces and Aircraft of World War I]; retrieved on 2009-11-09).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1889, Gossip returned to Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;Digglep.2&quot;/&gt; By 1891, he was living as a tenant in a London [[boarding house]].&lt;ref name=&quot;WinterGossip&quot;/&gt; In 1894, he moved to Montreal, Canada.&lt;ref name=&quot;Digglep.3&quot;&gt;Diggle 1969, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; While living there, Gossip contributed articles to a newspaper in Manchester, England.&lt;ref name=&quot;WinterGossipDiggle&quot;/&gt; The June 1895 ''[[British Chess Magazine]]'' ''(BCM)'' and June 1897 [[List of chess periodicals|''American Chess Magazine'']] reported that he was living in [[Buffalo, New York]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Digglep.3&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Winter 2004 (quoting ''American Chess Magazine'', June 1897, p. 59).&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the pseudonym &quot;Ivan Trepoff&quot;, Gossip wrote a book, ''The Jew of Chamant'', which was published by Hausauer (Buffalo) in 1898, and by F.T. Neely (London and New York) in 1899. The two versions are subtitled, respectively, &quot;or, the modern [[The Count of Monte Cristo|Monte Cristo]]&quot; and &quot;a romance of crime&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Winter November 15, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The book is intensely antisemitic.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winter2009-02-14&quot;&gt;Winter February 14, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The author explains in its preface:&lt;ref name=&quot;Winter2009-02-14&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Trepoff 1899, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;My object in the present work is to paint the rich Jew in his true colors, as the enemy of society; to show that the Jew who steals millions, can, in Europe, at any rate, defy the laws with impunity, and that he almost invariably escapes punishment owing to improper occult influences, and the mighty power of Israelitish gold.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The chess literature is silent about the last decade of Gossip's life.&lt;ref name=&quot;WinterGossip&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Diggle 1969, pp. 3–4.&lt;/ref&gt; He died of heart disease on May 11, 1907, at the Railway Hotel in [[Liphook]], England.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gaigep.146&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Diggle 1969, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Winter 2004 (citing [[David Hooper (chess player)|David Hooper]], ''British Chess Magazine'', October 1964, p. 306).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chess career ==

By 1864, Gossip was appearing in London chess circles, [[draw (chess)|drawing]] a game against [[Joseph Henry Blackburne]] at a [[simultaneous exhibition]] in April.&lt;ref name=&quot;Digglep.1&quot;&gt;Diggle 1969, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; He played in a number of [[chess tournament]]s between 1870 and 1895, usually with unimpressive results.&lt;ref&gt;Di Felice 2004, pp. 51, 54, 55, 57, 59, 89, 103, 114, 117, 118, 121, 128, 129, 133, 142, 157.&lt;/ref&gt; At London 1870, the Third [[British Chess Congress|British Chess Association Congress]] (won by [[John Wisker]] after a playoff against [[Amos Burn]]), Gossip scored two of six possible [[Chess_tournament#Scoring|points]], finishing in a tie for fifth–sixth out of seven players. He had the consolation of handing Burn his only loss.&lt;ref&gt;Di Felice 2004, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Forster 2004, pp. 30–31, 43–44.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sergeant 1934, p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt; At London 1872 (won by Steinitz ahead of [[Johannes Zukertort]] and Blackburne), he scored just one out of seven, finishing seventh out of eight players.&lt;ref&gt;Di Felice 2004, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gossip won the 1873–74 [[correspondence chess]] tournament of the ''[[Chess-Players Chronicle]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Gossip and Lipschütz 1902, title page.&lt;/ref&gt; after which he &quot;was thought by some to be the strongest correspondence player known&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;HooperWhyldp.152&quot;&gt;Hooper and Whyld 1992, p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt; However, playing [[Glossary of chess#First board|first board]] for England in an 1879 correspondence chess match against the United States, he lost all four of his games to [[Ellen Gilbert]] of [[Hartford, Connecticut]]. She &quot;caused a sensation in the chess world&quot; by [[Glossary of chess#Announced mate|announcing mate]] in 21 moves in one game, and mate in 35 moves in another.&lt;ref name=&quot;HooperWhyldp.152&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brennen 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chernev 1974, pp. 132–33.&lt;/ref&gt; Gossip responded gallantly, dedicating his book ''Theory of the Chess Openings'' to her.&lt;ref name=&quot;HooperWhyldp.152&quot;/&gt;

In 1874, Gossip lost a match for the Championship Cup of the Provinces to [[John Owen (chess player)|Rev. John Owen]], retiring because of illness after one win, two draws, and two losses.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sergeant 1934, p. 163&quot;&gt;Sergeant 1934, p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; He won a local tournament at the [[Café de la Régence]] in Paris in 1880.&lt;ref&gt;Gossip 1891, p. v.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1882, he beat [[Wordsworth Donisthorpe]] in a match held at [[Simpson's Divan]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;Sergeant 1934, p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gossip's first significant success at [[Glossary of chess#Over-the-board (OTB)|over-the-board chess]] came at the 1883 London [[Vizayanagaram]] minor tournament.&lt;ref name=&quot;HooperWhyldp.155&quot;&gt;Hooper and Whyld 1992, p.&amp;nbsp;155.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The tournament was held in London at the same time as the 1883 London master tournament (won by Zukertort ahead of Steinitz). Hooper and Whyld 1992, p.&amp;nbsp;155. The minor tournament was called the Vizayanagaram tournament in recognition of a donation of 200 [[British pound|pounds]] by the [[Maharajah]] of Vizayanagaram, which was used to pay most of the prize fund in that tournament. Minchin 1883, p. xiv; Sergeant 1934, p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt; He scored 17½ out of 25, tying for fifth–sixth place out of 26 players with [[Charles Ranken]], who later co-authored the treatise ''Chess Openings Ancient and Modern'' (1889).&lt;ref name=&quot;HooperWhyldp.155&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Minchinp.xxxi&quot;&gt;Minchin 1883, p. xxxi.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;DiFelicep.89&quot;&gt;Di Felice 2004, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Curt von Bardeleben]] won with 21½&amp;nbsp;points; [[Isidor Gunsberg]], who would narrowly lose an 1890–91 [[World Chess Championship|World Championship]] match to Steinitz, finished fourth with&amp;nbsp;19 points.&lt;ref name=&quot;Minchinp.xxxi&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;DiFelicep.89&quot;/&gt;

In 1885 Gossip, a year after emigrating to Australia, issued a challenge to any player in the Australian colonies to play a match with him for 20&amp;nbsp;[[British pound|pounds]] a side and the title of Australian champion. [[Frederick Karl Esling]], a leading Melbourne player, accepted the challenge.&lt;ref name=&quot;Digglep.2&quot;/&gt; Esling won the first game, and the second was [[Glossary of chess#Adjournment|adjourned]] in a position favorable to him. Gossip then pled illness and forfeited the match.&lt;ref name=&quot;Whyld May 2001, p. 265&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kooyman 1957 (quoting letter from [[C. J. S. Purdy]]).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kenneth Whyld]] writes that the Australians probably considered Gossip a &quot;[[Anglophobia#Australia_and_New_Zealand|whingeing Pom]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Whyld May 2001, p. 265&quot;/&gt;

An Australian commentator observes, &quot;Gossip may not have been the most popular itinerant to venture to these shores in the nineteenth century, but when he announced his challenge ... he at least brought the question of an official Chess Champion of Australia before the chess playing fraternity&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Wagg in A.C.L. Partnership 1981, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1950, when Esling was 90, the Australian Chess Federation formally declared, belatedly, that he had become the first Australian Chess Champion by winning his 1885 match against Gossip.&lt;ref name=&quot;Whyld May 2001, p. 265&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Wagg in A.C.L. Partnership 1981, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Australian Championship for 90th Birthday!&quot;, ''Chess World'', July 1, 1950, pp. 149-61.&lt;/ref&gt; The Second [[Australian Chess Championship]], a tournament, was held at Adelaide in 1887. Gossip finished third with 6½ out of 9, behind [[Henry Charlick]] (7½&amp;nbsp;points) and Esling (7&amp;nbsp;points).&lt;ref name=&quot;Digglep.2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Di Felice 2004, p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt;

After returning to America in 1888, Gossip obtained an appointment at the [[Columbia University|Columbia Chess Club]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Digglep.2&quot;/&gt; The following year, he represented England at the [[American_Chess_Congress#Sixth_American_Chess_Congress|Sixth American Chess Congress]] (New York 1889), one of the greatest tournaments of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Christiaan M. Bijl calls it &quot;one of the greatest chess tournaments of the 19th century&quot;. Preface to Steinitz 1891 (1982 Olms edition). The Report of the Tournament Committee states that Gossip represented England. Steinitz 1891, p. XXII.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;According to Chessmetrics, New York 1889 was the strongest tournament between 1889 and 1894, and contained five of the top ten players in the world at the time. Chessmetrics, Summary: 1889-1894.&lt;/ref&gt; The Congress, a double [[Round-robin tournament|round robin]] that was one of the longest tournaments in history, was intended to select a challenger for the world championship title.&lt;ref&gt;Hooper and Whyld 1992, p. 446 (&quot;Miksa or Max Weiss&quot; entry).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Steinitz 1891, pp. xii, xx.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sergeant 1934, pp. 210, 232.&lt;/ref&gt; There, Gossip had what [[G. H. Diggle]] calls &quot;perhaps the best performance of his career&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Digglep.2&quot;/&gt; He scored 13½ out of 38 (11&amp;nbsp;wins, 5&amp;nbsp;draws, 22&amp;nbsp;losses), finishing 17th–18th out of 20 players. He won games from [[S. Lipschütz]], [[Max Judd]], [[Eugene Delmar]], [[Jackson Showalter]], [[William Pollock (chess player)|William Pollock]] (twice), [[Henry Bird (chess player)|Henry Bird]] (twice), [[David Graham Baird]], [[James Moore Hanham]], and [[John Washington Baird]].&lt;ref name=&quot;WinterGossip&quot;&gt;Winter 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Di Felicep.117&quot;&gt;Di Felice 2004, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mikhail Chigorin]] and [[Max Weiss]] tied for first with 29&amp;nbsp;points, edging out Gunsberg (28½&amp;nbsp;points).&lt;ref name=&quot;Di Felicep.117&quot;/&gt;

Gossip was unable to repeat even this modest level of success in his final tournaments. He finished last in five consecutive strong events: the Master Section at London 1889 (scoring 1½ out of 10; Bird won on tiebreak over Gunsberg); the ''Meisterturnier'' (Master Tournament) at [[Breslau]] 1889 (scoring three out of ten; [[Siegbert Tarrasch]] won); the Master Section of [[Manchester]] 1890 (scoring four out of nineteen; Tarrasch won); the Master Tournament at London 1892 (scoring 2½ out of 11; future World Champion [[Emanuel Lasker]] won); and New York 1893 (scoring 2½ out of 13; Lasker won with a [[List_of_world_records_in_chess#Perfect_tournament_and_match_scores|perfect score]]).&lt;ref&gt;Di Felice 2004, pp. 114, 118, 121, 133, 142.&lt;/ref&gt; Gossip's run of last-place finishes moved Diggle to dub him &quot;the King of [[Wooden spoon (award)|Wooden Spoonists]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;WinterGossipDiggle&quot;/&gt; Gossip's last event was a minor tournament in [[Skaneateles (town), New York|Skaneateles, New York]] in July–August 1895, where he scored three out of six, finishing in a tie for third–fifth of seven players.&lt;ref&gt;Di Felice 2004, p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reichhelm 1898, p. 43. Consistent with the June 1895 ''BCM'', Reichhelm gives Buffalo as Gossip's city of residence. ''Id.''&lt;/ref&gt;

A report in the ''BCM'' in 1889 observed that Gossip suffered from great nervousness that prevented him from fully displaying his abilities at chess tournaments, where he had to stop his ears &quot;to keep out the low hum inseparable from a large concourse of people&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Digglepp.2-3&quot;&gt;Diggle 1969, pp. 2–3.&lt;/ref&gt; Bird likewise wrote that minor distractions that he would not even notice would &quot;drive ... Gossip to despair&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Bird 1893, pp. 240–41.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''BCM'' commentator accordingly believed that Gossip &quot;would make a good stand in a single encounter with men who are much higher in the tournament than he is&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Digglepp.2-3&quot;/&gt;

Following his move to Montreal, Gossip in a letter to a friend dated October 20, 1894 complained, &quot;The [[French Canadian]] Chessplayers here are the poorest, meanest [[humbug]]s I ever met – all [[Jesuit]]s.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;WinterGossipDiggle&quot;/&gt; He and Pollock played a match at the Montreal Chess Club in December 1894 and January 1895; each won six games, with five draws.&lt;ref name=&quot;WinterGossipDiggle&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Digglep.3&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rowland 1899, pp. 4, 10, 136–39.&lt;/ref&gt; This was an impressive result for Gossip &quot;in view of Pollock's undoubted strength&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Digglep.3&quot;/&gt; Later in 1895, Pollock finished 19th out of 22 players, scoring 8 out of 21 (including wins over Tarrasch and Steinitz), at [[Hastings 1895]],&lt;ref&gt;Di Felice 2004, p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Soltis 1975, pp. 76–77.&lt;/ref&gt; arguably at that time the strongest tournament in history.&lt;ref&gt;[[Garry Kasparov]] calls Hastings 1895 &quot;the most important tournament of the nineteenth century&quot;. Kasparov 2003, p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur Bisguier]] and [[Andrew Soltis]] call Hastings 1895 the &quot;greatest tournament of the nineteenth century&quot;. Bisguier &amp; Soltis 1974, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; Diggle writes that Gossip's drawn match with Pollock vindicates the ''BCM'''s 1889 observation that Gossip would be more at home in a match than a tournament.&lt;ref name=&quot;Digglep.3&quot;/&gt;

Gossip was only a minor master, &quot;a mediocre player who figured at or near the bottom of every better than average tourney in which he participated&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Reinfeld 1950, pp. 29, 38.&lt;/ref&gt; However, during his career he played tournament games against most of the world's leading players, including World Champions Lasker&lt;ref&gt;Gossip lost to Lasker at London 1892 and New York 1893. Di Felice 2004, pp. 133, 142.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lasker was World Champion from 1894 to 1921. Kažić 1974, p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt; and Steinitz;&lt;ref&gt;Gossip lost to Steinitz at London 1872. Di Felice 2004, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Steinitz was World Champion from 1886 to 1894. Kažić 1974, p. 206; Hooper and Whyld 1992, p. 395. Some consider Steinitz's reign to have begun in 1866, after he won a match against [[Adolf Anderssen]], Golombek 1977, p. 309; Fine 1983, p. 30, or 1872, after he won his first match against Zukertort. Sunnucks 1970, pp. 440–41.&lt;/ref&gt; World Championship challengers Zukertort,&lt;ref&gt;Gossip lost to Zukertort at London 1872.

[[File:Gossip Chess-Player's Manual (2).jpg|right|thumb|200px|''The Chess-Player's Manual'' by George H. D. Gossip and S. Lipschütz (1902 edition)]]

As of 1874, Gossip was the chess editor of ''The Hornet''.&lt;ref&gt;Forster 2004, p. 85 (quoting [[Amos Burn]] in the ''Liverpool Weekly Albion'', September 5, 1874).&lt;/ref&gt; In that year, after several years' work, he published his ''[[Masterpiece|magnum opus]]'', ''The Chess-Player's Manual—A Complete Guide to Chess''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Digglep.1&quot;/&gt; It was &quot;a handsomely produced work with more than 800 of its 900&amp;nbsp;pages devoted to openings and illustrative games&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;HooperWhyldp.155&quot;/&gt; The book became the subject of biting criticism, largely because Gossip had included 27 illustrative games that he had won against leading players of the day, and only 12 games that he had lost.&lt;ref name=&quot;Digglep.1&quot;/&gt; Steinitz later wrote:&lt;ref name=&quot;WinterGossipSteinitz&quot;&gt;Winter 2004 (quoting Steinitz, ''International Chess Magazine'', May 1888, pp. 137–38).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Mr Gossip had practiced the unfair ruse of carefully preserving stray [[Glossary_of_chess#Skittles|skittles]] games which he had happened to win or draw, generally after many defeats, against masters whose public records stood far above his own, ... thus leading the public to believe that the author stood on a par with them, or was even their superior.&lt;/blockquote&gt; According to Diggle, this edition of the book &quot;failed utterly&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;WinterGossipDiggle&quot;/&gt; The harsh reception accorded it embittered Gossip against chess critics for the rest of his life.&lt;ref name=&quot;Digglep.1&quot;/&gt;

In 1879, Gossip published ''Theory of the Chess Openings'', a shorter work more in the style of ''[[Modern Chess Openings]]'', which sold out within six months.&lt;ref name=&quot;HooperWhyldp.155&quot;/&gt; The preface and the concluding chapter of the book bitterly attacked the critics who had savaged his earlier treatise.&lt;ref name=&quot;Digglep.2&quot;/&gt; This time the critics, &quot;while deploring 'the outside slices of Mr. Gossip's sandwich'&amp;nbsp;&quot;, praised the main body of the work. [[William Wayte]] in the ''[[Chess Players Chronicle]]'' called the book &quot;fairly in possession of the field among English elementary treatises&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Digglep.2&quot;/&gt; Unfortunately for Gossip, he &quot;was the victim of an act of gross [[copyright infringement|piracy]], as many copies forming no part of the edition printed by his orders were circulated in America and the 'pirates' never brought to justice.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;WinterGossipDiggle&quot;/&gt;
[[File:Gossip's Vest-Pocket Chess Manual 2.jpg|left|thumb|150px|''Gossip's Vest-Pocket Chess Manual'']]

While in Australia, Gossip wrote a chess column that appeared in ''Once a Month'' magazine from February to October 1885.&lt;ref&gt;Ken Fraser in A.C.L. Partnership 1981, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

A new edition of ''The Chess-Player's Manual'' was published in 1888, this one with a 122-page appendix by Lipschütz.&lt;ref&gt;Winter 2004. Lipschütz's first name is unknown, with various sources giving it as &quot;Samuel&quot;, &quot;Solomon&quot;, and &quot;Simon&quot;. Winter April 30, 2007; Gaige 1987, p. 251.&lt;/ref&gt; Steinitz wrote that &quot;Mr Gossip has produced a useful work, which in some respects must be regarded even superior to that of [[Howard Staunton|Staunton]] or any other previous writers on the chess openings. ... But the most meritorious distinguishing feature of the Manual is the large collection of illustrative games by various first-class masters, and in that respect Mr Gossip's work stands second only to Signor Salvioli's ''Teoria e Pratica'' among the analytical works in any language.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;WinterGossipSteinitz&quot;/&gt; The following year, Steinitz cited it in ''The Modern Chess Instructor'' as one of the 12 principal authorities he had relied on in writing that treatise.&lt;ref&gt;Steinitz 1889, pp. viii–ix.&lt;/ref&gt;

An anonymous reviewer in ''[[The New York Times]]'' called the new edition of ''The Chess-Player's Manual'' &quot;probably the most convenient, trustworthy, and satisfactory chess book accessible in the English language&quot;. The reviewer concluded that the games and [[Chess problems|problems]] in the volume would &quot;afford great entertainment&quot; to the casual enthusiast, &quot;while for real students of chess ... it is very nearly indispensable&quot;. He also praised &quot;Mr. Lipschütz's appendix, which brings the development of the openings almost down to date&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times'' 1888.&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Hooper (chess player)|David Hooper]] and [[Kenneth Whyld]] write in ''[[The Oxford Companion to Chess]]'' that Lipschütz's appendix &quot;helped to make this one of the standard opening books of the time&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Hooper and Whyld 1992, p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt; World Champion [[Bobby Fischer]] had a copy of ''The Chess-Player's Manual'' in his personal library,&lt;ref&gt;Brady 1973, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; and cited it in his famous 1961 article &quot;A [[Glossary of chess#Bust|Bust]] to the [[King's Gambit]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer wrote, &quot;The Chessplayers [sic] Manual&quot; by Gossip and Lipschutz, published in 1874, devotes 237 pages to this gambit without arriving at a conclusion.&quot; Fischer 1961, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Nick de Firmian]] refers to &quot;A Bust to the King's Gambit&quot; as &quot;Bobby Fischer's famous article&quot;. de Firmian 2009, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrew Soltis]] calls it &quot;a celebrated article&quot;. Müller 2009, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:International Chess Magazine.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Steinitz's ''International Chess Magazine'' (1888)]]
The June 1888 issue of Steinitz's ''[[International Chess Magazine]]'' contained an article by Gossip that Robert John McCrary calls &quot;a very illuminating, important, and detailed account of the state of San Francisco chess&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;McCrary (book), p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McCrary (Internet).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;An excerpt from the article appears in Mechanics' Institute Chess Club 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; For the last few months of 1888 Gossip was listed as being on the &quot;Editorial Staff&quot; of the ''Columbia Chess Chronicle''. Its December 29, 1888 issue contained a lengthy article by him entitled &quot;Chess in the Present Day&quot;, which offered a broad sweep of chess history and the advances made by chess in the United States. Gossip called [[Paul Morphy]] and Steinitz &quot;the two greatest chessplayers that have ever lived&quot; and remarked that &quot;no Englishman has yet attained, or probably ever will attain, to the eminence of chess champion of the world. ... The deep-thinking German, the brilliant Frenchman and the versatile American have always been too much for sober, stolid [[John Bull]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;WinterGossip&quot;/&gt;

Gossip in 1891 published a second revised edition of his ''Theory of the Chess Openings'', which Diggle calls &quot;a handsome volume with an appendix of sixty-one pages&quot;. Characteristically, he devoted much of the appendix to criticizing his detractors and anticipating their further attacks.&lt;ref name=&quot;Digglep.3&quot;/&gt;

Gossip also wrote the lesser-known chess books ''The Chess Players' Text Book'' (1889), ''The Chess-player's Vade Mecum and Pocket Guide to the Openings'' (1891), ''Modern Chess Brilliancies'' (1892), ''The Chess Player's Pocket Guide to Games at [[Chess handicap|Odds]]'' (1893), ''The Chess Pocket Manual'' (1894), ''The Chess Player's Mentor'' (with [[Francis Joseph Lee]], 1895), ''The Complete Chess-Guide'' (with Lee, 1903), ''Gossip's Vest-Pocket Chess Manual'' (date unknown; pictured at above left), and a collection of his own games, ''Games: G. H. D. Gossip versus Bezkrowny, [[Albert Clerc|Clerc]], Donisthorpe, Gocher, Gunsberg, [[Leopold Hoffer|Hoffer]], Owen, Sanders, Vines Played During the Last 10 Years in England &amp; France'' (1882, with Gunsberg and Steinitz).&lt;ref&gt;WorldCat.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Betts 2005, pp. 603, 618.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Gossip in 1893.jpg|left|thumb|165px|Gossip at New York 1893]]
Burn's biographer Richard Forster notes that Gossip &quot;was well-known for his exaggerated self-esteem&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Forster 2004, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Philip Sergeant]] in his book ''A Century of British Chess'' remarks that his &quot;play was never quite up to his own estimate of it&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sergeant 1934, p. 163&quot;/&gt; ''The New York Times'' portrays him at the Sixth American Chess Congress (1889) as follows:&lt;ref name=&quot;WinterGossip&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Winter August 10, 2008 (quoting &quot;The Chessboard Kings: Ways and Looks of 20 Great Players&quot;, ''The New York Times'', June 16, 1889, p. 8).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Gossip, with his long, flowing beard, looks like one of the old-time monks. He has a good-shaped cranium, bald at the top, and is a little above the medium height. ... He believes himself to be one of the greatest chessplayers in the world, and thinks that if everything had gone on to his liking he could have beaten all the champions at the tournament. He is a deliberate player, but every now and then he takes a nip from a flask of brandy that generally stands on his table. He complained that his chair was too low, and he once attributed a defeat to that. Finally, he got a large ledger and sat upon it. He did, in fact, seem to derive some inspiration from its contents, for he played two or three excellent games afterward.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Diggle observes that Gossip &quot;developed 'a happy knack of treading on other people's corns' by rushing into print&quot; his occasional wins in offhand games against such leading players as Bird and Zukertort.&lt;ref name=&quot;Digglep.1&quot;/&gt; He also vehemently denounced his critics and those with whom he disagreed. For example, in 1888 the ''Columbia Chess Chronicle'' quoted a lecture he had given two days before on the [[Vienna_Game#Steinitz_Gambit|Steinitz Gambit]]. After condemning as &quot;utterly worthless&quot; the analysis of that opening published in two English periodicals, Gossip declaimed:&lt;ref&gt;Winter 2004 (quoting ''Columbia Chess Chronicle'', September 15, 1888, pp.&amp;nbsp;91–92).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;In order, therefore, to establish an important point of theory, and at the same time to prevent American chessplayers from being misled and deceived by the superficial analysis of incompetent British chess editors, whose object in condemning the Steinitz Gambit has obviously been mainly to depreciate the originality of its illustrious inventor, whom they invariably try to drag down to their own miserable level of shallow incompetency and self-conceit, I submit the following variations which at any rate possess the undeniable merit of exposing the hollow analytical twaddle continually published in the two London journals above named.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hooper and Whyld note Gossip's &quot;unusual talent for making enemies&quot; and attribute the critical reception of his books to this, since in their opinion &quot;his books were not significantly worse than the general run of the time, and they were better than, for example, those by Bird, who was popular&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;HooperWhyldp.155&quot;/&gt; They remark on his travels that, &quot;Disliked in England, he travelled to Australia, the United States, and Canada, where he also became unpopular.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;HooperWhyldp.155&quot;/&gt; Some measure of his talent for stirring up controversy is provided by a letter Pollock wrote during their 1894–95 match:&lt;ref&gt;Whyld July 2001 (quoting ''The Four-leaved Shamrock'', 1911).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;I and Gossip are six each and may draw the match. He has proved a terrible crank and has had several games by forfeit, and one &quot;cancelled&quot;. He now has a [[libel]] suit against the chess column of the ''[[The_Gazette_(Montreal)#History|Herald]]''. ... We have just agreed, per the committee, to call the match a draw. Whereby all parties are relieved.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Chess historian [[Edward Winter (chess historian)|Edward Winter]] observes that &quot;Gossip has always been a soft target for mockery&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;WinterGossip&quot;/&gt; He notes that Hooper and Whyld in the first edition (1984) of ''The Oxford Companion to Chess'' &quot;treated him essentially as light relief&quot;; the second edition (1992) treated him more equitably, but like the first omitted any mention of his performance at New York 1889.&lt;ref name=&quot;WinterGossip&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See Hooper and Whyld 1984, p. 131; Hooper and Whyld 1992, pp. 155–56.&lt;/ref&gt; Yakov Damsky in ''The Batsford Book of Chess Records'' (2005), addressing the question of which player &quot;achieved the greatest negative distinction&quot; on the international level, opines that Gossip &quot;can probably feel safe from competition&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Damsky 2005, p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt; Mike Fox and Richard James in their book ''The Even More Complete Chess Addict'' (1993) write that, &quot;Of players who've entered chess history, perhaps the strongest claimant for the all-time [[Glossary of chess#Patzer|grandpatzer]] title is George Hatfeild Dingley Gossip (1841–1907). George had a worse record in major tournaments than anyone in history (last at Breslau 1889, London 1889, Manchester 1890, London 1892, and New York 1893: a total of just four wins, 52 losses and 21 draws).&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Fox and James 1993, p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt; Like Hooper and Whyld, they overlook his result at New York 1889, a major tournament where he won 11 games and finished above the bottom.&lt;ref&gt;Winter 2004. Gossip's 13.5 points equalled the combined scores of the last two finishers ([[John Washington Baird]], 7 points and [[Nicholas MacLeod]], 6.5 points). Gossip's draw against Weiss (ChessGames.com (Gossip-Weiss)) could be said to have determined the outcome of the tournament, since if Weiss had won the game he would have won the tournament outright rather than tying with Chigorin for first place.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2001 article, Whyld himself takes notice of Gossip's result at New York 1889 and suggests that &quot;history has perhaps given him an unfair verdict&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Whyld May 2001, p. 264.&lt;/ref&gt;

By [[Arpad Elo|Arpad Elo's]] calculation, Gossip's strength during his five-year peak was equivalent to an [[Elo rating]] of 2310.&lt;ref&gt;Elo 1978, p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt; Today [[FIDE]], the World Chess Federation, often awards the [[Grandmaster_(chess)#Current_regulations|Grandmaster]] title to players with Elo ratings of 2500 and above, and the lesser [[International Master]] and [[FIDE Master]] titles to players rated at least 2400 and 2300, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Under [http://www.fide.com/component/handbook/?id=58&amp;view=article FIDE Regulation 1.5] (FIDE; retrieved on 2009-11-11), a player can achieve the Grandmaster title by earning two or more [[Glossary of chess#Norm|grandmaster norms]] in events covering at least 27&amp;nbsp;games, and attaining a rating of 2500 at some point. Likewise, a player can achieve the International Master title by achieving the requisite International Master norms and attaining a rating of 2400 at some point. Under [http://www.fide.com/component/handbook/?id=58&amp;view=article FIDE Regulation 1.3] (FIDE; retrieved on 2009-11-11), a player who achieves a published rating of 2300 is entitled to the FIDE Master title.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another assessment system, [[Chessmetrics]], calculates that Gossip's highest rating was 2470 (number 50 in the world) in April 1889.&lt;ref name=&quot;SonasGossip&quot;&gt;Sonas, Chessmetrics Player Profile: George Gossip.&lt;/ref&gt; By comparison, the world's three highest-rated players at that time had Chessmetrics ratings over 2700.&lt;ref&gt;Sonas, April 1889 rating list.&lt;/ref&gt; Chessmetrics also ranks Gossip number 17 in the world during four one-month periods between February and July 1873,&lt;ref name=&quot;SonasGossip&quot;/&gt; when opportunities for high-level competition were much rarer.&lt;ref&gt;Fine 1983, pp. 16, 31, 49.&lt;/ref&gt; Like Diggle, Chessmetrics considers New York 1889 Gossip's best individual performance, concluding that he scored 39% against opponents with an average rating of 2595, giving him a [[Glossary of chess#Performance rating|performance rating]] of 2539 for that tournament.&lt;ref name=&quot;SonasGossip&quot;/&gt; In 1904, the ''[[Deutsche Schachzeitung]]'', on the basis of its tabulation of players' percentage scores in all major international tournaments from [[London 1851 chess tournament|London 1851]] to [[Cambridge Springs, Pennsylvania|Cambridge Springs 1904]], ranked Gossip the number 62 living player in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Forster 2004, p. 669 (reproducing table from the ''Deutsche Schachzeitung'', July 1904, pp. 222–23).&lt;/ref&gt;

Diggle writes that despite his faults, Gossip was &quot;a man of dauntless courage and infinite capacity for hard work&quot;, which enabled him to become a recognized author despite the disastrous reception that the first edition of his ''Chess-Player's Manual'' received. His literary style was vigorous, and shows him to be an educated and well-read man.&lt;ref name=&quot;Digglep.3&quot;/&gt;

[[Fred Reinfeld]] calls the game &quot;a glorious masterpiece&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Reinfeld 1950, p. 29. However, echoing the general contempt for Gossip, Reinfeld begins his discussion of the game by observing, &quot;Every dog has his day.&quot; ''Id.''&lt;/ref&gt; Steinitz proclaims, &quot;One of the finest specimens of sacrificing play on record. Mr. Gossip deserves the highest praise for the ingenuity and depth of combination which he displayed in this game.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Steinitz 1891, p. 388.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reinfeld 1950, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; Soltis writes that &quot;there were many raised eyebrows&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Soltis 1978, p. 197.&lt;/ref&gt; when the tournament committee awarded the prize for the best-played game not to Gossip for this game, but to Gunsberg for his win over Mason.&lt;ref&gt;ChessGames.com (Mason–Gunsberg).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Steinitz 1891, pp. 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wellmuth 1943, pp. 88–89.&lt;/ref&gt; After comparing the two games, Whyld writes, &quot;The verdict seems clear. Gossip was robbed!&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Whyld May 2001, p. 265&quot;/&gt; Diggle states, &quot;Gossip was, of course, the last man to keep quiet about this decision, and for once he had considerable public sympathy on his side.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Diggle 1969, p. 2. Pollock won the [[Glossary of chess#Brilliancy prize|brilliancy prize]] for his scintillating victory over Weiss. Steinitz 1891, pp. 2–3; Soltis 1978, p. 197; Wellmuth 1943, pp. 89–90.

When facing world-class opponents, Gossip more often fell victim to their combinations. A famous example is his loss, also at New York 1889, to [[Mikhail Chigorin]] (White), who lost world championship matches to Steinitz in 1889 and 1892.&lt;ref&gt;ChessGames.com (Chigorin–Gossip).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sukhin 2007, pp. 140, 147.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'''1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.c3 d5''' 3...Nf6 is the safest response if Black is not well versed in the ensuing complications—as Gossip proves not to be.&lt;ref&gt;Kaufman 2004, p. 343.&lt;/ref&gt; '''4.Qa4 f6 5.Bb5 Ne7 6.exd5&amp;nbsp;Qxd5 7.O-O''' 7.d4! is the main line today.&lt;ref&gt;de Firmian 2008, p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; '''7...Bd7?''' 7...e4! 8.Ne1 Bf5 9.f3 leads to [[Glossary of chess#Equalise/Equalize|equality]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bogoljubovp.39&quot;&gt;Bogoljubov 1987, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; '''8.d4 e4 9.Nfd2 Ng6?''' 9...f5! was correct.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bogoljubovp.39&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Damskyp.109&quot;&gt;Damsky 2005, p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; '''10.Bc4 Qa5 11.Qb3 f5?''' 11...0-0-0! was the best chance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bogoljubovp.39&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Damskyp.109&quot;/&gt; '''12.Bf7+ Ke7?'''
