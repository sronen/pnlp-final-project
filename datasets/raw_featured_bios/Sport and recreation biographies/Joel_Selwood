'''Joel Anthony Selwood''' (born 26 May 1988) is an [[Australian rules football]]er and the current captain of the [[Geelong Football Club]] in the [[Australian Football League]] (AFL). A midfielder, {{convert|1.82|m|ft|sigfig=2}} tall and weighing {{convert|86|kg|sigfig=2}}, Selwood is able to contribute [[Australian rules football positions#Midfield|inside or outside]] while [[Midfielder (Australian Rules)|on the ball]].

A standout junior [[Track and field athletics|track and field athlete]] and footballer, Selwood entered top-level football early, joining the [[TAC Cup]] competition as a [[TAC Cup#Age eligibility|bottom-aged player]]. His accomplishments as a junior included [[Most Valuable Player]] awards at state and international levels, captaining Australia in the [[International Rules Series]], and selection in the [[All-Australian]] and [[TAC Cup|TAC Cup Team of the Year]] sides. Despite a serious knee injury during his final year of junior football, Selwood was selected with Geelong's first [[AFL Draft|pick]], and seventh overall, in the [[2006 AFL Draft]].

Selwood made his AFL debut in 2007, winning the [[AFL Rising Star Award]] and [[AFLPA Awards|AFLPA Best First Year Player Award]]. He has since become a [[AFL premiership medallion|triple premiership player]], a two-time [[All-Australian]], a [[Carji Greeves Medal]]list, and the youngest-ever recipient of the [[AFLPA Awards|AFLPA Robert Rose Most Courageous Player Award]]. Selwood has also represented the [[Victoria Australian rules football team|Victorian]] state team as the youngest player to feature in the [[all-star]] event, and was awarded the [[Michael Tuck Medal]] following Geelong's 2009 [[NAB Cup]] victory. As of 2011, Selwood holds the second highest winning–percentage record of any player in AFL history, helping the club reach three successive [[AFL Grand Final]]s from 2007–2009 and another in 2011.

Selwood's on-field success has led to several commercial and ambassadorial deals with companies including: [[Asics]], [[Auskick]], [[Cotton On]], [[National Australia Bank]], [[Seeing Eye Dogs Australia]], and [[The Smith's Snackfood Company|Smith's]].

His performances in the championships earned him end-of-year [[All-Australian]] honours and the [[Most Valuable Player]] award for Victoria Country. In addition, he was named in the TAC Cup Team of the Year, awarded a scholarship within the prestigious [[Australian Institute of Sport|AIS-AFL Academy]], and subsequently captained his older teammates in the annual under-18s [[International Rules Series]] in Ireland.
