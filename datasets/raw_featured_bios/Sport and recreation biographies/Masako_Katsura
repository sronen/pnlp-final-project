Katsura trailblazed a path for women in the sport by competing and placing among the best in the male-dominated world of professional billiards. First learning the game from her brother-in-law and then under the tutelage of Japanese champion [[Kinrey Matsuyama]], Katsura became Japan's only female professional player. In competition in Japan she took second place in the country's national [[three-cushion billiards]] championship three times. In [[Exhibition game|exhibition]] she was noted for {{Cuegloss|run|running}} 10,000 points at the game of [[Balkline and straight rail|straight rail]].

After marrying a U.S. Army non-commissioned officer in 1950, Katsura emigrated with him to the United States in 1951. There she was invited to play in the 1952 U.S.-sponsored World Three-Cushion Championship, ultimately taking seventh place at that competition. Katsura was the first woman ever to be included in any world billiards tournament. Her fame cemented, Katsura went on an exhibition tour of the United States with 8-time world champion [[Welker Cochran]], and later with 51-time world champion [[Willie Hoppe]]. In 1953 and 1954 she again competed for the world three-cushion crown, taking fifth and fourth places respectively.

Little was seen of Katsura for the next few years. She made 30 exhibition appearances in 1958, and went on a one-week exhibition engagement the following year with [[Harold Worst]], but did not compete in any professional tournaments. In 1959, she made two television appearances on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC's]] ''[[You Asked for It]]'', and one on the [[CBS]] primetime television hit ''[[What's My Line?]]''. Katsura returned to competition in 1961, playing a challenge match for the World Three-Cushion title against Worst, then reigning world champion, and was defeated by him. Katsura disappeared from the sport thereafter, only making a brief impromptu appearance in 1976. She moved back to Japan in about 1990 and died in 1995.

Following the competition, Jay Bozeman, said &quot;We've found it hard to believe that a woman could actually step into the best billiard championship in the world and hold her own. Miss Katsura is one of the finest players I've faced in a world's tournament,&lt;ref name=&quot;Salina&quot; /&gt; while [[Welker Cochran]], five-time holder of the Billiards World Crown, predicted:&lt;ref name=&quot;Ada&quot; /&gt; &quot;Given another two or three years of American competition and she will be the world's champion.... Masako has opened a new field for women. Her presence has made the game attractive to women for the first time. She has the power of a man and strokes beautifully. Her maneuvers with the cue ball are fantastic. All she needs is a bit more experience and she will be unbeatable.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ada&quot; /&gt;

{{quote box|quote=Masako Katsura was the greatest thing that ever happened in the whole history of billiards... maybe the greatest thing that ever happened period. For a woman to compete on absolutely equal terms with men... and a cute, feminine woman, at that... why, it's never been done before or since. She was not competing against just any men, understand, she was competing against the greatest players in the world. She was a sensation.

Soon after the 1952 championship, Cochran announced he was coming out of a seven-year retirement to play an [[Exhibition game|exhibition]] tour with Katsura.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGoorty&quot; /&gt; &quot;Millions of fans want to see this charming first lady of billiards&quot; he said, &quot;now some of them can.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dixon&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://newspaperarchive.com/PdfViewerTags.aspx?img=45704893|format=fee required|title=Woman Cueist to Open Tour|work=Dixon Evening Telegraph|date=April 17, 1952|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The duo previewed their tour with a three-day engagement at the Garden City Parlor in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]] starting on April 18, 1952. Thereafter, they planned stops in [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] (May 2–3); Chicago (May 5–11); Detroit in mid-May; and on to tentative stops in Cleveland, [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], Boston, Philadelphia, Dallas, San Diego, Los Angeles and [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]]. The format was to be a 100-point straight-rail match, followed by a 50-point three-cushion game played under tournament conditions&lt;ref name=&quot;Dixon&quot; /&gt; with trick or &quot;fancy&quot; shots to follow.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://newspaperarchive.com/PdfViewerTags.aspx?img=32430746|format=fee required|title=Woman Billiard Player to compete in City Matches|work=Suburbanite Economist|date=May 7, 1952|page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; Katsura stated prior to departing: &quot;I hope my tour will convince women that billiards is not only a man's game. Women can play just as well as men.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lima&quot; /&gt;

Billiards champion [[Tex Zimmerman]] (Cochran's partner in the 924 Club)&lt;ref name=&quot;Oakland2&quot; /&gt; and well known pool [[Hustling|hustler]] [[Danny McGoorty]] had a hand in organizing the tour. In preparation, they played up Katsura's exoticness and her physical attractiveness. Tex Zimmerman's wife sewed tight-fitting kimonos for Katsura, slit up the side, which she wore during her exhibitions with high heels.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGoorty&quot; /&gt; Katsura was a tiny woman, weighing between 88&lt;ref name=&quot;Niagara&quot; /&gt; and 96&amp;nbsp;pounds.&lt;ref name=&quot;Time&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|first=Staff writers|date=March 17, 1952|title=Lady with a Cue|journal=Time Magazine|publisher=Time|volume=LIX|issue=11|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,816134-1,00.html?iid=perma_share}}&lt;/ref&gt; and standing 5&amp;nbsp;feet tall—just about the height of a standard [[cue stick]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Niagara&quot; /&gt; McGoorty later mused: &quot;Masako was cute! She was thirty-nine years old but she looked twenty-nine. She hopped around that table on her high heels, giving the fans a little smile, and everybody loved her.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;McGoorty&quot; /&gt;

It was Katsura's playing ability, though, rather than her other charms, that made her a phenomenon.  When Cochran returned from his tour with Katsura he told McGoorty, who was a world class player in his own right, &quot;you will have trouble with her.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;McGoorty&quot; /&gt; When they finally got a chance to play, the match drew crowds. &quot;They could have sold seats in the toilet!&quot; McGoorty exclaimed.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGoorty&quot; /&gt; After the match, McGoorty confirmed Cochran's prediction: {{Quote|I had trouble with her. I played hard and I threw her all the dirtiest stuff I knew, and I was lucky to win five out of the ten games. If you had the slightest idea of easing up on her because she was only a cute little girl, you were dead. She would murder you. I found out damn quick you could not leave her an open shot. If you did she would take those balls away from you and stick them right up your pooper. The killer instinct—that broad had it, and never mind the little smile.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGoorty&quot; /&gt;}}

A number of pre-booked stops on the tour suffered from lack of attendance. Cochran was very bitter about it. [[United Media|NEA]] sports editor, Harry Grayson indicated that the game was in general decline, and said that Cochran &quot;traces the decline of championship and exhibition billiards to manufacturers taking the stars off the payroll during the depression.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Warren&quot; /&gt; In a previous exhibition tour by Cochran and Hoppe in 1945, they had sold out in 13 cities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Warren&quot; /&gt; Despite some lackluster stops, upon her return to California, Katsura continued to play exhibition matches with the game's greats. Katsura and Kilgore put on a week long exhibition in San Francisco in January 1953, where they seesawed back and forth. On January 12, Katsura beat Kilgore in their first match with runs of seven and ten, but lost to him in their second. The total points scored by the two at that time was 349 for Katsura to Kilgore's 379.&lt;ref name=&quot;Times&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://newspaperarchive.com/PdfViewerTags.aspx?img=47405177|format=fee required|title=Miss Kalsura Beats Cue Champ Kilgore|work=The Times|date=January 13, 1953|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Katsura started another exhibition series with Cochran at his club in February 1953&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://newspaperarchive.com/PdfViewerTags.aspx?img=43315850|format=fee required|title=Exhibition Billiard Series to Open|work=Oakland Tribune|date=February 1, 1953|page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, tuning up for the 1953 world tournament, to start on March 26, went on a nationwide tour with Willie Hoppe in the latter part of February 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://newspaperarchive.com/PdfViewerTags.aspx?img=94029826|format=fee required|title=Hoppe Vs.

Little was heard from Katsura for many years after the 1961 world championship.
