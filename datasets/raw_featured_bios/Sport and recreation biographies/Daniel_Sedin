==Playing career==
===Modo Hockey (1997–2000)===
Aged 16, Daniel and Henrik began their professional careers in 1997–98 with Modo Hockey of the [[Elitserien|Swedish Elite League]]. Daniel recorded 12 points over 45 games during his rookie season.

This option required that they play [[junior ice hockey|junior hockey]] in North America, which was not their intention.&lt;ref name=mirror/&gt; Barnett also suggested either Henrik or Daniel opt out of the 1999 draft, hoping that the team that selected the first twin would select the other the following year.&lt;ref name=mirror/&gt;  On the possibility of the Sedins' playing for separate teams, [[Vancouver Canucks]] scout [[Thomas Gradin]] commented, &quot;They're good enough to play with anyone, but separately their capacity might decrease by 10 or 15 percent.&quot;&lt;ref name=mirror/&gt; Nevertheless, Henrik and Daniel both entered the 1999 draft expecting to be selected by separate teams.&lt;ref name=tiger/&gt;  However, through a series of transactions,{{#tag:ref|The Canucks already possessed the 3rd overall pick in the [[1999 NHL Entry Draft]] that was used to select [[Henrik Sedin]].

#The 4th overall pick acquired from the Blackhawks was then traded along with two third-round picks in the 1999 draft (75th and 88th) to the [[Tampa Bay Lightning]] in exchange for the Lightning's first-round pick (1st overall).
#The 1st overall pick acquired from the Lightning, along with a conditional third-round pick in the 2000 draft, was then traded to the [[Atlanta Thrashers]] for the Thrashers' first-round pick (2nd overall) under the condition that then-Thrashers GM [[Don Waddell]] not select either Sedin with the first overall pick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sedin twins' dynamics changed draft|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/hockey/nhl/1999/draft/news/1999/06/26/nhldraft_twins/|accessdate=2010-08-22|date=1999-06-26|publisher=''[[Sports Illustrated]]''|author=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=notes}} Canucks general manager [[Brian Burke (ice hockey)|Brian Burke]] obtained the second and third overall picks, which he used to select Daniel and Henrik, respectively.

Two days later, Keith was suspended five games for his hit by the league.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Duncan Keith suspended 5 games for elbowing Daniel Sedin|url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/nhl/story/2012/03/23/sp-hockey-chicago-blackhawks-vancouver-canucks-concussion-daniel-sedin.html|accessdate=2012-04-04|date=2012-03-23|publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|agency=Canadian Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Daniel made his North American debut competing for Sweden in the 1997 [[World U17 Hockey Challenge]], held in [[Alberta]]. Leading the tournament in scoring with 26 points (9 goals and 17 assists) over 6 games, he helped Sweden to a silver medal. After going undefeated in five contests, they were defeated in the gold medal game by Team [[Ontario]] 6–2.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Before they were stars: 25 years of great performances at the World U17 Hockey Challenge|url=http://www.hockeycanada.ca/index.php/ci_id/156190/la_id/1/|accessdate=2011-03-11|date=2011-01-01|publisher=[[Hockey Canada]]|author=Derek Jory}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Back in Europe, Daniel competed at the 1997 European Junior Championships, recording two goals and six points over six games. The following year, at the 1998 European Junior Championships, Sweden's final game required them to beat Russia by four goals to surpass Finland in [[goal difference|goal differential]] and win the gold medal. Daniel recorded two assists as Sweden won 5–1.&lt;ref name=mirror/&gt;

In his NHL draft year, Daniel competed for Sweden at the [[1999 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships|1999 World Junior Championships]] in [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]].  He recorded 10 points in six games, and tied for second in tournament scoring with [[Daniel Tkaczuk]] of [[Canada national junior hockey team|Canada]] and [[Scott Gomez]] of the [[USA Hockey|United States]], behind [[Brian Gionta]] of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Final Scoring|url=http://hockeycanada.ca/index.php/ci_id/2101/la_id/1.htm|accessdate=2010-05-30|publisher=[[Hockey Canada]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sweden failed to medal, losing the bronze medal game against Slovakia by a 5–4 score.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=World Jr. Championship results/schedule|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/hockey/wjc99/sked.htm#result|accessdate=2010-05-30|1999-01-06|publisher=''[[USA Today]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Later that year, Daniel made his debut for the [[Sweden national men's ice hockey team|Swedish men's team]] at the [[1999 Men's World Ice Hockey Championships|1999 World Championships]] in [[Norway]].

In 2000, Daniel once again competed in both the [[2000 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships|World Junior]] and [[2000 Men's World Ice Hockey Championships|Men's Championships]]. At the junior tournament in Sweden, Daniel matched his previous year's output with 10 points. He was the third highest point-scorer in the tournament, behind Henrik and [[Milan Kraft]] of the Czech Republic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scoring leaders|url=http://www.iihf.com/hockey/x/9900/U20a/gs/pg000007.htm|accessdate=2010-04-18|publisher=[[International Ice Hockey Federation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Again, Sweden failed to earn a medal, finishing in fifth place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IIHF Championships 2000|url=http://www.iihf.com/hockey/x/9900/U20a/9900/htm/u20a_fr.htm|accessdate=2010-05-30|publisher=[[International Ice Hockey Federation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the Men's World Championships, Daniel and Henrik both recorded five points; they were the youngest players on the squad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Team Sweden|url=http://www.iihf.com/hockey/x/9900/wsa00/cs/pg000083.htm|accessdate=2010-06-01|publisher=[[International Ice Hockey Federation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sweden did not achieve a medal, losing to [[Finland national men's ice hockey team|Finland]] in the quarterfinal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Final Round|url=http://www.iihf.com/hockey/x/9900/wsa00/cs/pg000027.htm|accessdate=2010-05-30|publisher=[[International Ice Hockey Federation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following his rookie season with the Vancouver Canucks, Daniel made his third World Championships appearance, in [[2001 Men's World Ice Hockey Championships|2001]] in [[Germany]]. He was injured midway through the tournament and had to return to Vancouver for surgery on a [[herniated disc]] in his lower back.&lt;ref name=&quot;back surgery&quot;/&gt; Sweden defeated the [[United States national men's ice hockey team|United States]] 3–2 to win its second bronze medal in three years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Playoff Round|url=http://www.iihf.com/hockey/x/0001/WS/cs/pg000010.htm|accessdate=2010-05-04|publisher=[[International Ice Hockey Federation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made a fourth tournament appearance at the [[2005 Men's World Ice Hockey Championships|2005 World Championships]] in [[Austria]].

Throughout his career, Daniel has been known as a goal-scorer, usually finishing plays initiated by his brother, Henrik.&lt;ref name=surprise/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;have hart&quot;/&gt; However, Daniel is also a proficient [[wiktionary:playmaker|playmaker]] and generates many sequences with Henrik off the [[wiktionary:cycle|cycle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kessel responds to spotlight, Henrik Sedin shines in shadows|url=http://m.si.com/news/wr/wr/detail/2126123;jsessionid=CDEEA7CD3D50114FD5326CE8ECE4B311.cnnsi1|accessdate=2010-08-19|date=2009-12-16|publisher=''[[Sports Illustrated]]''|author=Darren Eliot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bernier does a lot of things well, but Sedins need more|url=http://www.faceoff.com/hockey/nhlnews/story.html?id=af66ce00-1098-4728-8f67-61cef79b5022|accessdate=2010-04-19|date=2008-10-29|publisher=''[[The Province]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Daniel's familiarity with Henrik's play enhances his effectiveness; the pair are known for their ability to find each other intuitively with passes,&lt;ref name=surprise&gt;{{cite news|title=Surprised by Sedin?

With offensive skill marking the prime component of his game, Daniel is known to avoid initiating contact with opposing players.  Early in their career, he and Henrik were knocked off the puck easily, leading many in the media to refer to them as the &quot;Sedin Sisters&quot;.&lt;ref name=surprise/&gt;  As a result, players have often taken advantage of their lack of physicality by playing aggressively against them.  This once led Canucks general manager Brian Burke to publicly complain, commenting during a [[2002 Stanley Cup playoffs|2002 playoff]] series against the Detroit Red Wings, &quot;'Sedin' is not Swedish for 'punch me or headlock me in a scrum'.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Top Canucks prospect Cody Hodgson to return to game action|url=http://www.faceoff.com/hockey/teams/story.html?id=2510345&amp;add_feed_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.faceoff.com%2Fscripts%2FSP6Atom.aspx%3Fid%3D830270|accessdate=2010-04-19|date=2010-02-01|publisher=''[[The Vancouver Sun]]''|author=Elliott Papp}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As their careers progressed, the Sedins have worked on their strength, improving their puck possession, allowing them to play more effectively.&lt;ref name=surprise/&gt;

==Personal life==
Daniel met his wife Marinette in his hometown Örnsköldsvik, Sweden, around 1998.&lt;ref name=vancouversun/&gt; She came with him to Vancouver upon the start of Daniel's NHL career in 2000,&lt;ref name=reader&gt;{{cite news|title=The Sedins raise their own reader|url=http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/news/story.html?id=0644bb92-078a-4dcb-ab36-5f88e62d2d7b%20|accessdate=2010-05-30|date=2007-10-02|publisher=''[[The Vancouver Sun]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the two married in 2005.&lt;ref name=vancouversun/&gt; After earning a bachelor's degree in psychology at the [[University of British Columbia]]&lt;ref name=reader/&gt; Marinette became involved with the Canucks Family Education Centre, helping female immigrants transition to the English language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Daniel Sedin's better half is hleping others make the transition into a new world|url=http://canucks.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=499514|accessdate=2010-05-30|date=2009-09-23|publisher=[[National Hockey League]]|author=Derek Jory}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together, they have two daughters, Ronja (born in 2006) and Anna (born in March 2011), and a son, Erik (born in 2008).&lt;ref name=vancouversun/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Manny Malhotra's injury hits team hard|url=http://www.vancouversun.com/sports/Manny+Malhotra+injury+hits+team+hard/4488361/story.html|accessdate=2011-03-23|date=2011-03-23|work=[[The Vancouver Sun]]|publisher=Postmedia News|location=Vancouver}} {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; They live in the Vancouver neighbourhood of [[Shaughnessy, Vancouver|Shaughnessy]] during the NHL season, returning to Sweden every summer.&lt;ref name=vancouversun&gt;{{cite web|title=Daniel Sedin|url=http://www.vancouversun.com/Daniel+Sedin/2923316/story.html|accessdate=2010-08-19|publisher=''[[The Vancouver Sun]]''|author=Yvonne Zacharias|date=2010-04-19}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;
