'''Robert William''' &quot;'''Bob'''&quot; '''Meusel''' (July 19, 1896 – November 28, 1977) was an American [[baseball]] [[left fielder|left]] and [[right fielder]] who played in [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) for eleven seasons from 1920 through 1930, all but the last for the [[New York Yankees]]. He was best known as a member of the Yankees' championship teams of the 1920s, nicknamed the &quot;[[Murderers' Row]]&quot;, during which time the team won its first six [[American League]] (AL) pennants and first three [[World Series]] titles.

Meusel, noted for his strong outfield throwing arm, batted fifth behind [[Baseball Hall of Fame]]rs [[Babe Ruth]] and [[Lou Gehrig]].&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thedeadballera.com/Obits/Meusel.Bob.Obit.html|accessdate=2007-07-30|date=1977-11-30|title=Meusel, Yankees Outfielder Dies|publisher=The New York Times via TheDeadBallEra.com| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070212043705/http://thedeadballera.com/Obits/Meusel.Bob.Obit.html| archivedate = February 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1925, he became the second Yankee, after Ruth, to lead the AL in the following offensive categories: [[home run]]s (33), [[run batted in|runs batted in]] (138) and [[extra base hit]]s (79). Nicknamed &quot;Long Bob&quot; because of his 6 foot, 3&amp;nbsp;inch (1.91&amp;nbsp;m) stature, Meusel [[batting average|batted]] .313 or better in seven of his first eight seasons, finishing with a .309 career average; his 1,005 RBI during the 1920s were the fourth most by any major leaguer, and trailed only [[Harry Heilmann]]'s total of 1,131 among AL right-handed hitters. Meusel ended his career in 1930 with the [[Cincinnati Reds]]. He [[hitting for the cycle|hit for the cycle]] three times, and was the second of three major leaguers to accomplish this feat as many as three times during a career.

His older brother, [[Irish Meusel|Emil &quot;Irish&quot; Meusel]], was a star outfielder in the [[National League]] (NL) during the same period, primarily for the [[San Francisco Giants|New York Giants]].&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

==Early life==
Meusel was born in [[San Jose, California]], the youngest of Charlie and Mary Meusel's six children.&lt;ref name=&quot;family&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Biographical Dictionary of American Sports. Baseball |author=David Porter|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-29884-4|page=1049}}&lt;/ref&gt; At an early age he moved to [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], where he attended [[Los Angeles High School]]. Meusel started his career with the [[Vernon Tigers]] of the [[Pacific Coast League]] in 1917. He joined the [[United States Navy|US Navy]] during [[World War I]] and played for the [[United States Navy Baseball|Navy baseball team]].&lt;ref name=&quot;navy&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Babe Ruth: Launching the Legend |author=Jim Reisler|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=0-07-143244-2|pages=54&amp;ndash;55}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went back to the Tigers for the 1919 season, batting .330. He also played [[third baseman|third base]] in the minors.&lt;ref name=&quot;thirdbaseman&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=The Life That Ruth Built: A Biography|author=Marshall Smelser
|publisher=Quadrangle/New York Times Book Company |isbn=0-8129-0540-7 |page=152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 14, 1921 Meusel married Edith Cowan, with whom he had one daughter.

==Professional career==
Meusel's contract was purchased by the [[New York Yankees]] in early 1920.&lt;ref name=Weiss&gt;{{cite web|last=Weiss |first=Bill |coauthors=Wright, Marshall |title=Team #31 1906 Portland Beavers (114 – 58) |publisher=Minor League Baseball | url=http://web.minorleaguebaseball.com/milb/history/top100.jsp?idx=31 |accessdate=2007-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a productive [[spring training]], Meusel replaced future Hall of Famer [[Frank Baker]] at third base.&lt;ref name=Baker&gt;{{cite news|title=Meusel will play third for the Yankees|work=The New York Times|page=12|date=April 1, 1920|accessdate=2007-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; He played his first game on April 14, 1920. In his rookie season, Meusel had a .328 batting average with 11 home runs and 83 runs batted in over 119 games. He finished fourth in the league in doubles with 41 while sharing time with [[Duffy Lewis]] in left field.&lt;ref name=stats&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/m/meusebo01.shtml|accessdate=2007-07-30|title=Bob Meusel|publisher=Baseball-Reference.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1921 season, Meusel started in 149 out of 154 games, primarily playing right field. He batted .318, finishing second in the league in home runs with 24 and third in the league with 136 runs batted in.&lt;ref name=stats/&gt;&lt;ref name=1921season&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportingnews.com/archives/worldseries/1921.html|year = 2002|accessdate=2007-07-31|title=History of the World Series - 1921|publisher=[[The Sporting News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He [[hitting for the cycle|hit for the cycle]] in a win against the [[Minnesota Twins|Washington Senators]] on May 7. In the second game of a September 5 doubleheader, he tied a major league record for outfielders (previously accomplished by nine others) by recording four [[assist (baseball)|assists]]. He broke a club record and tied [[Jack Tobin]] of the [[Baltimore Orioles|St. Louis Browns]] for the league lead in outfield assists with 28; he was considered to be one of the league's best all-around players.&lt;ref name=&quot;assists&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=The Yankee Encyclopedia|author=Mark Gallagher
|publisher=Sports Publishing LLC|isbn=1-58261-683-3 |page=361}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meusel's brother, Irish, was acquired by the [[San Francisco Giants|New York Giants]] from the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] mid-season, and helped lead the Giants to the pennant. The two brothers played against each other in the [[1921 World Series]] where the Giants faced their tenants (the Yankees played their home games in the [[Polo Grounds]], the ball park owned by the Giants). Bob Meusel [[stolen base|stole]] home in Game 3 of the Series.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; He [[double (baseball)|doubled]] in [[Babe Ruth]] for the winning run in Game 5 for a one-game lead, but the Yankees lost the next three games and the Series (the last best-of-nine in World Series history).&lt;ref name=1921season/&gt; His batting average in those eight games was a mere .200.&lt;ref name=stats/&gt;

At the same time, Meusel, [[Bill Piercy]], and Ruth signed up to play in a [[barnstorming]] tour. It was a violation of baseball rules at the time, and Meusel and Ruth had previously been warned about playing with the tour. As punishment, [[Commissioner of Baseball]] [[Kenesaw Mountain Landis]] suspended them for the first five weeks of the 1922 season and fined them their World Series cash share of $3,362 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|3362|1922|r=0}}}} today) each.&lt;ref name=&quot;suspended&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Luckiest Man: The Life and Death of Lou Gehrig|author=Jonathan Eig|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=0-7432-4591-1 |page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; That season Meusel only played in 121 games, hitting .319 with 16 home runs and 84 runs batted in&lt;ref name=stats/&gt; as he gradually shifted to left field to allow Ruth to instead play right field. Meusel occasionally played right field in Yankees games away from home to protect Ruth from the sun, as the sun affected Ruth's skill as an outfielder.&lt;ref name=affected&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.sportingnews.com/baseball/al100/seasons/slideshows/1927/5.html|accessdate=2007-07-31|title=100 Years of the American League|publisher=The Sporting News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the games he missed, he again led the AL in assists with 24. He hit for the cycle for the second time of his career in a win against the [[Detroit Tigers]] on July 21. The Yankees managed to win the American League pennant for the second year in a row, but they were again beaten by the Giants, this time in five games. Meusel had the highest batting average of the Yankees at the end of the Series with .300.&lt;ref name=high&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/postseason/1922_WS.shtml|accessdate=2007-07-30|title=1922 World Series (4-0-1): New York Giants (93&amp;ndash;61) over New York Yankees (94&amp;ndash;60) |publisher = Baseball-Reference.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Emil and Bob Meusel 1923.jpg|thumb|Bob Meusel with his brother, outfielder [[Irish Meusel|Emil &quot;Irish&quot; Meusel]].]]
In 1923, Meusel hit .313 with 9 home runs and 91 runs batted in&lt;ref name=stats/&gt; as the Yankees moved into their new [[Yankee Stadium]]. Meusel helped lead the team to their first [[1923 World Series|World Series]] title, in their third consecutive matchup with the Giants. Meusel had the most runs batted in (eight) of any player in the Series. He hit a two-run [[triple (baseball)|triple]] in the second inning to help the Yankees win Game 4 at the Polo Grounds, drove in five runs in Game 5 and had a key two-run [[single (baseball)|single]] that gave the Yankees the lead for good in Game 6.&lt;ref name=&quot;keyhero&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=The Giants Encyclopedia|author=Tom Schott|publisher=Sports Publishing LLC|isbn=1-58261-693-0 |page=319}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the 1924 season started, Meusel's close friend [[Tony Boeckel]], [[shortstop]] for the [[Atlanta Braves|Boston Braves]], was killed when the car in which he was riding flipped over in [[San Diego]]. Meusel was a passenger in the vehicle but escaped unhurt.&lt;ref name=&quot;caraccident&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Ninety Feet from Fame: Close Calls With Baseball Immortality|author=Mike Robbins|publisher=Carroll &amp; Graf Publishers|isbn=0-7867-1335-6|page=173}}&lt;/ref&gt; That year Meusel hit .320 with 12 home runs and 120 runs batted in, playing in 143 games. In a game against the Tigers on June 13, Meusel was involved in one of the most notorious brawls in baseball history. With the Yankees leading 10&amp;ndash;6 in the top of the ninth inning, [[Ty Cobb]], the star and manager of the Tigers, gave pitcher [[Bert Cole]] the signal to [[hit by pitch|hit]] Meusel with a pitch. Ruth saw the signal and warned Meusel, who was hit in the back and rushed to fight Cole. Both teams rushed onto the field to brawl, and Cobb and Ruth started fighting as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;fight&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=And the Skipper Bats Cleanup: A History of the Baseball Player-Manager|author=Fred Stein|publisher=McFarland &amp; Company|isbn=0-7864-1228-3|page=148}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over a thousand fans also rushed onto the field, and a riot erupted. The police managed to control the brawl and arrested several fans. The umpire of the game, [[Billy Evans]], pushed Meusel and Ruth out of [[Tiger Stadium (Detroit)|Navin Field]] to safety.&lt;ref&gt;Smelser: pp. 296-297&lt;/ref&gt; American League President [[Ban Johnson]] punished Meusel and Cole by fining them and issuing a ten-day suspension.&lt;ref&gt;Smelser: p. 296.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meusel had a breakout year in 1925. He led the American League in home runs (33), runs batted in (138), games played (156) and extra base hits (79). Despite this, he finished merely tied for 18th position overall for the AL's [[MLB Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player]] award, far behind winner (and former Yankee) [[Roger Peckinpaugh]] of the Washington Senators. The Yankees had their worst season of the decade, finishing seventh in the league with a 69&amp;ndash;85 record. In the following 1926 season, Meusel only played in 108 games, batting .315 with 12 home runs and 81 runs batted in.&lt;ref name=stats/&gt; In the [[1926 World Series]] against the [[St. Louis Cardinals]], Meusel dropped a key [[fly ball]] with one out and the bases loaded in the fourth inning of Game 7, allowing the Cardinals to tie the game 1-1; the next batter singled to drive in two more runs.&lt;ref name=&quot;keyflyball&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Branch Rickey: Baseball's Ferocious Gentleman|author=Lee Lowenfish|publisher=U of Nebraska Press|isbn=0-8032-1103-1 |page=167}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meusel had chance to redeem himself later in the game, but made infield outs in both the fifth and seventh innings, each time with two men on base. In the bottom of the ninth inning, with New York trailing 3-2, Cardinals starting pitcher [[Grover Cleveland Alexander]] retired the first two batters and then [[base on balls|walked]] Ruth. Meusel was up to bat when Ruth tried to steal second base, and catcher [[Bob O'Farrell]] threw him out, ending both the game and the Series; Meusel only hit .238.&lt;ref name=Ruthstolenbase&gt;{{cite news|author=[[Murray Chass]]|title=When a Seventh Game is Necessary:High Drama|work=The New York Times|page=207|date=October 26, 1986|accessdate=2007-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meusel was a key member of the [[1927 New York Yankees]] team, which many consider to be one of the greatest baseball teams ever.&lt;!--who are &quot;many&quot;?--&gt; That season Meusel played in 135 games, hitting .337 with 8 home runs and 103 runs batted in, and finished second in the league with 24 stolen bases;&lt;ref name=stats/&gt; on May 16 he stole second, third and home in one game. In the [[1927 World Series]], Meusel batted only .118 and broke the record for the most [[strikeout]]s in a four-game series with seven,&lt;ref name=record&gt;{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0FCI/is_8_64/ai_n15343199|accessdate=2007-07-31|month=November | year=2005|title=World series record book: high marks for a single series|publisher=Baseball Digest}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the Yankees swept the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] in four games. In 1928 Meusel played in 131 games, hitting .297 with 11 home runs and 111 runs batted in.&lt;ref name=stats/&gt; He hit for the cycle a record-tying third time on July 26 against the Tigers.&lt;ref name=cycle&gt;{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0FCI/is_9_64/ai_n15657364/pg_2|accessdate=2007-07-31|month=November | year=2005|title=Cycle hitters: single double triple home run: in the same game|publisher=Baseball Digest}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Yankees reached the [[1928 World Series|World Series]] for the third year in a row, playing the Cardinals in a rematch from two years previously. In Game 1 of the Series, Meusel hit the only home run in his World Series career as the Yankees won the game and went on to sweep the series 4&amp;ndash;0.&lt;ref name=onlyhomer&gt;{{cite news|author=Ray Corio|title=Question Box|work=The New York Times|page=C11|date=October 13, 1986|accessdate=2007-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the start of the 1930 season, the Yankees sold Meusel to the [[Cincinnati Reds]], and he played in 110 games, hitting .289 with 10 home runs and 69 runs batted in.&lt;ref name=stats/&gt; The Reds released Meusel after the season, and he went on to the [[Minneapolis Millers]] of the [[American Association (20th century)|American Association]] where he played the 1931 season, hitting .283.&lt;ref name=Millers&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stewthornley.net/notable.html|accessdate=2007-07-31|title=Notable Minneapolis Millers|author=Stew Thorley}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went back to the [[Pacific Coast League]] in 1932, where he played 64 games with the [[Hollywood Stars]], batting .329 with four home runs before retiring.&lt;ref name=&quot;PCL&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=The Pacific Coast League: A Statistical History, 1903-1957|author=Dennis Snelling|publisher=McFarland &amp; Company|isbn=0-7864-0045-5|page=210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meusel's major league career ended with 368 doubles, 94 triples, 156 home runs, a .497 [[slugging percentage]], 1,067 runs batted in, 826 [[run (baseball)|runs scored]] and 140 stolen bases. Most of his various Yankee career records for right-handed hitters were broken by [[Tony Lazzeri]] in the mid-1930s; [[Joe DiMaggio]] broke his marks for batting average, slugging average and doubles in the late 1940s.

==Retirement and death==
After retiring from baseball, Meusel worked as a security guard at a US Navy base for 15 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;family&quot;/&gt; He was in attendance when his former teammate [[Lou Gehrig]] made his famous [[Lou Gehrig#'The Luckiest Man on the Face of the Earth'|'Luckiest Man on the Face of the Earth']] speech on July 4, 1939.&lt;ref name=&quot;lucky&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=A Legend in the Making, The New York Yankees in 1939|author=Richard Tofel|publisher=Ivan R. Dee|isbn=1-56663-411-3 |page=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also appeared in the 1942 film ''[[The Pride of the Yankees]]'', as well as the 1948 film ''[[The Babe Ruth Story]]'', as himself in a [[cameo appearance|cameo role]] on both occasions.

Meusel died of [[death by natural causes|natural causes]] at his home in [[Downey, California]] in 1977, and was buried at [[Rose Hills Memorial Park]] in [[Whittier, California|Whittier]].

==Legacy==
Meusel received the most recognition for being a member of the &quot;[[Murderers' Row]]&quot; teams of the mid-1920s, which included Ruth, Gehrig, [[second baseman]] [[Tony Lazzeri]] and [[center fielder]] [[Earle Combs]]. He shares the record for the most times hitting for the cycle with three, tying the mark set by [[John Reilly (baseball)|Long John Reilly]] in 1890; [[Babe Herman]] later tied the mark in 1933. Meusel had one of the strongest arms of the era; in his obituary, ''[[The New York Times]]'' called his throwing arm &quot;deadly accurate&quot;.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; Hall of Fame manager [[Casey Stengel]], who played on the 1921 through 1923 Giants teams, said that he had never seen a better thrower.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

Harvey Frommer described Meusel as a heavy drinker and womanizer who did not get along with his teammates. His manager [[Miller Huggins]] called him &quot;indifferent&quot;.&lt;!--to what?--&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;indifferent&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=A Yankees Century, A Celebration of the First Hundred Years of Baseball's Greatest Team|author=Harvey Frommer|publisher=The Berkley Publishing Group|isbn=0-425-18617-2|page=196}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was quiet and reserved, rarely giving newspaper interviews until his career was winding down.&lt;ref name=&quot;quiet&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=A Farewell to Heroes|author=Frank Graham|publisher=Southern Illinois Univ Press|isbn=0-8093-2491-1|page=207}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also known for his lazy attitude, such as refusing to run out ground balls, which many said kept him from achieving greatness.&lt;ref&gt;Eig: p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; Regularly among the league leaders in strikeouts, his 24 career strikeouts in the World Series were a record for right-handed hitters until Yankees [[Hank Bauer]] and [[Gil McDougald]] surpassed it in [[1958 World Series|1958]].

Meusel was considered for election to the [[Baseball Hall of Fame]] by its [[Veterans Committee]] in 1982, but the committee instead selected former commissioner [[Happy Chandler]] and former Giants shortstop [[Travis Jackson]] in its balloting.&lt;ref name=Halloffame&gt;{{cite news|author=Joseph Durso|title=Chandler, Jackson to join Hall|work=The New York Times|page=B18|date=March 11, 1982|accessdate=2007-08-06|authorlink=Joe Durso}}&lt;/ref&gt;
