'''Nikita Vasilyevich Filatov''' ({{lang-ru|Никита Васильевич Филатов}}; born May 25, 1990) is a [[Russians|Russian]] professional [[ice hockey]] player. Filatov was loaned to [[HC CSKA Moscow]] of the [[Kontinental Hockey League]] (KHL) by the [[Ottawa Senators]] of the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) in December, 2011.&lt;ref name=&quot;tsn.ca&quot;&gt;http://www.tsn.ca/nhl/story/?id=382975 SENATORS ASSIGN FILATOV TO AHL; SUSPENSION EXPECTED&lt;/ref&gt; He previously played with the [[Columbus Blue Jackets]] of the NHL.

== Playing career ==
=== Junior ===
Filatov played [[minor ice hockey|minor]] and [[junior ice hockey|junior hockey]] in the [[HC CSKA Moscow|CSKA Red Army hockey system]] from the age of 13. At the age of 15 during the 2005–06 season, Filatov made his debut for CSKA 2 (the club's junior team), where he continued to play during the 2006–07 season, and averaged more than three points per game.&lt;ref name=russprosp&gt;{{cite web|title=Russian Hockey NHL prospects Nikita Filatov Columbus Blue Jackets|url=http://www.russianprospects.com/public/profile.php?player_id=640|accessdate=2010-01-22|publisher=Russian Prospects}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same season, Filatov made his international debut for Russia at the [[IIHF World U18 Championships|World Under 18 Championship]].&lt;ref name=russprosp /&gt;&lt;ref name=nhlprof&gt;{{cite web|title=Nikita Filatov, Blue Jackets|url=http://bluejackets.nhl.com/club/player.htm?id=8474566&amp;view=stats|accessdate=2010-01-22|publisher=[[Columbus Blue Jackets]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
During the 2007–08 season, Filatov made his professional [[Russian Super League]] debut with CSKA, seeing limited action in five games.&lt;ref name=russprosp /&gt;  He spent the majority of the season playing at the junior level in Russia.  With his CSKA junior team, Filatov played in 23 games, scoring 23 goals and providing 24 assists.&lt;ref name=nhlprof /&gt;  Leading up to the [[2008 NHL Entry Draft]], the league's annual meeting at which the rights to amateur players are divided among teams, [[NHL Central Scouting Bureau|NHL's Central Scouting Bureau]] ranked Filatov as the top European skater in their mid-term and final rankings.&lt;ref name=draftprofile&gt;{{cite web|title=Filatov, Nikita|url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/draftprospectdetail.htm?dpid=211|accessdate=2010-01-22|publisher=[[National Hockey League]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;   After the 2007–08 season, Filatov was selected in the first round of the 2008 NHL Entry Draft, the sixth overall selection, by the [[Columbus Blue Jackets]].&lt;ref name=nhlprof /&gt;

Filatov was also the first overall selection in the 2008 [[Canadian Hockey League]] (CHL) [[Canadian_Hockey_League#CHL_Import_Draft|Import Draft]], selected by the [[Sudbury Wolves]] of the [[Ontario Hockey League]]. Sudbury general manager [[Mike Foligno]] was comfortable with the risks of not knowing whether Filatov would play at junior or professional level when he came to North America.  Blue Jackets general manager [[Scott Howson]] would not guarantee Filatov a place on their team, saying &quot;We’ve already told Nikita that we’ll see how things go in training camp and we’ll decide what’s best for him.&quot;&lt;ref name=chldraft&gt;{{cite web|title=Sudbury Wolves will select Nikita Filatov first overall in CHL import draft|url=http://www.thehockeynews.com/articles/16824-Sudbury-Wolves-will-select-Nikita-Filatov-first-overall-in-CHL-import-draft.html|accessdate=2010-01-22|date=2008-06-25|author=Campbell, Ken|work=[[The Hockey News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Professional ===
After being drafted by the Blue Jackets, Filatov signed a three-year contract with the club on July 10, 2008.&lt;ref name=tsnprof&gt;{{cite web|title=Nikita Filatov|url=http://www.tsn.ca/nhl/teams/players/bio/?id=6497|accessdate=2010-01-22|publisher=[[The Sports Network]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His base salary for the contract was $875,000, with bonus clauses that could bring the value as high as $1.35&amp;nbsp;million per season.&lt;ref name=contractterms&gt;{{cite web|title=Blue Jackets sign No. 1 pick|url=http://www.dispatch.com/live/content/sports/stories/2008/07/10/cbjno1.html|work=The Columbus Dispatch|author=Portzline, Aaron|date=2008-07-10|accessdate=2010-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His signing with Columbus created some controversy within the [[Kontinental Hockey League|KHL]], as the league president [[Alexander Medvedev]] claimed that the Blue Jackets owed CSKA Moscow compensation of at least $1.5&amp;nbsp;million for signing Filatov.  Medvedev claimed that although the term of the contract had expired, under Russian law it did not terminate until an indemnity amount had been negotiated.&lt;ref name=khlcontract&gt;{{cite web|title=K.H.L.

During this investigation, the players were unable to play international hockey sanctioned by the IIHF.&lt;ref name=iihfcontract&gt;{{cite web|title=Hockey's governing body probing KHL contracts|url=http://m.espn.go.com/nhl/story?storyId=3495585|publisher=[[The Associated Press]]|accessdate=2010-01-23|date=2008-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In September, the KHL dropped its opposition to Filatov's contract with the Blue Jackets, and he received his transfer.&lt;ref name=hncontract&gt;{{cite web|title=KHL makes concessions, but NHL not impressed|url=http://www.thehockeynews.com/articles/17776-KHL-makes-concessions-but-NHL-not-impressed.html|author=Campbell, Ken|accessdate=2010-01-23|date=2008-09-06|work=[[The Hockey News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Filatov did not make the team after attending training camp with the Blue Jackets, instead making his North American professional debut for the Blue Jackets' [[American Hockey League]] (AHL) affiliate, the [[Syracuse Crunch]].&lt;ref name=tsnprof /&gt;  However, on October 15, 2008 Filatov was called up to the NHL,&lt;ref name=tsnprof /&gt; playing in his first game and scoring his first goal with the Blue Jackets on October 17, 2008 against the [[Nashville Predators]].&lt;ref name=firstgame&gt;{{cite web|title=Blue Jackets recall Nikita Filatov from Syracuse|url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=402600|accessdate=2010-01-22|date=2009-01-07|publisher=[[National Hockey League]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For the rest of the 2008–09 season, Filatov split time between the AHL and the NHL.  He played eight games with the Blue Jackets, finishing the season with four goals.&lt;ref name=nhlprof /&gt; He became the first Blue Jackets rookie to record a [[Hat-trick#Hockey|hat-trick]] in the January 10, 2009 match against the [[Minnesota Wild]].&lt;ref name=hattrick&gt;{{cite web|title=Columbus rookie Nikita Filatov nets hat trick|url=http://sports.yahoo.com/nhl/recap?gid=2009011029|accessdate=2010-01-22|date=2009-01-10|publisher=Yahoo!}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the season, Filatov had played 39 games with the Crunch in the AHL scoring 16 goals and adding 16 assists.&lt;ref name=nhlprof /&gt;  He was named as a starter for the PlanetUSA team in the 2009 [[AHL All-Star Game]].&lt;ref name=ahlasg&gt;{{cite web|title=Nikita Filatov Named to Starting Line-Up for AHL All-Star Game|url=http://bluejackets.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=478906|accessdate=2010-01-22|date=2009-01-07|publisher=[[Columbus Blue Jackets]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the start of the 2009–10 NHL season, Filatov made the Blue Jackets roster after training camp.  Although healthy, he did not play in six of the team's first 18 games, a decision made by Columbus head coach [[Ken Hitchcock]].&lt;ref name=cdrussia&gt;{{cite web|title=Filatov leaving Blue Jackets|url=http://www.dispatch.com/live/content/sports/stories/2009/11/17/1117cbjup.html|author=Portzline, Aaron|accessdate=2010-01-22|date=2009-11-17|work=The Columbus Dispatch}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Filatov was unhappy with his playing time and role on the team under Hitchcock and requested to be transferred back to his Russian club team.&lt;ref name=cdrussia /&gt;  Hitchcock and the Blue Jackets coaching staff tried to improve Filatov's attention to defensive aspects of the game.&lt;ref name=sidefense&gt;{{cite web|title=Jackets, Stars offer lessons in young asset management; more|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2009/writers/allan_muir/11/13/filatov.brunnstrom.howard/index.html|publisher=CNNSI.com|date=2009-11-13|accessdate=2010-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This emphasis on defensive play did not suit Filatov, and he did not receive much playing time.  The Blue Jackets management agreed to Filatov's request to return to Russia for the remainder of the season.&lt;ref name=cdrussia /&gt;  This arrangement resulted from direct dealings between the Blue Jackets and CSKA Moscow, where Filatov's salary was paid by the Russian club, and the Blue Jackets retained his rights.&lt;ref name=gmfil&gt;{{cite web|title=Filatov finds a comfort zone |url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/hockey/filatov-finds-a-comfort-zone/article1414659/|accessdate=2010-01-22|date=2009-12-30|author=Sekeres, Matthew|work=The Globe and Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after his return to Russia, Filatov set a KHL record by scoring the game winning goal in three consecutive games.&lt;ref name=khlgamewinners&gt;{{cite web|title=Filatov keeps on winning|url=http://en.khl.ru/news/2009/11/25/23731.html|publisher=[[Kontinental Hockey League]]|date=2009-11-25|accessdate=2010-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was named the league's best newcomer (defined by the KHL as &quot;a player born in 1987 or later, who has played no more than 20 top-level matches in previous national tournaments&quot;) for November,&lt;ref name=newcomer&gt;{{cite web|title=November's finest|url=http://en.khl.ru/news/2009/12/2/23740.html|publisher=[[Kontinental Hockey League]]|date=2009-12-02|accessdate=2010-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the league's best rookie for the 11th week of the season.&lt;ref name=rotw&gt;{{cite web|title=Players of the week|url=http://en.khl.ru/news/2009/11/30/23737.html|publisher=[[Kontinental Hockey League]]|date=2009-11-30|accessdate=2010-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In his shortened season in Russia, Filatov played 26 games, scoring 9 goals and adding 13 assists.&lt;ref name=hockeydb&gt;{{cite web|title=Nikita Filatov hockey statistics|url=http://www.hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/pdisplay.php?pid=108670|publisher=HockeyDB.com|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Initial statements by both sides indicated the player would return to Columbus after the 2009–10 season, but since returning to Russia, Filatov has been less clear about his intentions for the 2010–11 season, stating &quot;I hope I’ll be back next year, but right now, it’s really hard to say because it will again be a tough decision.&quot;&lt;ref name=gmfil /&gt;  Howson has not commented on Filatov's stance, except to say that he expects Filatov to be at the team's training camp prior to the 2010–11 season.&lt;ref name=11tc&gt;{{cite web|title=Jackets notebook: Russell's game on upswing|url=http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/sports/2010/01/08/jackets_notes_1-8.ART_ART_01-08-10_C4_T8G80RL.html|accessdate=2010-01-24|date=2010-01-08|author=Reed, Tom|work=The Columbus Dispatch}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Subsequently, Filatov stated after the 2009–10 season that he intended to return to Columbus for training camp.&lt;ref name=comingback&gt;{{cite web|title=Filatov plans to return for Jackets training camp|url=http://www.dispatch.com/live/content/sports/stories/2010/04/24/filatov-plans-to-return-for-training-camp.html?sid=101|author=Portzline, Aaron|work=The Columbus Dispatch|date=2010-04-24|accessdate=2010-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 17, 2011, the Senators reassigned Filatov to [[Binghamton Senators|Binghamton]] of the [[American Hockey League]] after he had recorded just one assist in nine games with Ottawa. Filatov had previously been loaned to CSKA Moscow of the [[Kontinental Hockey League]] with a contract agreement in place for Filatov to sign. However, Filatov failed to sign the KHL contract and continued to occupy a roster spot with the Senators. Ottawa was still obligated to pay his full salary, costing the team both cap space as well as actual money on the team's payroll. The Senators intended to suspend Filatov for not reporting.&lt;ref name=&quot;tsn.ca&quot;/&gt; On December 18 Filatov finally agreed to a contract with CSKA Moscow.&lt;ref&gt;http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Hockey/NHL/Ottawa/2011/12/18/19140436.html 'Terrific' Turris a great fit for Sens&lt;/ref&gt;

==Playing style==
Scouting reports on Filatov were mixed in advance of the 2008 NHL Entry Draft.  [[Sergei Nemchinov]], coach of Russia's junior national team said of Filatov, &quot;He definitely has an NHL upside because he can score, is a well-rounded player and is responsible in the defensive zone.&quot;&lt;ref name=draftprofile /&gt;  Independent scouting service Red Line Report at one point declared Filatov &quot;the next best thing to [[Steven Stamkos]]&quot; (who was eventually selected first overall in the 2008 draft).&lt;ref name=stamkos&gt;{{cite web|title=Race for top pick heating up thanks to Filatov|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/hockey/columnist/woodlief/2008-02-22-redline_N.htm|work=USA Today|author=Woodlief, Kyle|date=2008-02-22|accessdate=2010-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  McKeen's Hockey scouts described him as a cross between [[Ilya Kovalchuk]] and [[Maxim Afinogenov]].&lt;ref name=islesdraft&gt;{{cite web|title=Nikita Filatov|url=http://islanders.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=465637|publisher=[[New York Islanders]]|accessdate=2010-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His strengths included his skating and vision, as well as the inclination to play at high intensity.&lt;ref name=islesdraft /&gt;  The NHL's Director of European Scouting, Goran Stubb, assessed Filatov's NHL readiness as, &quot;Nikita is a leader, has a great attitude, an excellent work ethic and tons of talent.&quot;&lt;ref name=euroscout&gt;{{cite web|title=Filatov up next in NHL Russian Revolution|url=http://bluejackets.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=479524|publisher=[[Columbus Blue Jackets]]|author=Morreale, Mike|date=2008-06-20|accessdate=2010-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other scouts were not as impressed with his defensive game, preferring to focus on his offensive abilities.&lt;ref name=sidefense /&gt; Off the ice, Filatov does not train in a traditional gym or weight room, preferring to run outside in sand and lift objects such as trees and boulders.&lt;ref name=geared&gt;{{cite web|title=Filatov geared up for return|url=http://www.dispatch.com/live/content/sports/stories/2010/07/15/filatov-geared-up-for-return.html?sid=101|work=The Columbus Dispatch|author=Portzline, Aaron|date=2010-07-15|accessdate=2010-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
Filatov was born in [[Moscow]], Russia to parents Slava and Yelena.&lt;ref name=family&gt;{{cite web|title=A Nest for Nikita|url=http://www.syracuse.com/crunch/index.ssf?/base/sports-0/1228470962199430.xml&amp;coll=1|accessdate=2010-01-23|date=2008-12-05|author=Kramer, Lindsay|publisher=Syracuse Online LLC}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He speaks fluent English due in large part to his mother, a teacher who gave him lessons at home.&lt;ref name=draftprofile /&gt;  When he started playing professional hockey in North America for the Syracuse Crunch, his mother stayed for several weeks to help him get acclimated to his new surroundings.&lt;ref name=family /&gt;
