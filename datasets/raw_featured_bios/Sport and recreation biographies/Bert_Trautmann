'''Bernhard Carl''' &quot;'''Bert'''&quot; '''Trautmann''', [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] (born 22 October 1923) is a German former professional [[Association football|footballer]] who played for [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] from 1949 to 1964. Brought up during times of inter-war strife in Germany, Trautmann joined the [[Luftwaffe]] early in the [[Second World War]], serving as a [[Fallschirmjäger (Nazi Germany)|paratrooper]]. He fought on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] for three years, earning five medals including an [[Iron Cross]]. Later in the war he was transferred to the [[Western Front (World War II)|Western Front]], where he was captured by the [[British Army|British]] as the war drew to a close. One of only 90 of his original 1,000-man regiment to survive the war, he was transferred to a [[prisoner-of-war]] camp in [[Ashton-in-Makerfield]], [[Lancashire]]. Trautmann refused an offer of [[repatriation]], and following his release in 1948 he settled in Lancashire, combining farm work with playing as goalkeeper for local football team [[St Helens Town F.C.|St Helens Town]].

Performances for St Helens gained Trautmann a reputation as an able goalkeeper, resulting in interest from [[The Football League|Football League]] clubs. In October 1949 he signed for [[Manchester City FC|Manchester City]], a club playing in the highest level of football in the country, the [[Football League First Division|First Division]]. The club's decision to sign a former [[Axis powers|Axis]] paratrooper sparked protests, with 20,000 people attending a demonstration. Over time he gained acceptance through his performances in the City goal, playing all but five of the club's next 250 matches.

Named [[FWA Footballer of the Year]] for 1956, Trautmann entered football folklore with his performance in the 1956 [[The Football Association|FA]] (Football Association) [[1956 FA Cup Final|Cup Final]]. With 17 minutes of the match remaining Trautmann suffered a serious injury after diving at the feet of [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City's]] [[Peter Murphy (footballer born 1922)|Peter Murphy]]. Despite his injury he continued to play, making crucial saves to preserve his team's 3–1 lead. His neck was noticeably crooked as he collected his winner's medal; three days later an [[X-ray]] revealed it to be broken.

Trautmann continued to play for Manchester City until 1964, making 545 appearances. After ending his playing career he moved into management, first with lower-division sides in [[England]] and [[Germany]], and later as part of a [[German Football Association]] development scheme that took him to several countries including [[Burma]], [[Tanzania]] and [[Pakistan]]. In 2004 he was appointed an honorary [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] (OBE) for promoting Anglo-German understanding through football.

==Early life in Germany==
[[File:Bremen an der Schlachte 1922.jpg|thumb|right|Trautmann's birthplace, [[Bremen]], in the 1920s]]Trautmann was born on 22 October 1923 in Walle, a [[middle class]] area in west [[Bremen (city)|Bremen]], living with his father, who worked in a fertiliser factory by the docks, and his mother Frieda, a housewife.&lt;ref&gt;Rowlands, ''Trautmann: The Biography'', p13&lt;/ref&gt; He had one brother, Karl-Heinz, three years his junior, with whom he enjoyed a close relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Rowlands, ''Trautmann: The Biography'', p14&lt;/ref&gt; The bleak economic climate of the early 1930s forced the Trautmanns to sell their house and move to an apartment block in the [[working class]] area of Gröpelingen, where Bernhard lived until 1941. The young Bernhard had a keen interest in sports, playing football, [[field handball|handball]] and völkerball (a form of [[dodgeball]]). To this end he joined the [[YMCA]] and football club ''Blau und Weiss''.&lt;ref&gt;Blau und Weisse later became part of the Tura Bremen club, so some sources list Tura as the club he played for as a junior.&lt;/ref&gt; He took to playing for the football club with enthusiasm, but the YMCA activities did not hold his attention to the same extent. In August 1933 he joined a new organisation instead, the [[Deutsches Jungvolk|Jungvolk]], a precursor to the [[Hitler Youth]].&lt;ref&gt;Rowlands, ''Trautmann: The Biography'', p19&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, he won several local junior athletics events and was awarded a certificate for athletic excellence signed by [[Paul von Hindenburg]], the President of Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Rowlands, ''Trautmann: The Biography'', p22&lt;/ref&gt; At the onset of the [[Second World War]], Trautmann was working as an [[apprentice]] [[motor mechanic]].&lt;ref name=&quot;hof&quot;&gt;James, ''The Official Manchester City Hall of Fame'', p134&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second World War==
In 1941 Trautmann joined the [[Luftwaffe]], initially as a radio operator. During training he did not show much aptitude for radio work and so he transferred to [[Spandau]] to become a ''[[Fallschirmjäger (Nazi Germany)|Fallschirmjäger]]'' ([[paratrooper]]).&lt;ref&gt;Rowlands, ''Trautmann: The Biography'', p38&lt;/ref&gt; He served first in [[Occupied Poland]], though a station far behind the front line resulted in boredom for his regiment, which resorted to sports and practical jokes to pass the time. One such practical joke involving a car backfired on Trautmann, resulting in a [[staff sergeant]] burning his arms. Trautmann was [[court-martial]]led, and received a three-month prison sentence. At the start of his confinement Trautmann came down with acute [[appendicitis]], and spent the remainder of his sentence in a [[military hospital]].&lt;ref&gt;Rowlands, ''Trautmann: The Biography'', pp. 43–44.&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1941 he rejoined the 35th at [[Dnepropetrovsk]], [[Ukraine]], where the [[German Army|German]] advance had halted because of the early onset of winter. Over-winter hit-and-run attacks on [[Soviet Army]] supply routes were the main focus of the unit, and in spring Trautmann was promoted to [[corporal]]. Gains were made in 1942, but the Soviet counter-offensive hit Trautmann's unit hard, and by the time it was withdrawn from the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]], only 300 of the original 1,000 remained.&lt;ref&gt;Rowlands, ''Trautmann: The Biography'', p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; Trautmann won five medals for his actions on the Eastern Front, including an [[Iron Cross]] First Class.&lt;ref name=&quot;hof&quot;/&gt;

Promoted to [[sergeant]], Trautmann was part of a unit formed from the remnants of several others which had been decimated in the east, stationed in [[France]] in preparation for the Allied [[Invasion of Normandy]]. In 1944 he was one of the few survivors of the Allied bombing of [[Kleve]],&lt;ref name=&quot;indypow&quot;&gt;{{cite web| last=Turnbull|first=Simon|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-from-prisoner-of-war-to-folklore-1093866.html|title=From prisoner of war to folklore |publisher=''[[The Independent]]''|date=16 May 1999 |accessdate=17 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and with no unit left he decided to head homeward to Bremen. By this point German soldiers without valid leave papers were being shot as deserters, so Trautmann sought to avoid troops from either side. However, a few days later he was captured in a barn by two [[US Army|American soldiers]]. Deciding that Trautmann had no useful intelligence to give them, the soldiers marched him out of the barn with his hands raised.&lt;ref&gt;Rowlands, ''Trautmann: The Biography'', p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; Fearing he was about to be executed, Trautmann fled. After gaining enough distance to evade his captors, he jumped over a fence, only to land at the feet of a [[British Army|British soldier]], who greeted him with the words ''&quot;Hello Fritz, fancy a cup of tea?&quot;''&lt;ref name=&quot;KoL&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Turnbull|first=Simon|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/keeper-of-legends-from-enemy-to-friend--anglogerman-relations-could-not-be-in-better-hands-477168.html |title=Keeper of legends |publisher=''[[The Independent on Sunday]]''|date=7 May 2006 |accessdate=17 August 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier in the war he had been captured by the [[Soviet Union|Russians]] and later the [[French Resistance]], but escaped both times.&lt;ref name=&quot;hof&quot;/&gt; With the war drawing to a close, Trautmann did not attempt a third escape. He was initially imprisoned near [[Ostend]], [[Belgium]], then transferred to a transit camp in [[Essex]], where he was interrogated. As a volunteer soldier who had been subject to [[indoctrination]] from a young age, he was classified as a category &quot;C&quot; prisoner by the authorities, meaning he was regarded as a [[Nazi]].&lt;ref name=&quot;hof 135&quot;&gt;James, ''The Official Manchester City Hall of Fame'', p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt; Trautmann, one of only 90 of his original regiment to survive the war,&lt;ref name=&quot;indypow&quot;/&gt; was then transferred to a [[prisoner-of-war camp]] at [[Marbury Hall, Anderton with Marbury | Marbury Hall]], near [[Northwich]], [[Cheshire]], interned with other category &quot;C&quot; prisoners. He was soon downgraded to non-Nazi &quot;B&quot; status,&lt;ref&gt;Rowlands, ''Trautmann: The Biography'', p63&lt;/ref&gt; following which he was taken to PoW Camp 50 (now [[Byrchall High School]]) in [[Ashton-in-Makerfield]], a small town in [[Lancashire]] between [[St Helens, Merseyside|St Helens]] and [[Wigan]], where he stayed until 1948.&lt;ref name=&quot;hof 135&quot;/&gt; Football matches were regularly held at the camp, in which Trautmann played outfield. However, in a match against amateur team [[Haydock|Haydock Park]], Trautmann picked up an injury while playing [[centre-half]]. He asked to swap positions with goalkeeper Gunther Luhr, and from that day forward played as a goalkeeper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Philip|first=Robert |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/2367646/Salute-to-a-true-Cup-final-legend-legend.html |title=Salute to a true Cup final legend |publisher=''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''|date=3 November 2005 |accessdate=17 August 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was during this time he became known as ''&quot;Bert&quot;'', as the English had trouble pronouncing &quot;Bernd&quot;, the abbreviated version of his name.

==Early football career==
With closure of the PoW camp imminent, Trautmann declined an offer of [[repatriation]] and stayed in Britain,&lt;ref name=&quot;ESPN&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Wilson|first=Steve |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/columns/story?id=344190&amp;root=england&amp; |title=A life less ordinary |publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=3 October 2005 |accessdate=17 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; working on a farm,&lt;ref name=&quot;bluemoon&quot;&gt;Clayton, ''Everything under the blue moon'', p196&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently working on [[bomb disposal]] in [[Huyton]].&lt;ref name=&quot;hof135&quot;&gt;James, ''The Official Manchester City Hall of Fame'', p135&lt;/ref&gt; He also played amateur football for the Liverpool County Combination club [[St Helens Town F.C.|St Helens Town]], through which he met the club secretary's daughter, Margaret Friar, whom he later married.&lt;ref name=&quot;bluemoon&quot;/&gt; Over the course of the 1948–49 season Trautmann's goalkeeping reputation steadily grew, and a series of high crowds were attributed to his displays,&lt;ref name=&quot;ESPN&quot;/&gt; including a record 9,000&amp;nbsp;attendance in the final of a local cup competition, the Mahon Cup.&lt;ref&gt;Rowlands, ''Trautmann: The Biography'', p85&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manchester City==
As the following season commenced, a number of [[Football League|League]] clubs showed interest in signing Trautmann. The first to offer him a contract was [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]], and on 7 October 1949 Trautmann signed for the club as an amateur, turning professional shortly after.&lt;ref name=&quot;mre&quot;&gt;Penney, ''The Maine Road Encyclopedia'', p194&lt;/ref&gt;

===Supporter discontent===
Some Manchester City fans were not happy about having a former member of the [[Luftwaffe]] on the team. Season ticket holders threatened a [[boycott]] and various groups in Manchester and around the country bombarded the club with protest letters. Besides the difficulties with his nationality, Trautmann was replacing the recently retired [[Frank Swift]], one of the greatest keepers in the club's history.&lt;ref name=&quot;hof76&quot;&gt;James, ''The Official Manchester City Hall of Fame'', p76&lt;/ref&gt; Though privately expressing doubts about the signing,&lt;ref&gt;Rowlands, ''Trautmann: The Biography'', p97&lt;/ref&gt; club captain [[Eric Westwood]], a Normandy veteran, made a public display of welcoming Trautmann by announcing &quot;There's no war in this dressing room&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Paskowsky|first=Matthias |url=http://www.11freunde.de/geschichtsstunde/100323?PHPSESSID=0 |language=German|title=Kein Krieg in dieser Kabine |publisher=''[[11 Freunde]]''|date=13 February 2007 |accessdate=17 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trautmann made his [[first team]] debut on 19 November against [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]],&lt;ref name=&quot;mre&quot;/&gt; and after a competent display in his first home match for the club protests shrank, as fans discovered his talent.&lt;ref name=&quot;hof137&quot;/&gt; He continued to receive abuse from crowds at away matches, which affected his concentration in some of his early games; in December 1949 he conceded seven goals at [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]].&lt;ref&gt;Rowlands, ''Trautmann: The Biography'', p99&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James, ''Manchester City&amp;nbsp;– The Complete Record'', p366&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Johnny Haynes Stand.JPG|thumb|Trautmann's visit to [[Craven Cottage]] in 1950 resulted in widespread media attention]] City's match against [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] in January 1950 was Trautmann's first visit to London. The match received widespread media attention as the majority of the British press were based in London; several leading sportswriters were watching Trautmann in action for the first time. The heavy damage caused to the city by the Luftwaffe meant former paratrooper Trautmann was a hate figure for the crowd, who yelled &quot;Kraut&quot; and &quot;Nazi&quot; at him.&lt;ref name=&quot;nfm&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Galvin|first=Robert |url=http://www.nationalfootballmuseum.com/pages/fame/Inductees/berttrautmann.htm |title=Bert Trautmann |publisher=[[National Football Museum]] |accessdate=17 August 2008}} {{Dead link|date=March 2012|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; City were struggling in the league, and were widely expected to suffer a heavy defeat. However, a string of saves from Trautmann meant that the final scoreline was a narrow 1–0 defeat instead. Upon the final whistle Trautmann received a standing ovation,&lt;ref name=&quot;nfm&quot;/&gt; and was applauded off the pitch by both sets of players.&lt;ref name=&quot;hof139&quot;&gt;James, ''The Official Manchester City Hall of Fame'', p139&lt;/ref&gt; The Manchester City team continued to struggle throughout the season, and were [[promotion and relegation|relegated]] to the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]].

===Successive cup finals===
Manchester City returned to the top flight at the first attempt, and in the following years Trautmann established himself as one of the best keepers in the league, playing all but five of his club's next 250&amp;nbsp;league matches.&lt;ref name=&quot;mre&quot;/&gt; By 1952 his fame had spread to his home country, leading [[FC Schalke 04|Schalke]] to offer Manchester City £1,000 for his services.&lt;ref name=&quot;hof137&quot;&gt;James, ''The Official Manchester City Hall of Fame'', p137&lt;/ref&gt; The offer was flatly refused, the club responding that they thought Trautmann to be worth twenty times more.&lt;ref&gt;Rowlands, ''Trautmann: The Biography'', p118&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-1950s Manchester City manager [[Les McDowall]] introduced a new tactical system using a deep-lying centre-forward, which became known as the ''[[Revie Plan]]'' after [[Don Revie]], who played the centre-forward role. The system depended on maintaining possession of the ball wherever possible, which required Trautmann to make use of his throwing ability. For goalkeepers of Trautmann's era it was usual to kick the ball as far as possible downfield after making a save. In contrast Trautmann, influenced by the Hungarian goalkeeper [[Gyula Grosics]], sought to start attacks by throwing the ball to a wing-half, typically [[Ken Barnes (footballer)|Ken Barnes]] or [[John McTavish]]. The wing-half would then pass to Revie, who developed the attack further.&lt;ref name=&quot;T157&quot;&gt;Rowlands, ''Trautmann: The Biography'', pp157–158&lt;/ref&gt; Using this system the club reached the [[1955 FA Cup Final]], in which Trautmann became the first German to play in an FA Cup final.&lt;ref name=&quot;KoL&quot;/&gt; City faced [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]], the winners of the cup in 1951 and 1952. Nerves affected the City players, and they went behind to a [[Jackie Milburn]] goal after only 45&amp;nbsp;seconds. Further problems were caused by the loss of [[Jimmy Meadows]] to injury after 18&amp;nbsp;minutes, leaving City with 10&amp;nbsp;men.&lt;ref&gt;James, ''Manchester City&amp;nbsp;– The Complete Record'', p49&lt;/ref&gt; The man advantage meant Trautmann's ability to start attacks from throws was limited. Though City equalised in the first half, they struggled in the second, and after 57&amp;nbsp;minutes Trautmann was outwitted by [[Bobby Mitchell (footballer)|Bobby Mitchell]], who scored Newcastle's second goal.&lt;ref&gt;Rowlands, ''Trautmann: The Biography'', p168&lt;/ref&gt; The match finished as a comfortable 3–1 win for Newcastle, and Trautmann gained only a runners-up medal.
[[File:Old Wembley Stadium (external view).jpg|thumb|300px|[[Wembley Stadium (1924)|Wembley Stadium]], the venue for the 1955 and 1956 FA Cup finals]]

Though defeated in the 1955 final, Manchester City had another strong season in [[1955-56 in English football|1955–56]], finishing fourth in the league and again reaching the FA Cup final, in which they faced [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]]. Trautmann was one of the team's most prominent performers. He had won the [[FWA Footballer of the Year]] Award shortly before the 1956 cup final,&lt;ref name=&quot;cr159&quot;&gt;James, ''Manchester City&amp;nbsp;– The Complete Record'', p159&lt;/ref&gt; the first goalkeeper to win the award. Two days later Trautmann stepped out onto the [[Wembley Stadium (1924)|Wembley]] pitch for the match that gained him worldwide acclaim.&lt;ref name=&quot;cr159&quot;/&gt; During the previous final, nervousness had contributed to the opposition scoring an early goal. The City team were more settled on this occasion however, and scored an early goal themselves, a left footed strike by [[Joe Hayes (footballer)|Joe Hayes]]. Birmingham equalised on 14&amp;nbsp;minutes. The match remained level until midway through the second half, when [[Jack Dyson]] and [[Bobby Johnstone]] scored two goals in as many minutes to give Manchester City a 3–1 lead. Birmingham attacked strongly in the next ten minutes. In the 75th minute Trautmann, diving at an incoming ball, was knocked out in a collision with Birmingham's [[Peter Murphy (footballer born 1922)|Peter Murphy]] in which he was hit in the neck by Murphy's right knee. No [[substitute (football)|substitutes]] were permitted, so Trautmann, dazed and unsteady on his feet, carried on. For the remaining 15&amp;nbsp;minutes he defended his net, making a crucial interception to deny Murphy once more. Manchester City held on for the victory, and Trautmann was the hero of the final because of his spectacular saves in the last minutes of the match. His neck continued to cause him pain, and [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Prince Philip]] commented on its crooked state as he gave Trautmann his winner's medal.&lt;ref name=&quot;TimesOBE&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Boyes|first=Roger|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article501385.ece|title=OBE for the German hero who stuck his neck out |publisher=''[[The Times]]''|date=1 November 2004|accessdate=17 August 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trautmann attended that evening's post-match banquet despite being unable to move his head,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://women.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/women/body_and_soul/article1937331.ece|title=Broken Dreams |publisher=''[[The Times]]''|date=16 June 2007|accessdate=17 August 2008 | location=London }}&lt;/ref&gt; and went to bed expecting the injury to heal with rest. As the pain did not recede, the following day he went to [[St George's Hospital]], where he was told he merely had a crick in his neck which would go away.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardianneck&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2006/may/06/sport.comment1|title=05.05.1956 Bert Trautmann breaks his neck |publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|date=6 May 2006|accessdate=17 August 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three days later, he got a [[second opinion (medicine)|second opinion]] from a doctor at [[Manchester Royal Infirmary]]. An [[X-ray]] revealed he had dislocated five [[vertebrae]] in his neck, the second of which was cracked in two.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardianneck&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bio184&quot;&gt;Rowlands, ''Trautmann: The Biography'', p184&lt;/ref&gt; The third vertebra had wedged against the second, preventing further damage which could have cost Trautmann his life.&lt;ref name=&quot;bio184&quot;/&gt;

===Recovery from injury===
Trautmann's convalescence took several months, resulting in him missing a large part of the [[1956-57 in English football|1956–57 season]]. [[Jack Savage (footballer)|Jack Savage]] deputised during his absence.&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, ''Century City&amp;nbsp;– Manchester City Football Club 1957/58'', page 200&lt;/ref&gt; At the start of December Trautmann played two reserve matches, but lacked confidence. He was restored to the first team on 15 December for a match against [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]], but conceded three goals. He continued to struggle for form in the remainder of the season, leading to some calls from fans and media for him to retire. Others criticised the club, believing that Trautmann had been forced to play while still not fully recovered from injury.&lt;ref name=&quot;bio195&quot;&gt;Rowlands, ''Trautmann: The Biography'', p195&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[1957-58 in English football|1957–58 season]] was an unusual one for Manchester City, who became the first and thus far only  English team to both score and concede 100 goals in a season.&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, ''Century City&amp;nbsp;– Manchester City Football Club 1957/58'', page ix&lt;/ref&gt; Trautmann played in 34 of these matches, and though he did not play in the 9–2 defeat to [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]], an 8–4 defeat to [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] was a record for the most goals conceded by Trautmann in a match at any point in his career,&lt;ref&gt;Rowlands, ''Trautmann: The Biography'', p199&lt;/ref&gt; and in the entire season he kept only two [[clean sheet]]s.&lt;ref&gt;James, ''Manchester City&amp;nbsp;– The Complete Record'', p383&lt;/ref&gt;

===Testimonial===
He appeared in 545&amp;nbsp;matches for City during the 15-year period between 1949 and 1964.

In 1964 he finished his career with a [[testimonial match|testimonial]] in front of an official crowd of 47,000,&lt;ref name=&quot;azmanc&quot;&gt;Brandon, ''A–Z of Manchester Football: 100 Years of Rivalry'', p220&lt;/ref&gt; though the actual figure was estimated to be closer to 60,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;hof142&quot;&gt;James, ''The Official Manchester City Hall of Fame'', p142&lt;/ref&gt; Trautmann captained a special joint Manchester City &amp; Manchester United XI that included [[Bobby Charlton]] and [[Denis Law]], against an England team that included [[Tom Finney]], [[Stanley Matthews]] and [[Jimmy Armfield]].

==International football==
Though recognised as one of the leading goalkeepers of his era, he never played for his native country. Trautmann met with German national coach [[Sepp Herberger]] in 1953, who explained that travel and political implications prevented him from selecting a player who was not readily available, and that he could only consider including Trautmann if he was playing in a German league.&lt;ref&gt;Rowlands, ''Trautmann: The Biography'', p123&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, Trautmann's [[international isolation]] prevented him from playing in the [[1954 FIFA World Cup|1954 World Cup]], in which his countrymen were victorious. Trautmann's only experience of international football came in 1960, when the Football League decided to include non-English players to represent the Football League in representative matches for the first time. Trautmann captained the League against the Irish League, and also played against the Italian League.

==Later career==
After leaving City Trautmann played briefly for [[Wellington Town F.C.|Wellington Town]], who offered him £50 per match. Age had diminished his abilities, but his debut at [[Hereford United F.C.|Hereford]] showed he still had the ability to draw crowds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archive.herefordtimes.com/2006/3/23/74394.html |title=The day Edgar St hailed brave Bert |publisher=''[[Hereford Times]]''|date=23 March 2006 |accessdate=17 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he was [[sent off]] at [[Tonbridge Angels F.C.|Tonbridge]] for violent conduct in his second match, and never played again.&lt;ref&gt;Rowlands, ''Trautmann: The Biography'', p216&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style of play==
Trautmann excelled at shot-stopping, particularly penalties, saving 60% of those he faced over the course of his career. [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] manager [[Matt Busby]] went so far as to mention Trautmann's anticipation in his pre-match team talks: &quot;Don't stop to think where you're going to hit it with Trautmann. Hit it first and think afterwards. If you look up and work it out he will read your thoughts and stop it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;nfm&quot;/&gt; Similar sentiments were expressed by Manchester City midfielder [[Neil Young (footballer born 1944)|Neil Young]] who recalled that &quot;the only way to beat him with a shot in training was to mishit it&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Penney, ''Manchester City: The Mercer-Allison Years'', p11&lt;/ref&gt; As a former handball player Trautmann was adept at throwing the ball long distances, an attribute he used to start attacking moves,&lt;ref name=&quot;ESPN&quot;/&gt; particularly after witnessing Hungarian goalkeeper [[Gyula Grosics]] use such tactics to good effect in Hungary's [[England v Hungary (1953)|6–3 victory over England]] in 1953.&lt;ref name=&quot;T157&quot;/&gt;

Trautmann found it difficult to accept criticism, and he allowed only close friends to suggest changes to his game. He occasionally dwelt on mistakes to the detriment of his concentration, a tendency his friend Stan Wilson called &quot;picking at daisies&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;T162&quot;&gt;Rowlands, ''Trautmann: The Biography'', p162&lt;/ref&gt; A short temper also caused occasional problems; he was sent off on more than one occasion.&lt;ref name=&quot;T162&quot;/&gt;

==Coaching career==
After a couple of months pondering his future career plans he received a telephone call from [[Stockport County F.C.|Stockport County]] chairman [[Victor Bernard]], who offered him the position of general manager. Stockport were a struggling lower league team with a small budget, and Trautmann's appointment was an attempt to improve the image of the club. Many people in the local area supported one of the two Manchester clubs, so to stimulate interest Trautmann and Bernard decided to move matches to Friday evenings, when neither Manchester club would be playing.&lt;ref&gt;Rowlands, ''Trautmann: The Biography'', p218&lt;/ref&gt; This improved revenue, but the team continued to struggle. Trautmann resigned in 1966 following a disagreement with Bernard.&lt;ref&gt;Rowlands, ''Trautmann: The Biography'', p223&lt;/ref&gt; From 1967 to 1968 he was manager of the German team [[Preußen Münster]], taking them to a 13th-place finish in the [[Regionalliga West (1963-74)|Regionalliga West]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |language=German|url=http://www.fussballdaten.de/spieler/trautmannbernd/ |title=Bernd Trautmann |publisher=[[Fussballdaten]] |accessdate=17 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; following which he had a short spell at [[Opel Rüsselsheim]]. The German Football Association then sent him as a development worker to countries without national football structures. His first posting was in [[Burma]], where he spent two years as the national coach, qualifying for the [[Football at the 1972 Summer Olympics|Olympics]] in 1972, and winning the President's Cup, a tournament contested by southeast Asian countries, later that year.&lt;ref&gt;Rowlands, ''Trautmann: The Biography'', p234&lt;/ref&gt; His work subsequently took him to [[Tanzania]], [[Liberia]], [[Pakistan]] and [[Yemen]], until 1988, when he retired and settled in Spain.

==Legacy and influence==
{{quote box|width=25%|fontsize=95%|quote=''There have only been two world-class goalkeepers. One was Lev Yashin, the other was the German boy who played in Manchester – Trautmann.''|source=—[[Lev Yashin]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Lev Yashin - Quotes |url=http://www.spiritus-temporis.com/lev-yashin/quotes.html |publisher=spiritus-temporis.com |accessdate=9 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Over the course of his career Trautmann received many plaudits from leading football figures. Russian goalkeeper [[Lev Yashin]], himself considered one of the greatest goalkeepers of all time, believed that Trautmann and himself were the &quot;only ... two world-class goalkeepers&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ESPN&quot;/&gt; 

Trautmann's idiosyncratic style of play also had an influence on budding young goalkeepers at the height of his career. Former [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] goalkeeper [[Bob Wilson (footballer born 1941)|Bob Wilson]] names Trautmann as his boyhood hero,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Harper|first=Nick|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2003/may/16/newsstory.sport8 |title=Small Talk: FA Cup Special |publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|date=16 May 2003 |accessdate=17 August 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Gordon Banks]] cited him as an influence on his playing style.&lt;ref&gt;Rowlands, ''Trautmann: The Biography'', p247&lt;/ref&gt;

Media outlets have since recognised Trautmann's reputation, with Trautmann placed unofficially as the 19th greatest goalkeeper of all-time by the [[Daily Mail]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=THE LIST: 20-11 of Sportsmail's top goalkeepers |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1135847/THE-LIST-20-11-Sportsmails-goalkeepers.html |publisher=www.dailymail.co.uk |work=Daily Mail |date=5 February 2009 |accessdate=5 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[ESPN]] consider Trautmann as one of the greatest FA Cup goalkeepers, with Trautmann representing Manchester City in two consecutive FA Cup finals in 1955 and 1956&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=The FA Cup's Greatest Goalkeepers |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/columns/story/_/id/861893/the-fa-cup's-greatest-goalkeepers?cc=5739 |publisher=http://soccernet.espn.go.com |work=ESPN |date=6 January 2011 |accessdate=5 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; while his lunge at [[Peter Murphy (footballer born 1922)|Peter Murphy]]'s feet to grasp the ball in the 1956 FA Cup Final is rated as the greatest FA Cup save - a save that broke Trautmann's neck.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=E.ON Great Saves No.1: Bert Trautmann |url=http://www.mirrorfootball.co.uk/archive/E-ON-Great-Saves-No-1-Bert-Trautmann-article271729.html |publisher=http://www.mirrorfootball.co.uk |accessdate=27 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
He was appointed an honorary [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] in 2004 for his work in [[Anglo-German relations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/3972309.stm |title=Football star Trautmann given OBE |publisher=BBC|date=1 November 2004 |accessdate=17 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005 he was inducted into the [[National Football Museum]]'s Hall of Fame.&lt;ref name=&quot;nfm&quot;/&gt;

==Personal life==
Trautmann married a Manchester woman, Margaret Friar, in 1950, but they divorced in the 1960s. The couple had three children, John, Mark and Stephen. John, his firstborn son, was killed in a car accident a few months after the FA Cup Final in 1956, aged five. According to Trautmann his wife's struggle to come to terms with the loss ultimately resulted in the breakup of their marriage.&lt;ref name=&quot;KoL&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rowlands, ''Trautmann: The Biography'', p226&lt;/ref&gt; He married Ursula Van der Heyde, a German national, while living in Burma in the 1970s, but divorced in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;Rowlands, ''Trautmann: The Biography'', p242&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1990 Trautmann has lived with his third wife Marlis in a small bungalow on the Spanish coast near [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]]. He has since helped found the 
''[[Trautmann Foundation]]'' which aims to use his example to improve Anglo-German relations through football.

Trautmann still follows Manchester City and occasionally visits Manchester to watch Manchester City play, as he did in April 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=City salutes Bert Traumann |url=http://www.mcfc.co.uk/Video/Features/Bert-Trautmann-video |publisher=www.mcfc.co.uk |work=Manchester City Football Club |date=13 April 2010 |accessdate=5 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trautmann said during his visit that he watches all of Manchester City's matches: &quot;I watch all City's games on TV, they're still my club&quot; and added &quot;I love England too and still shout for them – even if they're playing Germany!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Bert: Prem stars couldn't care less |url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/2926741/Manchester-City-legend-Bert-Trautmann-Todays-Premiership-stars-couldnt-care-less.html |publisher=www.thesun.co.uk |date=10 April 2010 |accessdate=5 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999 he appeared in the BBC ''[[Timewatch]]'' programme episode; &quot;The Germans We Kept&quot;, recounting the experiences of German [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] who decided to remain in England.&lt;ref&gt;BBC Timewatch episode &quot;The Germans We Kept&quot;, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;
