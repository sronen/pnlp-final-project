'''Martin Pierre Brodeur''' ({{IPA-fr|maʁtɛ̃ bʁɔdœʁ}}; born May 6, 1972) is a Canadian [[ice hockey]] [[goaltender]] who has played his entire [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) career with the [[New Jersey Devils]].  In his 19-year tenure with the Devils, he has won three [[Stanley Cup]] championships and has been in the playoffs every year but two. Brodeur has won two Olympic [[gold medal]]s with [[Canadian national men's hockey team|Team Canada]] in the [[2002 Winter Olympics|2002]] and [[2010 Winter Olympics|2010]] [[Winter Olympic Games]], as well as several other medals with Team Canada in other international competitions.

Brodeur is the NHL's all-time leader in regular season wins (surpassing [[Patrick Roy]] in 2009), losses, [[shutout (ice hockey)|shutout]]s, and games played, and holds numerous other league and franchise records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=414407 | title = Is Brodeur setting the bar beyond reach? | publisher = NHL.com | first = Dan | last = Rosen | date = 2009-03-18 | accessdate = 2009-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brodeur won at least 35 games in every season between [[1996–97 NHL season|1996–97]] and [[2007–08 NHL season|2007–08]], and is the only goalie in NHL history with eight 40-win seasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/recap.htm?id=2009021081|title=Brodeur reaches 40 wins again as Devils rip Jackets|publisher=NHL.com|author=Morreale, Mike G.|date=2010-03-23|accessdate=2010-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is a four-time [[Vezina Trophy]] winner, a five-time [[Jennings Trophy]] winner, a ten-time [[NHL All-Star Game|NHL All-Star]], a [[Calder Memorial Trophy]] winner, and one of only two NHL goaltenders to have scored goals in both the regular season and the playoffs.&lt;ref name=&quot;nhl.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nhl.com/ice/player.htm?id=8455710&amp;view=notes | title = Martin Brodeur, Devils – Notes | publisher = NHL.com | accessdate = 2009-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MainBio&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hockeygoalies.org/bio/brodeurm.html|title=Martin Brodeur Biography|publisher=hockeygoalies.org|accessdate=2006-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brodeur is widely considered by sports analysts and fans alike as the greatest goaltender in National Hockey League history. 

Brodeur uses a [[Butterfly style#Profly and hybrid|hybrid style]] of goaltending by [[stand-up style|standing up]] more than [[butterfly style]] goalies.&lt;ref name=&quot;butterfly&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url = http://msn.foxsports.com/nhl/story/9331992/Devils-Brodeur-closes-in-on-record-for-wins | title = A standup guy – or is he? | publisher = [[FoxSports.com]] | agency = Associated Press | date = 2009-03-14 | accessdate = 2009-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cox&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/columns/story?columnist=cox_damien&amp;id=3990924 | title = Brodeur the best?

==Early life==
Brodeur's success followed his father [[Denis Brodeur|Denis]], who was considered an outstanding goaltender.&lt;ref name=&quot;HHOFjournal&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hhof.com/HTML/exSCJ_33.shtml|title=Stanley Cup Journal|accessdate=2006-12-01|date=August 22, 2003|work=HHOF.com|publisher=[[Hockey Hall of Fame]]|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110604124252/http://www.hhof.com/HTML/exSCJ_33.shtml|archivedate=June 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He played in the [[Ice hockey at the 1956 Winter Olympics|1956 Olympics]] for [[Canadian national men's hockey team|Team Canada]] and won a bronze medal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Olympics&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Allen|first=Kevin|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/olympics/torino/2006-01-29-brodeur_x.htm|title=Brodeur following in father's mask|date=2006-01-29|accessdate=2006-12-01|publisher=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his playing career was over, Denis was a longtime photographer for the [[Montreal Canadiens]]. For more than 20 years, he attended all Montreal games and practices, and when Martin was old enough he came along. Martin idolized their goaltender [[Patrick Roy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wigge|first=Larry|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1208/is_23_225/ai_75434961|title=Q&amp;A – hockey players Patrick Roy and Martin Brodeur – Brief Article – Interview|date=2001-06-04|accessdate=2007-04-27|publisher=Sporting Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Martin did not start out as a goalie himself, but rather as a forward. His goaltending career began when his coach asked him if he wanted to play as a backup at the position in a youth tournament. Martin explained:&lt;ref name=&quot;GoalieDecision&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.martinbrodeur.net/index.php?lng=en&amp;vyber=fakty|title=Martin Brodeur – Facts|publisher=MartinBrodeur.net|accessdate=2007-04-06|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Cquote|The next season my coach came up to me and said, 'Do you want to be a goalie or forward this year?' It was the biggest decision of my life, and I was seven years old. I don't know why I decided, but I thought it would be fun to play goal.}}

Brodeur's play in goal soon got him noticed by fans and scouts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scouts&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ca.askmen.com/men/sports_60/86c_martin_brodeur.html|title=Martin Brodeur|publisher=AskMen.com|accessdate=2007-04-07|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, he made it to the [[Quebec Major Junior Hockey League|Quebec Major Junior League]]. While playing with the [[Saint-Hyacinthe Laser]], Brodeur made the QMJHL All-Rookie team and the QMJHL 2nd All-Star Team in [[1991–92 QMJHL season|1992]].

Brodeur was drafted by the [[New Jersey Devils]] in the first round (20th overall) in the [[1990 NHL Entry Draft]].

== NHL career ==
=== 1991–95  ===
In the [[1991–92 NHL season]], he was called up to the Devils on an emergency basis for four games when Devils goaltenders [[Chris Terreri]] and [[Craig Billington]] became injured. Brodeur won his NHL debut against the [[Boston Bruins]], 4–2,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=413372&amp;navid=DL|NHL|Home | title = Brodeur was a scorer before he was a goalie | publisher = [[NHL.com]] | first = Dan | last = Rosen | date = 2009-03-12 | accessdate = 2009-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and played in one playoff game that season. He spent most of the season and the entire following season with the [[Utica Devils]] of the AHL. However, in the [[1993–94 NHL season|1993–94 season]], Brodeur gained recognition when he won the [[Calder Memorial Trophy|Calder Trophy]], an annual award for the best rookie in the NHL, after leading the Devils to the second-best record in the league and the [[1994 Stanley Cup Playoffs#Eastern Conference Final|Eastern Conference Finals]] in the playoffs, where they lost to the [[New York Rangers]] in seven games.&lt;ref name=&quot;1994 Playoffs&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nbpfaus.net/~pfau/nhl/1994.html|title=1994 National Hockey League Playoffs|publisher=nbpfaus.net|accessdate=2007-02-09|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; He finished 2nd in [[goals against average]] (2.40) and 4th in [[save percentage]] (.915) in 47 games played during the regular season, helping him eventually land the starting job over Terreri.

The [[1994–95 NHL season]] season, which was shortened to 48 games due to a [[1994–95 NHL lockout|four-month lockout]] that was focused on salary cap issues, the Devils finished tied for 9th overall, 5th in their conference, but they were not considered a [[Stanley Cup]] contender. However, with the leadership of Brodeur, they defeated the Boston Bruins in the 1st round after shutting them out in three of their four wins. Brodeur had another stellar performance in the second round against [[Pittsburgh Penguins|Pittsburgh]], where he gave up only eight goals and helped the Devils soundly defeat the Penguins in five games. In the third round, the Devils defeated [[Philadelphia Flyers|Philadelphia]] in six games, giving them their first Stanley Cup finals appearance in franchise history, opposite the heavily favoured [[Detroit Red Wings]]. But the strong play of Brodeur and the Devils' infamous &quot;[[Neutral zone trap|trap]]&quot; method made the series lopsided in favour of New Jersey, who swept the Red Wings while holding them to only seven goals in four games. Brodeur now had a Stanley Cup in only his second full season in the NHL. After the victory, he was quoted as saying the following:&lt;ref name=&quot;MainBio&quot;/&gt;

{{cquote|In the last game against Detroit, the time from ten minutes left to one minute left was probably the longest nine minutes of my life. But from one to zero was probably the greatest time I've ever had. I didn't want the clock to run out. It was such a great feeling: people crying in the stands, people jumping up and down, people cheering. Guys couldn't even sit up on the bench. It was probably the best minute of my life.}}

=== 1995–99 ===
After a year of success, the Devils were in the middle of the pack for most of the [[1995–96 NHL season|1995–96 season]] and barely missed the playoffs. Brodeur played in 74 of his team's 82 games, setting a single-season record for most minutes played by a goalie, while having the 2nd-most shutouts (6) in the league. He was named the starter in the [[46th National Hockey League All-Star Game|All-Star Game]] for the [[Eastern Conference (NHL)|Eastern Conference]] and stopped all 12 shots he faced.&lt;ref name=&quot;MainBio&quot;/&gt; He finished fourth in voting for the [[Vezina Trophy]], which is awarded to the league's top goaltender. Brodeur also played on [[Canada men's national ice hockey team|Team Canada]] during the [[1996 World Cup of Hockey]], where Canada lost to the United States in the gold medal match.

In the [[1996–97 NHL season|1996–97 season]], the Devils finished 3rd in the NHL. Brodeur was runner-up for the Vezina Trophy, was named to the [[47th National Hockey League All-Star Game|All-Star team]], and had the lowest goals against average by a goalie in almost 30 years, earning him the [[Jennings Trophy]]. He also had 10 shutouts and a .927 save percentage. On April 17, 1997, in the first game of a first-round playoff matchup against the Montreal Canadiens, Brodeur fired the puck the length of the ice and into the Canadiens' empty net to ensure a 5–2 victory. It was only the second time in NHL history that a [[List of goaltenders who have scored a goal in an NHL game|goaltender had scored]] in the playoffs, and the fifth time overall.&lt;ref name=&quot;GoalScored&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.martinbrodeur.net/index.php?lng=en&amp;vyber=fakty|title=Martin Brodeur – Facts|publisher=MartinBrodeur.net|accessdate=2006-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Devils went on to win that series, but lost in the second round to the rival New York Rangers.

The following year, Brodeur had 43 wins and 10 shutouts in the regular season. The Devils finished first in the Eastern Conference,&lt;ref name=&quot;1stplace1998&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/leagues/seasons/nhl19271998.html|title=1997–98 NHL Standings|publisher=hockeydb.com|accessdate=2007-03-03|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; but lost in the first round of the playoffs to the eighth-seeded [[Ottawa Senators]].&lt;ref name=&quot;98playoffs&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/playoffdisplay.php3?league=NHL1927&amp;season=1998&amp;leaguenm=NHL|title=1997–98 NHL Playoff Results|publisher=hockeydb.com|accessdate=2007-03-03|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once again, Brodeur made the [[48th National Hockey League All-Star Game|All-Star Team]], finished as a runner-up for the Vezina Trophy, and won the Jennings Trophy.&lt;ref name=&quot;98Jennings&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hockeynut.com/9899/awards98.html|title=1998 NHL Awards|publisher=hockeynut.com|accessdate=2007-03-03|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[1998–99 NHL season|1998–99 season]], the Devils finished first in the Eastern Conference for the third straight year, with Brodeur winning 39 games. He was among the contenders for the Vezina Trophy and started in the [[49th National Hockey League All-Star Game|All-Star game]], making his fourth appearance. However, the Devils lost in the first round to the Penguins. It was the worst playoff performance in Brodeur's five-year career, as he allowed 20 goals in seven games with an .856 save percentage.&lt;ref name=&quot;PlayoffStats&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/player.htm?id=8455710&amp;tab=crst|title=Martin Brodeur – Career statistics|publisher=NHL.com|accessdate=2007-03-03|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1999–2004 ===
During the [[1999–2000 NHL season|1999–2000 season]], on February 15, 2000, Brodeur was credited with his second career goal, as Brodeur was the last Devils player on the ice to touch the puck before [[Daymond Langkow]] of the [[Philadelphia Flyers]] accidentally put the puck into his own empty net during a delayed penalty call against the Devils.&lt;ref name=&quot;2ndGoal&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Bostrom, Don.|url=http://www.mcall.com/sports/columnists/all-nhlcolumnsundayfeb11,0,4691572.column?page=2&amp;coll=all-randomcolumnistssport-misc|title=Devils' Brodeur is closing in on becoming NHL's new zero hero|publisher=mccall.com|date=February 11, 2007|accessdate=2007-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brodeur had previously tapped the puck behind his net, stopping an attempted wrap-around by a Philadelphia Flyer.

That season, Brodeur won 43 games for the second time in his career, and the Devils finished with the fourth spot in the Eastern Conference after losing the division to the Philadelphia Flyers by two points.&lt;ref name=&quot;9900standings&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/leagues/seasons/nhl19272000.html|title=1999-00 NHL Standings|publisher=hockeydb.com|accessdate=2007-03-20|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brodeur helped the Devils sweep the [[Florida Panthers]] in the first round, giving up only six goals in four games. In the next round against the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] he recorded two shutouts, including one in the final game of the series as the Devils went on to win four games to two, setting up a showdown with rival Philadelphia in the Eastern Conference Finals. The Flyers took a commanding 3–1 series lead and had home ice to close out the series, but Brodeur gave up only one goal in each of the remaining three games of the series, propelling the Devils to the surprising come from behind series victory in 7 games. They went on to play the [[Dallas Stars]] in the Stanley Cup Finals, who had a higher seed but fewer regular season points, giving the Devils home ice advantage in the series. After taking game one with a 7-goal rally against Dallas, the Devils were led by Brodeur the rest of the way as he gave up only six goals in the next five games, giving the team their second Stanley Cup Championship in six years.&lt;ref name=&quot;9900playoffs&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/playoffdisplay.php3?league=NHL1927&amp;season=2000&amp;leaguenm=NHL|title=1999-00 NHL Playoffs|publisher=hockeydb.com|date=June 10, 2001, 2000|accessdate=2007-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next year, Brodeur topped the 40-win mark for the third time in his career, despite having an average GAA and save-percentage throughout the season. He played in the All-Star Game for the 6th consecutive season, and helped the Devils earn the top seed in the Eastern Conference. In the first round Brodeur recorded two shutouts against the [[Carolina Hurricanes]] and the Devils took the series in six games. After struggling to beat 7th-seeded Toronto in seven games, the Devils had little trouble defeating the 6th-seeded Penguins in the Eastern Conference Finals, where Brodeur added two more shutouts, both on the road. In their second straight Stanley Cup finals appearance, the Devils played a back-and-forth series against the top seeded [[Colorado Avalanche]].&lt;ref name=&quot;2001finals1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/hockey/nhl/recaps/2001/06/07/njd_col|title=Game 6 recap|publisher=CNN SI|date=June 8, 2001|accessdate=2007-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;2001finals2&quot;&gt;{{cite news|author=Associated Press|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/hockey/nhl/2001/playoffs/news/2001/06/10/devils_folo_ap|title=Devils fall one game short in repeat quest|publisher=CNN SI|date=June 10, 2001|accessdate=2007-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Brodeur2003.jpg|thumb|right|Brodeur during pre-game warmups in March 2003]]
In the [[2001–02 NHL season|2001–02 season]], Brodeur finished among the league leaders in wins and GAA. Brodeur continued to lead the league in victories and remained a Vezina and MVP candidate. The next season, in [[2002–03 NHL season|2002–03]], Brodeur finally achieved what had been eluding him his whole career: the Vezina Trophy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vezina&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Roarke, Shawn P.|url=http://www.nhl.com/hockeyu/history/trophies/brodeur_vezina061203.html|title=At long last, the Vezina|publisher=NHL.com|date=June 12, 2003|accessdate=2007-03-03}}{{dead link|date=January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also won the Jennings Trophy again, was a [[Hart Memorial Trophy]] finalist for the league's Most Valuable Player, and was named a 1st Team All-Star and started in the All-Star Game. With one of the most impressive playoff performances of his career, Brodeur guided the Devils to their third Stanley Cup victory after dramatic seven-game series wins against the top-seeded Ottawa Senators and the surprising 7th-seeded [[Mighty Ducks of Anaheim]]. He posted 3 shutouts against Anaheim and had a playoff total of 7 overall,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scores.espn.go.com/nhl/recap?gameId=230609011|title=NHL Scoreboard – June 9, 2003: Anaheim Ducks at New Jersey Devils (recap)|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures|accessdate=2007-04-17|date=2003-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; breaking [[Dominik Hašek]]'s NHL record of 6 (Hasek had recorded his 6 shutouts for Detroit the previous year).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Associated Press|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/hockey/2003/playoffs/news/2003/06/10/devils_btn|title=2003 NHL playoffs – Statitudes|publisher=CNN SI|year=2003|accessdate=2007-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, the [[Conn Smythe Trophy]] for playoff MVP was awarded to Anaheim goaltender [[Jean-Sébastien Giguère]], who became the first player not on the championship team to be named playoff MVP since [[Ron Hextall]] of Philadelphia in 1987.&lt;ref name=&quot;ConnSmythe&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/trophies/smythe.html|title=Conn Smythe Trophy|publisher=NHL.com|accessdate=2007-03-05|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some hockey writers speculated a New Jersey player did not win because there were multiple candidates, resulting in a [[split vote]] among the sportswriters who selected the winner.&lt;ref name=&quot;PreSmythe03&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/story/2003/06/06/conn_smythe030606.html|title=Who will win the Conn Smythe?|publisher=CBC Sports|accessdate=2006-11-28|date=2003-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GiguereSmythe&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/hockey/cup/2003-06-09-giguere-smythe_x.htm|title=Trophy, stats no consolation for Giguere|publisher=[[USA Today]]|date=June 9, 2003|accessdate=2006-11-28 | first1=Rod | last1=Beaton}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the [[2003–04 NHL season|2003–04 season]], Brodeur won his second consecutive Vezina Trophy and Jennings trophy. He was also a first Team All-Star, a starter in the NHL All-Star Game, and a finalist for the Hart Trophy again. The Devils lost the [[Atlantic Division (NHL)|Atlantic Division]] title by 1 point to the Philadelphia Flyers, who had obtained the 3-seed and home ice advantage against the sixth seeded Devils in the first round of the playoffs. This would be too much for Brodeur and the Devils to overcome, as the Flyers went on to defeat them in five games.

=== The Brodeur Rule ===
[[File:NHL Hockey Rink.svg|thumb|150px|The goaltender trapezoids behind each goal, added by the NHL before the 2005–06 season, were widely viewed as singling out Brodeur for his puck-handling skills.]]
After the 2004–05 lockout and before the start of the 2005–06 season, the league instituted a new rule preventing goaltenders from playing the puck behind the [[goal line (ice hockey)|goal line]], except within a [[trapezoid]]-shaped zone located behind the net. The trapezoid begins at the goal line with angled lines six feet from each [[goal post]] and widens to 28 feet at the  [[boards (ice hockey)|end boards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/rules/rule31.html|title=NHL Rulebook Rule 31: Goaltender Penalties|publisher=NHL.com|year=2005|accessdate=2007-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former Flyers general manager Bobby Clarke was one of the leaders in getting the trapezoid implemented. This was viewed by many as singling out Brodeur, who was one of the best at getting behind the net to handle the puck, and has come to be known as the &quot;Brodeur Rule&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Diamos2007&quot;&gt;{{cite news|author=Diamos, Jason.|url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10616F835550C758DDDA00894DD404482|title=New Rule Will Take a Weapon Away from Brodeur|publisher=''[[New York Times]]'' (subscription required)|date=September 16, 2005|accessdate=2007-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jones, Tom.|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2005/09/18/Sports/Brodeur_not_handling_.shtml|title=Brodeur not handling new rule well|publisher=[[St. Petersburg Times]]|date=September 18, 2005|accessdate=2007-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 2009 NHL General Managers' Meeting it was discussed whether the rule should be eliminated as a solution to the increasing number of injuries on defensemen who are being hit hard by forechecking forwards. The forecheckers were no longer impeded by defensemen holding them up because of the crackdown on interference which created situations where defensemen were being hit at high speeds. Brodeur believed that revoking the trapezoid could result in more scoring and more exciting games. He explained, &quot;If you give the liberty to the goalies to play the puck, they'll mess up more than they're successful.&quot; He also expressed his concern for defensemen, &quot;It's a no-brainer if they want to start to eliminate these huge hits for the defensemen... Whenever my defensemen or somebody was getting a big hit, I felt guilty that I let that guy get hit like that. Now, I've got to sit and watch all the time... You've got to try to find something because so many guys are getting hurt.&quot; At the time of his statement, Devils defensemen [[Paul Martin (ice hockey)|Paul Martin]], [[Johnny Oduya]] and [[Bryce Salvador]] were all out with injuries. Devils coach [[Jacques Lemaire]] supported removing the trapezoid and commented that, &quot;They never put a rule against [[Wayne Gretzky]] because he was so great... To me, it's good and it's a gamble that having the goaltender come out, and it's – hey, you've got to play smart against them.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Brodeur hopes NHL banishes trapezoid&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.northjersey.com/blogs/fireice/comments/brodeur_hopes_nhl_banishes_trapezoid/|title=Brodeur hopes NHL banishes trapezoid|publisher=Fire&amp;Ice|accessdate=2009-11-10|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultimately the suggestion was rejected and the rule stayed in place. [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] GM [[Brian Burke (ice hockey)|Brian Burke]] said, &quot;We had originally approved a rule where the goaltenders couldn't handle the puck behind the net at all. The game was turning into a tennis match.

After the [[2004–05 NHL lockout]] canceled the [[2004–05 NHL season|2004–05 season]], Brodeur signed a contract extension with the Devils on January 27, 2006, that will pay him $31.2 million over six years. In the [[2005–06 NHL season|2005–06 season]] he posted 43 wins, adding on to his NHL records of what was now five 40-win seasons and ten consecutive 30-win seasons.&lt;ref name=&quot;30and10&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Associated Press]]|url=http://www.tsn.ca/nhl/teams/news_story/?ID=157193&amp;hubname=nhl-devils|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070310131328/http://www.tsn.ca/nhl/teams/news_story/?ID=157193&amp;hubname=nhl-devils|archivedate=2007-03-10|title=Brodeur sets goaltending mark in Devils win|date=March 4, 2006|accessdate=2006-12-06|publisher=TSN}}&lt;/ref&gt; After struggling early in the season, his impressive play later on made him a finalist for the Vezina Trophy for the third straight year,&lt;ref name=&quot;Vezina0506&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/news/2006/05/271296.html|title=NHL Announces 2005–06 Trophy finalists|publisher=NHL.com|date=May 4, 2006|accessdate=2007-03-05}}{{dead link|date=January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and helped lead the Devils to a surprising comeback in the last two months of the season that resulted in them winning the Atlantic Division in the final game of the year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Atlantic2006&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msgnetwork.com/content_news.jsp?articleID=v0000msgn20060419T023023461&amp;newsgroup=ap.sportsml.columnist.article&amp;sports=ice-hockey&amp;team=Devils&amp;league=nhl|title=Devils complete comeback to capture Atlantic Division title|publisher=MSG Network|accessdate=2007-03-05|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first round of the playoffs, he beat the Rangers for the first time in his career, leading the Devils to a four-game sweep. But a 4–1 series loss to the Carolina Hurricanes eliminated the Devils in the next round.

[[File:Brodeur in stance.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Brodeur readies himself for action during a game in 2007.]]
In the [[2006–07 NHL season|2006–07 season]], Brodeur made his ninth NHL All-Star Game appearance in [[Dallas, Texas]], won his third Vezina Trophy and rose on several NHL records lists. On December 9, 2006, he posted a 2–0 victory over the Philadelphia Flyers for his 462nd career win, moving him into 2nd place on the all-time list ahead of active goalie [[Ed Belfour]] of the Florida Panthers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.yahoo.com/nhl/news;_ylt=ApEG9C82o9RC5C8bZdGzTzpivLYF?slug=afp-ihockeynhldevils&amp;prov=afp&amp;type=lgns|title=Brodeur vaults into 2nd on all-time win list|publisher=Yahoo! Sports|year=2006|accessdate=2006-12-10}} {{Dead link|date=March 2012|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just a few weeks later, on December 26, Brodeur beat the Pittsburgh Penguins 3–0 to record his 85th career shutout, moving him past Glenn Hall for 3rd place on that all-time list and 1st place among all active goalies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.yahoo.com/nhl/recap;_ylt=AtFCxMTuQK_xMxtSoR30ZsZ7vLYF?gid=2006122611&amp;prov=ap|title=Penguins Devils Recap – Tuesday December 26, 2006|publisher=Yahoo Sports!|year=2006|accessdate=2006-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 1, 2007, Brodeur beat the Philadelphia Flyers 6–5 in overtime to take the all-time lead in overtime (non-shootout) wins with 45, passing childhood idol [[Patrick Roy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kreiser, John. |url=http://www.nhl.com/nhl/app/?service=page&amp;page=NewsPage&amp;articleid=288388|title=Take nothing for granted in the 'final' minute|publisher=nhl.com|date=February 2, 2007|accessdate=2007-02-02}}{{dead link|date=January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Devils first 38 wins of the season were all with Brodeur in net, leading him to set a NHL record for most consecutive wins for a team.&lt;ref name=&quot;38consecutive&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/recap?gameId=270225023|title=Devils goalie Clemmensen gets first win in 11 months|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=2007-04-12|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 3, 2007, Brodeur tied the NHL record for most wins in a single season with 47, set by [[Bernie Parent]] in [[1973–74 NHL season|1973–74]], in a 2–1 shootout victory against the Ottawa Senators.&lt;ref name=&quot;Standings0226&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.yahoo.com/nhl/standings;_ylt=Ah6GJ3htsMPCh5StqCrl7Ih7vLYF|title=2006–07 NHL Standings|publisher=Yahoo! Sports|accessdate=2007-04-04|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later, he broke the record with his 48th win in a 3–2 victory over the Philadelphia Flyers, which helped the Devils clinch their seventh Atlantic Division title and the second seed in the Eastern Conference.

In the Eastern Conference Quarterfinals against the seventh-seeded [[Tampa Bay Lightning]], Brodeur started out shaky and the Devils fell behind two games to one. He would come back strong, however, to finish the series, and helped the team advance in six games while passing [[Grant Fuhr]] for second place in all-time playoff victories. In the second round against the Ottawa Senators, Brodeur could not continue his stellar play and allowed 15 goals in only 5 games en route to a 4–1 series victory for the Senators.

[[File:Averyrule.jpg|right|thumb|Sean Avery attempts to distract Brodeur during game 3 of the first round of the 2008 Stanley Cup Playoffs.]]
In the [[2007–08 NHL season|2007–08 season]], Brodeur became the second goalie in NHL history to reach 500 wins with a victory against the [[Philadelphia Flyers]] on November 17, 2007. The only other goalie to achieve the feat is [[Patrick Roy]]. Brodeur was also named the starting goalie for the Eastern Conference in the [[56th National Hockey League All-Star Game|2007–08 NHL All Star Game]] in [[Atlanta]]. However, he was unable to participate because of a family obligation. [[New York Islanders]] goalie [[Rick DiPietro]] took over as starter of the game, while [[Boston Bruins]] goalie [[Tim Thomas (ice hockey)|Tim Thomas]] took the last spot for goalies.

After losing a bitter series against the rival [[New York Rangers]] in the opening round of the 2008 NHL playoffs, Brodeur refused to shake [[Sean Avery]]'s hand. During game three of the series, in an unusual move, Avery turned to face Brodeur during a 5-on-3 power play, and began waving his hands and stick in front of Brodeur's face in an effort to distract him. The day after this game the NHL announced that it had revised its unsportsmanlike conduct rule, now known as [[Sean Avery#The Sean Avery rule|The Sean Avery Rule]], effectively outlawing such antics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/nhl/app?articleid=360464&amp;page=NewsPage&amp;service=page|title=NHL reacts quickly to Avery's antics, amends unsportsmanlike conduct rule|publisher=NHL.com|accessdate=2008-05-02|year=2008}}{{dead link|date=January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brodeur started wearing a new painted mask design for the [[2008–09 NHL season]] with a stylized &quot;MB30&quot; on the front, replacing the &quot;J&quot; that had been on his mask for his entire NHL career. During a game on November 1, 2008, Brodeur suffered a &quot;bruised elbow&quot; which would later be diagnosed as a torn distal [[biceps]] tendon, the first major injury in his career.  Following surgery on November 6, he would miss 16 weeks of the season before playing his next game on February 26, 2009. Upon returning from the injury, Brodeur registered a 4–0 shutout against the Colorado Avalanche for his 200th career shutout.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Associated Press|url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/recap.htm?id=2008020909|title=Marty's back, as good as ever|publisher=[[NHL.com]]|date=February 26, 2009|accessdate=2009-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three days later, he recorded his 100th career shutout against the Philadelphia Flyers, three short of [[Terry Sawchuk]]'s NHL record.

=== 2009–present ===
[[File:Martin Brodeur vs Islanders in Nov 2011.jpg|thumb|Brodeur playing in November 2011]]
Since 2009, Brodeur has broken and tied a number of career records for goaltenders, including:
* Most career wins, breaking Patrick Roy's record of 551.&lt;ref name&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=413927 | title = Roy glad to be there for Brodeur's big night | publisher = NHL.com | first = Dan | last = Rosen | date = 2009-03-15 | accessdate = 2009-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;552w&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tsn.ca/nhl/story/?id=271603&amp;lid=headline&amp;lpos=topStory_main|title=Brodeur becomes winningest goalie ever with 552nd victory|date=2009-03-17|accessdate=2009-03-17|publisher=The Sports Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Most playoff [[shutout]]s 24.
* Most minutes played, breaking Patrick Roy's record of 60,235 minutes.
* Most games played, surpassing Patrick Roy's record of 1029.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/recap.htm?id=2009020511|title=Brodeur sets another record as Devils beat Senators |accessdate=2009-12-19|last=Morreale |first=Mike G. |date=2009-12-19 |publisher=[[NHL.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Most regular-season shutouts, breaking [[Terry Sawchuk]]'s record of 103.

On December 30, 2009, Brodeur and the Devils shut out the Penguins, 2–0. It was his 105th career shutout, giving him the all-time professional record, surpassing [[George Hainsworth]]'s total of 104 combined in the NHL (94) and [[Western Canada Hockey League]] (10). On April 6, 2010, Brodeur reached his 600th career win by defeating the Thrashers 3–0. This was also his 110th career shutout. 

In the [[2009–10 NHL season]], Brodeur led the NHL in wins (45), shutouts (9), games played (77) and minutes played (4,499). He also won his fifth Jennings Trophy and had the third-best GAA in the league, leading his team to back-to-back division wins that included a 6–0 regular-season sweep of the defending Stanley Cup champion Pittsburgh Penguins. However, the Devils lost in the first round of the playoffs, losing to the 7th-seeded team [[Philadelphia Flyers]] in five games. Brodeur went on to record 23 wins during the [[2010-11 NHL season]], which saw the Devils slump during the first half of the season, only to miss the playoffs narrowly after a hot winning streak during the season's latter half.

The Devils returned to the [[2012 Stanley Cup playoffs|playoffs]] in the [[2011–12 NHL season]], as Brodeur recorded his 14th 30-win season. In Game 1 of the conference quarterfinals against the Panthers, Brodeur became only the second goaltender to record 100 playoff wins in a 3-2 Devils victory.  In Game 4 with a 4-0 victory, Brodeur broke the NHL career playoff shutout record with his 24th, surpassing Patrick Roy, who had 23.

Brodeur was selected as [[Canadian national men's hockey team|Team Canada]]'s back-up goalie to [[Patrick Roy]] for the [[1998 Winter Olympics]] in [[Nagano]], Japan; but did not get to play. Canada failed to win a medal after losing the bronze-medal match to [[Finnish national men's ice hockey team|Finland]], a game in which many people thought Brodeur should have played.&lt;ref name=&quot;NoBronze&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Canadian Press]]|url=http://www.tsn.ca/story/print/?id=133888|title=Backup battle heats up at Canada camp|publisher=TSN.ca|date=August 18, 2005|accessdate=2007-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[2002 Winter Olympic Games/Ice hockey|2002 Olympics]] at [[Salt Lake City]], [[Utah]], Brodeur was initially named the backup behind [[Curtis Joseph]], but following Joseph's losing the tournament opener against [[Swedish national men's ice hockey team|Sweden]], Brodeur was named the starting goaltender the rest of the way, and won gold for Canada. He had the best GAA in the tournament and went undefeated, stopping 31 of 33 shots in the gold-medal victory over [[American national men's hockey team|Team USA]].

Brodeur then led Team Canada to a [[World Cup of Hockey]] championship in 2004, allowing only 5 goals in five games. He led all goalies in GAA and save percentage while going undefeated. He had another impressive performance for the team at the world hockey championships in the following year. After this, ''The Sports Forecaster 2005–06'' said the following:&lt;ref name=&quot;MainBio&quot;/&gt;

{{Cquote|Brodeur is arguably the top goaltender in the world. Fresh off a World Cup win in 2004 and another strong performance at the 2005 IIHF World hockey championships. He's the game's best puck-handling goaltender, though the NHL's new rules changes may somewhat alter that effectiveness.}}

Brodeur was selected as Team Canada's starter in the [[2006 Winter Olympics]] in [[Turin]], Italy. He started in 4 of 6 games, but Canada failed to win a medal after losing to [[Russian national men's ice hockey team|Russia]] in the quarterfinals.

He was one of the three goalies on Team Canada for the [[2010 Winter Olympics]] in [[Vancouver]], Canada. He registered a shootout win against [[Switzerland men's national ice hockey team|Switzerland]] and a loss to the [[United States men's national ice hockey team|United States]]. After the loss to the US, he was benched for the remainder of the 2010 Games in favor of [[Roberto Luongo]].

Brodeur has played for [[Canadian national men's hockey team|Canada]] in:
* [[1995 Men's World Ice Hockey Championships|1995 IIHF World Championships]] ('''bronze''')
* [[1996 World Cup of Hockey]] ('''silver''')
* [[Ice hockey at the 1998 Winter Olympics|1998 Winter Olympic Games]] (4th place)

== Personal life ==
Brodeur married Melanie Dubois (a native of [[Saint-Liboire, Quebec]], Canada) in August 1995 and has four children:&lt;ref name=&quot;Children&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hhof.com/html/exSCJ_33.shtml|title=Stanley Cup Journals:33|publisher=hhof.com|accessdate=2007-02-28|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anthony, born in 1995; twin sons, William and Jeremy, born in 1996; and Annabelle Antoinette, born in 2002. Melanie filed for divorce during the 2003 playoffs amid reports that Martin was having an affair with Genevieve Nault, the wife of Melanie's brother.&lt;ref name=&quot;divorce&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/playoffs2003/story?id=1557270|title=Brodeur's wife files for divorce|publisher=ESPN.com|year=2003|accessdate=2007-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incident added some fuel to the fire for hecklers during the playoffs.&lt;ref name=&quot;heckling&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.sportingnews.com/nhl/articles/20030510/472987.html|title=Canada's capital primed for East finals|publisher=sportingnews.com|year=2003|accessdate=2007-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reports proved to be true, as Martin and Genevieve married in June 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.yahoo.com/nhl/blog/puck_daddy/post/Romantic-or-insane-Marty-Brodeur-gets-married-a?urn=nhl,91034|title=Romantic or insane: Marty Brodeur gets married again|date=2008-06-30|accessdate=2008-06-30|author=Puck Daddy|publisher=Yahoo!

Brodeur is regarded as a brilliant chef and an engaging [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/raconteur+ raconteur] in his spare time.&lt;ref name=&quot;HHOFjournal&quot;/&gt; He has hosted a [[street hockey]] tournament in his hometown of St. Leonard, [[Quebec]], for each of the Devils' [[Stanley Cup]] championships, where he plays his childhood position of [[forward (hockey)|forward]]. His oldest brother, Denis Jr., is a photographer like their father, and his other older brother, Claude, was a pitcher in the [[Montreal Expos]]' farm system. He has two sisters, Line and Sylvie.

In 2005, Brodeur began co-authoring his autobiography, ''Brodeur: Beyond the Crease'', with long-time [[Toronto Star]] columnist and [[ESPN]] contributor [[Damien Cox]], which was released in October 2006. Some of the things Brodeur talks about in the book are player salaries and contracts, NHL marketing, [[Lou Lamoriello]], and the Devils' new arena in Newark, the [[Prudential Center]]. Brodeur also includes his views on the &quot;new NHL&quot; after the lockout, and how it affects his career.&lt;ref name=&quot;biography&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amazon.com/dp/0470838515/|title=Brodeur: Beyond the Crease (Hardcover)|accessdate=2006-12-06|publisher=Amazon.com|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book's photographs were shot by Martin's father, [[Denis Brodeur|Denis]].

Brodeur co-owns a business called &quot;La Pizzeria Etc.&quot; with former teammate [[Sheldon Souray]]. The idea came about after Souray was traded to play in [[Montreal]], the city in which the business now operates.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pizzeria&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.martinbrodeur30.com/about_1757_en/|title=About Martin – La Pizzeria Etc.|accessdate=2009-02-26|publisher=MartinBrodeur30.com|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brodeur is a co-owner of the Spa d'Howard, also based in his native [[Quebec]].

=== Milestones ===
[[Image:Brodeur30.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Brodeur, in net during the 2005–06 Stanley Cup Playoffs, is regarded by many as the greatest goaltender of all-time.]]
Brodeur is the youngest goaltender in NHL history to reach the 300, 400 and 500 regular season win plateaus, and is the only goaltender to reach 600 regular season wins (Brodeur currently stands at 656 wins). His 300th victory came on December 15, 2001, with a 39-save shutout against the Ottawa Senators at the [[Scotiabank Place|Corel Centre]]. His 400th victory was on March 23, 2004, at the [[Office Depot Center]] in [[Sunrise, Florida]], as the Devils defeated the hometown Florida Panthers. Brodeur stopped twenty-one shots, and needed to work overtime to get the win. With the victory he also became the first goaltender to win 400 games playing every game for the same team.&lt;ref name=&quot;MainBio&quot;/&gt;  Brodeur reached the 500 win plateau on November 17, 2007, against the Philadelphia Flyers, with a 6 to 2 win. On March 15, 2008, he earned his seventh 40-win season of his career, the most of any goaltender in NHL history. On April 6, 2010, Brodeur reached 600 wins with a 3-0 shutout over the Atlanta Thrashers. On April 5, 2012, in a 2-1 win over the Detroit Red Wings, he reached his 14th 30-win season, again the most of any NHL goaltender.

On March 14, 2009, Brodeur recorded his 551st career win against the Montreal Canadiens at the [[Bell Centre]] to tie Patrick Roy for the most in NHL history in his hometown and where Roy played the first half of his career. To acknowledge their fellow countryman, the crowd of Canadiens fans chanted Brodeur's name at the end of the game and gave him a standing ovation. Brodeur's father Denis was at the game taking pictures.&lt;ref name=&quot;551wins&quot;&gt;{{cite web

 | author = Farrell, Sean
 | accessdate = 2009-03-16
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three nights later, in a 3–2 win over the [[Chicago Blackhawks]], Brodeur became the all-time NHL leader in regular season wins by a goaltender with 552.

On November 27, 2009, Brodeur broke the record for most minutes ever played by an NHL goaltender, breaking Patrick Roy's record of 60,235.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/28/sports/hockey/28nhl.html |title=Martin Brodeur Sets Another Record in the Devils’ Victory|publisher=www.nytimes.com |accessdate=2009-11-28 | date=2009-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 7, 2009, Brodeur tied Sawchuk's record for regular season shutouts at 103 in a 3–0 victory over the Buffalo Sabres. Twelve nights later, Brodeur broke the record set by [[Patrick Roy]] for games played by a goaltender in the National Hockey League (1,030 games). Two weeks after tying Sawchuk's shutout record, Brodeur recorded his 104th regular season shutout, breaking Sawchuk's record with a 4–0 victory over the Pittsburgh Penguins, stopping all 35 shots. On December 30, 2009, Brodeur and the Devils again shut out the Pittsburgh Penguins, 2–0. It was his 105th career shutout, giving him the all-time professional record, surpassing George Hainsworth's total of 104 combined in the NHL (94) and Western Canada Hockey League (10).

On April, 19, 2012, Brodeur passed Patrick Roy's record for most career playoff shutouts at 24 in a 4-0 victory over the Florida Panthers.

=== Records ===
In over 16 seasons with the New Jersey Devils, Brodeur owns several notable NHL records as listed below. Most of these records Brodeur has broken were held by goalies who have played at least a full 20 year career.
