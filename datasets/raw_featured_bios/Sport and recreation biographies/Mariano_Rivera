'''Mariano Rivera''' (born November 29, 1969) is a [[Panama]]nian right-handed [[baseball]] [[pitcher]] who has played 18 seasons in [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) for the [[New York Yankees]]. Nicknamed &quot;Mo&quot;,&lt;ref name=mo/&gt; Rivera has served as a [[relief pitcher]] for most of his career, and since 1997, he has been the Yankees' [[closer (baseball)|closer]]. A 12-time [[MLB All-Star Game|All-Star]] and five-time [[World Series]] champion, he is MLB's all-time leader in [[Save (baseball)|saves]] (607) and [[games finished]] (890). His accolades include five [[American League]] (AL) [[Rolaids Relief Man Award]]s, the [[1999 World Series|1999]] [[World Series Most Valuable Player Award|World Series Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award]], and the [[2003 American League Championship Series|2003]] [[League Championship Series MVP Award|AL Championship Series MVP Award]].

Rivera was signed by the Yankees organization in 1990 as an amateur free agent in Panama, and he debuted in the major leagues in 1995. Initially a [[starting pitcher]], he struggled in the role and was consequently converted to a relief pitcher. After a breakthrough season in 1996 as a [[setup man]], he became the Yankees' closer in 1997. In the following years, he established himself as one of baseball's top relievers, [[List of Major League Baseball saves champions|leading the major leagues in saves]] in 1999, 2001, and 2004. Rivera's presence in the late [[Inning#Baseball|innings]] of games to record the final [[Out (baseball)|outs]] has contributed to the Yankees' success in the late-1990s and 2000s, particularly in the [[Major League Baseball postseason|postseason]] where he has set numerous records, including lowest [[earned run average]] (ERA) (0.70) and most saves (42). His pitching repertoire consists primarily of one [[Pitch (baseball)|pitch]]—a sharp-breaking, mid-90s mile per hour (mph) [[cut fastball]] that has been called an all-time great pitch.&lt;ref name=usa&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/soac/2006-10-09-rivera_x.htm|title=Yanks' Rivera continues to learn|author=Antonen, Mel|work=[[USA Today]]|date=2006-10-09|accessdate=2006-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Rivera is regarded by baseball experts as one of the most dominant relievers in major league history.&lt;ref name=humble&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/2010-03-13/sports/27058930_1_puerto-caimito-cardboard-cousin|title=Modern Yankee Heroes: From humble beginnings, Mariano Rivera becomes the greatest closer in MLB history|author=Red, Christian|work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]|date=2010-03-13|accessdate=2011-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pitching with a longevity and consistency uncommon to the closer role, he has saved at least 25&amp;nbsp;games in 15&amp;nbsp;consecutive seasons and has posted an ERA under 2.00 in 11&amp;nbsp;seasons, both of which are records. His career 2.22&amp;nbsp;ERA and 1.00&amp;nbsp;[[Walks plus hits per inning pitched|WHIP]] are the lowest marks in baseball's [[live-ball era]]. On the field, he is well known for his reserved demeanor and composure that contrast with the effusiveness of many of his peers. Off the field, he has been involved in charitable causes and the Christian community through the Mariano Rivera Foundation. Sportswriters anticipate Rivera will be inducted into the [[Baseball Hall of Fame]] upon retirement.&lt;ref name=verducci/&gt;

==Early life==
Mariano Rivera was born in [[Panama City]], [[Panama]], on November&amp;nbsp;29, 1969, to Mariano, Sr. and Delia Rivera.&lt;ref name=glove/&gt; His father worked as a ship captain in the [[fishing]] industry.&lt;ref name=s4&gt;Sherman (2006), pp. 4–5&lt;/ref&gt; Rivera has one older sister, Delia, and two younger brothers, Alvaro and Giraldo.&lt;ref&gt;Levin (2008), p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; He grew up in the Panamanian [[fishing village]] of [[Puerto Caimito]]—a town he described as &quot;poor&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Coming Home|series=E:60|serieslink=E:60|network=[[ESPN]]|credits=Reported by [[Tom Rinaldi]]|airdate=2010-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;—frequently playing [[soccer]] with his friends. For their [[baseball]] games, they substituted milk cartons for [[baseball glove|gloves]] and tree branches for [[baseball bat|bats]],&lt;ref name=usa/&gt; and they fashioned balls by taping wads of shredded fishing nets and beat-up [[baseball (ball)|baseballs]] with [[electrical tape]].&lt;ref name=early&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1009676/1/index.htm|title=Strikeouts by the Boatload|journal=[[Sports Illustrated]]|author=Bamberger, Michael|date=1997-03-24|volume=86|issue=12|accessdate=2011-09-07|pages=50–53}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rivera used this makeshift equipment until his father bought him his first leather glove when he was 12 years old.&lt;ref name=glove&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/1998-08-31/sports/18084874_1_puerto-caimito-mariano-rivera-week-at-yankee-stadium|title=Where Rivera goes for relief takes hat off to Panama|work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]|author=Hermoso, Rafael|date=1998-08-31|accessdate=2011-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Rivera thought of baseball as a hobby and did not seriously consider playing professionally.&lt;ref name=early/&gt; Instead, his aspirations were to become a professional soccer player, but a series of ankle injuries while playing at Pedro Pablo Sanchez High School dashed his hopes.&lt;ref name=usa/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Levin (2008), p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; After graduating from high school at age 16, he worked six-day weeks on a commercial boat captained by his father, catching [[shrimp]] and [[sardine]]s.&lt;ref name=s4/&gt;&lt;ref name=early/&gt; The job was &quot;way too tough&quot; for Rivera, who was more interested in becoming a [[mechanic]].&lt;ref name=usa/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Levin (2008), p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; As a 19-year-old, he had to abandon a capsizing {{convert|120|ST|t|adj=on}} commercial boat, all but convincing him to give up fishing as a career.&lt;ref name=usa/&gt;

In 1988, Rivera began to play [[shortstop]] for Panamá Oeste, a local amateur baseball team.&lt;ref name=s4/&gt; Herb Raybourn, the [[New York Yankees]]' director of [[Latin America]]n operations, saw athleticism in Rivera but did not project him to be a [[Major League Baseball|major league]] shortstop.&lt;ref name=scout&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/06/sports/baseball/06scout.html|title=Scout saw effortless ability in young Mariano Rivera|work=[[The New York Times]]|author=Curry, Jack|authorlink=Jack Curry|date=2009-07-05|accessdate=2009-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; A year later, Panamá Oeste's [[pitcher]] performed so poorly that Rivera volunteered to pitch.&lt;ref name=s4/&gt; He excelled at the position, prompting his teammates to contact Yankees [[scout (sports)|scout]] Chico Heron. Two weeks later, Rivera was invited to a Yankees tryout camp in Panama City where Raybourn was visiting.&lt;ref name=s4/&gt; Raybourn was surprised to find Rivera pitching at the camp, since scouts passed on him as a shortstop a year prior.&lt;ref name=scout/&gt; Although Rivera had no formal pitching training and threw only {{convert|85|-|87|mph|0|abbr=off}}, Raybourn was impressed by Rivera's athleticism and smooth, effortless pitching motion.&lt;ref name=s4/&gt; Viewing Rivera as a raw talent, Raybourn signed the [[Amateur sports|amateur]] [[free agent]] to a contract with a [[United States dollar|US$]]3,000 [[signing bonus]] (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|3000|1990|r=0}}}} today) on February&amp;nbsp;17, 1990.&lt;ref name=usa/&gt;&lt;ref name=s4/&gt;

==Professional baseball career==
===Minor leagues (1990–1995)===
After signing his contract in Panama with the Yankees organization, Rivera—who spoke no [[English language|English]] at the time—left home for the first time. He flew to the United States to begin pitching for the [[Minor league baseball#Rookie|Rookie]] level [[Gulf Coast League Yankees|Yankees]] of the [[Gulf Coast League]] (GCL), a [[Minor league baseball|minor league]] affiliate of the New York Yankees.&lt;ref name=early/&gt; At that point in his career, he was considered by scouts to be a &quot;fringe prospect&quot; at best,&lt;ref&gt;Sherman (2006), p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; but he made progress with a strong 1990 season for the GCL Yankees. Pitching mostly in [[relief pitcher|relief]], he allowed one [[earned run]] in 52&amp;nbsp;[[innings pitched]]—a 0.17&amp;nbsp;[[earned run average]] (ERA)—and he allowed only 24&amp;nbsp;baserunners.&lt;ref name=minors&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/player.cgi?id=rivera002mar|title=Mariano Rivera Minor League Statistics &amp; History|work=[[Baseball-Reference.com]]|publisher=Sports Reference LLC|accessdate=2011-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; His seven-inning [[no-hitter]] on the season's final day &quot;put him on the map with the organization&quot;, according to [[Manager (baseball)|manager]] [[Glenn Sherlock]].&lt;ref&gt;Sherman (2006), pp. 68–69&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, he ascended to the [[Minor league baseball#Class A|Class A]] level [[Greensboro Grasshoppers|Greensboro Hornets]] of the [[South Atlantic League]], where he [[Starting pitcher|started]] 15 of the 29 games he pitched in. Despite a 4–9&amp;nbsp;[[Win-loss record (pitching)|win–loss record]], he recorded a 2.75&amp;nbsp;ERA in {{frac|114|2|3}}&amp;nbsp;innings pitched and [[strikeout|struck out]] 123&amp;nbsp;[[batting (baseball)|batters]] while [[base on balls|walking]] 36&amp;nbsp;batters.&lt;ref name=minors/&gt; New York Yankees manager [[Buck Showalter]] took notice of Rivera's strong [[strikeout-to-walk ratio]], calling it &quot;impressive in any league&quot; and stating, &quot;This guy is going to make it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Sherman (2006), pp. 13–14&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, Rivera was promoted to the [[Minor league baseball#Class A-Advanced|Class A-Advanced]] [[Fort Lauderdale Yankees]] of the [[Florida State League]] (FSL). He started 10&amp;nbsp;games in Fort Lauderdale, compiling a 5–3&amp;nbsp;win–loss record and a 2.28&amp;nbsp;ERA.&lt;ref name=minors/&gt; He attempted to improve the movement on his [[slider]] by snapping his wrist in his pitching motion, but he inadvertently caused damage to the [[Ulnar collateral ligament (elbow)|ulnar collateral ligament]] in his throwing elbow.&lt;ref name=s17&gt;Sherman (2006), pp. 17–18&lt;/ref&gt; Elbow surgery took place in August 1992 to repair the damage, ending his season and interrupting his minor league career.&lt;ref name=s17/&gt; It was expected that he would require [[Tommy John surgery]], but during the procedure, Rivera's doctors determined that he did not need ligament replacement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/2009-06-30/sports/17926614_1_yankees-gm-gene-michael-tommy-john-surgery|title=At start of Mariano Rivera's Yankee career, Gene Michael almost traded him|author=Harper, John|work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]|date=2009-06-29|accessdate=2011-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; His rehabilitation coincided with the [[1992 Major League Baseball expansion draft|1992 Major League Baseball (MLB) expansion draft]] to fill the rosters for the [[Florida Marlins]] and [[Colorado Rockies]] [[expansion team]]s. Rivera was left unprotected by the Yankees but was not drafted.&lt;ref name=usa/&gt; He successfully rehabilitated his arm in early 1993 and resumed pitching that year. He first joined the Rookie level Yankees to make two abbreviated starts, before returning to the Class A level Hornets to start ten more games.&lt;ref name=minors/&gt; Witnessing him rehabilitate, the Hornets' [[official scorer]] Ogi Overman was not optimistic about Rivera's future, saying, &quot;I thought [he] was on a one-way trip to nowhere.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/new-york/story/_/id/6971651/new-york-yankees-mariano-rivera-poise-grace-pressure-unrivaled|title=From obscurity to history, only one Mo|work=[[ESPN.com]]|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures|author=O'Connor, Ian|authorlink=Ian O'Connor|date=2011-09-19|accessdate=2011-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, he ascended from the Class A-Advanced level [[Tampa Yankees]] of the FSL to the [[Double-A]] level [[Albany-Colonie Yankees]] of the [[Eastern League (baseball)|Eastern League]], and then to the [[Triple-A (baseball)|Triple-A]] level [[Columbus Clippers]] of the [[International League]]. For the year, Rivera finished with a 10–2&amp;nbsp;record in 22&amp;nbsp;starts, although he struggled for Columbus, recording a 5.81&amp;nbsp;ERA in six starts.&lt;ref name=minors/&gt; He began the 1995 season with Columbus ranked by ''[[Baseball America]]'' as the ninth-best prospect in the Yankees organization.&lt;ref name=s18&gt;Sherman (2006), pp. 18–19&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, his pitching repertoire primarily consisted of [[fastball]]s, although he threw a slider and [[changeup]] as secondary pitches.&lt;ref name=&quot;s17&quot;/&gt;

===Major leagues (1995–present)===
====1995–1997====
After opening the 1995 season with Columbus, Rivera made his major league debut against the [[California Angels]] on May 23, 1995, as a starting pitcher. Replacing an injured [[Jimmy Key]], Rivera allowed five earned runs in {{frac|3|1|3}}&amp;nbsp;innings pitched in a 10–0 loss.&lt;ref name=mlb08&gt;&quot;Bio – 2008 Career Highlights&quot;, ''MLB.com''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=eck/&gt; He experienced mixed success as a major league starter and as a result, he split time between the Yankees and their Columbus minor league affiliate.&lt;ref name=s18/&gt; As a 25-year-old rookie just three years removed from major arm surgery, Rivera's role on the team was not guaranteed. Management considered [[Trade (sports)|trading]] him to the [[Detroit Tigers]] for starter [[David Wells]], but Yankees [[general manager]] [[Gene Michael]] quickly called off negotiations when he learned that Rivera's pitches reached {{convert|95|–|96|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} in one of his starts, {{convert|6|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} faster than his previous average velocity.

In 1996, Rivera served primarily as a [[setup pitcher]] for [[closer (baseball)|closer]] [[John Wetteland]], typically pitching in the seventh and eighth [[inning#Baseball|innings]] of games before Wetteland pitched in the ninth.&lt;ref name=usa/&gt; Their effectiveness gave the Yankees a 70–3&amp;nbsp;win–loss record that season when leading after six innings.&lt;ref&gt;Zimniuch (2010), pp. 219, 221&lt;/ref&gt; Over twelve games between April 19 and May 21, Rivera pitched 26&amp;nbsp;consecutive scoreless innings, including 15&amp;nbsp;consecutive hitless innings.&lt;ref name=mlb96/&gt; In the regular season, Rivera finished with a 2.09&amp;nbsp;ERA in {{frac|107|2|3}}&amp;nbsp;innings pitched and set a Yankees single-season record for strikeouts by a reliever (130).&lt;ref name=mlb96/&gt; In the [[postseason]], he allowed just one earned run in {{frac|14|1|3}}&amp;nbsp;innings pitched,&lt;ref name=ps-stats/&gt; helping the Yankees advance to and win the [[1996 World Series]] against the [[Atlanta Braves]].

Rivera impressed Yankees management enough that they chose not to re-sign Wetteland, who became a free agent in the offseason.

Rivera is well respected among his peers for his professionalism. Fellow closer [[Joe Nathan]] said, &quot;I look up to how he's handled himself on and off the field...

Many of Rivera's colleagues credit him with popularizing the cutter among major league pitchers. Fellow closer [[Jason Isringhausen]], who adopted the pitch later in his career, said, &quot;I think he's been an influence on everybody that throws it. Everybody saw what [Rivera] could do, basically with one pitch. Nobody could throw it like he did, but now, you talk about the evolution of the cutter—just ask hitters about it and they tell you everybody's throwing one. And they hate it.&quot; [[Al Leiter]], whose signature pitch was a cutter, echoed Isringhausen's sentiments: &quot;Now, everybody throws it and Mo has had a huge influence on that. Pitchers watched him and marveled at what he did with one pitch.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/2011-09-20/sports/30206165_1_cutter-divine-intervention-mariano-rivera|title=Mariano Rivera says it was divine intervention, but for hitters, his cutter has been pure Hell|work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]|author=Harper, John|date=2011-09-20|accessdate=2011-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rivera is a devout Christian. During his childhood, neither he nor his family attended church, but after a [[Born again (Christianity)|born-again]] experience in his early 20s, Rivera—and subsequently his parents—became religious.&lt;ref name=king/&gt; He maintains that God has a reason for everything that happens. For example, he found his failure in Game 7 of the [[2001 World Series]] easier to deal with when he learned of the consequences it had on a teammate. Had the Yankees won the series, teammate [[Enrique Wilson]] would have remained in New York for a few extra days for the championship parade and would have departed for his native [[Dominican Republic]] on [[American Airlines Flight 587]], which crashed shortly after takeoff, killing all 260 people aboard. Rivera told Wilson, &quot;I am glad we lost the World Series, because it means that I still have a friend.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Excerpt from the &quot;Epilogue&quot; for ''The Last Night of the Yankee Dynasty: The Game, the Team, and the Cost of Greatness''|author=Olney, Buster|url=http://proxy.espn.go.com/mlb/columns/story?columnist=olney_buster&amp;id=2051491|work=[[ESPN.com]]|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures|date=2005-05-02|accessdate=2009-05-12|authorlink=Buster Olney}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rivera's pitching glove is inscribed &quot;Phil. 4:13&quot;, in reference to the [[Bible]] verse [[Epistle to the Philippians|Philippians]] 4:13 (&quot;I can do all things through Christ, who strengthens me&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2005/writers/dave_hollander/05/27/mariano.rivera/index.html|title=Keeping the faith|work=[[SI.com]]|publisher=[[Time, Inc.]]|author=Hollander, Dave|date=2005-05-27|accessdate=2011-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rivera is involved with [[philanthropy|philanthropic]] contributions in his native Panama, which include building an elementary school and a church, providing Christmas gifts to children, and developing a program that provides computer access and adult mentors to youths.&lt;ref name=mlb08/&gt; The Mariano Rivera Foundation annually distributes more than $500,000 to underprivileged children in the US and Panama through church-based institutions. Rivera intends to dedicate himself to philanthropy after retiring from baseball.&lt;ref name=king/&gt; In 2012, The Giving Back Fund estimated that he donated $627,500 to charity in 2010, ranking him as the 25th-most generous celebrity on a list that the fund compiled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forbes.com/sites/andersonantunes/2012/01/11/the-30-most-generous-celebrities/3/|title=The 30 Most Generous Celebrities|work=[[Forbes]]|first=Anderson|last=Antunes|date=2012-01-11|accessdate=2012-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
