'''Laurence''' (sometimes '''Lawrence'''&lt;ref name=World85&gt;Blair ''World of Bede'' p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; or '''Laurentius''';&lt;ref name=ASE/&gt; died {{Nowrap|2 February}} {{Nowrap|619 AD}}) was the second [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] from about 604 to 619. He was a member of the [[Gregorian mission]] sent from Italy to England to [[Christianization|Christianize]] the [[Anglo-Saxons]] from their native [[Anglo-Saxon paganism]], although the date of his arrival is disputed. He was [[Consecration|consecrated]] archbishop by his predecessor, [[Augustine of Canterbury]], during Augustine's lifetime, in order to ensure continuity in the office. While archbishop, he attempted unsuccessfully to resolve differences with the native British bishops by corresponding with them about points of dispute. Laurence faced a crisis following the death of King [[Æthelberht of Kent]], when the king's successor abandoned Christianity; he eventually reconverted. Laurence was [[Canonization#Historical development of the process|revered]] as a saint after his death in 619.

==Early life==
Laurence was part of the Gregorian mission originally dispatched from Rome in 595 to convert the Anglo-Saxons from their native paganism to Christianity; he landed at [[Thanet]], [[Kent]], with Augustine in 597,&lt;ref name=DNB&gt;Brooks &quot;[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/16166 Laurence (d. 619)]&quot; ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ASE106&gt;Stenton ''Anglo-Saxon England'' p. 106&lt;/ref&gt; or, as some sources state, first arrived in 601 and was not a part of the first group of missionaries.&lt;ref name=Hindley36&gt;Hindley ''Brief History of the Anglo-Saxons'' p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Brooks9&gt;Brooks ''Early History of the Church of Canterbury'' pp. 9–13&lt;/ref&gt; He had been a monk in Rome before his travels to England,&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; but nothing else is known of his history or background.&lt;ref name=World59&gt;Blair ''World of Bede'' p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; The medieval chronicler [[Bede]] says that  Augustine sent Laurence back to Pope [[Pope Gregory I|Gregory I]] to report on the success of converting King Æthelberht of Kent and to carry a letter with questions for the pope. Accompanied by [[Peter of Canterbury]], another missionary, he set off some time after July 598, and had returned by June 601.&lt;ref name=Blair63&gt;Blair ''World of Bede'' p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; He brought back with him Gregory's replies to Augustine's questions, a document commonly known as the ''[[Libellus responsionum]]'', that Bede incorporated in his ''[[Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum]]''.&lt;ref name=ASE&gt;Lapidge &quot;Laurentius&quot; ''Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Anglo-Saxon England''&lt;/ref&gt; Laurence is probably the Laurence referred to in the letter from Gregory to [[Bertha of Kent|Bertha]], queen of Kent. In that letter, Gregory praises Bertha for her part in the conversion of her husband, details of which Gregory says he received from Laurence the priest.&lt;ref name=Blair60&gt;Blair ''World of Bede'' p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; It is known that Laurence returned to England with [[Mellitus]] and others of the second group of missionaries  in the summer of 601, but there is no record of Peter being with them.&lt;ref name=Blair66&gt;Blair ''World of Bede'' p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archbishop==
Laurence succeeded Augustine to the [[Archbishop of Canterbury|see of Canterbury]] in about 604, and ruled until his death on 2&amp;nbsp;February 619.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;&lt;ref name=Handbook213&gt;Fryde, et al. ''Handbook of British Chronology'' p. 213&lt;/ref&gt; To secure the succession, Augustine had consecrated Laurence before he died, even though that was prohibited by [[canon law]].&lt;ref name=ASE/&gt; Augustine was afraid though that if someone did not step into the office immediately, it would damage the missionary efforts in Britain.&lt;ref name=Brooks9/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hindley43&gt;Hindley ''A Brief History of the Anglo-Saxons'' p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; However, Laurence never received a [[pallium]] from Rome, so he may have been considered uncanonical by the papacy.&lt;ref name=ASE112&gt;Stenton ''Anglo-Saxon England'' pp. 112–113&lt;/ref&gt; Bede makes a point of comparing Augustine's action in consecrating Laurence to Saint Peter's action of consecrating [[Pope Clement I|Clement]] as [[Bishop of Rome]] during Peter's lifetime, which the theologian [[J. Robert Wright]] believes may be Bede's way of criticising the practices of the church in his day.&lt;ref name=Wright47&gt;Wright ''Companion to Bede'' p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;

In 610 Laurence received letters from Pope [[Pope Boniface IV|Boniface IV]], addressed to him as archbishop and Augustine's successor.&lt;ref name=Blair80&gt;Blair ''World of Bede'' p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; The correspondence was in response to Laurence having sent Mellitus to Rome earlier in 610, to solicit advice from the papacy on matters concerning the English Church. While in Rome Mellitus attended a [[synod]], and brought the synodical decrees back with him to Laurence.&lt;ref name=Blair86&gt;Blair ''World of Bede'' pp. 86–87&lt;/ref&gt;

In 613 Laurence consecrated the monastery church built by Augustine in Canterbury, and dedicated it to saints [[Saint Peter|Peter]] and [[Saint Paul|Paul]]; it was later re-consecrated as [[St Augustine's Abbey]], Canterbury.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; Laurence also wrote to the bishops in the lands held by the [[Scoti|Scots]] and by the [[Britons (historical)|Britons]], urging them to hold [[Easter]] on the day that the Roman church celebrated it, instead of their traditional date, part of the [[Easter controversy#Third_phase|Easter controversy]].&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; The letter is also preserved in Bede's history.&lt;ref name=Bede105&gt;Bede ''History of the English Church and People'' pp. 105–107&lt;/ref&gt; Laurence in 609 stated that [[Dagan (bishop)|Dagan]], a [[Celtic Christianity|native]] bishop, would not eat with Laurence or share a roof with the archbishop, due to the differences between the two Churches.&lt;ref name=MonksCiv261&gt;Décarreaux ''Monks and Civilization'' p. 261&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pagan reaction==

He is flanked by two colonnades, which are filled with small scenes. Over the central figure is an arch with surmounts a winged bull.]]
Æthelberht died in 616, during Laurence's tenure; his son [[Eadbald of Kent|Eadbald]] abandoned Christianity in favour of Anglo-Saxon paganism, forcing  many of the Gregorian missionaries to flee the pagan backlash that followed Æthelberht's death.&lt;ref name=Hindley43/&gt; Among them in [[Gaul]] were Mellitus, who was [[Bishop of London]], and [[Justus]], who was [[Bishop of Rochester]].&lt;ref name=Kirby30&gt;Kirby ''Earliest English Kings'' pp. 30–33&lt;/ref&gt; Remaining in Britain, Laurence succeeded in reconverting Eadbald to Christianity.&lt;ref name=Hindley43/&gt; Bede relates the story that Laurence had been prepared to give up when he was visited by St Peter in a dream or vision. St Peter chastised Laurence and whipped him, and the marks of the whipping remained after the vision or dream ended. Laurence then displayed them to Eadbald, and the king was converted on the spot.&lt;ref name=Brooks64&gt;Brooks ''Early History of the Church of Canterbury'' pp. 64–66&lt;/ref&gt; Bede, however, hints that it was the death of some of the leaders of the pagan party in battle that really persuaded Laurence to stay.&lt;ref name=Blair86/&gt; According to Benedicta Ward, a historian of Christianity, Bede uses the story of the whipping as an example of how suffering was a reminder of Christ's suffering for humans, and how that example could lead to conversion.&lt;ref name=Ward120&gt;Ward ''Venerable Bede'' pp. 120–121&lt;/ref&gt; Wright argues that another point Bede is making is that it is because of the intercession of St Peter himself that the mission continued.&lt;ref name=Wright49&gt;Wright ''Companion to Bede'' pp. 48–50&lt;/ref&gt; David Farmer, in the ''[[Oxford Dictionary of Saints]]'', suggests that the whipping story may been a blending of the ''[[Quo vadis|Quo Vadis]]'' story with some information given by [[Jerome]] in a letter.&lt;ref name=Farmer313/&gt;

Modern historians have seen political overtones in the pagan reaction. The historian D. P. Kirby sees Eadbald's actions as a repudiation of his father's pro-[[Franks|Frankish]] policies.&lt;ref name=Kirby30/&gt; [[Alcuin]], a later medieval writer, wrote that Laurence was &quot;censured by apostolic authority&quot;.&lt;ref name=QKirby31&gt;Quoted in Kirby ''Earliest English Kings'' p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; This may have been a letter from Pope [[Pope Adeodatus I|Adeodatus&amp;nbsp;I]], commanding Laurence to stay in Kent. Kirby goes on to argue that it was Justus, not Laurence, who converted Eadbald, and this while Justus was archbishop, sometime around 624.&lt;ref name=Kirby30/&gt; Not all historians agree with this argument, however. Nicholas Brooks states that the king was converted during Laurence's archiepiscopate, within a year of him succeeding his father.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; The historian [[Barbara Yorke]] argues that there were two co-rulers of Kent after Æthelberht's death, Eadbald and a Æthelwald, and that Eadbald was converted by Laurence while Æthelwald was converted by Justus after his return to Rochester.&lt;ref name=Yorke32&gt;Yorke ''Kings and Kingdoms'' p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; Another factor in the pagan reaction was Laurence's objection to Eadbald's marriage to his father's widow, something that Christians considered to be unlawful.&lt;ref name=Yorke123&gt;Yorke ''Conversion'' p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;

All efforts to extend the church beyond Kent encountered difficulties due to the attitude of King [[Rædwald of East Anglia]], who had become the leading king in the south after Æthelberht's death.&lt;ref name=ASE127&gt;Stenton ''Anglo-Saxon England'' p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; Rædwald was converted before the death of Æthelberht, perhaps at the urging of Æthelberht, but his kingdom was not, and Rædwald seems to have converted only to the extent of placing a Christian altar in his pagan temple.&lt;ref name=ASE112a&gt;Stenton ''Anglo-Saxon England'' p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; It proved impossible for Mellitus to return to London as bishop, although Justus did resume his duties at Rochester.&lt;ref name=Kirby30/&gt;

==Death and legacy==

Laurence died on 2&amp;nbsp;February 619, and was buried in the abbey of St Peter and Paul in Canterbury, later renamed St Augustine's; his [[relics]], or remains, were moved, or [[Translation (relics)|translated]], to the new church of St Augustine's in 1091.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; His [[shrine]] was in the axial chapel of the abbey church, flanking the shrine of Augustine, his predecessor.&lt;ref name=Shrines67&gt;Nilson ''Cathedral Shrines'' p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; Laurence came to be regarded as a saint, and was given the [[Calendar of saints|feast day]] of 3&amp;nbsp;February.&lt;ref name=Walsh357&gt;Walsh ''A New Dictionary of Saints'' p. 357&lt;/ref&gt; The ninth century [[Stowe Missal]] commemorates his feast day, along with Mellitus and Justus.&lt;ref name=ODS366&gt;Farmer ''Oxford Dictionary of Saints'' p. 366&lt;/ref&gt; A ''[[Haigiography|Vita]]'' (or ''Life'') was written about the time of his translation, by [[Goscelin]], but it is mainly based on information in Bede.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; His tomb was opened in 1915. Besides his feast day, the date of his translation, 13&amp;nbsp;September, was also celebrated after his death.&lt;ref name=Farmer313&gt;Farmer ''Oxford Dictionary of Saints'' pp. 313–314&lt;/ref&gt; Laurence's tenure as archbishop is mainly remembered for his failure to secure a settlement with the Celtic church, and for his reconversion of Eadbald following Æthelbert's death.&lt;ref name=ASE112/&gt; He was succeeded as archbishop by Mellitus, the Bishop of London.&lt;ref name=Handbook213/&gt;
