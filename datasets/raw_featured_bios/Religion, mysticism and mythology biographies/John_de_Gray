'''John de Gray''' (died 18 October 1214) was a medieval English [[Bishop of Norwich]], and the elected but unconfirmed [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. He was employed in the service of [[John of England]] even before John's coronation as king, for which he was rewarded with a number of ecclesiastical offices, culminating in his ''[[pro forma]]'' election to Norwich in 1200. De Gray continued in royal service after his elevation to the [[episcopate]], lending the king money and undertaking diplomatic missions on his behalf. In 1205 King John attempted to further reward de Gray with a [[Translation (ecclesiastical)|translation]] to the archbishopric of Canterbury, but a disputed election process led to de Gray's selection being quashed by Pope [[Pope Innocent III|Innocent III]] in 1206.

Innocent consecrated [[Stephen Langton]] as archbishop against John's wishes, triggering a long dispute between the papacy and the king. The pope imposed various sanctions on England and John; at one point de Gray was one of only two bishops still legitimately holding office in England. In 1209 he became governor of Ireland for John, and spent until 1213 attempting to impose royal government on the Anglo-Norman barons and the native Irish in that country. Recalled to England to help defend against a threatened invasion by the French, de Gray then travelled to Rome to secure a papal pardon after the final settlement of John and Innocent's dispute over the bishop's abortive elevation to Canterbury. After securing his pardon de Gray was appointed [[Bishop of Durham]], but he died on his way back to England.

De Gray built a palace in his diocese and several castles in Ireland. Although reviled by one contemporary writer as an &quot;evil counsellor&quot; to the king,&lt;ref name=QDNB/&gt; modern historians have been more forgiving; one praised his intelligence and others stated that de Gray was one of the few men King John trusted throughout his life. De Gray's nephew, [[Walter de Gray]], secured the office of [[Lord Chancellor]] with his uncle's help in 1205.

==Early life==

Some describe de Gray as a native of Norfolk; he was likely descended from the [[Anglo-Normans|Norman]] knight, [[Anchetil de Greye]].&lt;ref name=DNB&gt;Haines &quot;[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/11541 Gray, John de (d. 1214)]&quot; ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''&lt;/ref&gt; De Gray was the uncle of Walter de Gray, later [[Archbishop of York]].&lt;ref name=BHOCleve/&gt; The elder de Gray was instrumental in securing the selection of his nephew as Lord Chancellor,&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; as he was a surety for Walter's payment of a fine of 5000&amp;nbsp;[[mark (money)|marks]] to acquire the position.&lt;ref name=Harding236&gt;Harding ''England in the Thirteenth Century'' p. 236&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|A fine is a payment made to a lord or other person, usually either as a regular payment, such as for a lease, or for the ability to take office.&lt;ref name=Coredon125&gt;Coredon ''Dictionary of Medieval Terms'' p. 125&lt;/ref&gt;}}

By 1196 de Gray was in the service of [[John I of England|Prince John]] (later King John), and was keeper of John's seal by 1198.&lt;ref name=BHOCleve&gt;Greenway ''[http://british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=7207 Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066–1300: volume 6: York: Archdeacons of Cleveland]''&lt;/ref&gt; After John's accession to the throne of England in 1199 he became [[Archdeaconry of Cleveland|Archdeacon of Cleveland]] in March 1200,&lt;ref name=BHOCleve/&gt; and [[List of Archdeacons of Gloucester|Archdeacon of Gloucester]] before April that year.&lt;ref name=BHOGlou&gt;Greenway ''[http://british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=33885 Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066–1300: volume 2: Monastic cathedrals (northern and southern provinces): Worcester: Archdeacons of Gloucester]''&lt;/ref&gt; He also served as John's secretary,&lt;ref name=Warren160&gt;Warren ''King John'' pp. 160–162&lt;/ref&gt; and frequently as a deputy for the [[Lord Chancellor]], [[Hubert Walter]].&lt;ref name=Young149&gt;Young ''Hubert Walter'' p. 149&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after John became king, de Gray began travelling between England and the continent on royal business, and for the first two years of John's reign was active in the royal chancery, sealing royal charters.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

De Gray was elected Bishop of Norwich on about 7 September 1200,&lt;ref name=Handbook261/&gt; although the election was purely ''pro forma'',&lt;ref name=Warren160&gt;Warren ''King John'' p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; as acknowledged by a contemporary writer [[Roger of Howden]], who stated that the new bishop &quot;succeeded to the bishopric of Norwich by the gift of King John&quot;.&lt;ref name=QWarren160&gt;Quoted in Warren ''King John'' p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; De Gray was [[consecration|consecrated]] on 24 September.&lt;ref name=Handbook261&gt;Fryde, et al. ''Handbook of British Chronology'' p. 261&lt;/ref&gt; His consecration took place together with that of the new [[Bishop of Hereford]] [[Giles de Braose]] at [[Westminster]], at the conclusion of a provincial church council held by Archbishop Walter, which de Gray had been attending.&lt;ref name=Walter65&gt;Cheney ''Hubert Walter'' p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; Walter performed the ceremony in a chapel of [[Westminster Abbey]].&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

==Bishop of Norwich==

While bishop, de Gray often lent the king money, and on one occasion held the [[regalia|royal regalia]] as security for the repayment of a loan; he also served as a royal justice. In 1203 de Gray accompanied Archbishop Hubert Walter of Canterbury and several [[papal legate]]s on an unsuccessful diplomatic mission to King [[Philip II of France]].&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; Philip had demanded that John's niece [[Eleanor of Brittany]] or his nephew [[Arthur of Brittany]] be surrendered to him together with all of John's lands on the continent, none of which John was prepared to concede. Philip invaded [[Normandy]] after the bishops returned to England.&lt;ref name=Loss260&gt;Powicke ''Loss of Normandy'' p. 260&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1203 some of de Gray's knights were part of the garrison at the castle of [[Le Vaudreuil|Vaudreuil]] in Normandy, serving under the command of [[Robert FitzWalter]].  Although they had provisions and John was moving in support of the troops, in the summer of 1203 the garrison surrendered to Philip, shortly after a siege had begun.&lt;ref name=Loss162&gt;Powicke ''Loss of Normandy'' p. 162&lt;/ref&gt; When King John abandoned Normandy in late 1203, effectively relinquishing control of the duchy to Philip, de Gray was one of his companions on the journey to the port of Barfleur, and went on to England with the king.&lt;ref name=Loss169&gt;Powicke ''Loss of Normandy'' p. 169 and footnote 251&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archbishop-elect==

King John's attempt to force de Gray's election as Archbishop of Canterbury in 1205 was the beginning of the king's long quarrel with Pope [[Pope Innocent III|Innocent III]]. After Hubert Walter's death in July 1205, the selection of a successor was hindered by doubts about what the proper procedure should be, something that commonly happened with elections to Canterbury. King John postponed a decision while delegations from the bishops of England and the monks of the [[cathedral chapter]] went to Rome to seek guidance from the pope.&lt;ref name=Jones35/&gt; The bishops of the province of Canterbury claimed the right to a say in who was elected, as whoever was chosen would be their superior,&lt;ref name=Harding266&gt;Harding ''England in the Thirteenth Century'' p. 266&lt;/ref&gt; but according to [[canon law]] the monks of the cathedral chapter had the right to elect the new archbishop. The king also had a say in the election,&lt;ref name=Lyon306&gt;Lyon ''Constitutional and Legal History'' pp. 306–307&lt;/ref&gt; as the archbishop was a major [[tenant-in-chief]] and was traditionally one of the principal royal advisors.&lt;ref name=Huscroft195&gt;Huscroft ''Ruling England'' pp. 195–196&lt;/ref&gt;

While the delegations from the various parties were in Rome, the monks of Canterbury secretly elected one of their own, [[Reginald (sub-prior)|Reginald]], as archbishop, and subsequently sent him to Rome to join the delegation. When King John discovered that Reginald had been elected without any royal input he forced the monks to elect de Gray as archbishop.&lt;ref name=Warren160/&gt; Some stories have Reginald's election taking place before the despatch of the first delegation to the [[Roman Curia|papal curia]]. Another source, [[Gervase of Canterbury]], has the king telling the chapter they could choose their own nominee after six months, while the king secretly sent envoys to Rome to secure de Gray's election.&lt;ref name=Jones35&gt;Jones ''King John and Magna Carta'' pp. 35–37&lt;/ref&gt; A further story, from [[Roger of Wendover]], states that the monks elected Reginald before Walter was even buried, and that only a few members of the cathedral chapter&amp;nbsp;– the younger ones&amp;nbsp;– participated in the election. Wendover wrote in the 1230s and was not a monk of Canterbury, therefore it is unlikely he has recorded a true account.&lt;ref name=Election212&gt;Knowles &quot;Canterbury Election&quot; ''English Historical Review'' pp. 212–215&lt;/ref&gt;

De Gray was postulated, or nominated, to Canterbury on 11 December 1205,&lt;ref name=Warren160/&gt; which presented Innocent with two candidates for the office. In an effort to reach a compromise,&lt;ref name=Lyon240&gt;Lyon ''Constitutional and Legal History'' p. 240&lt;/ref&gt; the pope quashed both nominations on about 30 March 1206;&lt;ref name=Warren160/&gt;&lt;ref name=Handbook232&gt;Fryde, et al. ''Handbook of British Chronology'' p. 232&lt;/ref&gt; Innocent's reason for invalidating de Gray's candidacy was that any election was invalid if an earlier one was still under appeal to the papacy.&lt;ref name=Evil116&gt;Turner ''King John'' p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; The monks then elected [[Stephen Langton]], with Innocent's approval.&lt;ref name=Warren160/&gt; John did not accept Langton's candidacy however, and Innocent's consecration of Langton in 1207 led to an eight-year struggle between John and the pope over the rights of the king to secure the election of his choice as archbishop.&lt;ref name=Lyon240/&gt; John refused to allow Langton to enter England and exiled the Canterbury monks.&lt;ref name=Huscroft195/&gt; Innocent placed an [[interdict]] on England in 1207, which John countered by confiscating the income and estates of any clergy who enforced it. Innocent went on to [[excommunicate]] John in 1209, in a dispute that led to the exile of many of the English clergy and John's imposition of heavy financial demands on the church in England;&lt;ref name=Lyon240/&gt; by 1209 de Gray and [[Peter des Roches]], the [[Bishop of Winchester]], were the only English bishops not in exile or dead.&lt;ref name=Lyon306/&gt; But it was not until 1213,&lt;ref name=Lyon240/&gt; when Innocent began to support John's deposition, that the king became concerned and reached a settlement with the papacy.&lt;ref name=Ruling196&gt;Huscroft ''Ruling England'' pp. 196–197&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Ireland==

By 1209 de Gray was in Ireland serving as the king's governor,&lt;ref name=Handbook161&gt;Fryde, et al. ''Handbook of British Chronology'' p. 161&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|It appears that de Gray left England after July 1208, as he was a witness to royal charters constantly from January through July 1208, when he disappears from royal documents.&lt;ref name=Richardson145&gt;Richardson &quot;Norman Ireland&quot; ''Irish Historical Studies'' p. 145 and footnote 1&lt;/ref&gt;}} an office sometimes referred to as [[justiciar]] for Ireland.&lt;ref name=Wood219&gt;Wood &quot;Office of Chief Governor&quot; ''Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy'' p. 219&lt;/ref&gt; One possible reason for his appointment was to save him from being accused of ignoring the interdict on England. As a bishop, it was de Gray's ecclesiastical duty to enforce the interdict, but by going to Ireland, which was not under interdict, he could continue to serve the king without provoking the papacy.&lt;ref name=Warren195&gt;Warren ''King John'' pp. 195–196&lt;/ref&gt; De Gray's chief policy in Ireland was to extend English rule, to which end he was involved in battles on the [[River Shannon]] and in [[Fermanagh]].&lt;ref name=Otway83&gt;Otway-Ruthven ''History of Medieval Ireland'' p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; He also replaced the Irish coinage with English, and attempted unsuccessfully to make English laws applicable in Ireland.&lt;ref name=Barlow408&gt;Barlow ''Feudal Kingdom of England'' pp. 408–409&lt;/ref&gt; De Gray's term of office in Ireland coincided with a time of change in Irish governmental practices.&lt;ref name=Angevin55&gt;Gillingham ''Angevin Empire'' p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;

During King John's persecution of [[William de Braose, 4th Lord of Bramber|William de Braose]] in 1209, [[William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke|William Marshall]] gave de Braose shelter on his Irish lands. De Gray demanded that Marshall surrender de Braose to him as a traitor, but Marshall refused, claiming that since he held some lands from de Braose, it would be an act of treason to surrender his lord to an outside authority.&lt;ref name=Loss295&gt;Powicke ''Loss of Normandy'' p. 295&lt;/ref&gt; Marshall's refusal does not seem to have embittered de Gray however, as three years later the bishop was praising him in a letter to King John.&lt;ref name=Warren201&gt;Warren ''King John'' p. 201&lt;/ref&gt;

John led an expedition to Ireland in 1210 in an effort to bring the Anglo-Norman barons under control. He opened talks with the native Irish kings, and some accounts state that his negotiations were so successful that the native Irish submitted to him. In contrast, the historian Seán Duffy has argued that the native Irish nobility were just as resistant to the king as the Anglo-Norman barons. After John's return to England he ordered de Gray to build three new castles in [[Connacht]],&lt;ref name=Duffy241/&gt; one of them at [[Athlone]].&lt;ref name=Orpen261&gt;Orpen &quot;Athlone Castle&quot; ''Journal of the Royal Society of Antiquaries'' p. 261&lt;/ref&gt; Associated with the castle building were two military invasions of Connacht by the royal government&amp;nbsp;– one from Meath and Leinster and the other from Munster.&lt;ref name=Duffy241&gt;Duffy &quot;John and Ireland&quot; pp. 241–242&lt;/ref&gt; De Gray left Ireland in 1211 to lead a military campaign against the Welsh,&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; leaving his deputy [[Richard de Tuit]] in charge of the country.&lt;ref name=Wood219/&gt;

De Gray also faced resistance from the northern Irish. In 1212 he led a campaign against [[Áed Méith]], in the promotion of which he constructed castles at [[Cáer Uisce]], [[Belleek, County Fermanagh|Belleek]], and [[Clones]],{{efn|Besides these castles and the earlier ones, in 1213, five more castles were either refurbished or built on de Gray's orders&amp;nbsp;– at [[Clonmacnoise]], [[Durrow, County Offaly|Durrow]], [[Birr]], [[Kinnitty]], and [[Roscrea]].&lt;ref name=Orpen266&gt;Orpen &quot;Athlone Castle&quot; ''Journal of the Royal Society of Antiquaries'' p. 266&lt;/ref&gt;}} bases for raids against the [[Ua Néill]] territory in the north. A naval campaign was also launched, but to no avail.&lt;ref name=Duffy241/&gt; De Gray suffered a defeat at the hands of [[Cormac mac Art Ó Melaghlain|Cormac O'Melaghlin]] in 1212 at [[Fircal]], Offaly,&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; and left Ireland the following year.&lt;ref name=Evil108&gt;Turner ''King John'' p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; He continued to hold the office of governor for a time, but by July 1213 he had been replaced by [[Henry de Loundres]], the [[Archbishop of Dublin]].&lt;ref name=Wood219/&gt; One of de Gray's final acts as justiciar was to take a force of Irish knights to England to help repel a threatened invasion by the French king, [[Philip II of France|Philip Augustus]].&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

==Episcopal affairs and later career==

As bishop, de Gray settled a long-running dispute between the monks of his cathedral chapter and his predecessors as bishop.&lt;ref name=Harper-Bill294&gt;Harper-Bill &quot;John and the Church&quot; ''King John'' p. 294&lt;/ref&gt; He also allowed the monks of his cathedral chapter the right to appoint and replace the clergy of the dependent churches of the cathedral.&lt;ref name=Cheney121&gt;Cheney ''From Becket to Langton'' p. 121 footnote 7&lt;/ref&gt; De Gray received a 1203 missive from Pope Innocent III decrying the marriages of some [[secular clergy]], in contravention of canon law.&lt;ref name=Cheney137&gt;Cheney ''From Becket to Langton'' p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; In more secular matters, he granted the town of [[King's Lynn#Toponymy|Bishop's Lynn]] (now [[King's Lynn]]) the right to hold a weekly market and two [[Fair#History|fair]]s per year. He also built a palace at [[Gaywood, Norfolk|Gaywood]].&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

De Gray's ability to raise money made him useful to King John. In 1213 de Gray mustered 500&amp;nbsp;knights during a period when King Philip II was threatening to invade England,&lt;ref name=Powell121/&gt; bringing this force over from Ireland along with mounted men-at-arms to support the king in England.&lt;ref name=Warren204&gt;Warren ''King John'' p. 204&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1213, John and Innocent finally resolved the dispute over Langton's election to Canterbury, and part of the settlement was that John gave Ireland and England to Innocent and received them back from the pope, making John a papal vassal.&lt;ref name=Lyon306/&gt; The settlement was sealed with a treaty, to which de Gray was one of the witnesses.&lt;ref name=Powell121&gt;Powell and Wallis ''House of Lords in the Middle Ages'' p. 121&lt;/ref&gt; After John settled with the papacy, de Gray was not included in the general pardon, and had to go to Rome to be pardoned.&lt;ref name=Warren212/&gt; While in that city the bishop was named as one of the guarantors of a new financial arrangement between the king and the pope dealing with feudal payments from England, which lowered the lump sum that had to be paid before Innocent would lift the interdict.&lt;ref name=Vincent92&gt;Vincent ''Peter des Roches'' p. 92&lt;/ref&gt;  After Innocent pardoned de Gray, the pope recommended his election as [[Bishop of Durham]] in 1213;&lt;ref name=Warren212&gt;Warren ''King John'' p. 212&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BHODurham&gt;Greenway ''[http://british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=33859 Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066–1300: volume 2: Monastic cathedrals (northern and southern provinces): Durham: Bishops]''&lt;/ref&gt; but de Gray died during his journey back to England on 18 October 1214, at [[Saint-Jean-d'Angély]] in [[Poitou]].&lt;ref name=Handbook261/&gt; He was buried in [[Norwich Cathedral]], but his tomb has not survived.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

As well as encouraging his nephew's career, de Gray took into his household two of Hubert Walter's household clerks: David, and Robert of Ruddeby.&lt;ref name=Young58&gt;Young ''Hubert Walter'' p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; Another clerk employed by de Gray, [[Robert de Bingham]], was in the bishop's household during the papal interdict on England; he went on to become a teacher of theology at Oxford, and [[Bishop of Salisbury]] in 1228.&lt;ref name=Vincent83&gt;Vincent ''Peter des Roches'' p. 83 and footnote 203&lt;/ref&gt;

De Gray remained close to John for most of the bishop's life,&lt;ref name=Evil46&gt;Turner ''King John'' p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; and one of the king's chief fundraisers.&lt;ref name=Powell121/&gt; [[Sidney Painter]], a historian and biographer of John, said of de Gray that he was &quot;probably the only man whom John trusted absolutely and without reservation for the whole period of their association&quot;.&lt;ref name=QEvil46&gt;Quoted in Turner ''King John'' p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; The medievalist Ralph Turner called de Gray &quot;one of John's greatest favourites&quot;,&lt;ref name=Evil61&gt;Turner ''King John'' p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; and another of John's biographers, {{nowrap|[[W. L. Warren]]}}, described de Gray as &quot;one of the best brains of the royal administration&quot;.&lt;ref name=Warren195/&gt; [[Matthew Paris]], a medieval writer, called him an &quot;evil counsellor&quot;,&lt;ref name=QDNB&gt;Quoted in Haines &quot;[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/11541 Gray, John de (d. 1214)]&quot; ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''&lt;/ref&gt; and blamed many of the difficulties of John's later reign on de Gray's failed election to Canterbury.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;
