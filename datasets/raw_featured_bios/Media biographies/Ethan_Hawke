==Career==
===Early work===
Hawke obtained his mother's permission to attend his first [[casting call]] at age 14.&lt;ref name=&quot;sunrise&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2005/oct/08/features.fiction|title=Another sunrise|last=Halpern|first=Dan|date=October 8, 2005|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=February 3, 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; He secured his first film role in 1985's ''[[Explorers (film)|Explorers]]'', in which he played alongside [[River Phoenix]] as an alien-obsessed schoolboy who builds a spacecraft with his friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9E00E2DB1738F931A25754C0A963948260|title=The Screen: 'Explorers'|last=Maslin|first=Janet|date=July 12, 1985|work=The New York Times|accessdate=February 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film received favorable reviews&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/explorers/|title=Explorer Movie Reviews|date=July 12, 1985|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=February 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; but made poor box office revenues,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Betsy|last=Pickle|title=Northern Lights&amp;nbsp;— Ethan Hawke Relishes All He Learned Making 'White Fang'|date=February 4, 1991|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; a failure which Hawke has admitted caused him to quit acting for a brief period after the film's release. Hawke later described the disappointment as difficult to bear at such a young age, adding &quot;I would never recommend that a kid act.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;payoff&quot;/&gt; His next film appearance was not until 1989's comedy drama ''[[Dad (film)|Dad]]'', where he played [[Ted Danson]]'s son and [[Jack Lemmon]]'s grandson.&lt;ref name=&quot;payoff&quot;/&gt;

In 1989, Hawke made his breakthrough appearance, playing shy student Todd Anderson opposite [[Robin Williams]]'s inspirational English teacher in ''[[Dead Poets Society]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;actors&quot;/&gt; The film was critically well-received;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/dead-poets-society/|title=Dead Poets Society (1989): Reviews|date=June 2, 1989|publisher=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=August 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' reviewer wrote &quot;Hawke&amp;nbsp;... gives a haunting performance.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117790298?refcatid=31|title=Dead Poets Society Review|date=January 1, 1989|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|accessdate=February 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; With revenue of $235&amp;nbsp;million worldwide, the film remains Hawke's most commercially successful picture to date.&lt;ref name=&quot;earnings&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/people/chart/?view=Actor&amp;id=ethanhawke.htm|title=Ethan Hawke Movie Box Office Results|publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]]|accessdate=February 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hawke later described the opportunities he was offered as a result of the film's success as critical to his decision to continue acting: &quot;I didn't want to be an actor and I went back to college. But then the [film's] success was so monumental that I was getting offers to be in such interesting movies and be in such interesting places, and it seemed silly to pursue anything else.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;sunrise&quot; /&gt;

Hawke's next film, 1991's ''[[White Fang (1991 film)|White Fang]]'', brought his first leading role. The film, an adaptation of [[Jack London]]'s [[White Fang|novel of the same name]], featured Hawke as Jack Conroy, a [[Yukon]] gold hunter who befriends a [[wolfdog]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20166788,00.html|title=White Fang|last=Gleiberman|first=Owen|date=December 17, 2007|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=February 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[The Oregonian]]'', &quot;Hawke does a good job as young Jack, being both physically robust but still boyishly naive. He makes Jack's passion for White Fang real and keeps it from being ridiculous or overly sentimental.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Ted|last=Mahar|title='White Fang': A Boy, A Mine And A Dog|date=January 24, 1991|work=[[The Oregonian]]|page=C14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hawke then appeared in ''[[A Midnight Clear]]'' (1992), a well-received war film by [[Keith Gordon]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19920501/REVIEWS/205010305/1023|title=A Midnight Clear|last=Ebert|first=Roger|date=May 1, 1992|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|accessdate=February 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 1993's ''[[Alive (1993 film)|Alive]]'', an adaptation of [[Piers Paul Read]]'s 1974 book, ''[[Alive: The Story of the Andes Survivors]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,305303,00.html|title=Alive (Movie&amp;nbsp;– 1993) |last=Gleiberman|first=Owen|date=January 15, 1993|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=February 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical success===
Hawke's next part, in the [[Generation X]] drama ''[[Reality Bites]]'' (1994) as Troy, a slacker who mocks the ambitions of his love interest (played by [[Winona Ryder]]),&lt;ref name=&quot;sunrise&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name= &quot;rickey&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rickey|first=Carrie|title=Generation X Turns Its Back|work=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]|page=L01|date=April 3, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; received critical acclaim. Film critic [[Roger Ebert]] called Hawke's performance convincing and noteworthy: &quot;Hawke captures all the right notes as the boorish Troy.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19940218/REVIEWS/402180303/1023|title=Reality Bites|last=Ebert|first=Roger|date=February 18, 1994|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|accessdate=February 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The New York Times'' noted, &quot;Mr. Hawke's subtle and strong performance makes it clear that Troy feels things too deeply to risk failure and admit he's feeling anything at all.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=950DE1DC143BF93BA25751C0A962958260|title=Coming of Age in Snippets: Life as a Twentysomething|last=James|first=Caryn|date=February 18, 1994|work=The New York Times|accessdate=February 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the film was a surprise box office disappointment.&lt;ref name=&quot;rickey&quot;/&gt;

The following year Hawke again received critical praise, this time for his performance in [[Richard Linklater]]'s 1995 drama ''[[Before Sunrise]]''. The film follows a young American (Hawke) and a young French woman ([[Julie Delpy]]), who meet on a train and disembark in Vienna, spending the night exploring the city and getting to know one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/1995/01/27/DD52018.DTL|title=An Extraordinary Day Dawns 'Before Sunrise'|last=LaSalle|first=Mick|date=January 27, 1995|work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|accessdate=February 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' praised Hawke and Delpy's performances: &quot;[they] interact so gently and simply that you feel certain that they helped write the dialogue. Each of them seems to have something personal at stake in their performances.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;barbara&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/e/a/1995/01/27/WEEKEND15835.dtl|title=Modern &quot;Roman Holiday' alive and well in Vienna|last=Shulgasser|first=Barbara|date=January 27, 1995|work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|accessdate=February 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Away from acting, Hawke directed the music video for the 1994 song &quot;[[Stay (I Missed You)]]&quot; by singer-songwriter [[Lisa Loeb]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2000/dec/19/comment|title=The best Ethan Hawke scene|date=December 19, 2000|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=July 16, 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also published his first novel in 1996, ''The Hottest State'', about a love affair between a young actor and a singer. Hawke said of the novel, &quot;Writing the book had to do with dropping out of college, and with being an actor. I didn't want my whole life to go by and not do anything but recite lines. I wanted to try making something else. It was definitely the scariest thing I ever did. And it was just one of the best things I ever did.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;sunrise&quot;/&gt; The book met with a mixed reception. ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' said that Hawke &quot;opens himself to rough literary scrutiny in ''The Hottest State''. If Hawke is serious&amp;nbsp;... he'd do well to work awhile in less exposed venues, perhaps focusing on shorter stories and submitting them to little magazines.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,294593,00.html|title=The Hottest State&amp;nbsp;— Book Review|last=Schwarzbaum|first=Lisa|date=October 18, 1996|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=February 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The New York Times'' thought Hawke did &quot;a fine job of showing what it's like to be young and full of confusion&quot;, concluding that ''The Hottest State'' was ultimately &quot;a sweet love story&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/03/books/love-hurts.html|title=Love Hurts|last=Nessel|first=Jen|date=November 3, 1996|work=The New York Times|accessdate=February 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Andrew Niccol]]'s science fiction film ''[[Gattaca]]'' (1997), &quot;one of the more interesting scripts&quot; Hawke said he had read in &quot;a number of years&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Kenneth M.|last=Chanko|title=Hawke-ing the future in science-fiction thriller 'Gattaca'|date=October 26, 1997|work=[[The San Diego Union-Tribune]]|page=E–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hawke played the role of a man who infiltrates a society of genetically perfect humans by assuming another man's identity in order to realize his dream of space travel. Although ''Gattaca'' was not a success at the box office&lt;ref name=&quot;earnings&quot; /&gt; it drew generally favorable reviews from critics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/gattaca|title=Gattaca (1997): Reviews|date=October 24, 1997|publisher=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=August 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Hawke's performance was critically well-received. The ''[[Fort Worth Star-Telegram]]'' reviewer wrote that &quot;Hawke, building on the sympathetic-but-edgy presence that has served him well since his kid-actor days, is most impressive&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Michael H.|last=Price|title=Gattaca Well-conceived sci-fi|date=October 24, 1997|work=[[Fort Worth Star-Telegram]]|page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1998 saw Hawke appearing in ''[[Great Expectations (1998 film)|Great Expectations]]'', a contemporary film adaptation of the [[Charles Dickens]] [[Great Expectations|novel]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/9802/06/great.expectations/|title=Review: What the Dickens is 'Great Expectations'?|last=Tatara|first=Paul|date=February 6, 1998|publisher=[[CNN]]|accessdate=March 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and collaborating for a second time with director Richard Linklater in ''[[The Newton Boys]]'', based on the true story of the [[Newton Gang]], a family of bank robbers from [[Uvalde, Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/1998/03/27/DD28206.DTL|title=Bank-Robbing `Newton' Brothers Show Boys Will Be Boys|last=Stack|first=Peter|date=March 27, 1998|work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|accessdate=February 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999 Hawke starred in ''[[Snow Falling on Cedars (film)|Snow Falling on Cedars]]'', in which he played a reporter named Ishmael Chambers, who, after being wounded in World War II, comes home to take over his family newspaper after his father's death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2000/SHOWBIZ/Movies/01/07/review.snowfalling/|title=Review: 'Snow Falling on Cedars' a visual feast|last=Clinton|first=Paul|date=January 7, 2000|publisher=[[CNN]]|accessdate=February 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film, based on [[David Guterson]]'s novel of the [[Snow Falling on Cedars|same title]], received ambivalent reviews and ''Entertainment Weekly'' concluded, &quot;Hawke scrunches himself into such a dark knot that we have no idea who Ishmael is or why he acts as he does.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,275053,00.html|title=Snow Falling on Cedars&amp;nbsp;— Movie Review|last=Schwarzbaum|first=Lisa|date=January 7, 2000|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=February 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also appeared that year in [[Frank Whaley]]'s directorial debut ''[[Joe the King]]'' (1999).

Hawke's next film role was in [[Michael Almereyda]]'s 2000 film ''[[Hamlet (2000 film)|Hamlet]]'', in which he played the [[Prince Hamlet|title character]]. The film transposed the famous [[William Shakespeare]] [[Hamlet|play]] to contemporary New York City,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/entertainment/movies/reviews/hamlethowe.htm|title='Hamlet': A Melancholy Dude |last=Howe|first=Desson|date=May 19, 2000|work=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=February 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; a technique Hawke felt made the play more &quot;accessible and vital&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/nydn-features/a-renaissance-man-tackles-shakespeare-hamlet-ethan-hawke-mind-movie-stardom-article-1.869336|title=A Renaissance Man tackles Shakespeare 'Hamlet's' Ethan Hawke has more on his mind than movie stardom|last=Dominguez|first=Robert|date=May 11, 2000|work=[[Daily News (New York)]]|accessdate=April 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Salon.com|Salon]]'' reviewer wrote: &quot;Hawke certainly isn't the greatest Hamlet of living memory&amp;nbsp;... but his performance reinforces Hamlet's place as Shakespeare's greatest character.

===''Training Day'' and after===
Hawke's next role, and one for which he received substantial critical acclaim, came in ''[[Training Day]]'' (2001).
