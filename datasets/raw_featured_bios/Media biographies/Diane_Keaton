'''Diane Keaton''' (born '''Diane Hall''' January 5, 1946) is an American film actress, director, producer, and screenwriter. Keaton began her career on stage, and made her screen debut in 1970. Her first major film role was as [[Kay Adams-Corleone]] in ''[[The Godfather]]'' (1972), but the films that shaped her early career were those with director and co-star [[Woody Allen]] beginning with ''[[Play It Again, Sam (1972 film)|Play It Again, Sam]]'' in 1972. Her next two films with Allen, ''[[Sleeper (film)|Sleeper]]'' (1973) and ''[[Love and Death]]'' (1975), established her as a comic actor. Her fourth, ''[[Annie Hall]]'' (1977), won her the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]].

Keaton subsequently expanded her range to avoid becoming typecast as her ''Annie Hall'' persona. She became an accomplished dramatic performer, starring in ''[[Looking for Mr. Goodbar (film)|Looking for Mr. Goodbar]]'' (1977) and received Academy Award nominations for ''[[Reds (film)|Reds]]'' (1981) and ''[[Marvin's Room (film)|Marvin's Room]]'' (1996). Some of her popular later films include ''[[Baby Boom (film)|Baby Boom]]'' (1987), ''[[Father of the Bride (1991 film)|Father of the Bride]]'' (1991), ''[[The First Wives Club]]'' (1996), ''[[Something's Gotta Give (film)|Something's Gotta Give]]'' (2003) and ''[[The Family Stone]]'' (2005). Keaton's films have earned a cumulative gross of over US$1.1&amp;nbsp;[[1000000000 (number)|billion]] in North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.the-numbers.com/people/DKEAT.html |title= Diane Keaton Box Office Data |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060508130236/http://www.the-numbers.com/people/DKEAT.html |archivedate=May 8, 2006}}.

Keaton began studying acting at the [[Neighborhood Playhouse]] in New York City. She initially studied acting under the [[Meisner technique]], an [[ensemble cast|ensemble]] acting technique first evolved in the 1930s by [[Sanford Meisner]], a New York stage actor/acting coach/director who had been a member of The Group Theater (1931–1940).

== Career ==
=== 1970s ===
[[File:Dkeatongodfather.jpg|thumb|upright|Keaton as [[Kay Adams-Corleone]] in the final shot of 1972's ''[[The Godfather]]'']]

After being nominated for a [[Tony Award]] for ''Play It Again, Sam'', Keaton made her film debut in 1970's ''[[Lovers and Other Strangers]]''. She followed with guest roles on the television series ''[[Love, American Style]]'' and ''[[Night Gallery]]'', and ''[[Mannix]]''. Between films, Keaton appeared in a series of [[deodorant]] [[television commercial|commercials]].

Keaton's breakthrough role came two years later when she was cast as [[Kay Adams-Corleone|Kay Adams]], the girlfriend and eventual wife of [[Michael Corleone]] (played by [[Al Pacino]]) in [[Francis Ford Coppola]]'s 1972 blockbuster ''[[The Godfather]]''. Coppola noted that he first noticed Keaton in ''Lovers and Other Strangers'', and cast her because of her reputation for [[eccentricity (behavior)|eccentricity]] that he wanted her to bring to the role&lt;ref&gt;Behind the Scenes: A Look Inside. Featurette from ''The Godfather'' DVD bonus features.&lt;/ref&gt; (Keaton claims that at the time she was commonly referred to as &quot;the kooky actress&quot; of the film industry).&lt;ref name=&quot;NPR&quot; /&gt; Her performance in the film was loosely based on her real life experience of making the film, both of which she has described as being &quot;the woman in a world of men&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;NPR&quot; /&gt; ''The Godfather'' was an unparalleled critical and financial success, becoming the highest grossing film of the year and winning the [[Best Picture Oscar]] of 1972.

Two years later she reprised her role as Kay Adams in ''[[The Godfather Part II]]''. She was initially reluctant, stating that, &quot;At first, I was skeptical about playing Kay again in the ''Godfather'' sequel. But when I read the script, the character seemed much more substantial than in the first movie.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;mcrazed&quot; /&gt; In ''Part II'' her character changed dramatically, becoming more embittered about her husband's activities. Even though Keaton received widespread exposure from the films, her character's importance was minimal. ''[[Time magazine|Time]]'' wrote that she was &quot;invisible in ''The Godfather'' and pallid in ''The Godfather, Part II''.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;time1977&quot;&gt;&quot;Love, Death and La&amp;nbsp;– De&amp;nbsp;– Dah&quot; ''TIME'' magazine. September 26, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;

Keaton's other notable films of the 1970s included many collaborations with Woody Allen. Although by the time they made films together, their romantic involvement had ended, she played many eccentric characters in several of his comic and dramatic films including ''[[Sleeper (film)|Sleeper]]'', ''[[Love and Death]]'', ''[[Interiors]]'', ''[[Manhattan (film)|Manhattan]]'', and the film version of ''[[Play It Again, Sam (1972 film)|Play It Again, Sam]]'', directed by [[Herbert Ross]]. Allen has credited Keaton as his muse during his early film career.&lt;ref&gt;Lax, 2000, p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977, Keaton starred with Allen in the [[romantic comedy]] ''[[Annie Hall]]'', one of her most famous roles. ''Annie Hall'' was written and directed by Allen and the film was believed to be autobiographical of his relationship with Keaton. Allen based the character of Annie Hall loosely on Keaton (&quot;Annie&quot; is a nickname of hers, and &quot;Hall&quot; is her original surname). Many of Keaton's mannerisms and her self-deprecating sense of humor were added into the role by Allen. (Director [[Nancy Meyers]] has claimed &quot;Diane's the most self-deprecating person alive&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Sean Smith. &quot;Sweet on Diane&quot; ''Newsweek''.

In 2006, ''[[Premiere (magazine)|Premiere]]'' magazine ranked Keaton in ''Annie Hall'' as 60th on its list of the &quot;100 Greatest Performances of All Time&quot;:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
It's hard to play ditzy. ... The genius of Annie is that despite her loopy backhand, awful driving, and nervous tics, she's also a complicated, intelligent woman. Keaton brilliantly displays this dichotomy of her character, especially when she yammers away on a first date with Alvy (Woody Allen) while the subtitle reads, 'He probably thinks I'm a yoyo.'

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Keaton's eccentric wardrobe in ''Annie Hall'', which consisted mainly of vintage men's clothing, including neckties, vests, baggy pants, and [[fedora (hat)|fedora]] hats, made her an unlikely fashion icon of the late 1970s. Most of the clothing seen in the film came from Keaton herself, who was already known for her [[tomboy]]ish clothing style years before ''Annie Hall'', though Ruth Morley and [[Ralph Lauren]] reportedly worked on the movie's costume.&lt;ref name=&quot;mcrazed&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;filmsiteanni&quot;&gt;Tim Dirks.

In the film she played a Catholic schoolteacher for deaf children who lives a double life, spending nights frequenting singles bars and engaging in promiscuous sex. Keaton became interested in the role after seeing it as a &quot;psychological case history.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Joan Juliet Buck. &quot;Inside Diane Keaton&quot;. ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]''. March 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; The same issue of ''Time'' commended her role choice and criticized the restricted roles available for female actors in American films: &lt;blockquote&gt;A male actor can fly a plane, fight a war, shoot a badman, pull off a sting, impersonate a big cheese in business or politics. Men are presumed to be interesting. A female can play a wife, play a whore, get pregnant, lose her baby, and, um, let's see ... Women are presumed to be dull. ... Now a determined trend spotter can point to a handful of new films whose makers think that women can bear the dramatic weight of a production alone, or virtually so. Then there is Diane Keaton in ''Looking for Mr. Goodbar''. As Theresa Dunn, Keaton dominates this raunchy, risky, violent dramatization of Judith Rossner's 1975 novel about a schoolteacher who cruises singles bars.&lt;ref name=&quot;time1977&quot; /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In addition to acting, Keaton has stated that &quot;&lt;nowiki&gt;[I]&lt;/nowiki&gt; had a lifelong ambition to be a singer.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sundaypost.com/magazine/mag_archive/famous/mag_celebrity_dec_2005.htm The ever-changing star].

In 1977, she began recording tracks for a solo album, but the finished record never materialized.&lt;ref name=&quot;RS1977&quot; /&gt;

Keaton met with more success in the medium of still photography. Like her character in ''Annie Hall'', Keaton had long relished photography as a favorite hobby, an interest she picked up as a teenager from her mother. While traveling in the late 1970s she began exploring her avocation more seriously. &quot;Rolling Stone had asked me to take photographs for them, and I thought, 'Wait a minute, what I'm really interested in is these lobbies, and these strange ballrooms in these old hotels.' So I began shooting them&quot;, she recalled in 2003. &quot;These places were deserted, and I could just sneak in anytime and nobody cared. It was so easy and I could do it myself. It was an adventure for me.&quot; ''Reservations'', her collection of photos of hotel interiors, was published in book form in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Robert | last = Long | title = Diane Keaton: A Photographer's Role | url = http://www.easthamptonstar.com/DNN/Archive/2003/20030626/feat1.htm | work = [[The East Hampton Star]] | date = June 26, 2003 | accessdate =August 25, 2008 | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080725123627/http://www.easthamptonstar.com/DNN/Archive/2003/20030626/feat1.htm &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt; | archivedate = July 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After ''Manhattan'' in 1979, Keaton and Woody Allen ended their long working relationship, and the film would be their last major collaboration until 1993. In 1978, Keaton became romantically involved with [[Warren Beatty]], and two years later he cast her to play opposite him in ''[[Reds (film)|Reds]]''. In the film, she played [[Louise Bryant]], a journalist and feminist, who flees from her husband to work with radical journalist [[John Silas Reed|John Reed]] (Beatty), and later enters Russia to locate him as he chronicles the [[Russian Civil War]]. ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that Keaton was, &quot;nothing less than splendid as Louise Bryant&amp;nbsp;– beautiful, selfish, funny and driven. It's the best work she has done to date.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Vincent Canby]]. [http://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/04/movies/beatty-s-reds-with-diane-keaton.html Beatty's Reds with Diane Keaton]. ''The New York Times''. December 4, 1981. Retrieved February 24, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Keaton received her second Academy Award nomination for the film.

Beatty cast Keaton after seeing her in ''Annie Hall'', as he wanted to bring her natural nervousness and insecure attitude to the role. The production of ''Reds'' was delayed several times since its conception in 1977, and Keaton almost left the project when she believed it would never be produced. Filming finally began two years later. In a 2006 ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' story, Keaton described her role as &quot;the everyman of that piece, as someone who wanted to be extraordinary but was probably more ordinary ... I knew what it felt like to be extremely insecure.&quot; [[Assistant director]] Simon Relph later stated that Louise Bryant was one of her most difficult roles, and that &quot;&lt;nowiki&gt;[she]&lt;/nowiki&gt; almost got broken.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;vanityfair2006&quot;&gt;&quot;The Making of ''Reds''&quot;.

1984 brought ''[[The Little Drummer Girl (film)|The Little Drummer Girl]]'', Keaton's first excursion into the thriller and action genre. ''The Little Drummer Girl'' was both a financial and critical failure, with critics claiming that Keaton was miscast for the genre, such as one review from ''[[The New Republic]]'' claiming that &quot;the title role, the pivotal role, is played by Diane Keaton, and around her the picture collapses in tatters. She is so feeble, so inappropriate.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Stanley Kauffmann. &quot;The Little Drummer Girl.&quot; ''[[The New Republic]]'' 191.

Two years later she starred with [[Jessica Lange]] and [[Sissy Spacek]] in ''[[Crimes of the Heart (film)|Crimes of the Heart]]'', adapted from [[Beth Henley]]'s Pulitzer Prize-winning play into a moderately successful screen comedy. She starred in her first commercial vehicle with 1987's ''[[Baby Boom (film)|Baby Boom]]'', her first of four collaborations with writer-producer [[Nancy Meyers]]. In ''Baby Boom'', Keaton starred as a Manhattan career woman who is suddenly forced to care for a toddler. That same year she made a cameo in Allen's film ''[[Radio Days]]'' as a nightclub singer. 1988's ''The Good Mother'' was a misstep for Keaton.

In 1987, Keaton directed and edited her first feature film, a documentary named ''Heaven'' about the possibility of an [[afterlife]]. ''Heaven'' met with mixed critical reaction, with ''The New York Times'' likening it to &quot;a conceit imposed on its subjects.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Vincent Canby]].

=== 1990s ===
By the 1990s, Keaton had established herself as one of the most popular and versatile actors in Hollywood. Now middle-aged, she shifted to more mature roles, frequently playing matriarchs of middle-class families. Of her role choices and avoidance of becoming [[typecasting (acting)|typecast]], she said: &quot;Most often a particular role does you some good and Bang!

She began the decade with ''[[The Lemon Sisters]]'', a poorly received comedy/drama that she starred in and produced, which was shelved for a year after its completion. In 1991, Keaton starred with [[Steve Martin]] in the family comedy ''[[Father of the Bride (1991 film)|Father of the Bride]]''. She was almost not cast in the film, as the commercial failure of ''The Good Mother'' had strained her relationship with [[Walt Disney Pictures]], the studio of both films.&lt;ref name=&quot;filmscouts&quot; /&gt; ''Father of the Bride'' was Keaton's first major hit after four years of commercial disappointments.

Keaton reprised her role four years later in the sequel, as a woman who becomes pregnant in middle age at the same time as her daughter. A review of the film for the ''[[San Francisco Examiner]]'' was one of many in which Keaton once again received comparison to [[Katharine Hepburn]]: &quot;No longer relying on that stuttering uncertainty that seeped into all her characterizations of the 1970s, she has somehow become Katharine Hepburn with a deep maternal instinct, that is, she is a fine and intelligent actress who doesn't need to be tough and edgy in order to prove her feminism.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Shulgasser.

Keaton's first film of 2000 was ''[[Hanging Up]]'' with [[Meg Ryan]] and [[Lisa Kudrow]]. Keaton also directed the film, despite claiming in a 1996 interview that she would never direct herself in a film, saying &quot;as a director, you automatically have different goals.

In 1979, she began dating her ''Reds'' co-star [[Warren Beatty]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes&quot;&gt;[http://movies.nytimes.com/person/96996/Diane-Keaton/biography Diane Keaton biography].
