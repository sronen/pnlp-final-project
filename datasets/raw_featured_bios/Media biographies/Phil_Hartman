'''Philip Edward''' &quot;'''Phil'''&quot; '''Hartman''' (September 24, 1948{{spaced ndash}} May 28, 1998; ''né'' '''Hartmann''') was a [[Canadian American|Canadian-American]] actor, comedian, screenwriter, and graphic artist. Born in [[Brantford]], [[Ontario]], Hartman and his family moved to the United States when he was 10. After graduating from [[California State University, Northridge]], with a degree in graphic arts, he designed album covers for bands like [[Poco]] and [[America (band)|America]]. Feeling the need for a more creative outlet, Hartman joined the comedy group [[The Groundlings]] in 1975 and there helped comedian [[Paul Reubens]] develop his character [[Pee-wee Herman]]. Hartman co-wrote the screenplay for the film ''[[Pee-wee's Big Adventure]]'' and made recurring appearances on Reubens' show ''[[Pee-wee's Playhouse]]''.

Hartman became famous in the late 1980s when he joined the sketch comedy show ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''. He won fame for his impressions, particularly of President [[Bill Clinton]], and he stayed on the show for eight seasons. Called &quot;the Glue&quot; for his ability to hold the show together and help other cast members, Hartman won a [[Primetime Emmy Award]] for his ''SNL'' work in 1989. In 1995, after scrapping plans for his own variety show, he starred as Bill McNeal in the [[NBC]] [[sitcom]] ''[[NewsRadio]]''. He also had frequent roles on ''[[The Simpsons]]'' as [[Lionel Hutz]], [[Troy McClure]], and others, and appeared in the films ''[[Houseguest]]'', ''[[Sgt. Bilko]]'', ''[[Jingle All the Way]]'', and ''[[Small Soldiers]]''.

Hartman had been divorced twice before he married Brynn Omdahl in 1987; the couple had two children together. However, their marriage was fractured, due in part to Brynn's drug use. On May 28, 1998, Brynn&lt;!--She took the surname Hartman after her marriage, thus, per [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style (biographies)#Family members with the same surname]], is referred to as &quot;Brynn&quot; from now on.--&gt; shot and killed her husband while he slept in their [[Encino, California|Encino]], [[Los Angeles]], home, then committed [[suicide]] several hours later. In the weeks following his death, Hartman was celebrated in a wave of tributes. Dan Snierson of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' opined that Hartman was &quot;the last person you'd expect to read about in lurid headlines in your morning paper...a decidedly regular guy, beloved by everyone he worked with&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ew&quot; /&gt;

==Early life==

==Career==
===Early career (1975–1985)===
Working alone as a graphic artist, Hartman frequently amused himself with &quot;flights of voice fantasies&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;jerk&quot;/&gt; Eventually he felt he needed a more social outlet and in 1975, aged 27, developed this talent by attending evening comedy classes run by the [[California]]-based improvisational comedy group [[The Groundlings]].&lt;ref name=&quot;atlanta&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bh&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=van/&gt; While watching one of the troupe's performances, Hartman impulsively decided to climb on stage and join the cast.&lt;ref name=&quot;bookof&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;jerk&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;leavesnl&quot;/&gt; After several years of training, paying his way by re-designing the groups' logo and merchandise, Hartman formally joined the cast of The Groundlings; by 1979 he had become one of the show's stars.&lt;ref name=van/&gt; Hartman met comedian [[Paul Reubens]] and the two became friends, often collaborating on writing and comedic material. Together they created the character [[Pee-wee Herman]] and developed ''[[The Pee-wee Herman Show]]'', a stage performance which also aired on [[HBO]] in 1981.&lt;ref name=&quot;jerk&quot;/&gt; Hartman played [[Captain Carl]] on ''The Pee-wee Herman Show'' and returned in the role for the children's show ''[[Pee-wee's Playhouse]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;jerk&quot;/&gt; Reubens and Hartman made cameos in the 1980 film ''[[Cheech &amp; Chong's Next Movie]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;bh&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=TV book|author=Knutzen, Eirik|date=1997-06-29|work=[[Boston Herald]]|page=TV 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Playhouse Party – Cartoon Network reanimates Pee-wee Herman Hartman then co-wrote the script of the 1985 feature film|date=2006-07-11|work=[[The Gazette (Colorado Springs)|The Gazette]]|author=Short, Christopher|page=Life 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hartman co-wrote the script of the 1985 feature film ''[[Pee-wee's Big Adventure]]'' and had a cameo as a reporter.&lt;ref name=&quot;atlanta&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ew&quot;/&gt; Although he had considered quitting acting at the age of 36 due to limited opportunities, the success of ''Pee-wee's Big Adventure'' brought new possibilities and changed his mind.&lt;ref name=&quot;hamilton&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title='No spikes, no sudden downfalls': Slow and steady wins the race for Phil Hartman|accessdate=2008-10-24|date=1995-08-22|author=Thomas, Bob|work=[[The Hamilton Spectator]]|page=D3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;newfaces&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|title=Four New Faces on 'Saturday Night'|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|page=44|date=1986-09-30|accessdate=2009-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a creative falling-out with Reubens, Hartman left the Pee-Wee Herman project to pursue other roles.&lt;ref name=&quot;jerk&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jam.canoe.ca/Movies/Artists/H/Hartman_Phil/1996/12/01/758979.html|title=Phil: The Jerky Guy|accessdate=2008-08-04|date=1996-12-01|publisher=[[Canadian Online Explorer|Canoe]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bottle&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=nice/&gt;

In addition to his work with Reubens, Hartman recorded a number of voice-over roles. These included appearances on ''[[The Smurfs (1981 TV series)|The Smurfs]]'', ''[[Challenge of the GoBots]]'', ''[[The 13 Ghosts of Scooby-Doo]]'', and voicing characters Henry Mitchell and George Wilson on ''[[Dennis the Menace (1986 animated series)|Dennis the Menace]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;cbs profile&quot;/&gt; Additionally Hartman developed a strong persona providing voice-overs for advertisements.&lt;ref name=&quot;leavesnl&quot; /&gt;

After appearing in the 1986 films ''[[Jumpin' Jack Flash (film)|Jumpin' Jack Flash]]'' and ''[[¡Three Amigos!]]'', Hartman successfully auditioned for [[NBC]]'s variety show ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' (''SNL'') and joined the cast and writing staff.&lt;ref name=&quot;ew&quot; /&gt; He told the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', &quot;I wanted to do [''SNL''] because I wanted to get the exposure that would give me box-office credibility so I can write movies for myself.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;newfaces&quot;/&gt; In his eight seasons with the show Hartman became known for his impressions, and performed as over 70 different characters. Hartman's original ''Saturday Night Live'' characters included [[Saturday Night Live TV show sketches of the 1990s#Cooking with the Anal Retentive Chef|Eugene, the Anal Retentive Chef]] and [[Unfrozen Caveman Lawyer]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cbs profile&quot;/&gt; His impressions included [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Ronald Reagan]], [[Ed McMahon]], [[Barbara Bush (First Lady)|Barbara Bush]], [[Charlton Heston]], [[Phil Donahue]] and [[Bill Clinton]]; the last was often considered his best-known impression.&lt;ref name=&quot;ew&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cad&quot; /&gt;

Hartman first performed his Clinton impression on an episode of ''[[The Tonight Show]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;dallas&quot; /&gt; When he met Clinton in 1993 Hartman remarked, &quot;I guess I owe you a few apologies&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;dallas&quot; /&gt; adding later that he &quot;sometimes [felt] a twinge of guilt about [his Clinton impression]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;cad&quot; /&gt; Clinton showed good humor and sent Hartman a signed photo with the text: &quot;You're not the president, but you play one on TV. And you're OK, mostly.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;cad&quot; /&gt; For his Clinton impression, Hartman copied the president's &quot;post-nasal drip&quot; and the &quot;slight scratchiness&quot; in his voice, as well as his open, &quot;less intimidating&quot; hand gestures. Hartman opted against wearing a larger prosthetic nose when portraying Clinton, as he felt it would be distracting. He instead wore a wig, dyed his eyebrows brighter and used makeup to highlight his nose.&lt;ref name=van/&gt; One of Hartman's more famous sketches as Clinton saw the president visit a [[McDonald's]] restaurant and explain his policies by eating other customers' food. The writers told him that he was not eating enough during rehearsals for the sketch – by the end of the live performance, Hartman had eaten so much he could barely speak.&lt;ref name=&quot;dallas&quot; /&gt;

Backstage at ''SNL'', Hartman was called &quot;the Glue&quot;, a name coined by [[Adam Sandler]], according to [[Jay Mohr]]'s book ''[[Gasping for Airtime]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Gasping for Airtime|year=2004|publisher=Hyperion|author=Mohr, Jay|page=164|isbn=1-4013-0006-5|authorlink=Jay Mohr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=van&gt;{{cite news|title=100 Flavors of Vanilla|author=Rice, Darcy|work=Orange Coast Magazine|date=08-1996|pages=34–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''SNL'' creator [[Lorne Michaels]] explained the reason for the name: &quot;He kind of held the show together. He gave to everybody and demanded very little. He was very low-maintenance.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;surface&quot;/&gt; Hartman often helped other cast members. For example, he aided [[Jan Hooks]] in overcoming her [[stage fright]].&lt;ref name=hooks/&gt; Michaels added that Hartman was &quot;the least appreciated&quot; cast member by commentators outside the show, and praised his ability &quot;to do five or six parts in a show where you're playing support or you're doing remarkable character work&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;cbs profile&quot;/&gt; Hartman won the [[Primetime Emmy Award]] for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Variety, Music or Comedy Program|Outstanding Writing for a Variety, Music or Comedy Program]] for ''SNL'' in 1989, sharing the award with the show's other writers. He was nominated in the same category in 1987, and individually in 1994 for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Individual Performance in a Variety or Music Program|Outstanding Individual Performance in a Variety or Music Program]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Emmys&quot;/&gt;

After his co-stars [[Jon Lovitz]], [[Dennis Miller]], Jan Hooks and [[Dana Carvey]] had left, Hartman said he felt &quot;like an athlete who's watched all his [[World Series]] teammates get traded off into other directions&amp;nbsp;... It was hard to watch them leave because I sort of felt we were all part of the team that saved the show.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;leavesnl&quot; /&gt; This cast turnover contributed to his leaving the show in 1994.&lt;ref name=&quot;cad&quot; /&gt; Hartman had originally planned to leave the show in 1991, but Michaels convinced him to stay to raise his profile; his portrayal of Clinton contributed to this goal.&lt;ref name=&quot;leavesnl&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title='SNL's' Grand Old Man—With Friends Gone, Hartman Prepares To Make His Exit|accessdate=2008-10-24|date=1993-11-23|author=Rosenthal, Phil|work=[[Los Angeles Daily News]]|page=L1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jay Leno]] offered him the role of his sidekick on ''The Tonight Show'' but Hartman opted to stay on ''SNL''.&lt;ref name=&quot;king2&quot;&gt;{{cite interview|last=Hartmann|first=John|interviewer=[[Larry King]]|callsign=[[CNN]]|city=[[Los Angeles, California]]|date=2003-02-20|program=Larry King Live|programlink=Larry King Live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;adman&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19921001&amp;slug=1516047|title=Phil Hartman Makes Like A Primo Pitchman|author=Boss, Kitt|date=1992-10-01|work=[[The Seattle Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; NBC persuaded him to stay on ''SNL'' by promising him his own comedy–variety show entitled ''The Phil Show''.&lt;ref name=&quot;cad&quot; /&gt; He planned to &quot;reinvent the variety form&quot; with &quot;a hybrid, very fast-paced, high energy [show] with sketches, impersonations, pet acts, and performers showcasing their talents&quot;.

Hartman was popular among the staff of ''The Simpsons''. [[Showrunners]] [[Bill Oakley]] and [[Josh Weinstein]] stated that they enjoyed his work, and used Hartman as much as possible when working on the show.

He died before filming of the concluding episode could take place. Executive producer [[Bonnie and Terry Turner|Terry Turner]] decided to recast the part, noting: &quot;I have far too much respect for [Hartman] to try to find some clever way of getting around this real tragedy.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ew&quot; /&gt; Hartman made a considerable amount of money from television advertising,&lt;ref name=&quot;king2&quot;/&gt; earning $300,000 for a series of four commercials for the soft drink [[Slice (soft drink)|Slice]].&lt;ref name=&quot;adman&quot;/&gt; He also appeared in advertisements for McDonalds (as Hugh McAttack) and [[MCI Communications|1-800-Collect]] (as Max Jerome).&lt;ref name=&quot;salon&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.salon.com/entertainment/tv/feature/1998/05/28feature.html|title=Phil Hartman 1948–1998|work=Salon.com|author=Millman, Joyce|date=1998-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hartman wrote a number of screenplays that were never produced.&lt;ref name=&quot;king2&quot;/&gt; In 1986, Hartman began writing a screenplay for a film entitled ''Mr. Fix-It'',&lt;ref name=&quot;newfaces&quot;/&gt; and completed the final draft in 1991. [[Robert Zemeckis]] was signed to produce the film, with Gil Bettman hired to direct. Hartman called it &quot;a sort of a merger of horror and comedy, like ''[[Beetlejuice]]'' and ''[[Throw Momma From the Train]]''&quot;, adding, &quot;It's an American nightmare about a family torn asunder. They live next to a toxic dump site, their water supply is poisoned, the mother and son go insane and try to murder each other, the father's face is torn off in a terrible disfiguring accident in the first act. It's heavy stuff, but it's got a good message and a positive, upbeat ending.&quot; Zemeckis could not secure studio backing, however, and the project collapsed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='SNL' Co-star Looking For Studio|accessdate=2009-02-07|date=1991-10-09|page=5E|work=[[Tribune Media Services]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another movie idea involving Hartman's Groundlings character Chick Hazard, Private Eye also fell through.&lt;ref name=&quot;newfaces&quot;/&gt;

In contrast to his real-life personality which was described as &quot;a regular guy and, by all accounts, one of show business' most low-key, decent people&quot;,&lt;ref name=intel&gt;{{cite news|title=His Intellect, Humanity Set Hartman Apart|date=1998-05-29|work=[[Sacramento Bee]]|author=Kushman, Rick|page=A18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hartman often played unpleasant characters or villains.&lt;ref name=nice&gt;{{cite news|title=Nice guy Phil Hartman loves playing weasels|work=[[Star Tribune]]|author=Strickler, Jeff|date=1996-11-26|page=01E}}&lt;/ref&gt; He noted that his standard character is a &quot;jerky guy&quot;, and described his usual roles as &quot;the weasel parade&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;jerk&quot;/&gt; citing McNeal, McClure and Ted Maltin from ''Jingle All the Way'' as examples.&lt;ref name=nice/&gt; Hartman enjoyed playing such roles because he &quot;just want[ed] to be funny, and villains tend to be funny because their foibles are all there to see.&quot;&lt;ref name=nice/&gt;

He often played supporting roles, rather than the lead part. He said &quot;throughout my career, I've never been a huge star, but I've made steady progress and that's the way I like it,&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;cad&quot; /&gt; and &quot;It's fun coming in as the second or third lead. If the movie or TV show bombs, you aren't to blame.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;jerk&quot;/&gt; Hartman was considered a &quot;utility player&quot; on ''SNL'' with a &quot;kind of Everyman quality&quot; which enabled him to appear in the majority of sketches, often in very distinct roles.&lt;ref name=van/&gt; [[Jan Hooks]] stated of his work on ''SNL'': &quot;Phil never had an ounce of competition. He was a team player. It was a privilege for him, I believe, to play support and do it very well. He was never insulted, no matter how small the role may have been.&quot;&lt;ref name=hooks/&gt; He was disciplined in his performances, studying the scripts beforehand. Hooks added: &quot;Phil knew how to listen. And he knew how to look you in the eye, and he knew the power of being able to lay back and let somebody else be funny, and then do the reactions. I think Phil was more of an actor than a comedian.&quot;&lt;ref name=hooks/&gt; Film critic [[Pauline Kael]] declared that &quot;Phil Hartman and Jan Hooks on ''Saturday Night Live'' are two of the best comic actors I've ever seen.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=137|title=Conversations with Pauline Kael|year=1996|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|editor=Brantley, Will|isbn=0-87805-899-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writer and acting coach Paul Ryan noted Hartman's work ethic with his impressions. He assembled a collection of video footage of the figure he was preparing to impersonate and watched this continually until he &quot;completely embodied the person.&quot; Ryan conluded that &quot;what made [Hartman's impressions] so funny and spot on was Phil's ability to add that perfect touch that only comes from trial and error and practicing in front of audiences and fellow actors.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Art of Comedy: Getting Serious About Being Funny|year=2007|publisher=Watson-Guptill|page=168|isbn=9780823084678|author=Ryan, Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hartman described this process as &quot;technical.&quot;&lt;ref name=van/&gt; As an impressionist Lyle V. Harris said Hartman had a &quot;rare talent for morphing into...anybody he wanted to be.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Whatever the role, he made it funny: Phil Hartman 1948–1998|author=Harris, Lyle V.|work=[[The Hamilton Spectator]]|date=1998-05-30|page=W11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ken Tucker summarised Hartman's comedic style: &quot;he could momentarily fool audiences into thinking he was the straight man, but then he'd cock an eyebrow and give his voice an ironic lilt that delivered a punchline like a fast slider—you barely saw it coming until you started laughing.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;kentucker&quot;/&gt; Hartman claimed that he borrowed his style from actor [[Bill Murray]]: &quot;He's been a great influence on me – when he did that smarmy thing in ''[[Ghostbusters]]'', then the same sort of thing in ''[[Groundhog Day (film)|Groundhog Day]]''. I tried to imitate it. I couldn't. I wasn't good enough. But I discovered an element of something else, so in a sick kind of way I made myself a career by doing a bad imitation of another comic.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;jerk&quot;/&gt;

==Personal life==
Hartman married Gretchen Lewis in 1970 and they divorced sometime before 1982. He married real estate agent Lisa Strain in 1982, and their marriage lasted three years. Strain told ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' that Hartman was reclusive off screen and &quot;would disappear emotionally&amp;nbsp;... he'd be in his own world. That passivity made you crazy.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;surface&quot;/&gt; Hartman married former model and aspiring actress Brynn Omdahl (born Vicki Jo Omdahl) in November 1987, having met her on a blind date the previous year.&lt;ref name=&quot;bookof&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;surface&quot;/&gt; Together they had two children, Sean and Birgen Hartman.&lt;ref name=&quot;surface&quot;/&gt; The marriage had difficulties—Brynn reportedly felt intimidated by her husband's success and was frustrated that she could not find any on her own, although neither party wanted a divorce. Hartman considered retiring to save the marriage.&lt;ref name=&quot;surface&quot;/&gt; He tried to get Brynn acting roles but she became progressively more reliant on narcotics and alcohol, entering [[Drug rehabilitation|rehab]] several times.&lt;ref name=&quot;bookof&quot;/&gt; Because of his close friendship with ''SNL'' associate [[Jan Hooks]], Brynn joked on occasion that Hooks and Hartman were married &quot;on some other level&quot;.&lt;ref name=hooks&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/entertainment/1998/06/02/1998-06-02__snl__co-star_remembers_her_.html|title='SNL' Co-Star Remembers Her Hartman|accessdate=2008-10-12|date=1998-06-12|author=Bianculli, David|work=[[New York Daily News]]|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20101113044046/http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/entertainment/1998/06/02/1998-06-02__snl__co-star_remembers_her_.html|archivedate=2010-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stephen Root]], Hartman's ''NewsRadio'' co-star, felt that few people knew &quot;the real Phil Hartman&quot; as he was &quot;one of those people who never seemed to come out of character,&quot; but he nevertheless got the impression of a family man who cared deeply for his children.&lt;ref name=must&gt;{{cite book|title=The Show Must Go On: How the Deaths of Lead Actors Have Affected Television Series|year=2008|author=Snauffer, Douglas|publisher=McFarland|isbn=9780786432950|page=162}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his spare time, Hartman enjoyed driving, flying, sailing, marksmanship and playing the guitar.&lt;ref name=&quot;ew&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bookof&quot;/&gt;

==Death==
On the evening of May 27, 1998, Brynn Hartman visited the Italian restaurant [[Buca di Beppo]] in [[Encino, California]], with producer and writer Christine Zander, who said she was &quot;in a good frame of mind&quot;. After returning to the couple's nearby home, Brynn started a &quot;heated&quot; argument with Hartman, who threatened to leave her if she started using drugs again, and went to bed.&lt;ref name= &quot;surface&quot; /&gt; While Hartman slept, Brynn entered his bedroom shortly before 3&amp;nbsp;a.m. with a .38 caliber handgun and fatally shot him twice in the head and once in his side.&lt;ref name= &quot;surface&quot; /&gt; She was intoxicated and had recently taken [[cocaine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://edition.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/TV/9806/08/brynn.hartman.drugged/ |title=Coroner: Hartman's wife on drugs, drunk|date=1998-06-08|accessdate= 2008-10-25| publisher = CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brynn drove to the home of her friend Ron Douglas and confessed to the killing but initially he did not believe her. The pair drove back to the house in separate cars after which Brynn called another friend and confessed a second time.&lt;ref name= &quot;surface&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name= &quot;cnn&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/TV/9806/02/hartman/ | title= Police say Hartman's wife told friends about shooting|accessdate=2007-06-22|date=1998-06-02|publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon seeing Hartman's body, Douglas called [[9-1-1| 911]] at 6:20&amp;nbsp;a.m.  Police subsequently arrived and escorted Douglas and the Hartmans' two children from the premises, by which time Brynn had locked herself in the bedroom and committed suicide, shooting herself once in the head.&lt;ref name= &quot;surface&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name= &quot;death&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/TV/9805/28/hartman/|title= Phil Hartman, wife die in apparent murder–suicide|accessdate=2007-05-25|date=1998-05-28|publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Los Angeles police stated Hartman's death was due to &quot;domestic discord&quot; between the couple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/TV/9805/28/hartman.update/ |title=Police: 'Domestic discord' behind Hartman slayings|accessdate= 2007-06-22 |date=1998-05-28|publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt; A friend recalled that Brynn allegedly &quot;had trouble controlling her anger...

Other causes for the incident were later suggested. Before committing the act, Brynn was taking the antidepressant drug [[Sertraline |Zoloft]]. A wrongful-death lawsuit was filed in 1999 by Brynn's brother, Gregory Omdahl, against the drug's manufacturer, [[Pfizer Inc.|Pfizer]], and her child's psychiatrist Arthur Sorosky, who provided samples of Zoloft to Brynn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Makers of Antidepressant Sued In Hartman Deaths|date= 1999-05-29|work= [[Times Union (Albany)| The Times Union]]|page=A2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hartman's friend and former ''SNL'' colleague [[Jon Lovitz]] has accused Hartman's former ''NewsRadio'' co-star [[Andy Dick]] of re-introducing Brynn to [[cocaine]], causing her to relapse and suffer a nervous breakdown.

Brynn's sister Katharine Omdahl and brother-in-law Mike Wright raised the two Hartman children.&lt;ref name=&quot;cnn&quot; /&gt; Hartman's will stipulated that each child will receive their inheritance over several years after they turn 25. The total value of Hartman's estate was estimated at $1.23&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name=&quot;cnn&quot; /&gt; In accordance with Hartman's will, his body was [[cremated]] by [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Glendale|Forest Lawn Memorial Park and Mortuary]] in [[Glendale, California]], and his ashes were scattered over [[Santa Catalina Island, California|Santa Catalina Island]]'s Emerald Bay.&lt;ref name=&quot;cnn&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/TV/9806/05/hartman/index.html|title=Family members hold private memorial for Hartmans|accessdate=2008-11-01|date=1998-06-05|publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Response and legacy===
Hartman was widely mourned in [[Hollywood, California|Hollywood]]. NBC executive [[Don Ohlmeyer]] stated that Hartman &quot;was blessed with a tremendous gift for creating characters that made people laugh. Everyone who had the pleasure of working with Phil knows that he was a man of tremendous warmth, a true professional and a loyal friend.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;death&quot; /&gt; Steve Guttenberg expressed his shock at Hartman's death, and [[Steve Martin]] said he was &quot;a deeply funny and very happy person&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;death&quot; /&gt; Matt Groening called him &quot;a master&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;ew&quot; /&gt; while director [[Joe Dante]] said, &quot;He was one of those guys who was a dream to work with. I don't know anybody who didn't like him.&quot;&lt;ref name=intel/&gt; Dan Snierson of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' concluded that Hartman was &quot;the last person you'd expect to read about in lurid headlines in your morning paper,&quot; and &quot;a decidedly regular guy, beloved by everyone he worked with&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ew&quot; /&gt; In 2007 ''Entertainment Weekly'' ranked Hartman the eighty-seventh greatest television icon of all time,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/gallery/0,,20152957_20152958_20159463_13,00.html|title=Greatest TV Icons: Nos. 100–51|accessdate=2007-12-19|work=Entertainment Weekly}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Maxim (magazine)|Maxim]]'' named Hartman the top ''Saturday Night Live'' performer of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://maximonline.com/slideshows/index.aspx?slideId=3716&amp;imgCollectId=194&amp;src=jb203|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070930165544/http://maximonline.com/slideshows/index.aspx?slideId=3716&amp;imgCollectId=194&amp;src=jb203|archivedate=2007-09-30|title=The Best Saturday Night Live Performers|accessdate=2007-12-19|work=[[Maxim (magazine)|Maxim]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Laugh.com and Hartman's brother John Hartmann published the album ''Flat TV'' in 2002. The album is a selection of comedy sketches recorded by Hartman in the 1970s which had been kept in storage until their release.
