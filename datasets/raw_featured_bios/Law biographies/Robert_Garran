'''Sir Robert Randolph Garran''' [[Order of St Michael and St George|GCMG]] [[Queen's Counsel|KC]] (10 February 1867 &amp;ndash; 11 January 1957) was an Australian lawyer and public servant, an early leading expert in [[Australian constitutional law]], the first employee of the [[Government of Australia]] and the first [[Solicitor-General of Australia]]. Garran spent thirty-one years as permanent head of the [[Attorney-General's Department (Australia)|Attorney-General's Department]], providing advice to ten different [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Ministers]] (from [[Edmund Barton|Barton]] to [[Joseph Lyons|Lyons]]). He played a significant behind-the-scenes role in the [[Federation of Australia|Australian federation movement]], as adviser to [[Edmund Barton]] and chair of the Drafting Committee at the [[Constitutional Convention (Australia)|1897–1898 Constitutional Convention]].

In addition to his professional work, Garran was also an important figure in the development of the city of [[Canberra]] during its early years. He founded several important cultural associations, organised the creation of the [[Canberra University College]], and later contributed to the establishment of the [[Australian National University]]. Garran published at least eight books and many journal articles throughout his lifetime, covering such topics as constitutional law, the history of [[federalism]] in Australia, and [[German language]] poetry.

==Early life==
Garran was born in [[Sydney]], [[New South Wales]], the only son (among seven children) of journalist and politician [[Andrew Garran]] and his wife Mary Isham. His parents were committed to [[social justice]], Mary campaigning for issues such as the promotion of education for women, and Andrew advocating [[Federation of Australia|Federation]] and covering reformist movements as editor of ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' and later promoting them as a member of the [[New South Wales Legislative Council]].&lt;ref name=&quot;companion&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last=Irving | first=Helen | title=Garran, Robert Randolph | encyclopedia=The Oxford Companion to the High Court of Australia | editor=[[Tony Blackshield|Blackshield, Tony]], [[Michael Coper|Coper, Michael]] &amp; [[George Williams (lawyer)|Williams, George]] | year=2001 | publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] | location=South Melbourne, Victoria | isbn=0-19-554022-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The family lived in [[Phillip Street, Sydney|Phillip Street]] in central Sydney. Garran's mother &quot;had a deep distrust, well justified in those days, of milkman's milk&quot; and so she kept a [[cow]] in the backyard, which would walk on its own to [[The Domain, Sydney|The Domain]] each day to graze and return twice a day to be milked.&lt;ref name=&quot;prosper p65&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author = Garran, Robert | title = Prosper the Commonwealth | page = 65}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Garrans later lived in the suburb of [[Darlinghurst, New South Wales|Darlinghurst]], just to the east of the centre of the city.

Garran attended [[Sydney Grammar School]] from the age of ten, starting in 1877. He was a successful student, and became [[School Captain]] in 1884. He then studied arts and law at the [[University of Sydney]], where he was awarded [[scholarship]]s for classics, mathematics and general academic ability.&lt;ref name=&quot;gifted knight&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Francis | first = Noel | title = The Gifted Knight: Sir Robert Garran | publisher = Noel Francis (Australia); Australian National University Press (worldwide) | year = 1983 | location = Canberra | isbn = 0-9592095-0-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Garran graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree with first-class honours in 1888, winning the University's Medal in Philosophy, and a Bachelor of Laws degree in 1889.&lt;ref name=&quot;gifted knight&quot; /&gt;

After graduating, Garran began to study for the Bar examination. He was employed for a year with a firm of Sydney [[solicitor]]s, and the next year served as associate to Justice [[William Charles Windeyer]] of the [[Supreme Court of New South Wales]].&lt;ref name=&quot;gifted knight&quot; /&gt; Windeyer had a reputation for being a harsh and inflexible judge, particularly in criminal cases, where he was said to have &quot;a rigorous and unrelenting sense of the retribution that he believed criminal justice demanded, [and] a sympathy verging on the emotional for the victims of crime.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB Windeyer&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title =  Windeyer, Sir William Charles (1834–1897) | encyclopedia = Australian Dictionary of Biography | volume = 6 | pages = 420–422 | publisher = Melbourne University Press | location = Carlton | year = 1976 | url = http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A060452b.htm | accessdate = 15 September 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Garran however offered a different view, saying that &quot;those who knew him well knew that under a brusque exterior he was the kindest of men&quot;, and his reputation had to some degree been created by misrepresentation.&lt;ref name=&quot;prosper p78&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author = Garran, Robert | title = Prosper the Commonwealth | page = 78 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1891, Garran was admitted to the [[New South Wales Bar]], where he commenced practice as a [[barrister]], primarily working in [[Equity (law)|equity]].

==Federation movement==

[[Image:Andrew Garran.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Portrait of Andrew Garran, Robert's father, in 1896.]]

Garran, like his father, was strongly involved in the [[Federation of Australia|Australian Federation movement]], the movement which sought to unite the [[British colonies]] in Australia (and, in early proposals, New Zealand) into one [[federation|federated]] [[country]]. The first [[Constitutional Convention (Australia)|Constitutional Convention]] was held in 1891 in the chamber of the [[Legislative Council of New South Wales]] in [[Macquarie Street, Sydney]], around the corner from Garran's chambers in Phillip Street; Garran regularly attended and sat in the public gallery to see &quot;history... in the making under my very eyes.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;prosper p92&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author = Garran, Robert | title = Prosper the Commonwealth | page = 92 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Garran would later recall with approval that the 1891 convention was the first with the courage to face the &quot;lion in the path&quot;, the issue of [[customs]] duties and [[tariff]]s, which had previously divided states such as [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], who were in favour of [[protectionism]], and states such as [[New South Wales]], who were in favour of [[free trade]]. In Garran's view a clause proposed at the convention, which allowed for tariffs against international trade while ensuring free trade domestically (the predecessor to the final [[section 92 of the Australian Constitution]]), &quot;expressed the terms on which New South Wales was prepared to face the lion.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;prosper p96-97&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author = Garran, Robert | title = Prosper the Commonwealth | pages = 96–97 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Garran became involved with the work of [[Edmund Barton]], who would later be the first [[Prime Minister of Australia]] but at the time was the ''[[de facto]]'' leader of the federation movement in New South Wales as Sir [[Henry Parkes]] declined into poor health. Garran, along with others such as [[Atlee Hunt]], worked essentially as secretaries to Barton's federation campaign, drafting correspondence and planning meetings. At one late night meeting, planning a speech Barton was to give in the Sydney suburb of [[Ashfield, New South Wales|Ashfield]], Barton coined the phrase &quot;For the first time, we have a nation for a continent, and a continent for a nation&quot;; Garran recalled that the now famous phrase &quot;would have been unrecorded if I had not happened to jot it down.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;prosper p101&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author = Garran, Robert | title = Prosper the Commonwealth | page = 101 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1893, when the [[Australasian Federal League]] was formed at a meeting in the [[Sydney Town Hall]], Garran joined immediately and was made a member of the executive committee. He was one of the League's four delegates to the 1893 [[Corowa Conference]] and a League delegate to the 1896 [[Bathurst Conference]], informal conferences held between members of the League (primarily based in Sydney), the [[Australian Natives Association]] (mainly Victorian) and other pro-federation groups.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot; /&gt; At Corowa he was part of an impromptu group organised by [[John Quick (politician)|John Quick]] which drafted a resolution, passed at the Conference, calling on the colonial parliaments to hold a directly elected [[Constitutional Convention (Australia)|Constitutional Convention]] to be charged with drafting the Bill for the [[Constitution of Australia]]. The proposal, which came to be known as the Corowa Plan, was later accepted at the 1895 Premiers' Conference and formed the basis for the federation process over the following five years.&lt;ref name=&quot;prosper p104&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author = Garran, Robert | title = Prosper the Commonwealth | page = 104 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1897, Garran published ''The Coming Commonwealth'',&lt;ref name=&quot;coming Cth&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Garran | first = Robert | title = The coming Commonwealth: an Australian handbook of federal government | publisher = [[Angus &amp; Robertson]] | year = 1897 | location = Sydney }}&lt;/ref&gt; an influential book on the history of the Federation movement and the debate over the 1891 draft of the Constitution of Australia. The book was based on material he prepared for a course on [[federalism]] and federal systems of government, which he had planned to give at the University of Sydney, but which failed to attract a sufficient number of students.&lt;ref name=&quot;companion&quot; /&gt; Nevertheless, the book was both unique and popular, as one of the few books on the topic at the time, with the first edition quickly selling out. Soon after its publication the [[Premier of New South Wales]] [[George Reid (Australian politician)|George Reid]], who had been elected as a New South Wales delegate to the 1897–1898 Constitutional Convention, invited Garran to be his secretary. At the Convention, Reid appointed him secretary of the Drafting Committee, at Barton's request; he was also a member of the Press Committee.&lt;ref name=&quot;NLA gateway&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = GARRAN, SIR ROBERT RANDOLPH (1867–1957) | work = National Library of Australia's Federation Gateway | url = http://www.nla.gov.au/guides/federation/people/garran.html | accessdate = 20 July 2006 | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060708000619/http://www.nla.gov.au/guides/federation/people/garran.html &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt; | archivedate = 8 July 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Garran recorded in a letter to his family during the convention's [[Melbourne]] sitting that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;The committee professes to find me very useful in unravelling the conundrums sent down by the finance committee... The last two nights I have found the drafting committee fagged [tired] and despairing, and now they have pitched the conundrums at me and gone out for a smoke; and then I worked out [[algebra]]ic formulas to clear the thing up, drafted clauses accordingly, and when the committee returned we had plain sailing.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;prosper p119-120&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author = Garran, Robert | title = Prosper the Commonwealth | pages = 119–120 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Garran joked that the long work of the drafting committee breached the ''[[Factory Acts]]'', the group (primarily Barton, [[Richard O'Connor (Australian politician)|Richard O'Connor]], [[John Downer]] and Garran) often working late into the night preparing drafts for the convention to consider and debate the next morning. On the evening before the convention's last day, Barton had gone to bed exhausted in the small hours, Garran and [[Charles Gavan Duffy]] finishing the final schedule of amendments at breakfast time.&lt;ref name=&quot;prosper p122&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author = Garran, Robert | title = Prosper the Commonwealth | page = 122 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The convention concluded successfully, approving a final draft which would ultimately, aside from a small amendment arranged at the last minute in [[London]], become the Constitution of Australia.

Throughout 1898, following the completion of the proposed Constitution, Garran participated in the campaign promoting Federation leading up to the referendums at which the people of the colonies voted whether or not to approve the Constitution. He contributed a daily column to the ''[[Sydney Evening News|Evening News]]'', and had humorous poems critiquing opponents of federation published in ''[[The Bulletin]]''. The following year, he began working with Quick on the ''Annotated Constitution of the Australian Commonwealth'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The annotated constitution of the Australian Commonwealth (1901)|url=http://www.archive.org/details/annotatedconstit00quicuoft|accessdate=2011-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;annotated con&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author = Quick, John &amp; Garran, Robert | title = The Annotated Constitution of the Australian Commonwealth | publisher = [[Angus &amp; Robertson]] | year = 1901 | location = Sydney | id = | isbn = 0959656804  }}&lt;/ref&gt; a reference work on the Constitution including a history, and detailed discussion of each section analysing its meaning and its development at the Conventions. Published in 1901, the ''Annotated Constitution'', commonly referred to simply as &quot;Quick &amp; Garran&quot;, soon became the standard work on the Constitution and is still regarded as one of the most important works on the subject.&lt;ref name=&quot;companion&quot; /&gt;

==Public service==

On the day that Federation was completed and Australia created, 1 January 1901, Garran was made a Commander of the [[Order of St Michael and St George]] (CMG),&lt;ref name=&quot;honour roll&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Robert Garran CMG | url=http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=1066381&amp;search_type=quick&amp;showInd=true | publisher=Australian Honours Database | accessdate=12 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was appointed secretary and Permanent Head of the [[Attorney-General's Department (Australia)|Attorney-General's Department]] by the first [[Attorney-General of Australia]], [[Alfred Deakin]]. Garran was the first, and for a time the only, public servant employed by the [[Government of Australia]]. Garran later said of this time that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;I was not only the head [of the department], but the tail. I was my own clerk and messenger. My first duty was to write out with my own hand [[Commonwealth of Australia Gazette|Commonwealth Gazette]] No. 1 proclaiming the establishment of the Commonwealth and the appointment of ministers of state, and to send myself down with it to the government printer.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;armchair chat&quot;&gt;{{cite web | author = Rayner, Michelle | title = Sir Robert Garran: a memoir of federation  | work = Australian Broadcasting Corporation | date = 1950s | url = http://www.abc.net.au/ourplace/national/garran.htm | accessdate = 20 July 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In this role, Garran was responsible for organising the [[Australian federal election, 1901|first federal election]] in March 1901, and for organising the transfer of various government departments from [[states and territories of Australia|the states]] to the federal government, including the [[Department of Defence (Australia)|Department of Defence]], the [[mail|postal]] and [[telegraph]]ic services (now part of the [[Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts (Australia)|Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts]]) and the Department of Trade and Customs (now part of the [[Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Australia)|Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade]]). As parliamentary drafter, Garran also developed legislation to administer those new departments and other important legislation.

Garran and his fellow staff aimed for a simple style of legislative drafting, a goal enabled by the fact that there was no pre-existing federal legislation on which their work would have to be based. In Garran's opinion the approach, which was put into practice many years before the similarly principled [[plain English]] movement became popular in government in the 1970s, was intended &quot;to set an example of clear, straightforward language, free from technical [[jargon]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;prosper p145&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author = Garran, Robert | title = Prosper the Commonwealth | page = 145 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent parliamentary drafters have noted that Garran was unusual in this respect for deliberately setting out to achieve and improve a particular drafting style, and that it was not until the early 1980s that such discipline among drafters re-emerged.&lt;ref name=&quot;penfold words&quot;&gt;{{cite conference | first = Hilary | last = Penfold | title = When words aren't enough: Graphics and other innovations in legislative drafting | booktitle = Language and the Law Conference, University of Texas at Austin | publisher = Office of Parliamentary Counsel | date = 6 December to 8 December 2001 | url = http://www.opc.gov.au/plain/docs/words_arent_enough.rtf | format = {{RTFlink}} | accessdate = 11 December 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Garran himself admitted that his drafting could be overly simplistic, citing the first customs and excise legislation (the ''[[Customs Act 1901]]'' and the ''[[Excise Act 1901]]''), developed with the Minister for Trade and Customs [[Charles Kingston]], as an example of the style taken to excess.&lt;ref name=&quot;prosper p145&quot; /&gt; The style was also once [[parody|parodied]] by foundation [[High Court of Australia|High Court]] Justice [[Richard O'Connor (Australian politician)|Richard O'Connor]] as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;Every man shall wear &amp;ndash;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp; (a) Coat&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp; (b) Vest&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp; (c) Trousers&lt;br /&gt;
Penalty: £100.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;armchair chat&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1902, Garran married Hilda Robson. Together they would have four sons, Richard (born 1903), [[John Garran|John]] (1905), Andrew (1906) and [[Peter Garran|Isham Peter]] (1910). At this time the family lived in [[Melbourne]], and the boys all attended [[Melbourne Grammar School]] and later studied at the [[University of Melbourne]], attending [[Trinity College (University of Melbourne)|Trinity College]] there.

The Attorney-General's Department also managed [[litigation]] on behalf of the government. Initially the department contracted private [[law firm]]s to actually conduct the litigation, but in 1903 the office of the [[Commonwealth Crown Solicitor]] was established, with [[Charles Powers]] the first to hold the job. The other Crown Solicitors that Garran worked with included [[Gordon Castle]] (with whom he had also worked as a drafter) and [[William Sharwood]].

Garran worked with several Attorneys-General as Permanent Head of the Department. Garran regarded the first Attorney-General, Alfred Deakin, as an excellent thinker and a natural lawyer, and on occasion &quot;[spoke] of Deakin as the [[Arthur Balfour|Balfour]] of Australian politics.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;prosper p156&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author = Garran, Robert | title = Prosper the Commonwealth | page = 156 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also very much impressed with the fifth Attorney-General, [[Isaac Isaacs]], who was an extremely diligent worker, and two time Attorney-General [[Littleton Groom]], who was &quot;probably one of the most useful Ministers the Commonwealth has had.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;prosper p158&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author = Garran, Robert | title = Prosper the Commonwealth | page = 158 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1912, Garran was considered as a possible appointee to the High Court, following the expansion of the bench from five seats to seven and the death of Richard O'Connor. [[Billy Hughes]], Attorney-General in the [[Andrew Fisher|Fisher]] government at the time, later said Garran would have been appointed &quot;but for the fact that he is too valuable a man for us to lose. We cannot spare him.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;companion&quot; /&gt;

===Solicitor-General===

In 1916, Garran was made the first [[Solicitor-General of Australia]] (the office was then known as Commonwealth Solicitor-General) by Billy Hughes, who had since become Prime Minister. The creation of the office and Garran's appointment to it was to some degree recognition of his existing role as Permanent Head of the Attorney-General's Department, in which Garran gave legal advice to several successive governments,&lt;ref name=&quot;gifted knight&quot; /&gt; but it also represented a formal delegation of many of the powers and functions formerly exercised by the Attorney-General.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot; /&gt;

Garran developed a strong relationship with Hughes, giving him legal advice on the [[World War I]] [[Conscription in Australia#World War I|conscription plebiscites]] and on the range of [[regulation]]s which were made under the ''[[War Precautions Act 1914]]''. The ''War Precautions Regulations'' had a broad scope, and were generally supported by the High Court, which adopted a much more flexible approach to the reach of the Commonwealth's [[Section 51(vi) of the Australian Constitution|defence power]] during wartime. A substantial amount of Garran's work during the war involved preparing and carrying out the regulations. Many of them were directed at maximising the economic aspect of the war effort and ensuring supplies of goods to Australian troops; others were directed at controlling citizens or former citizens of the enemy [[Central Powers]] living in Australia. On one occasion, when Hughes had been informed that at a party hosted by a [[Germans|German]] man, the band had played &quot;[[Das Lied der Deutschen]]&quot;, Hughes asked Garran &quot;By the way, what is this tune?&quot; to which Garran replied that it was [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]]'s melody to &quot;[[Gott erhalte Franz den Kaiser]]&quot;, and as it was used as the tune to several [[hymn]]s &quot;it was probably sung in half a dozen churches in Sydney last Sunday.&quot; Hughes then said &quot;Good Heavens! I have played that thing with one finger hundreds of times.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;prosper p223&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author = Garran, Robert | title = Prosper the Commonwealth | page = 223 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The partnership between Garran and Hughes is regarded by some as unusual, given that Garran was &quot;tall, gentlemanly, wise and scholarly&quot;, and patient with his staff, whereas Hughes was &quot;short of stature [and] renowned for bursts of temper.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;gifted knight&quot; /&gt; Nevertheless, the partnership was a successful one, with Hughes recognising the importance of Garran's constitutional expertise, remarking once about the World War I period that &quot;the best way to govern Australia was to have Sir Robert Garran at [my] elbow, with a fountain pen and a blank sheet of paper, and the ''War Precautions Act''.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last = Parker | first = R.S. | title = Garran, Sir Robert Randolph (1867–1957) | encyclopedia = Australian Dictionary of Biography | volume = 8 | pages = 622–625 | publisher = Melbourne University Press | location = Carlton | year = 1981 | url = http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A080638b.htm | accessdate = 20 July 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, Garran respected Hughes' strong leadership style, which had been important in guiding the country through the war, although in describing the [[Nationalist Party of Australia|Nationalist Party]]'s loss in the [[Australian federal election, 1922|1922 federal election]], Garran later said that &quot;Hughes also overestimated his own hold on Parliament [although] his hold on the people was probably undiminished.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;prosper p280&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author = Garran, Robert | title = Prosper the Commonwealth | page = 280 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Garran accompanied Hughes and [[Joseph Cook]] (then the Minister for the Navy) to the 1917 and 1918 meetings of the [[Imperial War Cabinet]] in [[London]], United Kingdom, and was also part of the [[British Empire]] delegation to the 1919 [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] in [[Paris]], France. There he was on several of the treaty drafting committees, and contributed to many provisions, notably the portions of the [[League of Nations]] Covenant relating to [[League of Nations mandate]]s. Though focusing mainly on League of Nations matters, Garran and [[John Latham (Australian jurist)|John Latham]] (the head of Australian Naval Intelligence) had the status of technical advisers to Hughes and Cook, and so could attend the main conference and any of the associated councils. Observing the proceedings, Garran admired the &quot;moral and physical courage&quot; of French premier [[Georges Clemenceau]], whom he regarded as determined to protect France from Germany but in a measured and temperate way; in Garran's words, Clemenceau &quot;always withstood the excessive demands of the French chauvinists, of the French army, and of [[Ferdinand Foch|Foch]] himself.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;prosper p260&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author = Garran, Robert | title = Prosper the Commonwealth | page = 260 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Garran viewed some similarities between [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] [[David Lloyd George]] and [[President of the United States|United States President]] [[Woodrow Wilson]] where others saw only differences, since Lloyd George &quot;also had a strong vein of idealism in his character&quot;, and Wilson could be pragmatic when the situation called for it, such as in discussions relating to American interests.&lt;ref name=&quot;prosper p262&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author = Garran, Robert | title = Prosper the Commonwealth | page = 262 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Garran also met other political and military leaders at the conference, including [[T. E. Lawrence]], &quot;an [[Jesus College, Oxford|Oxford]] youth of 29 &amp;ndash; he looks 18&quot;, who was modest and &quot;without any affectation... in a company of two or three [he] could talk very interestingly, but at a larger gathering he was apt to be dumb.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;prosper p264&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author = Garran, Robert | title = Prosper the Commonwealth | page = 264 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Garran house.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The Garran family house in Canberra, 22 Mugga Way, [[Red Hill, Australian Capital Territory|Red Hill]].]]

Following the war, Garran worked with Professor [[Harrison Moore]] of the University of Melbourne and [[South Australia]]n judge Professor [[Jethro Brown]] on a report about proposed constitutional amendments which ultimately became the referendum questions put forward in the [[Australian referendum, 1919|1919 referendum]]. Garran had been made a [[Knight Bachelor]] in 1917&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sir Robert Garran|url=http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=1083302&amp;search_type=quick&amp;showInd=true|publisher=Australian Honours Database|accessdate=12 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was appointed as a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) in 1920.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Robert Garran KCMG|url=http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=1082580&amp;search_type=quick&amp;showInd=true|publisher=Australian Honours Database|accessdate=12 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Garran attended two [[Imperial Conference]]s, accompanying Prime Minister [[Stanley Bruce]] in 1923 and in 1930 joining Prime Minister [[James Scullin]] and Attorney-General [[Frank Brennan (Australian politician)|Frank Brennan]], chair of the Drafting Committee which prepared drafts of agreements on various topics, such as [[merchant shipping]]. He also attended the eleventh League of Nations conference that year with them in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]]. At the [[Royal Commission on the Constitution (Australia)|Royal Commission on the Constitution]] in 1927, Garran was invited to give evidence by Prime Minister Bruce, where he discussed the history and origins of the Constitution and the evolution of the institutions established under it.

Through the 1920s and early 1930s, Garran prepared annual summaries of legislative developments in Australia, highlighting important individual pieces of legislation for the ''Journal of Comparative Legislation and International Law'' (now known as the [[International and Comparative Law Quarterly]]) published by [[Oxford University Press]].&lt;ref name=&quot;JCLIL&quot;&gt;For example, {{cite journal | last = Garran | first = Robert | title = Commonwealth of Australia | journal = Journal of Comparative Legislation and International Law | volume = 1930 | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 1930 | id = OCLC 1680994 | accessdate = 10 December 2006 }} and {{cite journal | last = Garran | first = Robert | title = Commonwealth of Australia | journal = Journal of Comparative Legislation and International Law | volume = 1932 | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 1932 | id = OCLC 1680994 | accessdate = 10 December 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Towards the end of his time as Solicitor-General, Garran's work included the preparation of the Debt Conversion Agreement between the Government of Australia and the governments of [[states and territories of Australia|the states]], which involved the federal government taking over and managing the debts of the individual states, following the [[Australian referendum, 1928|1928 referendum]].&lt;ref name=&quot;prosper p336-338&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author = Garran, Robert | title = Prosper the Commonwealth | pages = 336–338 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1927, Garran had moved from his home in [[Melbourne]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] to the newly established capital [[Canberra]], one of the first public officials to do so (many government departments and their public servants did not move to Canberra until after [[World War II]]). He also worked within the Government to facilitate housing in Canberra for officials moving from other cities, and was involved in establishing cultural organisations in the city. In 1928 he was the inaugural President of the Canberra [[Rotary International|Rotary Club]]. In 1929, he formed the [[Canberra University Association]] in order to promote the formation of a university in Canberra, and in 1930 organised the establishment of [[Canberra University College]] (essentially a campus of the [[University of Melbourne]]) which taught undergraduate courses, chairing its council for its first twenty-three years. Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, Garran &quot;consistently advocated the establishment of what he prophetically called 'a National University at Canberra' &quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot; /&gt; which would be primarily for specialist research and [[postgraduate]] study, in areas particularly relating to Australia, such as foreign relations with Asia and the Pacific region.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot; /&gt; This vision was evidently influential on the establishment of the [[Australian National University]] (ANU) in 1946,&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot; /&gt; the only research-only university in the country (although in 1960 it amalgamated with Canberra University College to offer undergraduate courses).&lt;ref name=&quot;merger anu cuc&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Canberra University College 1930–1960 | work = Information Services @ ANU | publisher = Australian National University  | url = http://information.anu.edu.au/daisy/infoservices/279.html | accessdate = 10 April 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Retirement==

[[Image:Canberra Rotary 1928.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The presentation of the Charter of the Canberra Rotary Club, 1928, at the Hotel Canberra. Garran is seated, front centre.]]

Garran retired from his governmental positions on 9 February 1932, a fixed retirement date on the day before his sixty-fifth birthday. He soon returned to practise as a barrister, and within a month he was made a [[King's Counsel]] (KC). However, he occasionally carried out more prominent work. In 1932, he was selected on the advice of now Attorney-General John Latham to chair the [[Indian Defence Expenditure Tribunal]], to advise on the dispute between India and the United Kingdom regarding the costs of the military defence of India. In 1934, along with [[John Keating (Australian politician)|John Keating]], [[William Somerville (Australian politician)|William Somerville]] and [[David John Gilbert]], he formed a committee which prepared ''The Case for Union'',&lt;ref name=&quot;case for union&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author = Garran, Robert et al. | title = The Case for union : a reply to the case for the secession of the state of Western Australia | publisher = Government Printer | year = 1934 | location = Canberra }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Government of Australia]]'s official reply to [[Secessionism in Western Australia|the secessionist movement]] in the state of [[Western Australia]].

Garran was also involved with the arts; he was the vice-president of the Canberra Musical Society, where he sang and played the [[clarinet]], and in 1946 won a national song competition run by the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;companion&quot; /&gt; Garran also published translations of [[Heinrich Heine]]'s 1827 work ''Buch der Lieder'' (&quot;Book of Songs&quot;) in 1924,&lt;ref name=&quot;book of songs&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author = Heine, Heinrich; translated by Garran, Robert | title = The book of songs | publisher = Keating-Wood | year = 1924 | location = Melbourne }}&lt;/ref&gt; and of the works of [[Franz Schubert]] and [[Robert Schumann]] in 1946.&lt;ref name=&quot;schu&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author = Garran, Robert | title = Schubert and Schumann : songs and translations | publisher = Melbourne University Press | year = 1946 | location = Melbourne }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1937, Garran was made a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George (GCMG),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Robert Garran GCMG|url=http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=1073796&amp;search_type=quick&amp;showInd=true|publisher=Australian Honours Database|accessdate=12 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; the third time he had been knighted. Shortly after the establishment of the ANU in 1946, Garran became its first graduate when he was awarded an [[honorary degree|honorary doctorate]] of laws. He had already been awarded such an honorary doctorate from the University of Melbourne in 1937 and later receiving one from his [[alma mater]], the University of Sydney in 1952. Garran served on ANU's council from 1946 until 1951. Garran's influence on Canberra is remembered by the naming of the suburb of [[Garran, Australian Capital Territory]], and his link with ANU is remembered by the naming of a [[chair (official)|chair]] in the university's School of Law, by the naming of the hall of residence [[Burton &amp; Garran Hall]] and by the naming of Garran house at [[Canberra Grammar School]] for his work with that school. 

Garran died in 1957 in Canberra. He was granted a [[state funeral]], the first given to a public servant of the Government of Australia.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot; /&gt; He was survived by his four sons; his wife Hilda had died in 1936. His [[memoir]]s, ''Prosper the Commonwealth'',&lt;ref name=&quot;prosper&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author = Garran, Robert | title = Prosper the Commonwealth}}&lt;/ref&gt; were published posthumously in 1958, having been completed shortly before his death.

==Legacy==

[[Image:Garran 1944.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Garran at [[ANZAC Day]] celebrations at the [[cenotaph]] in [[Martin Place, Sydney]], 25 April 1944.]]

Garran's &quot;personality, like his prose, was devoid of pedantry and pomposity and, though dignified, was laced with a quizzical turn of humour.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot; /&gt; His death &quot;marked the end of a generation of public men for whom the cultural and the political were natural extensions of each other and who had the skills and talents to make such connections effortlessly.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;companion&quot; /&gt; At his death, Garran was one of the last remaining of the people involved with the creation of the Constitution of Australia.

Former Prime Minister [[John Howard]], in describing Garran, said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;I wonder though if we sometimes underestimate the changes, excitements, disruptions and adjustments previous generations have experienced. Sir Robert Garran knew the promise and reality of federation. He was part of the establishment of a public service which, in many ways, is clearly recognisable today.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;howard&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last = Howard | first = John | authorlink = John Howard | title = The 1997 Sir Robert Garran Oration | work = Prime Minister of Australia | date = 19 November 1997 | url = http://www.ipaa.org.au/_dbase_upl/1997%20Garran%20Oration.pdf | accessdate = 19 April 2012 | format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Garran's friend [[Charles Daley]], a long time civic administrator of the [[Australian Capital Territory]], emphasised Garran's contribution to the early development of the city of Canberra, particularly its cultural life, remarking at a celebratory dinner for Garran in 1954 that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;There has hardly been a cultural movement in this city with which Sir Robert has not been identified in loyal and inspiring support, as his constant aim has been that Canberra should be not only a great political centre but also a shrine to foster those things that stimulate and enrich our national life... his name will ever be inscribed in the annals, not only of Canberra, but of the Commonwealth as ''clarum et venerabile nomen gentibus''.&lt;ref name=&quot;gifted knight&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;daley quote lucan&quot;&gt;Daley quotes [[Marcus Annaeus Lucanus|Lucan]]'s epic poem ''[[Pharsalia]]''; the phrase may be translated as &quot;Among the people his name is honoured and distinguished.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However Garran is perhaps best remembered as an expert on constitutional law, more so than for his other contributions to public service. On his experience of Federation and the Constitution, Garran was always enthusiastic:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;I'm often asked 'has federation turned out as you expected?' Well yes and no. By and large the sort of thing we expected has happened but with differences. We knew the constitution was not perfect; it had to be a compromise with all the faults of a compromise... But, in spite of the unforeseen [sic] strains and stresses, the constitution has worked, on the whole, much as we thought it would. I think it now needs revision, to meet the needs of a changed world. But no-one could wish the work undone, who tries to imagine, what, in these stormy days, would have been the plight of six disunited Australian colonies.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;armchair chat&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Memorials ===
The [[Canberra]] suburb of [[Garran, Australian Capital Territory|Garran]], established in 1966,  was named after him.

In 1983, the former Patent Office building - now occupied by the Federal Attorney General's Department - was renamed Robert Garran Offices.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aussieheritage.com.au/listings/act/Barton/PatentOfficeformer/2316 Patent Office (former)], accessed 16 June 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The [[art deco]] building is within the [[Parliamentary Triangle]] of Canberra, and was constructed in 1932 at the corner of [[Kings Avenue, Canberra|Kings Avenue]] and [[National Circuit, Canberra|National Circuit]], in [[Parkes, Australian Capital Territory]].
