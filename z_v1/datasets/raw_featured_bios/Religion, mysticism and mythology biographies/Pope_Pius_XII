'''The Venerable Pope Pius XII''' ({{lang-la|Pius PP. XII}}; {{lang-it|Pio XII}}), born '''Eugenio Marìa Giuseppe Giovanni Pacelli''' (2 March 1876 – 9 October 1958), reigned as [[Pope]], head of the Catholic Church and [[monarch|sovereign]] of [[Vatican City]] State, from 2 March 1939 until his death in 1958.

Before [[papal conclave|election]] to the papacy, Pacelli served as secretary of the [[Department of Extraordinary Ecclesiastical Affairs]], papal [[nuncio]] and [[Cardinal Secretary of State]], in which capacity he worked to conclude treaties with European and Latin American nations, most notably the ''[[Reichskonkordat]]'' with [[Nazi Germany]]. The concordat of 1933 which saw the self-destruction of the [[Centre Party (Germany)|Centre (Catholic) Party]], on the orders of the Holy See, and Pius' leadership of the Catholic Church during World War II, including his &quot;decision to stay silent in public about the fate of the Jews&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Introduction, Gerard Noel, ''Pius XII,The Hound of Hitler''-, and  &lt;small&gt;&quot;brief phases of reassurance about the role of the Pope were followed by waves of critical literature[-] and counteracted the process of exoneration that had been underway for some years. The focus of recent analyses by John Cornwell via Michael Phayer, Susan Zucotti, Daniel J. Goldhagen, and Giovanni Miccoli, as well as works by authors Matteo Napolitano and Andrea Torniello, is once again about the Pope's silence about the murder of Jews in Europe -the papal archives could provide information about Vatican diplomacy between 1933 and 1945; however, the Vatican remains the only European state that withholds free access to its archives from contemporary historians. The archives of these years are crucial if many questions about the Holocaust and the Second World War are to be answered and if the  many uncertainties concerning Nazi refugee assistance by the Vatican are to be removed.&quot;  (Gerald Steinacher:Nazis on the Run, p. 105)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; remain the subject of controversy.

After the war Pius XII advocated peace and reconciliation, including lenient policies towards Axis and Axis-satellite nations. The Church experienced severe persecution and mass deportations of Catholic clergy in the [[Eastern Bloc]]. In light of his overt involvement in Italian politics – anyone who voted for a Communist candidate in the 1948 elections was threatened with automatic [[excommunication]] – Pius XII became known as a staunch opponent of the [[Italian Communist Party]]. Pius XII explicitly invoked ''[[ex cathedra]]'' [[papal infallibility]] with the [[Dogma (Roman Catholic)|dogma]] of the [[Assumption of Mary]] in his 1950 [[Apostolic constitution]] ''[[Munificentissimus Deus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of Catholicism'' by Frank K. Flinn, J. Gordon Melton; ISBN 081605455X, p. 267&lt;/ref&gt; His [[magisterium]] includes almost 1,000 addresses and radio broadcasts. His [[List of encyclicals of Pope Pius XII|forty-one encyclicals]] include ''[[Mystici Corporis]]'', the Church as the Body of Christ; ''[[Mediator Dei]]'' on liturgy reform; and ''[[Humani generis]]'' on the Church's positions on [[theology]] and [[evolution]]. He eliminated the Italian majority in the [[College of Cardinals]] in 1946.

==Early life==
{{Main|Early life of Pope Pius XII}}
Eugenio Marìa Giuseppe Giovanni Pacelli was born on 2 March 1876 in Rome into a family of intense Catholic piety with a history of ties to the papacy (the &quot;[[Black Nobility]]&quot;). His parents were Filippo Pacelli (1837–1916) and Virginia (née Graziosi) Pacelli (1844–1920). His grandfather, Marcantonio Pacelli, had been Under-Secretary in the Papal Ministry of Finances&lt;ref&gt;Pollard, 2005, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; and then Secretary of the Interior under [[Pope Pius IX]] from 1851–70 and helped found the Vatican's newspaper, ''[[L'Osservatore Romano]]'' in 1861.&lt;ref&gt;Marchione, 2004, p.1.; Gerard Noel, Pius XII:The Hound of Hitler, p.5&lt;/ref&gt; His cousin, [[Ernesto Pacelli]], was a key financial advisor to [[Pope Leo XIII]]; his father, Filippo Pacelli, a [[Franciscan]] [[Third order|tertiary]],&lt;ref&gt;O'Brian, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; was the dean of the [[Sacra Rota Romana]]; and his brother, [[Francesco Pacelli]], became a [[Laity|lay]] [[canon law]]yer and the legal advisor to [[Pius XI]], in which role he negotiated the [[Lateran Treaty]] in 1929, the pact with [[Benito Mussolini]], bringing an end to the [[Roman Question]].
[[File:Eugenio1882.jpg|upright|thumb|left|Eugenio Pacelli at the age of six in 1882]]

Together with his brother Francesco and his two sisters, Giuseppina and Elisabetta, he grew up in the centre of Rome. Having attended a kindergarten run by two nuns, and then a private Catholic elementary school, in two rooms of a building close to the [[Piazza Venezia]],&lt;ref&gt;''Hitler's Pope'', John Cornwell, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; by the age of ten he was enrolled at the Liceo Ennio Quirino Visconti Institute. This was a state school situated in the [[Collegio Romano]], former site of the Jesuit university in Rome, and was animated by a generally [[anti-Catholic]] and anticlerical spirit.&lt;ref&gt;Cornwell, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; He was an [[altar boy]] at the [[Santa Maria in Vallicella|Chiesa Nuova]] and his preferred play as a youth was to act out the celebration of Mass in his bedroom. One year he played out the entire [[Holy Week]] ceremonies. He liked music, particularly [[Beethoven]], [[J.S. Bach]], [[Mozart]] and [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]], and read [[Dante]], [[Alessandro Manzoni]] and [[Cicero]].  His favourite spiritual reading at this time was [[Thomas à Kempis]]'s ''[[Imitation of Christ]]'' and other religious reading included [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]] and the work of the seventeenth century French bishop [[Jacques-Bénigne Bossuet|Bossuet]]. Bossuet remained an influence throughout his life.&lt;ref&gt;Cornwell, pp. 19-20&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1894, aged 18, Pacelli began his theology studies at the prestigious Tridentine Collegio Capranica Seminary, and in November of the same year, registered to take a philosophy course at the Jesuit Gregoriana University. At the end of the first academic year however, in the summer of 1895, he dropped out of both the Capranica and the Gregorian University. According to his sister Elisabetta, the food at the Capranica was to blame.&lt;ref&gt;Cornwell, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;  Having received a special dispensation he continued his studies from home under the faculty of the Seminarium Romanum located in the Palazzo Sant'Appollinaire, later the Lateran University. From 1895-96, he studied philosophy at [[University of Rome La Sapienza]]. At home he wore his [[soutane]] and Roman collar throughout the day and continued to be influenced  by Father Giuseppe Lais, an [[Oratorian]] priest, a figure who had watched over Pacelli's religious progress since the age of eight. In 1899 he completed his education in &quot;Sacred Theology&quot; with a doctoral degree awarded on the basis of a short dissertation and an oral examination in [[Latin]].&lt;ref&gt;Cornwell, p.23&lt;/ref&gt;

==Church career==
===Priest and Monsignor===
[[File:Pacelliordenado.jpg|thumb|upright|Pacelli on the day of his ordination, 2 April 1899;apart from his post-ordination studies, the young priest did some part-time work in the field of [[pastoral care]]-spiritual counsellor to pupils of the Cenacle Convent in Rome, as well as a regular visitor to the Convent of the Assumption. These duties  encompassed the only pastoral work he performed during his entire career in the Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gerard Noel, p.10&quot;&gt;G. Noel, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;]]
While all other candidates from the Rome diocese were ordained in the [[Basilica of St. John Lateran]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Gerard Noel, p.9&quot;&gt;Gerard Noel, p.9&lt;/ref&gt; Pacelli was [[Holy Orders|ordained]] a priest on [[Easter Sunday]], 2 April 1899, alone in the private oratory of an auxiliary bishop of Rome, by Bishop [[Francesco di Paola Cassetta]], vice-regent of Rome and a family friend. Pacelli received his first assignment as a [[curate]] at [[Santa Maria in Vallicella|Chiesa Nuova]].&lt;ref name=&quot;marchione193&quot;&gt;Marchione, 2000, p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1901 he was brought into the Vatican bureaucracy and entered the [[Congregation for Extraordinary Ecclesiastical Affairs]], a sub-office of  the [[Secretariat of State (Vatican)|Vatican Secretariat of State]]. Monsignor [[Pietro Gasparri]], the recently appointed undersecretary at the Department of Extraordinary Affairs,  had underscored his proposal to Pacelli to  work in the 'Vatican's equivalent  of the Foreign office' by highlighting the 'necessity of defending the Church from the onslaughts of secularism and liberalism throughout Europe.'&lt;ref name=&quot;Gerard Noel, p.10&quot;/&gt; Pacelli became an ''apprendista'', an apprentice, in Gasparri's department.  In January 1901 he was also chosen, by Pope Leo XIII himself, according to an official account, to deliver condolences on behalf of the Vatican to [[Edward VII]] of the UK after the death of [[Queen Victoria]].&lt;ref name=&quot;marchione9&quot;&gt;Marchione, 2004, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:MarrydelValpacelli.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The Serbian Concordat, 24 June 1914. Present for the Vatican were [[Cardinal Merry del Val]] and next to him, Monsignor Eugenio Pacelli. Pacelli had  negotiated and drafted the document over the previous eighteen months. Cardinal Merry del Val remarked, 'If we say that we cannot trust the [[Serbs]], all the more reason for pinning them down with a concordat' - &quot;''an ominous foreshadowing of the argument employed by Pacelli to justify the Reich Concordat''&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;G. Noel, p. 21; J. Cornwell, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;]]

By 1904 Pacelli received his doctorate. The theme of his thesis was the nature of [[concordats]] and the function of canon law when a concordat falls into abeyance. Promoted to the position of ''minutante'', he prepared digests of reports that had been sent to the Secretariat from all over the world and in the same year became a [[papal chamberlain]]. In 1905  he received the title [[Domestic Prelate|domestic prelate]].&lt;ref name=&quot;marchione193&quot;/&gt; From 1904 until 1916, he assisted Cardinal [[Pietro Gasparri]] in his codification of [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]] with the Department of Extraordinary Ecclesiastical Affairs.&lt;ref name=&quot;marchione10&quot;&gt;Marchione, 2004, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Canon law, the body of internal laws of the Catholic Church, had gathered over centuries in a multitude of decrees, rules, and regulations.  The decision to create a code, rather than a compilation or collection of laws or canons, involved &quot;abstraction, fitting laws to succinct formulae divorced from historical and social origins&quot;; under Pius X's direction, the Code of Canon Law sought to create &quot;conformity, centralization, discipline&quot;. [[John Cornwell (writer)|John Cornwell]]: &quot; the text, together with the [[Anti-Modernist Oath]], became the means by which the Holy See was to establish and sustain the new, unequal, and unprecedented power relationship that had arisen between the papacy and the Church. Gaspari and Pacelli were its principal architects. The task was to absorb Pacelli for thirteen years.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Cornwell, ''Hitler's Pope'', p. 42&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1908, Pacelli served as a Vatican representative on the [[International Eucharistic Congress]], accompanying [[Rafael Merry del Val]]&lt;ref&gt;Cornwell, p.32&lt;/ref&gt; to London,&lt;ref name=&quot;marchione9&quot;/&gt; where he met [[Winston Churchill]].&lt;ref&gt;Dalin, 2005, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1911, he represented the Holy See at the [[Coronation of the British monarch|coronation]] of King [[George V]].&lt;ref name=&quot;marchione10&quot;/&gt;
Pacelli became the under-secretary in 1911, adjunct-secretary in 1912 (a position he received under [[Pope Pius X]] and retained under [[Pope Benedict XV]]) and secretary of the Department of Extraordinary Ecclesiastical Affairs in 1914—succeeding Gasparri, who was promoted to [[Cardinal Secretary of State]].&lt;ref name=&quot;marchione10&quot;/&gt; On 24 June 1914, just four days before [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria]] was assassinated in [[Sarajevo]], Pacelli, together with [[Cardinal Merry del Val]], represented the Vatican when the Serbian Concordat was signed. Pacelli had negotiated and drafted the document over the previous eighteen months.&lt;ref&gt;Cornwell, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; [[Serbia]]'s success in the [[First Balkan War]] against [[Turkey]] in 1912 had increased the number of Catholics within greater Serbia. At this time Serbia, encouraged by Russia, was challenging [[Austria-Hungary]]'s sphere of influence throughout the [[Balkans]]. Austria-Hungary's protectorate rights were  destroyed by the Concordat and the Austrians had attempted to wreck the negotiations, &quot;but the Vatican,in the person of Pacelli, had pressed the project to a conclusion.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Cornwell, p.50&lt;/ref&gt;
During World War I, Pacelli maintained the Vatican's registry of [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]]. In 1915, he travelled to [[Vienna]] to assist Monsignor [[Raffaele Scapinelli di Léguigno|Raffaele Scapinelli]], [[nuncio]] to Vienna, in his negotiations with [[Franz Joseph I of Austria]] regarding Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Levillain, 2002, p. 1211.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Archbishop and Papal Nuncio===
{{Main|Nunciature of Eugenio Pacelli}}
[[File:PioXIIgernamia1917.jpg|thumb|right|Pacelli at the Headquarters of [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]]]]
Pope Benedict XV appointed Pacelli as [[Apostolic Nuncio to Bavaria|nuncio to Bavaria]] on 23 April 1917, consecrating him as [[titular bishop|titular]] [[See of Sardis|Bishop of Sardis]] and immediately elevating him to [[archbishop]] in the [[Sistine Chapel]] on 13 May 1917. After his consecration, Eugenio Pacelli left for [[Bavaria]]. As there was no nuncio to [[Prussia]] or Germany at the time, Pacelli was, for all practical purposes, the nuncio to all of the [[German Empire]].

Once in [[Munich]], he conveyed the papal initiative to end the war to German authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Fatoni, 1992, pp 45–85.&lt;/ref&gt; He met with [[Ludwig III of Bavaria|King Ludwig III]] on 29 May, and later with [[Wilhelm II of Germany|Kaiser Wilhelm II]]&lt;ref name=&quot;marchione11&quot;&gt;Marchione, 2004, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; and Chancellor [[Bethmann-Hollweg]], who replied positively to the Papal initiative. However, Bethmann-Hollweg was forced to resign and the German High Command, hoping for a military victory, delayed the German reply until 20 September. For the remainder of the war, he concentrated on Benedict's humanitarian efforts.&lt;ref&gt;Rychlak, 2000, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; In the upheaval following the end of the war a disconcerted Pacelli sought Benedict XV's permission to leave Munich, where [[Kurt Eisner]] had declared a socialist republic, and he left for a while to [[Rorschach, St. Gallen|Rorschach]], and a tranquil Swiss sanatorium run by nuns. Monsignor Schioppa, the ''uditore'', was left in Munich.&lt;ref&gt;Cornwell, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;His recovery began with a 'rapport'&quot; with the 24 year old [[Pascalina Lehnert|Sister Pasqualina]] – she would soon be transferred to Munich when Pacelli &quot;pulled strings at the highest level&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;G. Noel, p.34&lt;/ref&gt;

When he returned to Munich, following Eisner's assassination by an anti-semitic nationalist, [[Anton Graf von Arco auf Valley|Count Arco-Valley]], he informed Gasparri-using Schioppa's eye-witness testimony of the chaotic scene at the former royal palace as the trio of Max Levien, [[Eugen Levine]], and Towia Axelrod sought power: &quot;''the scene was indescribable [-] the confusion totally chaotic [-] in the midst of all this, a gang of young women, of dubious appearance, Jews like the rest of them hanging around [-] the boss of this female rabble was Levien's mistress, a young Russian woman, a Jew and a divorcée [-] and it was to her that the nunciature was obliged to pay homage in order to proceed [-] Levien is a young man, also Russian and a Jew. Pale, dirty, with drugged eyes, vulgar, repulsive ...''&quot; According to Cornwell, a worrying impression of stereotypical anti-Semitic contempt is discernible in the 'catalogue of epithets describing their physical and moral repulsiveness' and Pacelli's &quot;constant harping on the Jewishness of this party of power usurpers&quot; chimed with the &quot;growing and widespread belief among Germans that the Jews were the instigators of the Bolshevik revolution, their principal aim being the destruction of Christian civilization&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Cornwell, p.75&lt;/ref&gt; Pacelli informed Gasparri that &quot;the capital of Bavaria, is suffering under a harsh Jewish-Russian revolutionary tyranny&quot; - but the crisis was soon over, and the [[Bavarian Soviet Republic|Munich Soviet Republic]] crushed by [[Freikorps]] and [[Reichswehr]] troops.

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-00535, Bamberg, 900 Jahr-Feier der Stadt.jpg|thumb|left|Nuncio Pacelli in July 1924 at the 900th anniversary of the City of [[Bamberg]]]]
Pacelli was appointed [[Apostolic Nuncio to Germany]] on 23 June 1920, and—after the completion of a Bavarian concordat—his nunciature was moved to Berlin in August 1925. Many of Pacelli's Munich staff stayed with him for the rest of his life, including his advisor [[Robert Leiber]] and Pascalina Lehnert – housekeeper, friend, and adviser to Pacelli for 41 years. In Berlin, Pacelli was Dean of the Diplomatic Corps and active in diplomatic and many social activities. He was aided by the German priest [[Ludwig Kaas]], who was known for his expertise in Church-state relations and was a full-time politician, politically active in the Catholic [[Centre Party (Germany)|Centre Party]], a party he led following [[Wilhelm Marx]]'s resignation in October 1928.&lt;ref&gt;Volk, 1972; Cornwell,p.96&lt;/ref&gt; While in Germany, he travelled to all regions, attended [[Katholikentag]] (national gatherings of the faithful), and delivered some 50 sermons and speeches to the German people.&lt;ref&gt;Kaas, 1930.&lt;/ref&gt; In Berlin he lived in the [[Tiergarten]] quarter and threw parties for the official and diplomatic elite. [[Paul von Hindenburg]], [[Gustav Stresemann]], and other members of the Cabinet were regular guests. 

In post-war Germany, in the absence of a nuncio in Moscow, Pacelli worked also on diplomatic arrangements between the Vatican and the Soviet Union. He negotiated food shipments for Russia, where the Church was persecuted. He met with Soviet representatives including Foreign Minister [[Georgi Chicherin]], who rejected any kind of religious education, the ordination of priests and bishops, but offered agreements without the points vital to the Vatican.&lt;ref&gt;Stehle, 1975, pp. 139–41.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Despite Vatican pessimism and a lack of visible progress, Pacelli continued the secret negotiations, until [[Pius XI]] ordered them to be discontinued in 1927. Pacelli supported German diplomatic activity aimed at rejection of punitive measures from victorious former enemies. He blocked French attempts for an ecclesiastical separation of the [[Saar (League of Nations)|Saar region]], supported the appointment of a papal administrator for [[Danzig]] and aided the reintegration of priests expelled from Poland.&lt;ref&gt;Morsey, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; A Prussian Concordat was signed on 14 June 1929. Following the [[Wall Street Crash]], the beginnings of a world economic slump appeared, and the days of the [[Weimar Republic]] were numbered. Pacelli was summoned back to Rome at this time – the call coming by telegram when he was resting at his favourite retreat, the Rorschach convent sanatorium. He left Berlin on 10 December 1929.&lt;ref&gt;Cornwell, pp. 103-04&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cardinal Secretary of State and Camerlengo===
[[File:PacelliBavaria1922a.JPG|thumb|upright|Eugenio Pacelli, nuncio in [[Bavaria]], visits a group of bishops.]]
Pacelli was made a Cardinal-Priest of ''[[Santi Giovanni e Paolo (Rome)|Santi Giovanni e Paolo]]'' on 16 December 1929 by Pope Pius XI, and within a few months, on 7 February 1930, Pius XI appointed him [[Cardinal Secretary of State]], responsible for foreign policy and state relations throughout the world. In 1935, Pacelli was named [[Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church]].

As Cardinal Secretary of State, Pacelli signed concordats with a number of countries and states. Immediately  on becoming Cardinal Secretary of State, Pacelli and Ludwig Kaas took up negotiations on a [[Baden]] Concordat  which continued until the spring and summer of 1932. Papal fiat appointed a supporter of Pacelli and his concordat policy, [[Conrad Gröber]], the new [[Archbishop of Freiburg]], and the treaty was signed in August 
1932.&lt;ref&gt;Kent, 2002, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Others followed: Austria (1933), Germany (1933), [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] (1935) and Portugal (1940). The [[Lateran treaties]] with Italy (1929) were concluded before Pacelli became Secretary of State. Roman Catholicism had become the sole recognized religion; the powerful democratic [[Italian People's Party (1919)|Catholic Popular Party]], in many ways similar to the Centre Party in Germany, had been disbanded, and  in place of political Catholicism the Holy See encouraged [[Catholic Action]], 'an anaemic form of clerically dominated religious rally-rousing.' It was permitted only so long as it developed &quot;its activity outside every political party and in direct dependence upon the Church hierarchy for the dissemination and implementation of Catholic principles.'&lt;ref&gt;Cornwell, p.115&lt;/ref&gt; Such concordats allowed the Catholic Church to organize youth groups, make ecclesiastical appointments, run schools, hospitals, and charities, or even conduct religious services. They also ensured that canon law would be recognized within some spheres (e.g., church decrees of [[Nullity (conflict)|nullity]] in the area of marriage).&lt;ref&gt;Fahlbusch, Erwin (ed.). Bromiley, Geoffrey W. (trans.) (2005). ''The Encyclopedia of Christianity''; ISBN 0-8028-2416-1&lt;/ref&gt;

As the decade began Pacelli wanted the Centre Party in Germany to turn away from the socialists. In the summer of 1931 he clashed with Catholic chancellor [[Heinrich Bruning]], who frankly told Pacelli he believed that he &quot;misunderstood the political situation in Germany and the real character of the Nazis.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Cornwell, p. 121&lt;/ref&gt; Following Bruning's resignation in May 1932 Pacelli, like the new Catholic chancellor [[Franz von Papen]], wondered if the Centre Party should look to the Right for a coalition, &quot;that would correspond to their principles'.&lt;ref&gt;Cornwell, p.128. Pacelli , quoted in Scholder's ''The Churches and the Third Reich', p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; He made many diplomatic visits throughout Europe and the Americas, including an [[Eugenio Pacelli's 1936 visit to the United States|extensive visit to the United States in 1936]] where he met [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], who appointed a personal envoy – who did not require Senate confirmation – to the [[Holy See]] in December 1939, re-establishing a diplomatic tradition that had been broken since 1870 when the pope lost [[Temporal power (Papal)|temporal power]].&lt;ref&gt;Dalin, 2005, pp. 58–59.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pacelli presided as [[Papal Legate]] over the [[International Eucharistic Congress]] in [[Buenos Aires, Argentina]] from 10–14 October 1934, and in [[Budapest]] from 25–30 May 1938.&lt;ref&gt;Marchione, 2002, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; At this time, [[antisemitism|anti-semitic]] laws were in the process of being formulated in Hungary. Pacelli made reference to the Jews &quot;whose lips curse [Christ] and whose hearts reject him even today&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''&quot;Christian responses to the Holocaust: moral and ethical issues: Religion, theology, and the Holocaust&quot;'', Donald J.

W. Klieforth, the American consul to Berlin, that [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] was &quot;an untrustworthy scoundrel and fundamentally wicked person&quot;; Klieforth wrote that Pacelli &quot;did not believe Hitler capable of moderation, and ... fully supported the German bishops in their [[anti-Nazi]] stand.&quot; A report written by Pacelli the following year for President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and filed with Ambassador [[Joseph Kennedy]] declared that the Church regarded compromise with the [[Third Reich]] as &quot;out of the question&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;bottum&quot;&gt;Joseph Bottum.

Some historians {{who|date=October 2011}} have argued that Pacelli, as Cardinal Secretary of State, dissuaded Pope Pius XI – who was nearing death at the time&lt;ref&gt;Phayer, 2000, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; – from condemning the ''[[Kristallnacht]]'' in November 1938,&lt;ref&gt;Walter Bussmann, 1969, &quot;Pius XII an die deutschen Bischöfe&quot;, ''Hochland'' 61, pp. 61–65&lt;/ref&gt; when he was informed of it by the papal nuncio in Berlin.&lt;ref name=&quot;gutman1136&quot;&gt;Gutman, Israel, Encyclopedia of the Holocaust, p. 1136.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise the draft encyclical ''[[Humani Generis Unitas]]'' (&quot;On the Unity of the Human Race&quot;), which was ready in September 1938 but, according to those responsible for an edition of the document&lt;ref&gt;Passelecp, Suchecky pp. 113–37&lt;/ref&gt; and other sources, it was not forwarded to the Holy See by the Jesuit General [[Wlodimir Ledochowski]].&lt;ref name=&quot;tablet&quot;&gt;Hill, Roland. 1997, 11 August. [http://www.thetablet.co.uk/articles/6576/ &quot;The lost encyclical&quot;], ''The Tablet''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;On 28 January 1939, eleven days before the death of Pius XI, a disappointed Gundlach informed LaFarge, the encyclical's author, &quot;It cannot go on like this&quot;. The text had not been forwarded to the Vatican. He had talked to the American assistant to Father General, who promised to look into the matter in December 1938, but did not report back.

Some historians {{Who|date=January 2012}} have argued that Pacelli learned about its existence only after the death of Pius XI and did not promulgate it as Pope.&lt;ref&gt;On 16 March four days after coronation, Gundlach informed LaFarge that the documents had been given to Pius XI shortly before his death, but that the new Pope had so far had no opportunity to learn about it. Passelecq, Suchecky. p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt; He did use parts of it in his inaugural encyclical ''[[Summi Pontificatus]]'', which he titled &quot;On the Unity of Human Society.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Encyclical of Pope Pius on the unity of human society to our venerable brethren: The Patriarchs, Primates, Archbishops, Bishops, and other ordinaries in peace and the communion with the Apostolic see (AAS 1939).&lt;/ref&gt; His various positions on Church and policy issues during his tenure as Cardinal Secretary of State were made public by the Holy See in 1939. Most noteworthy among the 50 speeches is his review of Church-State issues in Budapest in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;Eugenio Cardinal Pacelli.

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R24391, Konkordatsunterzeichnung in Rom.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Pacelli ''(seated, center)'' at the signing of the ''[[Reichskonkordat]]'' on 20 July 1933 in Rome with ''(from left to right)'': German prelate Ludwig Kaas, German Vice-Chancellor [[Franz von Papen]], Secretary of Extraordinary Ecclesiastical Affairs [[Giuseppe Pizzardo]], [[Alfredo Ottaviani]], and Reich minister [[Rudolf Buttmann]]]]

The ''Reichskonkordat'' was an integral part of four [[concordat]]s Pacelli concluded on behalf of the Vatican with German States. The state concordats were necessary because the German [[federalism|federalist]] [[Weimar Republic|Weimar]] constitution gave the German states authority in the area of education and culture and thus diminished the authority of the churches in these areas; this diminution of church authority was a primary concern of the Vatican. As Bavarian Nuncio, Pacelli negotiated successfully with the Bavarian authorities in 1925. He expected the concordat with Catholic Bavaria to be the model for the rest of Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Ludwig Volk, Die Kirche in den deutschsprachigen Ländern in: ''Handbuch der Kirchengeschichte, Band VII'', p. 539.&lt;/ref&gt; Prussia showed interest in negotiations only after the Bavarian concordat. However, Pacelli obtained less favorable conditions for the Church in the Prussian concordat of 1929, which excluded educational issues. A concordat with the German state of Baden was completed by Pacelli in 1932, after he had moved to Rome. There he also negotiated a concordat with Austria in 1933.&lt;ref&gt;Ludwig Volk, &quot;Die Kirche in den deutschsprachigen Ländern&quot;, ''Handbuch der Kirchengeschichte, Band VII'', pp. 539–44.&lt;/ref&gt; A total of 16 concordats and treaties with European states had been concluded in the ten year period 1922–1932.&lt;ref&gt;They included: Latvia 1922, Bavaria 1925, Poland 1925, France I., 1926, France II. 1926, Lithuania 1927, Czechoslovakia 1928, Portugal I 1928, Italy I1929, Italy II 1929, Portugal II 1929, Romania I 1927, Prussia 1929, Romania II 1932, Baden 1932, Germany 1933, Austria 1933. See P.Joanne M.Restrepo Restrepo SJ. ''Concordata Regnante Sanctissimo Domino Pio PP.XI. Inita'' Pontificia Universita Gregoriana, Roma, 1934.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Reichskonkordat'', signed on 20 July 1933, between Germany and the Holy See, while thus a part of an overall Vatican policy, was controversial from its beginning. It remains the most important of Pacelli's concordats. It is debated, not because of its content, which is still valid today, but because of its timing. A national concordat with Germany was one of Pacelli's main objectives as secretary of state, because he had hoped to strengthen the legal position of the Church. Pacelli, who knew German conditions well, emphasized in particular protection for Catholic associations (§31), freedom for education and Catholic schools, and freedom for publications.&lt;ref&gt;Ludwig Volk, &quot;Die Kirche in den deutschsprachigen Ländern&quot; in: ''Handbuch der Kirchengeschichte, Band VII'', pp. 546-47.&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[nuncio]] during the 1920s, he had made unsuccessful attempts to obtain German agreement for such a treaty, and between 1930 and 1933 he attempted to initiate negotiations with representatives of successive German governments, but the opposition of Protestant and Socialist parties, the instability of national governments and the care of the individual states to guard their autonomy thwarted this aim. In particular, the questions of denominational schools and pastoral work in the armed forces prevented any agreement on the national level, despite talks in the winter of 1932.&lt;ref&gt;Ludwig Volk ''Das Reichskonkordat vom 20. Juli 1933'', p. 34f., pp. 45–58.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Klaus Scholder ''The Churches and the Third Reich'' volume 1: especially Part 1, chapter 10; part 2, chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Adolf Hitler]] was appointed Chancellor on 30 January 1933 and sought to gain international respectability and to remove internal opposition by representatives of the Church and the Catholic [[Centre Party (Germany)|Centre Party]]. He sent his vice chancellor [[Franz von Papen]], a Catholic nobleman and member of the Centre Party, to Rome to offer negotiations about a Reichskonkordat.&lt;ref&gt;Volk, pp. 98–101. Feldkamp, pp. 88–93.&lt;/ref&gt; On behalf of Pacelli, Prelate Ludwig Kaas, the outgoing chairman of the Centre Party, negotiated first drafts of the terms with Papen.&lt;ref&gt;Volk, pp. 101, 105.&lt;/ref&gt; The concordat was finally signed, by Pacelli for the Vatican and von Papen for Germany, on 20 July and ratified on 10 September 1933.&lt;ref&gt;Volk, p. 254.&lt;/ref&gt; Father Franziscus Stratman, senior Catholic chaplain at Berlin University wrote &quot;The souls of well-disposed people are in a turmoil as a result of the tyranny of the National Socialists, and I am merely stating a fact when I say that the authority of the bishops among innumerable Catholics and non-Catholics has been shaken by the quasi-approval of the National Socialist movement&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Scholder, ''The Churches and the Third Reich, ii, p. 154''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Konrad von Preysing|Bishop Preysing]] cautioned against compromise with the new regime, against those who saw the Nazi persecution of the church  as an aberration that Hitler would correct.&lt;ref&gt;Krieg, Robert A., ''Catholic Theologians in Nazi Germany'', p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1933 and 1939, Pacelli issued 55 protests of violations of the ''Reichskonkordat''. Most notably, early in 1937, Pacelli asked several German cardinals, including Cardinal [[Michael von Faulhaber]] to help him write a protest of Nazi violations of the ''Reichskonkordat''; this was to become Pius XI's 1937 encyclical, ''[[Mit brennender Sorge]]''. The encyclical was written in German and not the usual [[Latin]] of official Roman Catholic Church documents. Secretly distributed by an army of motorcyclists and read from every German Catholic Church pulpit on [[Palm Sunday]], it condemned the [[paganism]] of the [[National Socialism]] ideology.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vidmar327&quot;&gt;Vidmar, pp. 327–3l&lt;/ref&gt; Pius XI credited its creation and writing to Pacelli.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pham45&quot;&gt;Pham, p. 45, quote: &quot;When Pius XI was complimented on the publication, in 1937, of his encyclical denouncing Nazism, ''Mit brennender Sorge'', his response was to point to his Secretary of State and say bluntly, 'The credit is his.'&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first official denunciation of Nazism made by any major organization and resulted in persecution of the Church by the infuriated Nazis who closed all the participating presses and &quot;took numerous vindictive measures against the Church, including staging a long series of immorality trials of the Catholic clergy.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bokenkotter389&quot;&gt;Bokenkotter, pp. 389–92, quote &quot;And when Hitler showed increasing belligerance toward the Church, Pius met the challenge with a decisiveness that astonished the world. His encyclical ''Mit brennender Sorge'' was the &quot;first great official public document to dare to confront and criticize Nazism&quot; and &quot;one of the greatest such condemnations ever issued by the Vatican&quot;. Smuggled into Germany, it was read from all the Catholic pulpits on Palm Sunday in March 1937. It exposed the fallacy and denounced the Nazi myth of blood and soil; it decried its neopaganism, its war of annihilation against the Church, and even described the Führer himself as a &quot;mad prophet possessed of repulsive arrogance&quot;. The Nazis were infuriated, and in retaliation closed and sealed all the presses that had printed it and took numerous vindictive measures against the Church, including staging a long series of immorality trials of the Catholic clergy.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 June 1941, the pope commented on the problems of the ''Reichskonkordat'' in a letter to the [[Bishop of Passau]], in Bavaria: &quot;The history of the Reichskonkordat shows, that the other side lacked the most basic prerequisites to accept minimal freedoms and rights of the Church, without which the Church simply cannot live and operate, formal agreements notwithstanding&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;74.A lEveque de Passau, in &quot;Lettres de Pie XII aux Eveques Allemands 1939–1944, Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 1967, p. 416&lt;/ref&gt;

Pius XI died on 10 February 1939. Several historians have interpreted the conclave to choose his successor as facing a choice between a diplomatic or a spiritual candidate, and they view Pacelli's diplomatic experience, especially with Germany, as one of the deciding factors in his election on 2 March 1939, his 63rd birthday, after only one day of deliberation and three ballots.&lt;ref&gt;Michael F. Feldkamp. ''Pius XII und Deutschland''; ISBN 3-525-34026-5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dalin, 2005, pp. 69–70&lt;/ref&gt; He was the first cardinal secretary of state to be elected Pope since [[Pope Clement IX|Clement IX]] in 1667.&lt;ref&gt;Catholic Forum. [http://www.catholic-forum.com/saints/pope0260.htm Pope Pius XII profile].&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of only two men known to have served as [[Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church|Camerlengo]] immediately prior to being elected as pope (the other being [[Pope Leo XIII]]). His [[Papal Coronation|coronation]] took place on 12 March 1939. Upon being elected pope he was also formally the Grand Master of the Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem, [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith|prefect of the Supreme Sacred Congregation of the Holy Office]], [[Congregation for the Oriental Churches|prefect of the Sacred Congregation for the Oriental Churches]] and [[Congregation for Bishops|prefect of the Sacred Consistorial Congregation]]. There was however a Cardinal-Secretary to run these bodies on a day-to-day basis.

Pacelli took the same papal name as his predecessor, a title used exclusively by [[:Category:Italian popes|Italian Popes]]. He was quoted as saying, &quot;I call myself Pius; my whole life was under Popes with this name, but especially as a sign of gratitude towards [[Pius XI]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Pius XII, quoted in Joseph Brosch, Pius XII, Lehrer der Wahrheit, Kreuzring, Trier,1968, p.45&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 December 1937, during his last consistory, Pius XI strongly hinted to the cardinals that he expected Pacelli to be his successor, saying &quot;He is in your midst.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Medius vestrum stetit quem vos nescetis. Everybody knew what the pope meant&quot;. Domenico Cardinale Tardini, Pio XII, Tipografia Poliglotta Vaticana, 1960, p. 105&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lehnert, Pascalina. ''Ich durfte Ihm Dienen, Erinnerungen an Papst Pius XII''. Naumann, Würzburg, 1986, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; He had previously been quoted as saying: &quot;When today the Pope dies, you'll get another one tomorrow, because the Church continues. It would be a much bigger tragedy, if Cardinal Pacelli dies, because there is only one. I pray every day, God may send another one into one of our seminaries, but as of today, there is only one in this world.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Lehnert, Pascalina. ''Ich durfte Ihm Dienen, Erinnerungen an Papst Pius XII''. Naumann, Würzburg, 1986, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;

===Appointments===
[[File:1983pasca.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Pascalina Lehnert]], born Josefina Lehnert 25 August 1894, the seventh of twelve children, near the village of [[Ebersberg]] in [[Bavaria]], Pius XII's housekeeper and confidant from his time as nuncio to Germany, she followed him to Rome. 'They lived under the same roof for 41 years.'&lt;ref name=&quot;Gerard Noel, p.9&quot;/&gt;]]
After his election, he made [[Luigi Maglione]] his successor as Cardinal Secretary of State. Cardinal Maglione, a seasoned Vatican diplomat, had reestablished diplomatic relations with Switzerland and was for many years nuncio in Paris. Yet, Maglione did not exercise the influence of his predecessor Pacelli, who as Pope continued his close relation with Monsignors Montini (later [[Pope Paul VI]]) and [[Domenico Tardini]]. After the death of Maglione in 1944, Pius left the position open and named Tardini head of its foreign section and Montini head of the internal section.&lt;ref&gt;Congregation of Extraordinary Ecclesiastical Affairs and Congregation of Ordinary Affairs&lt;/ref&gt; Tardini and Montini continued serving there until 1953, when Pius XII decided to appoint them cardinals,&lt;ref&gt;Pio XII, ''La Allocuzione nel consistorio Segreto del 12 Gennaio 1953'' in Pio XII, Discorsi e Radiomessagi di Sua Santita Vatican City, 1953, p. 455;&lt;/ref&gt; an honor which both turned down.&lt;ref&gt;Domenico Cardinale Tardini, Pio XII, Tipografia Poliglotta Vaticana, 1960, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; They were then later appointed to be Pro-Secretary with the privilege to wear Episcopal Insignia.&lt;ref&gt;Guilio Nicolini, Il Cardinale Domenico Tardini, Padova, 1980; ISBN 887026-340-1; p. 313&lt;/ref&gt; Tardini continued to be a close co-worker of the Pope until the death of Pius XII, while Montini became archbishop of [[Milan]], after the death of [[Alfredo Ildefonso Schuster]].

Pius XII slowly eroded the Italian monopoly on the [[Roman Curia]]; he employed German and [[Dutch people|Dutch]] [[Jesuit]] advisors, Robert Leiber, [[Augustin Bea]], and [[Sebastian Tromp]]. He also supported the elevation of Americans such as Cardinal [[Francis Spellman]] from a minor to a major role in the Church.&lt;ref&gt;In the Secretariat of State he had actively supported &quot;foreigners&quot;, for example Francis Spellman, the American monsignor, whom he consecrated himself as the first American Bishop in the Vatican curia. Spellman had organized and accompanied Pacelli's American journey and arranged a meeting with President Roosevelt. Only 30 days after his coronation, on 12 April 1939, Pope Pius XII named Spellman as archbishop of [[New York]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gannon, Robert I. ''The Cardinal Spellman Story'', Doubleday Company, New York, 1962&lt;/ref&gt; After World War II, Pius XII appointed more non-Italians than any Pope before him. American appointees included [[Joseph P. Hurley]] as regent of the nunciature in Belgrade, [[Gerald P. O'Hara]] as nuncio to [[Romania]], and Monsignor [[Aloisius Joseph Muench|Muench]] as nuncio to Germany. For the first time, numerous young Europeans, Asians and &quot;Americans were trained in various congregations and secretariats within the Vatican for eventual service throughout the world.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Oscar Halecki, James Murray, Jr. ''Pius XII, Eugenio Pacelli, Pope of Peace''; p. 370&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consistories===
{{further2|[[:Category:Cardinals created by Pope Pius XII]]}}
Only twice in his pontificate did Pius XII hold a [[consistory]] to create new [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinals]], in contrast to Pius XI, who had done so 17 times in as many years. Pius XII chose not to name new cardinals during World War II, and the number of cardinals shrank to 38, with [[Dennis Joseph Dougherty]] of [[Philadelphia]] being the only living U.S. cardinal. The first occasion on 18 February 1946 – which has become known as the &quot;Grand Consistory&quot; – yielded the elevation of a record 32 new cardinals, almost 50 percent of the College of Cardinals and reaching the canonical limit of 70 cardinals.&lt;ref&gt;(previously [[Pope Leo X|Leo X]]'s elevation of 31 cardinals in 1517 had held this title). [[Pope John Paul II|John Paul II]] surpassed this number on 21 February 2001, elevating 44 cardinals. By that time, the limit had been suspended and over 120 Cardinals existed.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1946 consistory, Pius XII, while maintaining the maximum size of the College of Cardinals at 70, named cardinals from China, India, the Middle East and increased the number of Cardinals from the Americas, proportionally lessening the Italian influence.&lt;ref&gt;Oscar Halecki, James Murray, Jr. ''Pius XII, Eugenio Pacelli, Pope of Peace'', p. 371.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his second consistory on 12 January 1953, it was expected that his closest co-workers, Msgrs. Domenico Tardini and Giovanni Montini would be elevated&lt;ref&gt;Levillain, 2002, p. 1136.&lt;/ref&gt; and Pius XII informed the assembled cardinals that both of them were originally on the top of his list,&lt;ref&gt;Pio XII, La Allocuzione nel consistorio Segreto del 12 Gennaio 1953 in Pio XII, Discorsi e Radiomessagi di Sua Santita, Vatican City, 1953, 455&lt;/ref&gt; but they had turned down the offer, and were rewarded instead with other promotions.&lt;ref&gt;Tardini later thanked him for not appointing him. The Pope replied with a smile: Monsignore mio, you thank me, for not letting me do what I wanted to do&quot; I replied, yes Holy Father, I thank you for everything you have done for me, but even more, what you have not done for me. The Pope smiled.'' In Domenico Cardinale Tardini, Pio XII, Tipografia Poliglotta Vaticana, 1960 157&lt;/ref&gt; The two consistories of 1946 and 1953 brought an end to over five hundred years of Italians constituting a majority of the [[College of Cardinals]].&lt;ref&gt;Tobin, Greg. (2003). ''Selecting the Pope: Uncovering the Mysteries of Papal Elections''. Barnes &amp; Noble Publishing; ISBN 0-7607-4032-1. pp. xv–xvi, 143.&lt;/ref&gt;

With few exceptions, Italian prelates accepted the changes positively; there was no protest movement or open opposition to the internationalization efforts.&lt;ref&gt;For example, Padellaro: &quot;Church history will memorize with special letters the secret conclave of 1946, and the cosmopolitan Pius XII, who called men of all races into the Senate of the Church&quot;, Nazareno Padellaro, Pio XII Torino, 1956, p. 484&lt;/ref&gt;

==Church reforms==
===Liturgy reforms===
{{Main|Liturgical reforms of Pope Pius XII|Mediator Dei}}
[[File:Papst Pius XII., Krönung 1939JS.jpg|thumb|300px|Pope Pius XII seated in the Sedia Gestatoria]]
In his encyclical ''Mediator Dei'', Pius XII links [[liturgy]] with the last will of [[Jesus Christ]]. {{cquote|But it is His will, that the worship He instituted and practiced during His life on earth shall continue ever afterwards without intermission. For he has not left mankind an [[orphan]]. He still offers us the support of His powerful, unfailing intercession, acting as our &quot;advocate with the Father.&quot; He aids us likewise through His Church, where He is present indefectibly as the ages run their course: through the Church which He constituted &quot;the pillar of truth&quot; and dispenser of grace, and which by His sacrifice on the cross, He founded, consecrated and confirmed forever.&lt;ref&gt;AAS, 1947, ''Mediator Dei'', p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Church has, therefore, according to Pius XII, a common aim with Christ himself, teaching all men the truth, and, offering to God a pleasing and acceptable sacrifice. This way, the Church re-establishes the unity between the [[Creator deity|Creator]] and His creatures.&lt;ref&gt;AAS, 1947, ''Mediator Dei'', p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; The sacrifice of the altar, being Christ's own actions, convey and dispense divine grace from Christ to the members of the Mystical Body.&lt;ref&gt;AAS 1947, ''Mediator Dei'', p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

The numerous reforms of Pius XII show two characteristics. Renewal and rediscovery of old liturgical traditions, such as the reintroduction of the [[Easter Vigil]], and, a more structured atmosphere within the Church buildings. The use of [[vernacular]] language, favoured by Pius XII, was hotly debated at his time. He increased non-Latin services, especially in countries with expanding Catholic mission activities. The [[church tabernacle]] holding the [[Blessed Sacrament]] should be immovably fixed to the altar and, unless another position was thought to be more appropriate, should normally be at the main altar.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/aas/documents/AAS%2049%20&amp;#91;1957&amp;#93;%20-%20ocr.pdf AAS, 1957, pp. 425–26]&lt;/ref&gt; The Church should display religious objects, but not be overloaded with secondary objects. Modern sacred art should be reverential and reflect the spirit of our time.&lt;ref&gt;AAS, 1952, pp. 542–46&lt;/ref&gt; Priests are permitted to officiate marriages without [[Holy Mass]]. They may also officiate confirmations in certain instances.&lt;ref&gt;AAS, 1946, pp. 349–54&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canon Law Reforms===
{{Main|Pope Pius XII reforms of Eastern Canon Law }}
Decentralized authority and increased independence of the Uniate Churches were aimed at in the [[Canon Law]]/Corpis Iuris Canonici (CIC) reform. In its new constitutions, Eastern Patriarchs were made almost independent from Rome (CIC Orientalis, 1957) Eastern marriage law (CIC Orientalis, 1949), civil law (CIC Orientalis, 1950), laws governing religious associations (CIC Orientalis, 1952) property law (CIC Orientalis, 1952) and other laws. These reforms and writings of Pius XII were intended to establish Eastern Orientals as equal parts of the mystical body of Christ, as explained in the [[encyclical]] ''[[Mystici Corporis]]''.

===Priests and Religious===
With the [[Apostolic constitution]] ''Sedis Sapientiae'', Pius XII added [[social sciences]], [[sociology]], [[psychology]] and [[social psychology]], to the pastoral training of future priests. Pius XII emphasised the need to systematically analyze the [[psychological]] condition of candidates to the [[priesthood]] to ensure that they are capable of a life of celibacy and service.&lt;ref&gt;AAS, 1956, p. 354 ff&lt;/ref&gt; Pius XII added one year to the theological formation of future priests. He included a &quot;pastoral year&quot;, an introduction into the practice of parish work.&lt;ref&gt;AAS, 1956, p. 357.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pius XII wrote in ''[[Menti Nostrae]]'' that the call to constant interior reform and Christian [[heroism]] means to be above average, to be a living example of Christian virtue. The strict norms governing their lives are meant to make them models of Christian perfection for lay people, he writes in .&lt;ref&gt;AAS, 1950, p. 657&lt;/ref&gt; Bishops are encouraged to look at model saints like [[Boniface]], and Pope Pius X.&lt;ref&gt;AAS 1954 313&lt;/ref&gt; Priests were encouraged to be living examples of the love of Christ and his sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;AAS 1957, p. 272&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theology==
{{Main|Theology of Pope Pius XII}}
[[File:Statue of Pope Pius XII in Fatima Portugal.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Fátima, Portugal|Fátima]] Statue of Pope Pius XII, who consecrated Russia and the [[World]]: ''«Just as a few years ago We consecrated the entire human race to the Immaculate Heart of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary (Roman Catholic)|Virgin Mary]], [[Mother of God]], so today We consecrate and in a most special manner We entrust all the peoples of Russia to this Immaculate Heart...»'']]
Pius XII explained the Catholic faith in 41 encyclicals and almost 1000 messages and speeches during his long pontificate. [[Mediator Dei]] clarified membership and participation in the Church. The encyclical [[Divino Afflante Spiritu]] opened the doors for biblical research. His magisterium was far larger and is difficult to summarize. In numerous speeches Catholic teaching is related to various aspects of life, education, medicine, politics, war and peace, the life of saints, [[Blessed Virgin Mary (Roman Catholic)|Mary]], the [[Mother of God]], things eternal and contemporary. Theologically, Pius XII specified the nature of the teaching authority of the Church. He also gave a new freedom to engage in theological investigations.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Humani generis]]'' (1950) and ''[[Divino Afflante Spiritu]]'' (1943), p. 305.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theological orientation===
;Biblical Research
{{Main|Divino Afflante Spiritu}}
The encyclical ''Divino Afflante Spiritu'', published in 1943,&lt;ref&gt;AAS, 1943, p. 297.&lt;/ref&gt; emphasized the role of the Bible. Pius XII freed biblical research from previous limitations. He encouraged Christian theologians to revisit original versions of the Bible in [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Hebrew]]. Noting improvements in [[archaeology]], the encyclical reversed Pope Leo XIII's encyclical, which had only advocated going back to the original texts to resolve ambiguity in the [[Latin Vulgate]]. The encyclical demands a much better understanding of ancient Jewish history and traditions. It requires bishops throughout the Church to initiate [[biblical studies]] for lay people. The Pontiff also requests a reorientation of Catholic teaching and education, relying much more on sacred scriptures in [[sermon]]s and religious instruction.&lt;ref&gt;AAS, 1943, p. 305.&lt;/ref&gt;

;The role of theology
This theological investigative freedom does not, however, extend to all aspects of theology. According to Pius, theologians, employed by the Church, are assistants, to teach the official teachings of the Church and not their own private thoughts. They are free to engage in empirical research, which the Church generously supports, but in matters of [[morality]] and religion, they are subjected to the teaching office and authority of the Church, the [[Magisterium]]. &quot;The most noble office of theology is to show how a doctrine defined by the Church is contained in the sources of revelation, ... in that sense in which it has been defined by the Church.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Pius XII, Enc. Humani Generis, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; The deposit of faith is authentically interpreted not to each of the faithful, not even to theologians, but only to the teaching authority of the Church.&lt;ref&gt;''Humani Generis'', p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mariology and the Dogma of the Assumption===
[[File:Tizian 041.jpg|upright|thumb|On 1 November 1950, Pius XII defined the dogma of the assumption ([[Titian]]'s ''Assunta'' (1516–18) pictured).]]

;World Consecration to the Immaculate Heart of Mary
{{Main|Pope Pius XII Consecration to the Immaculate Heart of Mary}}
As a young boy and in later life, Pacelli was an ardent follower of the Virgin Mary. He was consecrated as a bishop on 13 May 1917, the very first day of the apparitions of [[Our Lady of Fátima]]. He consecrated the world to the [[Immaculate Heart of Mary]] in 1942, in accordance with the second &quot;secret&quot; of Our Lady of Fátima. His remains were to be buried in the crypt of Saint Peter's Basilica on the feast day of Our Lady of Fátima, 13 October 1958.

;The Dogma of the Assumption of Our Lady
{{Main|Munificentissimus Deus}}
On 1 November 1950, Pope Pius XII defined the dogma of the Assumption: {{cquote|By the authority of our Lord Jesus Christ, of the Blessed Apostles Peter and Paul, and by our own authority, we pronounce, declare, and define it to be a divinely revealed dogma: that the [[Immaculate Conception|Immaculate Mother of God]], the ever Virgin Mary, having completed the course of her earthly life, was assumed body and soul into heavenly glory.&lt;ref&gt;AAS, 1950, p. 753.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The dogma of the bodily assumption of the Virgin Mary is the crowning of the theology of Pius XII. It resolved a theological difficulty that the dogma of the Immaculate Conception had left open: if the soul of Mary had been created without the taint of sin, yet the Bible states that the wages of sin is death, should it be concluded that Mary, who by definition never sinned, therefore never died? The dogma of her assumption settles the problem by stating that she did not experience the ordinary human death, but was taken to Heaven as a divine gift. The dogma was preceded by the 1946 encyclical [[Deiparae Virginis Mariae]], which requested all Catholic bishops to express their opinion on a possible dogmatization. On 8 September 1953, the encyclical ''[[Fulgens corona]]'' announced a Marian year for 1954, the centennial of the Dogma of the [[Immaculate Conception]].&lt;ref&gt;AAS 1953, p. 577&lt;/ref&gt; In the encyclical [[Ad caeli reginam]] he promulgated the [[Queenship of Mary]] feast.&lt;ref&gt;AAS 1954, p. 625&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mystici Corporis]] summarizes his [[mariology]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EMCC-110&quot;&gt;Pius XII, Enc.

;Medical theology
Pius XII delivered numerous speeches to medical professionals and researchers.&lt;ref&gt;Pio XII, ''Discorsi Ai Medici'' compiles 700 pages of specific addresses.&lt;/ref&gt; He addressed doctors, nurses, midwives, to detail all aspects of rights and dignity of patients, medical responsibilities, moral implications of psychological illnesses and the uses of psycho pharmaca. He also took on issues like the uses of medicine in [[terminally ill]] persons, medical lies in face of grave illness, and the rights of family members to make decisions against expert medical advice. Pope Pius XII often reconsidered previously accepted truth, thus he was first to determine that the use of pain medicine in terminally ill patients is justified, even if this may shorten the life of the patient, as long as life shortening is not the objective itself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.papalencyclicals.net/Pius12/P12PSYCH.HTM Pope Pius XII, The Moral Limits of Medical Research and Treatment].&lt;/ref&gt;

;Family and sexuality
Pope Pius XII developed an extensive theology of the family, taking issue with family roles, sharing of household duties, education of children, conflict resolution, financial dilemmas, psychological problems, illness, taking care of older generations, unemployment, marital holiness and virtue, common prayer, religious discussions and more. Within the overall divine purpose of family life, he fully accepted the [[calendar-based methods|rhythm method]] as a moral form of [[family planning]], although only limited circumstances, within the context of family.&lt;ref name=&quot;midwives&quot;&gt;Two speeches on 29 October 1951, and 26 November 1951: ''Moral Questions Affecting Married Life'': Addresses given to the Italian Catholic Union of Midwives 29 October 1951, and 26 November 1951 to the National Congress of the Family Front and the Association of Large Families, National Catholic Welfare Conference, Washington, D.C..

;Theology and science
To Pius XII, science and religion were heavenly sisters, different manifestations of divine exactness, who could not possibly contradict each other over the long term&lt;ref&gt;Discorsi E Radiomessaggi di sua Santita Pio XII, Vatican City, 1940, p. 407; Discorsi E Radiomessaggi di sua Santita Pio XII, Vatican City, 1942, p. 52; Discorsi E Radiomessaggi di sua Santita Pio XII, Vatican City, 1946,p.89Discorsi E Radiomessaggi di sua Santita Pio XII, Vatican City, 1951, pp. 28, 221, 413, 574&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding their relation, his advisor Professor Robert Leiber wrote: &quot;Pius XII was very careful not to close any doors prematurely. He was energetic on this point and regretted that in the case of [[Galileo]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Leiber, p. 411.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Evolution
{{Main|Humani generis}}
In 1950, Pius XII promulgated ''Humani Generis'' which acknowledged that [[evolution]] might accurately describe the biological origins of human life, but at the same time criticized those who &quot;imprudently and indiscreetly hold that evolution... explains the origin of all things&quot;. Catholics must believe that the human soul was created immediately by God. Since the soul is a spiritual substance it is not brought into being through transformation of matter, but directly by God, whence the special uniqueness of each person..&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Pius XII, Enc. Humani Generis, 36&lt;/ref&gt; Fifty years later, [[Pope John Paul II]], stating that scientific evidence now seemed to favour the evolutionary theory, upheld the distinction of Pius XII regarding the human soul. &quot;Even if the human body originates from pre-existent living matter, the spiritual soul is spontaneously created by God.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blessed-sacrament.org/evolution.doc|title=Finding God in human evolution|accessdate=2011-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Encyclicals, writings and speeches===

[[File:Our Lady of Good Counsel by Pasquale Sarullo.jpg|thumb|left|upright|In 1939 Pius XII placed his pontificate under the maternal care of ''[[Our Lady of Good Counsel]]'' and composed a prayer to her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://campus.udayton.edu/mary/meditations/olgc.html|title=Univ of Dayton|publisher=Campus.udayton.edu|date=30 July 2009|accessdate=12 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''This Saint's for You'' by Thomas J. Craughwell 2007; ISBN 1-59474-184-0; p. 172&lt;/ref&gt; This 19th-century painting is by [[Pasquale Sarullo]].]]
Pius XII issued 41 [[encyclical]]s during his pontificate – more than all his successors in the past 50 years taken together – along with many other writings and speeches. The pontificate of Pius XII was the first in Vatican history, which published papal speeches and addresses in [[vernacular]] language on a systematic basis. Until then, papal documents were issued mainly in [[Latin]] in ''[[Acta Apostolicae Sedis]]'' since 1909. Because of the novelty of it all, and a feared [[military occupation|occupation]] of the Vatican by the German [[Wehrmacht]], not all documents exist today. In 1944, a number of papal documents were burned or &quot;walled in&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Communication, Father Robert Graham, SJ, 10 November 1992&lt;/ref&gt; to avoid detection by the advancing German army. Insisting that all publications must be reviewed by him on a prior basis to avoid any misunderstanding, several speeches by Pius XII, who did not find sufficient time, were never published or appeared only once issued in the Vatican daily, ''[[Osservatore Romano]]''.

Several encyclicals addressed the [[Oriental Church]]es. ''[[Orientalis Ecclesiae]]'' was issued in 1944 on the 15th centenary of the death of [[Cyril of Alexandria]], a saint common to [[Orthodox Christianity|Orthodox]] and [[Latin]] Churches. Pius XII asks for prayer for better understanding and unification of the Churches. ''[[Orientales Omnes]]'', issued in 1945 on the 350th anniversary of the reunion, is a call to continued unity of the [[Ruthenian Church]], threatened in its very existence by the authorities of the Soviet Union. ''[[Sempiternus Rex]]'' was issued in 1951 on the 1500th anniversary of the Ecumenical [[Council of Chalcedon]]. It included a call to oriental communities adhering to [[monophysitism]] to return to the Catholic Church. ''Orientales Ecclesias'' was issued in 1952 and addressed to the Eastern Churches, protesting the continued [[Stalinist]] persecution of the Church. Several [[Apostolic Letter]]s were sent to the bishops in the East. On 13 May 1956, Pope Pius addressed all bishops of the Eastern Rite. Mary, the mother of God, was the subject of encyclical letters to the people of Russia in ''[[Fulgens Corona]]'', as well as a papal letter to the people of Russia.&lt;ref&gt;''Orientalis Ecclesiae'', AAS, 1944, p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Orientales Omnes'', AAS, 1946, pp. 33–63.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Sempiternus Rex'', AAS, 1951, pp. 625–44.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Orientales Ecclesias''. AAS, 1953, pp. 5–15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Apostolic Letters to the bishops in the East. AAS, 1956, pp. 260–64.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Fulgens Corona'', AAS, 1953, pp. 577–93.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Papal letter to the People of Russia, AAS, 1952, pp. 505–11.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Feasts and devotions===
In 1958, Pope Pius XII declared the Feast of the [[Holy Face of Jesus]] as [[Shrove Tuesday]] (the Tuesday before [[Ash Wednesday]]) for all Roman Catholics. The first medal of the Holy Face, produced by Sister [[Maria Pierina|Maria Pierina De Micheli]], based on the image on the [[Shroud of Turin]] had been offered to Pius XII who approved of the medal and the devotion based on it. The general devotion to the Holy Face of Jesus had been approved by [[Pope Leo XIII]] in 1885 before the image on the Turin Shroud had been photographed.&lt;ref&gt;Joan Carroll Cruz (OCDS).

==Canonisations and beatifications==
{{Main|Saints canonized by Pope Pius XII|Beatifications of Pope Pius XII}}
Pope Pius XII [[canonization|canonized]] numerous people, including Pope [[Pius X]]-&quot;both were determined to stamp out, as far as possible, all traces of dangerous [[heterodoxy]]&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Gerard Noel, p.16&lt;/ref&gt;- and [[Maria Goretti]]. He beatified [[Pope Innocent XI]]. The first canonizations were two women, the founder of a female order, [[Mary Euphrasia Pelletier]], and a young housekeeper said to have [[stigmata]], [[Gemma Galgani]]. Pelletier had a reputation for opening new ways for Catholic charities, helping people in difficulties with the law, who had been neglected by the system and the Church. Galgani was a woman in her twenties whose virtue became model by her canonization.&lt;ref&gt;Lehnert, Pascalina. ''Pius XII, Ich durfte ihm dienen'', Würzburg, 1982, p. 163&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War II==
[[File:Bernardinonogara.jpg|thumb|upright|The investments of [[Bernardino Nogara]] were critical to the financing of the papacy during World War II.]]
{{Main|Vatican City during World War II}}
As Cardinal Secretary of State, Pacelli signed a [[Concordat]] between Germany and the Vatican at a ceremony in Rome on 20 July 1933. His pontificate began on the eve of World War II. In the 1937 encyclical ''[[Mit brennender Sorge]]'', drafted by Pope Pius XII when he was still a cardinal,&lt;ref name=&quot;Pham45&quot;&gt;Pham, ''Heirs of the Fisherman: Behind the Scenes of Papal Death and Succession'' (2005), p. 45, quote: &quot;When Pius XI was complimented on the publication, in 1937, of his encyclical denouncing Nazism, ''Mit brennender Sorge'', his response was to point to his Secretary of State and say bluntly, 'The credit is his.'&amp;nbsp;&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Pope Pius XI denounced Nazism and breaches of the Reichskonkordat. Read from the pulpits of all German Catholic churches, it has been described as the first official denunciation of [[Nazism]] made by any major organization.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bokenkotter389&quot;&gt;Bokenkotter, ''A Concise History of the Catholic Church'' (2004), p. 389–92&lt;/ref&gt; Nazi persecution of the Church in Germany then began by &quot;outright repression&quot; and &quot;staged prosecutions of monks for homosexuality, with the maximum of publicity.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Chadwick254&quot;&gt;Chadwick, ''A History of Christianity'' (1995), pp. 254–55&lt;/ref&gt; When Dutch bishops protested against the deportation of Jews, the Nazis responded by deporting Jewish converts, including [[Edith Stein]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bokenkotter389&quot;/&gt;

In Poland, the Nazis murdered over 2,500 monks and priests and others were sent to [[concentration camp]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chadwick254&quot;/&gt; The Priester-Block (priests barracks) in the [[Dachau concentration camp]] lists 2,600 Roman Catholic priests.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vidmar327&quot;&gt;Vidmar, ''The Catholic Church Through the Ages'' (2005), p. 329&lt;/ref&gt; Pius XII's refusal to censure the [[Invasion of Poland|German invasion and annexation of Poland]] was regarded as a &quot;betrayal&quot; by many Polish Catholics and clergy, who saw his appointment of [[Hilarius Breitinger]] as apostolic administrator for the [[Reichsgau Wartheland|Wartheland]] in May  1942 as &quot;implicit recognition&quot; of the breakup of Poland; the opinions of the ''[[Volksdeutsche]]'', mostly German Catholic minorities living in Poland, were more mixed.&lt;ref&gt;Phayer, 2008, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Pius XII received frequent reports about atrocities committed by and/or against Catholics, his knowledge was incomplete; for example, he wept after the war on learning that [[Cardinal Hlond]] had banned German liturgical services in Poland.&lt;ref&gt;Phayer, 2008, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Phayer argues that Pius XII – both before and during his papacy – consistently &quot;deferred to Germany at the expense of Poland&quot;, and saw Germany – not Poland – as critical to &quot;rebuilding a large Catholic presence in Central Europe&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Phayer, 2008, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the war, the Pope followed a policy of public neutrality mirroring that of [[Pope Benedict XV]] during World War I. In 1939, Pius XII turned the Vatican into a centre of aid which he organized from various parts of the world&lt;ref&gt;O'Brian, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; At the request of the Pope, an information office for prisoners of war and refugees operated in the Vatican under [[Giovanni Battista Montini]], which in the years of its existence from 1939 until 1947 received almost 10 million (9,891,497) information requests and produced over 11&amp;nbsp;million (11,293,511) answers about missing persons.&lt;ref&gt;Corrado Pallenberg, p. 71&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1939, after the submission of [[Charles Maurras]] and the intervention of the [[Carmel of Lisieux]], Pius XII ended his predecessor's ban on [[Action Française]], an organization described by some authors as virulently [[antisemitic]] and [[anti-Communist]].&lt;ref&gt;Friedländer, Saul. ''Nazi Germany and the Jews: The Years of Persecution'', 1997, New York: HarperCollins, p. 223.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;McInerny-p49&quot;&gt;McInerney, 2001, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1939, the Pope employed a Jewish cartographer, Roberto Almagia, to work on old maps in the Vatican library. Almagia had been at the University of Rome since 1915 but was dismissed after [[Benito Mussolini]]'s antisemitic legislation of 1938. The Pope's appointment of two Jews to the Vatican Academy of Science as well as the hiring of Almagia were reported by ''[[The New York Times]]'' in the editions of 11 November 1939, and 10 January 1940.&lt;ref&gt;McInerney, 2001, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Soviet Union's acts of aggression against Finland, the [[Winter War]], Pius XII condemned the Soviet attack on 26 December 1939 in a speech at the Vatican. Later he donated a signed and sealed prayer on behalf of Finland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mil.fi/perustietoa/talvisota_eng/timer-30.html Finnish Defence Forces – The Winter War 1939–1940]. Retrieved 9 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 January 1940, after more than 15,000 Polish civilians had been killed, Pius XII said in a radio broadcast, &quot;The horror and inexcusable excesses committed on a helpless and a homeless people have been established by the unimpeachable testimony of eye-witnesses.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Gilbert|Gilbert, Sir Martin]]. ''The Second World War'', p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; In his first encyclical, ''[[Summi Pontificatus]]'' (20 October 1939), Pius XII publicly condemned the [[invasion of Poland (1939)|invasion]], [[occupation of Poland (1939-1945)|occupation]] and partition of [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] under the Nazi-Soviet [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]]. {{cquote|The blood of countless human beings, even noncombatants, raises a piteous dirge over a nation such as Our dear Poland, which, for its fidelity to the Church, for its services in the defense of Christian civilization, written in indelible characters in the annals of history, has a right to the generous and brotherly sympathy of the whole world, while it awaits, relying on the powerful intercession of Mary, Help of Christians, the hour of a resurrection in harmony with the principles of justice and true peace.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;small&gt; -- [[Summi Pontificatus]], p. 106.}}

[[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] magazine reported that France and Britain were favourably surprised by the encyclical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Monday, 6 November 1939|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,762726,00.html?promoid=googlep|title=Pius.

On 11 March 1940, the Pope had a personal meeting with German Minister of Foreign Affairs [[Joachim Ribbentrop]], who was visiting Rome. During that meeting, The German Foreign Minister suggested to the Pope an overall settlement between the Vatican and the Reich government in exchange for the Pope instructing the German bishops to refrain from political criticism of the German government, but no agreement was reached. The Vatican diplomatic record of the meeting describes what transpired as follows:&lt;blockquote&gt;He (Ribbentrop) answered that at the bottom it is a question of a revolution and that compared with other revolutions the National Socialist Revolution has not caused grave harm to the churches. To which the Pope replied that in reality there had been many injuries – and he continued to point out examples. Ribbentrop underlined that the State spends a great deal for the clergy and the Church. The Pope replied that a great deal has been taken away from the Church, houses, institutions of education – kicking out the legitimate owners malo modo in a few hours. The Holy Father insisted particularly on the schools.&lt;ref&gt;Conway, Prof. John S., &quot;The Meeting between Pope Pius XII and Ribbentrop&quot;, ''CCHA Study Sessions'', volume 35 (1968), pp. 103–16 [http://www.umanitoba.ca/colleges/st_pauls/ccha/Back%20Issues/CCHA1968/Conway.html archives from papers stored at the University of Manitoba]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After Germany invaded the [[Low Countries]] during 1940, Pius XII sent expressions of sympathy to the [[Wilhelmina of the Netherlands|Queen of the Netherlands]], the [[King of Belgium]], and the [[Grand Duchess of Luxembourg]]. When Mussolini learned of the warnings and the telegrams of sympathy, he took them as a personal affront and had his ambassador to the Vatican file an official protest, charging that Pius XII had taken sides against Italy's ally Germany. Mussolini's foreign minister claimed that Pius XII was &quot;ready to let himself be deported to a concentration camp, rather than do anything against his conscience.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Dalin, David G. ''The Myth of Hitler's Pope: How Pope Pius XII Rescued Jews from the Nazis''. Regnery Publishing: Washington, D.C. 2005; ISBN 0-89526-034-4; p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;

In the spring of 1940, a group of German generals seeking to overthrow Hitler and make peace with the British approached Pope Pius XII, who acted as a negotiator between the British and the abortive plot.&lt;ref&gt;Conway, Prof. John S., ''The Vatican, the Nazis and Pursuit of Justice''.&lt;!-- ISBN missing --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 June 1940, while the [[battle of France]] was still raging, the Pope issued encyclical ''Saeculo Exeunte Octavo'', which, though relating to [[Portugal]], made an ambiguous statement about the general situation in the following words: &quot;now, when more than a few European nations have been lost to the Church because of the changes in these calamitous times&quot;, referring to the German occupation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Pius XII|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xii/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xii_enc_13061940_saeculo-exeunte-octavo_en.html|title=Text of '&amp;#39;Saeculo Exeunte Octavo'&amp;#39;|publisher=Vatican.va|date=1940-06-13|accessdate=2011-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1941, Pius XII granted a private audience to [[Ante Pavelić]], the leader of the [[Independent State of Croatia|newly proclaimed Croatian state]] (rather than the diplomatic audience Pavelić had wanted).&lt;ref&gt;Minutes of 7 August 1941. British Public Records Office FO 371/30175 57760&lt;/ref&gt; Pius was criticised for his reception of Pavelić: an unattributed British [[Foreign Office]] memo on the subject described Pius as &quot;the greatest moral coward of our age.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Mark Aarons and John Loftus. ''Unholy Trinity'' pp. 71–72&lt;!-- ISBN missing --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The Vatican did not officially recognise Pavelić's regime. Pius XII did not publicly condemn the expulsions and forced conversions to Catholicism perpetrated on Serbs by Pavelić;&lt;ref&gt;Israel Gutman (ed.) ''Encyclopedia of the Holocaust'' vol 2, p. 739&lt;/ref&gt; however, the Holy See did expressly repudiate the forced conversions in a memorandum dated 25 January 1942, from the Vatican Secretiat of State to the Yugoslavian Legation.&lt;ref&gt;Rychlak, Ronald. ''Hitler, the War, and the Pope'' pp. 414–15, note 61.&lt;/ref&gt; The pope was well-informed of [[Catholic clergy involvement with the Ustaše]] regime, even possessing a list of clergymembers who had &quot;joined in the slaughter&quot;, but decided against condemning the regime or taking action against the involved clergy, fearing that it would lead to schism in the Croatian church or undermine the formation of a future Croatian state.&lt;ref&gt;Phayer, 2008, pp. 9–16.&lt;/ref&gt; Pius XII elevated [[Aloysius Stepinac]] — a Croatian archbishop convicted of collaborating with the [[Ustaše]] — to the cardinalate.&lt;ref&gt;Phayer, 2008, pp. 10–15, 147, 150.&lt;/ref&gt; Phayer agrees that Stepinac's was a &quot;show trial&quot;, but states &quot;the charge that he [Pius XII] supported the Ustaša regime was, of course, true, as everyone knew&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;phayerpav&quot;&gt;Phayer, 2008, p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt; and that &quot;if Stepinac had responded to the charges against him, his defense would have inevitably unraveled, exposing the Vatican's support of the [[genocide|genocidal]] Pavelić.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Phayer, 2008, p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1941, Pius XII interpreted ''[[Divini Redemptoris]]'', an [[encyclical]] of Pope Pius XI, which forbade Catholics to help communists, as not applying to military assistance to the Soviet Union. This interpretation assuaged American Roman Catholics who had previously opposed [[Lend-Lease]] arrangements with the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Ball Martinez. 1993, &quot;Pope Pius XII and the Second World War&quot;. ''Journal of Historical Review''. p. v., 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1942, Pius XII established diplomatic relations with the [[Japanese Empire]] and received ambassador [[Ken Harada (diplomat)|Ken Harada]], who remained in that position until the end of the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,777719,00.html|title=Religion: Rising Sun at the Vatican|publisher=Time Magazine|date=6 April  1942|accessdate=17 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0E15FE3D5E167B93C5AB1788D85F468485F9|title=Envoy to Vatican named; Tokyo Reports Choice of Harada Under De Facto Relations|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=17 December 2011|date=27 March 1942}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1942, Kazimierz Papée, Polish ambassador to the Vatican, complained that Pius had failed to condemn the recent wave of atrocities in Poland; when Cardinal Secretary of State Maglione replied that the Vatican could not document individual atrocities, Papée declared, &quot;when something becomes notorious, proof is not required.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Report by the Polish Ambassador to the Holy See on the Situation in German-occupied Poland, Memorandum No. 79, 29 May 1942, Myron Taylor's papers, NARA.&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1942, diplomatic relations were established with the Nationalist government of China. This step was envisaged earlier, but delayed due to Japanese pressure to establish relations with the pro-Japanese Wang Jingwei government. The first Chinese Minister to the Vatican, [[Hsieh Shou-kang]], was only able to arrive at the Vatican in January 1943, due to difficulties of travel resulting from the war. He remained in that position until late 1946.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hsstudyc.org.hk/en/tripod_en/en_tripod_153_06.html|title=Chen Fang-Chung, '&amp;#39;Lou Tseng-Tsiang: A Lover of His Church and of His Country|publisher=Hsstudyc.org.hk|accessdate=2011-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pope Pius XII's 1942 Christmas address|Pius XII's 1942 Christmas address]] via [[Vatican Radio]] remains a &quot;lightning rod&quot; in debates about Pius XII.&lt;ref&gt;Rittner and Roth, 2002, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of the speech spoke generally about human rights and civil society; at the very end of the speech, Pius XII mentioned &quot;the hundreds of thousands of persons who, without any fault on their part, sometimes only because of their nationality or race, have been consigned to death or to a slow decline&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Phayer, 2008, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; Reactions of contemporaries and scholars are divided, but the speech did denounce genocide (a term not coined until 1944), although &quot;it is still not clear ''whose'' genocide or ''which'' genocide he was referring to&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Phayer, 2008, p. xii.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several authors have [[Alleged plot to kidnap Pope Pius XII|alleged a plot to kidnap Pius XII]] by the Nazis during their occupation of Rome in 1943 (Vatican City itself was not occupied); British historian [[Owen Chadwick]] and the Jesuit [[Actes et documents du Saint Siège relatifs à la Seconde Guerre Mondiale|ADSS]] editor [[Robert A. Graham|Rev. Robert Graham]] each concluded such claims were an invention of [[Political Warfare Executive|British wartime propagandists]].&lt;ref&gt;Chadwick, 1988, pp. 256–57.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alvarez and Graham, 1997, pp. 86–88.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2007, subsequent to those accounts, Dan Kurzman published a work which he maintains establishes that the plot was a fact.&lt;ref name=&quot;kix&quot;&gt;Kurzman, 2007, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the war was approaching its end in 1945, Pius advocated a lenient policy by the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] leaders in an effort to prevent what he perceived to be the mistakes made at the end of World War I.&lt;ref&gt;Kent, 2002, pp. 87–100.&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1944, he met British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]], who was visiting Rome. At their meeting, the Pope expressed the hope that planned war crimes trials would not include Italian defendants, since he considered the Italians as victims of the Third Reich.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trumanlibrary.org/whistlestop/study_collections/nuremberg/documents/index.php?documentdate=1944-08-29&amp;documentid=C107-10-54&amp;studycollectionid=&amp;pagenumber=1|title=News Release, 28 August 1944|publisher=Trumanlibrary.org|date=29 August 1944|accessdate=12 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1939, the newly elected Pope Pius XII appointed several prominent Jewish scholars to posts at the Vatican after they had been dismissed from Italian universities under [[Italian Fascism|Fascist]] leader [[Benito Mussolini]]'s racial laws.&lt;ref&gt;Dalin, 2005, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; Pius later engineered an agreement—formally approved on 23 June 1939 — with Brazilian [[President of Brazil|President]] [[Getúlio Vargas]] to issue 3,000 [[visa (document)|visas]] to &quot;non-[[Aryan]] Catholics&quot;. However, over the next 18 months Brazil's Conselho de Imigração e Colonização (CIC) continued to tighten the restrictions on their issuance, including requiring a [[baptism|baptismal certificate]] dated before 1933, a substantial monetary transfer to the [[Banco do Brasil]], and approval by the Brazilian Propaganda Office in Berlin. The program was cancelled 14 months later, after fewer than 1,000 visas had been issued, amid suspicions of &quot;improper conduct&quot; (i.e., continuing to practice Judaism) among those who had received visas.&lt;ref name=&quot;gutman1136&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lesser, Jeffrey. 1995.

[[Cardinal Secretary of State]] Luigi Maglione received a request from [[Chief Rabbi]] of [[Palestine]] [[Yitzhak HaLevi Herzog|Isaac Herzog]] in the spring of 1940 to intercede on behalf of [[Lithuania]]n Jews about to be deported to Germany.&lt;ref name=&quot;gutman1136&quot;/&gt; Pius called [[Joachim von Ribbentrop|Ribbentrop]] on 11 March, repeatedly protesting against the treatment of Jews.&lt;ref name=&quot;McInerny-p49&quot;/&gt; In his 1939 encyclical ''[[Summi Pontificatus]]'', Pius rejected anti-semitism, stating that in the Catholic Church there is &quot;neither [[Gentile]] nor Jew, [[circumcision]] nor uncircumcision.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Dalin, 2005, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; In 1940, Pius asked members of the clergy, on Vatican letterhead, to do whatever they could on behalf of interned Jews.&lt;ref name=&quot;us081117&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Ewers, Justin|title=Sainthood on Hold|publisher=U.S. News and World Report|date=17–24 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1941, Cardinal [[Theodor Innitzer]] of [[Vienna]] informed Pius of Jewish deportations in Vienna.&lt;ref name=&quot;gutman1137&quot;&gt;Gutman, 1990, p. 1137.&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, when asked by French Marshal [[Philippe Pétain]] if the Vatican objected to antisemitic laws, Pius responded that the church condemned antisemitism, but would not comment on specific rules.&lt;ref name=&quot;gutman1137&quot; /&gt; Similarly, when [[Philippe Pétain]]'s regime adopted the &quot;Jewish statutes&quot;, the [[Vichy France|Vichy]] ambassador to the Vatican, [[Léon Bérard]] (a French politician), was told that the legislation did not conflict with Catholic teachings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Perl-p200&quot;&gt;Perl, William, The Holocaust Conspiracy, p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Valerio Valeri]], the [[nuncio]] to France was &quot;embarrassed&quot; when he learned of this publicly from Pétain&lt;ref&gt;Phayer, 2000, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; and personally checked the information with Cardinal Secretary of State Maglione&lt;ref&gt;Michael R. Marrus and Robert O. Paxton, 1981, ''Vichy France and the Jews'', New York: Basic Books, p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt; who confirmed the Vatican's position.&lt;ref&gt;Delpech, ''Les Eglises et la Persécution raciale'', p. 267.&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1942, Pius personally protested against the mass deportations of Jews from France, ordering the papal nuncio to protest to Pétain against &quot;the inhuman arrests and deportations of Jews&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Dalin, 2005, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1941, Pius objected to a [[Slovakia]]n Jewish Code,&lt;ref&gt;John F. Morley, 1980, ''Vatican Diplomacy and the Jews during the Holocaust, 1939–1943'', New York: KTAV, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; which, unlike the earlier Vichy codes, prohibited intermarriage between Jews and non-Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Phayer, 2000, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1941, Harold Tittman, a U.S. delegate to the Vatican, asked the pope to condemn the atrocities against Jews; Pius replied that the Vatican wished to remain &quot;neutral,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Perl, William, The Holocaust Conspiracy, p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt; reiterating the neutrality policy which Pius invoked as early as September 1940.&lt;ref name=&quot;Perl-p200&quot;/&gt;

In 1942, the Slovakian [[chargé d'affaires]] told Pius that [[Slovakian]] Jews were being sent to concentration camps.&lt;ref name=&quot;gutman1137&quot;/&gt; On 11 March 1942, several days before the first transport was due to leave, the chargé d'affaires in [[Bratislava]] reported to the Vatican: &quot;I have been assured that this atrocious plan is the handwork of ... Prime Minister ([[Vojtech Tuka|Tuka]]), who confirmed the plan ... he dared to tell me — he who makes such a show of his Catholicism — that he saw nothing inhuman or un-Christian in it ... the deportation of 80,000 persons to Poland, is equivalent to condemning a great number of them to certain death.&quot; The Vatican protested to the Slovak government that it &quot;deplore(s) these... measures which gravely hurt the natural human rights of persons, merely because of their race.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Lapide, 1980, p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 September 1942, Pius received a letter from Monsignor Montini (future [[Pope Paul VI]]), saying, &quot;the massacres of the Jews reach frightening proportions and forms.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;gutman1137&quot;/&gt; Later that month, [[Myron Taylor]], U.S. representative to the Vatican, warned Pius that the Vatican's &quot;moral prestige&quot; was being injured by silence on European atrocities, a warning which was echoed simultaneously by representatives from the United Kingdom, Brazil, [[Uruguay]], Belgium, and Poland.&lt;ref&gt;Phayer, 2000, pp. 27–28.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Cardinal Secretary of State]] replied that the rumors about genocide could not be verified.&lt;ref&gt;Israel Pocket Library, Holocaust, p. 133; Gutman, Israel, ''Encyclopedia of the Holocaust'', p. 1137.&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1942, when Tittman asked Cardinal Secretary of State Maglione if Pius would issue a proclamation similar to the Allied declaration &quot;German Policy of Extermination of the Jewish Race&quot;, Maglione replied that the Vatican was &quot;unable to denounce publicly particular atrocities.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hilberg, Raul, ''The Destruction of the European Jews'', p. 315.&lt;/ref&gt; Pius XII directly explained to Tittman that he could not name the Nazis without at the same time mentioning the Bolsheviks.&lt;ref&gt;Hilberg, Raul, ''The Destruction of the European Jews'', (2003) 3rd edition, pp. 1204–05.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pius XII never publicly condemned the Nazi massacre of 1,800,000–1,900,000 Poles, overwhelmingly Roman Catholic (including 2,935 members of the Catholic clergy),&lt;ref&gt;United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, [http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/article.php?lang=en&amp;ModuleId=10005473 Polish Victims].

Retrieved 17 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; nor did he ever publicly condemn the Soviet Union for the deaths of 1,000,000 Poles including an untold number of clergy.&lt;ref&gt;Poland's Holocaust, Tadeusz Piotrowski, 1998 ISBN 0-7864-0371-3; p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1942, Pius XII advised German and Hungarian bishops to speak out against the massacres on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]].&lt;ref&gt;Israel Pocket Library, Holocaust, p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1942 Christmas Eve message, he expressed strong concern for &quot;those hundreds of thousands, who ... sometimes only by reason of their nationality or race, are marked down for death or progressive extinction.&lt;ref&gt;Dalin, 2005, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 April 1943, Msgr. Tardini, one of Pius' closest advisors, told Pius that it would be politically advantageous after the war to take steps to help Slovakian Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} Actes et documents du Saint Siège relatifs à la Seconde Guerre mondiale/éd. par Pierre Blet, Angelo Martini, Burkhart Schneider and Robert Graham (7 April 1943).&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1943, Pius declined to publicly denounce the Nazi discrimination against Jews, following requests to do so from [[Władysław Raczkiewicz]], president of the Polish [[government-in-exile]], and Bishop [[Konrad von Preysing]] of Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;Israel Pocket Library, Holocaust, p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 September 1943, following the German occupation of northern Italy, Nazi officials gave Jewish leaders in Rome 36 hours to produce 50 kilograms of gold (or the equivalent) threatening to take 300 hostages. Then Chief Rabbi of Rome [[Israel Zolli]] recounts in his memoir that he was selected to go to the Vatican and seek help.&lt;ref&gt;Zolli, Eugenio. ''Before the Dawn''. Reissued in 1997 as ''Why I Became a Catholic''.&lt;/ref&gt; The Vatican offered to loan 15 kilos, but the offer proved unnecessary when the Jews received an extension.&lt;ref&gt;Israel Pocket Library, Holocaust, p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt; Soon afterward, when deportations from Italy were imminent, 477 Jews were hidden in the Vatican itself and another 4,238 were protected in Roman monasteries and convents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/vat_hol12.htm|title=The role of the Roman Catholic Church in the Shoah (Nazi Holocaust)|publisher=Religioustolerance.org|accessdate=6 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eighty percent of Roman Jews were saved from deportation.&lt;ref&gt;Dalin, 2005, pp. 82–85&lt;/ref&gt; Phayer argues that the German diplomats in Rome were the &quot;initiators of the effort to save the city's Jews&quot;, but holds that Pius XII &quot;cooperated in this attempt at rescue&quot;, while agreeing with Zuccotti that the pope &quot;did not give orders&quot; for any Roman Catholic institution to hide Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Phayer, 2008, p. xiii.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 April 1943, Pius wrote to Bishop [[Konrad von Preysing|Graf von Preysing]] of Berlin to say: &quot;We give to the pastors who are working on the local level the duty of determining if and to what degree the danger of reprisals and of various forms of oppression occasioned by episcopal declarations... ''ad maiora mala vitanda'' (to avoid worse)... seem to advise caution. Here lies one of the reasons, why We impose self-restraint on Ourselves in our speeches; the experience, that we made in 1942 with papal addresses, which We authorized to be forwarded to the Believers, justifies our opinion, as far as We see.... The Holy See has done whatever was in its power, with charitable, financial and moral assistance. To say nothing of the substantial sums which we spent in American money for the fares of immigrants.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Letter of Pius XII of 30 April 1943 to the Bischop of Berlin, Graf von Preysing, published in &quot;Documentation catholique&quot; of 2 February 1964.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 October 1943, [[Ernst von Weizsäcker]], the German Ambassador to the Vatican, telegrammed Berlin that &quot;...the Pope has not yet let himself be persuaded to make an official condemnation of the deportation of the Roman Jews.... Since it is currently thought that the Germans will take no further steps against the Jews in Rome, the question of our relations with the Vatican may be considered closed.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Lang, Berel.

In March 1944, through the papal nuncio in [[Budapest]], Angelo Rotta, the pope urged the [[Hungary|Hungarian]] government to moderate its treatment of the Jews.&lt;ref name=&quot;gutman1138&quot;&gt;Gutman, Israel, Encyclopedia of the Holocaust, p. 1138.&lt;/ref&gt; The pope ordered Rotta and other papal legates to hide and shelter Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Dalin, 2005, pp. 87–89&lt;/ref&gt; These protests, along with others from the King of Sweden, the International Red Cross, the United States, and Britain led to the cessation of deportations on 8 July 1944.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, Martin, ''The Holocaust'', p. 701.&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1944, Pius appealed to 13 Latin American governments to accept &quot;emergency passports&quot;, although it also took the intervention of the U.S. State Department for those countries to honor the documents.&lt;ref&gt;Perl, William, The Holocaust Conspiracy, p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ernst Kaltenbrunner|Kaltenbrunner Report]] to Hitler, dated 29 November 1944, against the backdrop of the [[20 July plot|20 July 1944 Plot to assassinate Hitler]], states that the Pope was somehow a conspirator, specifically naming Eugenio Pacelli (Pope Pius XII), as being a party in the attempt.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.transworldnews.com/NewsStory.aspx?id=95893&amp;cat=15 ''Pave the Way Foundation Reveals Evidence of Pope Pius XII's Active Opposition to Hitler''], 24 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

After World War II Pope Pius XII focused on material aid to war-torn Europe, an internal internationalization of the Roman Catholic Church, and the development of its worldwide diplomatic relations. His encyclicals, ''[[Evangelii Praecones]]'' and ''[[Fidei Donum]]'', issued on 2 June 1951 and 21 April 1957, respectively, increased the local decision-making of Catholic missions, many of which became independent dioceses. Pius XII demanded recognition of local cultures as fully equal to European culture.&lt;ref&gt;Audience for the directors of mission activities in 1944 A.A.S., 1944, p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Evangelii Praecones]]''. p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; Continuing the line of his predecessors, Pius XII supported the establishment of local administration in Church affairs: in 1950, the hierarchy of Western Africa became independent; in 1951, Southern Africa; and in 1953, [[British East Africa]]. Finland, [[Burma]] and [[French Africa]] became independent dioceses in 1955.

;Jewish orphans controversy
{{Main|Jewish orphans controversy}}
In 2005, ''[[Corriere della Sera]]'' published a document dated 20 November 1946 on the subject of Jewish children baptized in war-time France. The document ordered that baptized children, if orphaned, should be kept in Catholic custody and stated that the decision &quot;has been approved by the Holy Father&quot;. Nuncio [[Pope John XXIII|Angelo Roncalli]] (who became Pope John XXIII, and was recognized by [[Yad Vashem]] as [[Righteous Among the Nations]]) ignored this directive.&lt;ref&gt;Jerusalem Report, (7 February 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abe Foxman]], the national director of the [[Anti-Defamation League]] (ADL), who had himself been baptized as a child and had undergone a custody battle afterwards, called for an immediate freeze on Pius's beatification process until the relevant [[Vatican Secret Archives]] and baptismal records were opened.&lt;ref&gt;Anti-Defamation League. [http://www.adl.org/Interfaith/adl_vatican.asp ''ADL to Vatican: &quot;Open Baptismal Records and Put Pius Beatification on Hold&quot;'']. 13 January 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Two Italian scholars, Matteo Luigi Napolitano and Andrea Tornielli, confirmed that the memorandum was genuine although the reporting by the ''Corriere della Sera'' was misleading, as the document had originated in the French Catholic Church archives rather than the Vatican archives and strictly concerned itself with children without living blood relatives who were supposed to be handed over to Jewish organizations.&lt;ref&gt;Cavalli, Dimitri.

==Later life, illness and death==
===Late years of Pope Pius XII===
{{Main|Late years of Pope Pius XII}}
The last years of the [[pontificate]] of Pius XII began in late 1954 with a long illness, during which he considered [[abdication]]. Afterwards, changes in his work habit became noticeable. The Pope avoided long ceremonies, canonizations and consistories and displayed hesitancy in personnel matters. During the last years of the pontificate, Pius XII [[procrastinate]]d personnel decisions within his [[Roman Curia|Vatican]], and found it increasingly difficult to chastise subordinates and appointees such as [[Riccardo Galeazzi-Lisi]], who, after numerous indiscretions was excluded from Papal service for the last years, but, keeping his title, was able to enter the papal apartments to make photos of the dying Pope, which he sold to French magazines.&lt;ref&gt;Schneider, p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; Pius underwent cellular rejuvenation treatment, three courses, administered by Dr Paul Niehans, the most important in 1954 when Pacelli was gravely ill. Side-effects of the treatment included hallucinations, from which the Pope suffered in his last years. &quot;These years were also plagued by horrific nightmares. Pacelli's blood-curdling screams could be heard throughout the papal apartments.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Gerard Noel, ''Pius XII, The Hound of Hitler'', p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

Pius XII often elevated young priests as bishops, such as [[Julius Döpfner]] (35 years) and Karol Wojtyla (later [[Pope John Paul II]], 38 years), one of his last appointees in 1958. He took a firm stand against pastoral experiments, such as &quot;[[worker-priest]]s&quot;, who worked full time in factories and joined political parties and unions. He continued to defend the theological tradition of [[Thomism]] as worthy of continued reform, and as superior to modern trends such as [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] or [[existentialism]].&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Humani Generis]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Illness and death===
[[File:Tumulo pio xii.jpg|thumb|right|''The Pope of Mary'': A [[Madonna and Child]], added by John XXIII, hangs over the tomb of Pius XII.]]
{{Main|Death of Pope Pius XII}}
Following his 1954 illness, Pope Pius still addressed lay people and groups about a wide range of topics. Frequently he spoke to members of scientific congresses, setting out Christian teachings in light of  recent scientific findings.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} Sometimes he answered specific moral questions, which were addressed to him. To professional associations he explained specific occupational ethics in light of Church teachings. Pius granted the Honor of Being the &quot;Catholic University of The Philippines&quot; to the [[University of Santo Tomas]] in Manila.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} Robert Leiber helped him occasionally with his speeches and publications. [[Augustin Bea|Cardinal Augustine Bea SJ]] was his personal confessor. [[Pascalina Lehnert|Sister Pasqualina]] was for forty years his &quot;housekeeper, muse and lifelong companion&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Noel, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

Pius XII died on 9 October 1958 of acute [[heart failure]] brought on by a sudden [[myocardial infarction]] in [[Castel Gandolfo]], the Papal summer residence. His doctor Gaspanini said afterwards: &quot;The Holy Father did not die because of any specific illness. He was completely exhausted. He was overworked beyond limit. His heart was healthy, his lungs were good. He could have lived another 20 years, had he spared himself.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Lehnert, Pascalina, p. 191&lt;/ref&gt;

===Botched embalming===
Pius XII's physician, Dr. [[Riccardo Galeazzi-Lisi]], reported that the Pontiff's body was embalmed in the room where he died using a novel process invented by Dr. [[Oreste Nuzzi]].&lt;ref name=ModernMummies&gt;{{cite book|title=Modern Mummies|first=Christine|last=Quigley|year=1998|url=http://books.google.com/?id=ZOqU-9BTZO4C&amp;pg=PA204&amp;lpg=PA204&amp;dq=Galeazzi-Lisi+%22Pius+XII%22+embalming|publisher=McFarland &amp; Co.|isbn=978-0-7864-0492-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pope Pius XII did not want the vital organs removed from his body, demanding instead, that it be kept in the same condition, &quot;in which God created it&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Associated Press, 11 October 1958&quot;&gt;Associated Press, 11 October 1958&lt;/ref&gt; According to Galeazzi-Lisi, this was the reason why he and Professor Nuzzi, an embalmer from [[Naples]], used a novel embalming approach invented by Nuzzi.&lt;ref name=&quot;Associated Press, 11 October 1958&quot;/&gt; In a controversial press conference, Galeazzi-Lisi described in great detail the embalming the body of the late Pontiff. He claimed to have used the same system of oils and resins, with which the body of Jesus Christ was preserved.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Pope's Body Embalmed with Special Process&quot;, [[Associated Press]] (AP), Rome, 11 October 1958&lt;/ref&gt;

Galeazzi-Lisi asserted that the new process would &quot;preserve the body indefinitely in its natural state&quot;&lt;ref name=ModernMummies/&gt; However, whatever chance the new embalming process of efficaciously preserving the body was obliterated by intense heat in Castel Gandolfo during the embalming process. As a result, the body decomposed rapidly and the viewing of the faithful had to be terminated abruptly. Galeazzi-Lisi reported that heat in the halls, where the body of the late Pope lay in state, caused chemical reactions which required it to be treated twice after the original preparation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Associated Press, 11 October 1958&quot;/&gt; Swiss Guards stationed around Pius XII's body were reported to have become ill during their vigil.&lt;ref name=ModernMummies/&gt;

===Funeral===
His funeral procession into Rome was the largest congregation of Romans as of that date. Romans mourned &quot;their&quot; Pope, who was born in their city, especially as hero in time of war.&lt;ref&gt;Lehnert, Pascalina. ''Ich durfte ihm dienen'', p. 197&lt;/ref&gt; Angelo Cardinal Roncalli (later [[Pope John XXIII]]) wrote in his diary on 11 October that probably no Roman emperor had enjoyed such a triumph, which he viewed as a reflection of the spiritual majesty and religious dignity of Pius XII.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Hebblethwaite|Hebblethwaite, Peter]]. ''John XXIII, Pope of the Council'' (revised edition), Harper Collins: Glasgow. 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cause for canonization==
{{Main|Canonization of Pope Pius XII}}
The [[Testament of Pope Pius XII]] was published immediately after his death. Pope Pius XII's [[Congregation for the Causes of Saints|cause of canonization]] was opened on 18 November 1965 by Pope Paul VI. In May 2007, the congregation recommended that Pius XII should be declared [[Venerable]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/0702592.htm|title=CNS STORY: Sainthood congregation recommends Pope Pius XII be named venerable|publisher=Catholicnews.com|accessdate=6 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pope Benedict XVI]] did so on 19 December 2009, simultaneously making the same declaration in regard to Pope John Paul II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article6962638.ece|title=Pope John Paul II and Pope Pius XII move closer to sainthood|publisher=The Times|date=19 December 2009|accessdate=25 September 2011|location=London|first=Laura|last=Pitel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views, interpretations, and scholarship==
===Contemporary===
During the war, ''Time'' magazine credited Pius XII and the Catholic Church for &quot;fighting [[totalitarianism]] more knowingly, devoutly, and authoritatively, and for a longer time, than any other organized power&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Time. 16 August 1943.&lt;/ref&gt; During the war he was also praised editorially by the ''[[New York Times]]'' for opposing Nazi anti-Semitism and aggression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicleague.org/pius.php?id=21|title=New York Times 25 December 1941 and 25 December 1942|publisher=Catholicleague.org|accessdate=12 September 2010|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100731121713/http://www.catholicleague.org/pius.php?id=21 &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt;|archivedate=31 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some early works echoed these favorable sentiments, including Polish historian [[Oskar Halecki]]'s ''Pius XII: Eugenio Pacelli: Pope of peace'' (1954) and Nazareno Padellaro's ''Portrait of Pius XII'' (1949).

Many Jews{{Who|date=January 2012}} publicly thanked the pope for his help. [[Pinchas Lapide]], a Jewish theologian and Israeli diplomat to Milan in the 1960s, estimated controversially in ''[[Three Popes and the Jews]]'' that Pius &quot;was instrumental in saving at least 700,000 but probably as many as 860,000 Jews from certain death at Nazi hands.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Lapide, Pinchas. ''Three Popes and the Jews'', 1967, quoted in Dalin, 2005, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Some historians have questioned this&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Gilbert, Martin. ''The Holocaust'', p. 623.&lt;/ref&gt; often cited number, which Lapide reached by &quot;deducting all reasonable claims of rescue&quot; by non-Catholics from the total number of European Jews surviving the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]].&lt;ref&gt;Lapide, 1967, p. 269.&lt;/ref&gt; A Roman Catholic scholar, Kevin Madigan, has interpreted this and other praise from prominent Jewish leaders, including [[Golda Meir]], as less than sincere, an attempt to secure Vatican recognition of the [[Israel|State of Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;''&quot;Lapide was in the 1960s an Israeli consul in Milan and was attempting, at the time he made his inflated estimates, to secure Vatican recognition for the state of Israel. Similar motives explain statements made in the immediate postwar period by Golda Meir and Moshe Sharett, foreign ministers of the new state of Israel. Had these statements been accurate within even an order of magnitude, Pius would perhaps deserve to be honored by [[Yad Vashem]] and celebrated by Rabbi Dalin as a righteous gentile. They were not. Whatever was thus gained diplomatically by these statements--in the short run, precious little--was purchased at the cost of considerable historical untruth.&quot;'' in ''Christian Century'', &quot;Judging Pius XII&quot; by Kevin Madigan. 14 March 2001, pp. 6-7; see also ''The Pius war: responses to the critics of Pius XII'' by J. Bottum &amp; D. Dalin, 2004, p. 190&lt;/ref&gt;

After Pius XII's death on 9 October 1958 many Jewish organizations and newspapers around the world paid tribute to his legacy. At the United Nations, Golda Meir, Israel's Foreign Minister, said, &quot;When fearful martyrdom came to our people in the decade of Nazi terror, the voice of the Pope was raised for the victims. The life of our times was enriched by a voice speaking out on the great moral truths above the tumult of daily conflict.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/issues/pius12gs.htm|title=The Good Samaritan. Jewish Praise for Pope Pius XII by Dimitri Cavalli|publisher=Ewtn.com|accessdate=12 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Jewish Chronicle'' (London) stated on 10 October that &quot;Adherents of all creeds and parties will recall how Pius XII faced the responsibilities of his exalted office with courage and devotion.

Pius was also criticized during his lifetime. [[Leon Poliakov]] wrote in 1950 that Pius had been a tacit supporter of [[Vichy France]]'s anti-Semitic laws, calling him &quot;less forthright&quot; than [[Pope Pius XI]] either out of &quot;Germanophilia&quot; or the hope that Hitler would defeat communist Russia.&lt;ref&gt;Poliakov, Leon. November 1950. &quot;The Vatican and the 'Jewish Question': The Record of the Hitler Period – and After.&quot; ''Commentary'' 10: pp. 439–49.&lt;/ref&gt; Bishop [[Carlos Duarte Costa]], a long-time critic of Pius XII's policies during the war and an opponent of [[clerical celibacy]] and the [[Sacred language|use of Latin as language of the liturgy]], was [[excommunication|excommunicated]] by Pius XII on 2 July 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Redmile, Robert David. 2006.

On 21 September 1945, the general secretary of the World Jewish Council, Dr. Leon Kubowitzky, presented an amount of money to the pope, &quot;in recognition of the work of the Holy See in rescuing Jews from Fascist and Nazi persecutions.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;McInerney, 2001, p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt; After the war, in the autumn of 1945, Harry Greenstein from [[Baltimore]], a close friend of Chief Rabbi Herzog of [[Jerusalem]], told Pius how grateful Jews were for all he had done for them. &quot;My only regret&quot;, the pope replied, &quot;is not to have been able to save a greater number of Jews.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;McInerney, Ralph, ''The Defamation of Pius XII'', 2001.&lt;!-- ISBN missing --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Deputy''===
{{Main|The Deputy}}
[[File:1899eugenio.jpg|thumb|right|A rare 1899 handwriting of Eugenio Pacelli with text in [[Latin]]]]

In 1963, [[Rolf Hochhuth]]'s controversial drama ''[[The Deputy|Der Stellvertreter. Ein christliches Trauerspiel]]'' (''The Deputy, a Christian tragedy'', released in English in 1964) portrayed Pope Pius XII as a hypocrite who remained silent about the Holocaust. Books such as Dr. Joseph Lichten's ''A Question of Judgment'' (1963), written in response to ''The Deputy'', defended Pius XII's actions during the war. Lichten labelled any criticism of the pope's actions during World War II as &quot;a stupefying paradox&quot; and said, &quot;no one who reads the record of Pius XII's actions on behalf of Jews can subscribe to Hochhuth's accusation.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Lichten, 1963, ''[http://www.catholicleague.org/piusxii_and_the_holocaust/quesjud5.htm A Question of Judgement]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Critical scholarly works like [[Guenter Lewy]]'s controversial ''The Catholic Church and Nazi Germany'' (1964) also followed the publication of ''The Deputy''. Lewy's conclusion was that &quot;the Pope and his advisers – influenced by the long tradition of moderate anti-Semitism so widely accepted in Vatican circles – did not view the plight of the Jews with a real sense of urgency and moral outrage. For this assertion no documentation is possible, but it is a conclusion difficult to avoid&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Marchione, 2000, pp. 16–17.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002 the play was adapted into the film, ''[[Amen.]]''. An article on ''[[La Civilità Cattolica]]'' in March 2009 indicated that the accusations that Hochhuth's play made widely known originated not among Jews but in the Communist bloc. It was on Moscow Radio, on 2 June 1945, that the first accusation directly against Pius XII of refusing to speak out against the exterminations in Nazi concentration camps. It was also the first medium to call him &quot;Hitler's Pope&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Giovanni Sale, ''Il Novecento tra genocidi, paure e speranze'', Jaca Book, Milan 2006, p. 214, quoted in ''[[La Civiltà Cattolica]]'', 2009, I 540&lt;/ref&gt;

A former high-ranking KGB officer, [[Securitate]] General [[Ion Mihai Pacepa]] stated in 2007 that Hochhuth's play and numerous publications attacking Pius XII as a Nazi sympathizer were fabrications that were part of a [[KGB]] and [[Eastern bloc]] [[Marxism|Marxist]] secret services [[disinformation]] campaign, named [[Seat 12]], to discredit the moral authority of the Church and Christianity in the west.&lt;ref name=&quot;article.nationalreview.com&quot;&gt;[http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=YTUzYmJhMGQ5Y2UxOWUzNDUyNWUwODJiOTEzYjY4NzI= &quot;Moscow's Assault on the Vatican&quot;], ''[[National Review Online]]'', 25 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Pacepa indicated that he was involved in contacting eastern bloc agents close the Vatican in order to fabricate the story to be used for the attack against the wartime pope.&lt;ref name=&quot;article.nationalreview.com&quot;/&gt;

===''Actes''===
{{Main|Actes et documents du Saint Siège relatifs à la Seconde Guerre Mondiale}}
In the aftermath of the controversy surrounding ''The Deputy'', in 1964, [[Pope Paul VI]] authorized Jesuit scholars to access the Vatican State Department Archives, which are normally not opened for seventy-five years. Actes et documents du Saint Siège relatifs à la Seconde Guerre Mondiale, was published in 11 volumes between 1965 and 1981. The volumes were published by Angelo Martini, Burkhart Schneider, Robert Graham and Pierre Blet. Blet also published a summary of the 11 volumes.&lt;ref&gt;Blet, Pierre. ''Pius XII and the Second World War'', Paulist Press, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Hitler's Pope'' and ''The Myth of Hitler's Pope''===
{{Main|Hitler's Pope|The Myth of Hitler's Pope}}
In 1999, [[John Cornwell (writer)|John Cornwell]]'s ''Hitler's Pope'' criticized Pius for not doing enough, or speaking out enough, against the Holocaust. Cornwell argued that Pius' entire career as the nuncio to Germany, cardinal secretary of state, and pope was characterized by a desire to increase and centralize the power of the Papacy, and that he subordinated opposition to the Nazis to that goal. He further argued that Pius was [[anti-Semitism|anti-Semitic]] and that this stance prevented him from caring about the European Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Phayer, 2000, pp. xii–xiii.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:hitlerspope.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The cover of ''Hitler's Pope'', showing Nuncio Pacelli leaving the residence of [[President of Germany|President]] [[Paul von Hindenburg|Hindenburg]] in 1927.]]

Cornwell's work was the first to have access to testimonies from Pius' [[beatification]] process as well as to many documents from Pacelli's nunciature which had just been opened under the 75-year rule by the Vatican State Secretary archives.&lt;ref&gt;Sanchez, 2002, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; Cornwell's work received both praise and criticism.  While works such as [[Susan Zuccotti]]'s ''[[Under His Very Windows: The Vatican and the Holocaust in Italy]]'' (2000) and [[Michael Phayer]]'s ''The Catholic Church and the Holocaust, 1930–1965'' (2000) are critical of both Cornwell and Pius XII; [[Ronald J. Rychlak]]'s ''Hitler, the War and the Pope'' is critical as well but defends Pius XII in light of his access to most recent documents.&lt;ref&gt;Rychlak, Ronald J. ''Hitler, the War and the Pope'' Genesis Press, Columbus, MS: 2000, pp 401 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cornwell's scholarship has been criticized. For example, Kenneth L. Woodward stated in his review in ''Newsweek'' that &quot;errors of fact and ignorance of context appear on almost every page.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth L. Woodward. ''The Case Against Pius Xii'', ''Newsweek''. 27 September 1999. http://www.newsweek.com/id/89597&lt;/ref&gt; Five years after the publication of ''Hitler's Pope'', Cornwell stated: &quot;I would now argue, in the light of the debates and evidence following ''Hitler's Pope'', that Pius XII had so little scope of action that it is impossible to judge the motives for his silence during the war, while Rome was under the heel of Mussolini and later occupied by Germany&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''The Economist'', 9 December 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/books/displayStory.cfm?story_id=3471137 &quot;For God's sake&quot;]. ''The Economist''. 9 December 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Cornwell, ''The Pontiff in Winter'' (2004), p. 193&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 2003 book, ''[[A Moral Reckoning]]'', [[Daniel Goldhagen]], asserts that Pius &quot;chose again and again not to mention the Jews publicly.... [In] public statements by Pius XII ... any mention of the Jews is conspicuously absent.&quot; In a review of Goldhagen's book, [[Mark Riebling]] counters that Pius used the word &quot;Jew&quot; in his first encyclical, ''Summi Pontificatus'', published on 20 October 1939. &quot;There Pius insisted that all human beings be treated charitably – for, as [[Saint Paul|Paul]] had written to the [[Colossians]], in God's eyes &quot;there is neither Gentile nor Jew.&quot; In saying this, the Pope affirmed that Jews were full members of the human community – which is Goldhagen's own criterion for establishing 'dissent from the anti-Semitic creed.'&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://markriebling.blogs.com/files/jesus-jews-shoah.pdf|title=Mark Riebling, &quot;Jesus, Jews, and the Shoah&quot;, '&amp;#39;National Review'&amp;#39;, 27 January 2003|format=PDF|accessdate=2011-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David G. Dalin|Rabbi David Dalin]]'s ''[[The Myth of Hitler's Pope]]'' argues that critics of Pius are liberal Catholics and ex-Catholics who &quot;exploit the tragedy of the Jewish people during the Holocaust to foster their own political agenda of forcing changes on the Catholic Church today&quot; and that Pius XII was responsible for saving the lives of many thousands of Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Dalin, 2005, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

===International Catholic-Jewish Historical Commission===
{{Main|International Catholic-Jewish Historical Commission}}
In 1999, in an attempt to address some of this controversy, the International Catholic-Jewish Historical Commission (Historical Commission), a group of three Catholic and three Jewish scholars was appointed, respectively, by the [[Holy See]]'s Commission for Religious Relations with the Jews (Holy See's Commission) and the International Jewish Committee for Interreligious Consultations (IJCIC), to whom a preliminary report was issued in October 2000.&lt;ref name=&quot;ICJHC&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=The Vatican and the Holocaust: A Preliminary Report|author=International Catholic-Jewish Historical Commission|year=2000|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Holocaust/vatrep.html|publisher=Jewish Virtual Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Commission did not discover any documents, but had the agreed-upon task to review the existing Vatican volumes, that make up the ''Actes et Documents du Saint Siege (ADSS)''&lt;ref&gt;Preliminary Report, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; The Commission was internally divided over the question of access to additional documents from the Holy See, access to the news media by individual commission members, and, questions to be raised in the preliminary report. It was agreed to include all 47 individual questions by the six members, and use them as Preliminary Report.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gerard P Fogarty, Vatican/Holocaust&quot;&gt;Fogarty, Gerard P., ''The Vatican and the Holocaust, Presentation to the Dominican House of Studies, Washington, D.C.'', 9 December 2000&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the 47 questions, the commission issued no findings of its own. It stated that it was not their task to sit in judgment of the Pope and his advisors but to contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the papacy during the Holocaust.&lt;ref&gt;Preliminary Report, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

The 47 questions by the six scholars were grouped into three parts: (a) 27 specific questions on existing documents,&lt;ref&gt;Pages 5–10&lt;/ref&gt; mostly asking for background and additional information such as drafts of the encyclical ''[[Mit brennender Sorge]]'', which was largely written by Eugenio Pacelli.&lt;ref&gt;Question One&lt;/ref&gt; (b) Fourteen questions dealt with themes of individual volumes,&lt;ref&gt;Pages 10–13&lt;/ref&gt; such as the question how Pius viewed the role of the Church during the war.&lt;ref&gt;Question 28&lt;/ref&gt; (c) Six general questions,&lt;ref&gt;Pages 13–14&lt;/ref&gt; such as the absence of any anti-communist sentiments in the documents.&lt;ref&gt;Question 42&lt;/ref&gt; The disagreement between members over additional documents locked up up under the Holy See's 70 year rule resulted in a discontinuation of the Commission in 2001 on friendly terms.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gerard P Fogarty, Vatican/Holocaust&quot;/&gt; Unsatisfied with the findings, Dr. Michael Marrus, one of the three Jewish members of the Commission, said the commission &quot;ran up against a brick wall .... It would have been really helpful to have had support from the Holy See on this issue.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Melissa Radler. &quot;Vatican Blocks Panel's Access to Holocaust Archives.&quot; ''The Jerusalem Post''. 24 July 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter Stanford]], a Catholic journalist and writer, wrote, regarding ''Fatal Silence: the pope, the resistance and the German occupation of Rome'' (written by Robert Katz; ISBN 0297846612; Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, 2003): &quot;[The Vatican] still refuses to open all its files from the period - which seems to me to be a conclusive admission of guilt - but Katz has winkled various papers out of God's business address on earth to add to the stash of new information he has uncovered in America in the archives of the Office of Strategic Services. From this we learn that, although Pius's defenders still say that he paid a golden ransom in a vain effort to save Rome's Jews from transportation to the death camps, the most he did was indicate a willingness to chip in if the Jews could not raise the sum demanded. He also shows that no individual Jews were spared, as is often claimed, after Pius personally intervened with the Nazis. Moreover, Katz reveals that those who did escape the Nazi round-up and found sanctuary in church buildings in Rome did so in the face of explicit opposition from the Vatican. The real heroes and heroines were the priests and nuns who refused to bow to Pius's officials and hand over the desperate people whom they were hiding. The main problem with writing about Pius's wartime is that in effect, he did nothing. Facing the murders of six million people, he remained silent. As Jews were taken away from the ghetto that sat right alongside St Peter's, he may have agonised, but he did not intervene. When he did raise his voice with the German occupiers, it was either to ensure that the Vatican City state would not be compromised - that is to say, he would be safe - or to emphasise his own neutrality in a conflict which, for many, became a battle between good and evil. His unrealistic hope was that the Catholic Church could emerge as the peacemaker across Europe. Instead, both the American and British leaderships, as Katz shows, regarded the papacy as tainted by its association with Nazism and irrelevant in the post-1945 reshaping of the Continent. Both had urged Pius to speak up against the Holocaust and so drew their own conclusions about him. Far from being a saint, then, he was at best a fool, perhaps an anti-Semite and probably a coward.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Stanford, Peter J. &quot;Catholic guilt&quot;, 13 October 2003, [http://www.newstatesman.com/200310130045] in review of ''Fatal Silence: the pope, the resistance and the German occupation of Rome'', written by Robert Katz; ISBN 0297846612. Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recent developments===
Phayer's ''[[Pius XII, The Holocaust, and the Cold War]]'' (2008) makes use of many documents that have recently come to light due to [[Bill Clinton]]'s 1997 executive order declassifying wartime and postwar documents, many of which are currently at the [[US National Archives]] and [[Holocaust Memorial Museum]]. These documents include diplomatic correspondence, American espionage, and even decryptions of German communications. Relevant documents have also been released by the [[Argentine government]] and the [[British Foreign Office]] and other information sources have become available, including the diary of Bishop [[Joseph Patrick Hurley|Hurley]]. These documents reveal new information about Pius XII's actions regarding the [[Ustaše]] regime, the genocides in Poland, the finances of the wartime church, the deportation of the Roman Jews, and the [[Ratlines (history)|postwar &quot;ratlines&quot;]] for Nazis and fascists fleeing Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Phayer, 2008, pp. xi–xvi.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Phayer, &quot;the face of Pope Pius that we see in these documents is not the same face we see in the eleven volumes the Vatican published of World War II documents, a collection which, though valuable, is nonetheless critically flawed because of its many omissions&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Phayer, 2008, p. xi.&lt;/ref&gt;

A special conference of scholars on Pius XII on the 50th anniversary of his death was held in Rome on 15–17 September 2008, by [[Pave the Way Foundation]], a nonsectarian organization founded by Gary Krupp, a Jewish American, which promotes interfaith cooperation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ptwf.org/Downloads/International%20News%20on%20our%20Symposium.pdf|title=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/speeches/2008/se|format=PDF|accessdate=12 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pope [[Benedict XVI]] held on 19 September 2008 a reception for the conference participants, where he praised Pius XII as a pope who made every effort to save Jews during the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/speeches/2008/september/documents/hf_ben-xvi_spe_20080918_pave-the-way_en.html|title=Address at the conclusion of the symposium organized by the &quot;Pave the Way Foundation&quot;|publisher=Vatican.va|date=19 September 2008|accessdate=6 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second conference was held from 6–8 November 2008 by the Pontifical Academy of Life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/new.php?n=12968|title=Vatican recalls life and teachings of Pius XII 50 years after his death|publisher=Catholicnewsagency.com|accessdate=6 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 October 2008, the 50th anniversary of Pius XII's death, [[Benedict XVI]] celebrated pontifical mass in his memory. Shortly prior to, and after the mass, dialectics continued between the Jewish hierarchy and the Vatican as Rabbi Shear Yeshuv Cohen of Haifa addressed the Synod of Bishops and expressed his disappointment towards Pius XII's &quot;silence&quot; during the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Donadio|first=Rachel|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/10/world/europe/10briefs-POPEDEFENDSP_BRF.html?ref=world|title=Synod Controversy|location=Italy|publisher=Nytimes.com|date=2008-10-09|accessdate=2011-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 June 2009, the [[Pave the Way Foundation]] announced that it would release of 2,300 pages of documents in [[Avellino, Italy]], dating from 1940 to 1945, which the organization claims show that Pius XII &quot;worked diligently to save Jews from Nazi tyranny&quot;; the organization's founder, Krupp has accused historians of harboring &quot;private agendas&quot; and having &quot;let down&quot; the public.&lt;ref&gt;''Jerusalem Post''. 2009, 17 June
[http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1245184852508&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull &quot;Foundation says documents will show Pius helped Jews&quot;].&lt;/ref&gt; The foundation's research led to the publication of the book ''Pope Pius XII and World War II: the documented truth'', authored by Krupp; the book reproduces 225 pages of the new documents produced by the foundation's research. 

On 17 September 2009, [[Pave the Way Foundation]] nominated Pius XII to be listed as [[Righteous Among the Nations]] at the [[Yad Vashem]] Holocaust Memorial. The foundation's efforts produced some 3,000 original documents and photos on the life of Pius XII and his work to save Jews during World War II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Alexander Drummer|url=http://www.zenit.org/rssenglish-26890|title=Pius XII Proposed as Righteous Among the Nations|publisher=ZENIT|date=17 September 2009|accessdate=12 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
