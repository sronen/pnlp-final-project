'''Maximus the Confessor''' (Greek Μάξιμος ο [[:wikt:ομολογητής|Ομολογητής]]) also known as '''Maximus the Theologian''' and '''Maximus of Constantinople''' (c. 580 – 13 August 662) was a [[Christian]] [[monk]], [[theologian]], and scholar. In his early life, he was a civil servant, and an aide to the [[Byzantine Emperor]] [[Heraclius]]. However, he gave up this life in the political sphere to enter into the monastic life. 

After moving to [[Carthage]], Maximus studied several [[Neo-Platonism|Neo-Platonist]] writers and became a prominent author. When one of his friends began espousing the [[Christology|Christological]] position known as [[Monothelitism]], Maximus was drawn into the controversy, in which he supported the [[Chalcedonian]] position that [[Jesus]] had both a human and a divine [[Will (philosophy)|will]]. Maximus is [[veneration|venerated]] in both [[Eastern Christianity]] and [[Western Christianity]]. His Christological positions eventually resulted in his torture and exile, soon after which he died. However, his theology was upheld by the [[Third Council of Constantinople]] and he was venerated as a saint soon after his death. His [[feast day]] is celebrated twice during the year: on 13 August and 21 January. His title of [[Confessor of the Faith|Confessor]] means that he suffered for the Christian faith, but was not directly [[martyr]]ed.  His '''Life of the Virgin''' is thought to be the earliest complete biography of Mary, the mother of [[Jesus]].

==Life==
===Early life===
Very little is known about the details of Maximus' life prior to his involvement in the theological and political conflicts of the Monothelite controversy.&lt;ref&gt;The following account is based on the lengthy tenth-century biography catalogued as BHG 1234 and printed in Migne's Patrologia Graeca (90, 68A1-109B9). In recent years, however, this account has been called into question on the basis of new scholarly research. The author, or rather compiler, of BHG 1234 turns out to have used one of the biographies of Theodore the Studite (BHG 1755) to fill the gaps in the information he had on Maximus (See W. Lackner, Zu Quellen und Datierung der Maximosvita (BHG&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; 1234), in Analecta Bollandiana 85 [1967], p. 285-316). The information the compiler of BHG 1234 did have he drew from the passions extant at the time, in which nothing is said about Maximus' early years (See B. Roosen, Maximi Confessoris Vitae et Passiones Graecae. The Development of a Hagiographic Dossier, in Byzantion 80 [2010], forthcoming). On the basis of mostly internal evidence from Maximus' writings, C. Boudignon convincingly advocates a Palestinian birth for Maximus instead (See C. Boudignon, Maxime le Confesseur était-il constantinopolitain?, in B. Janssens – B. Roosen – P. Van Deun [ed.], Philomathestatos. Studies in Greek and Byzantine Texts Presented to Jacques Noret for his Sixty-Fifth Birthday [= Orientalia Lovaniensia Analecta 137], Leuven – Paris – Dudley, MA, 2004, p. 11-43; and id., Le pouvoir de l'anathème ou Maxime le Confesseur et les moines palestiniens du VIIe siècle, in A. Camplani - G. Filoramo, Foundations of Power and  Conflicts of Authority in Late-Antique Monasticism. Proceedings of the International Seminar, Turin, December 2–4, 2004 [= Orientalia Lovaniensia Analecta, 157], Leuven - Paris - Dudley, MA, 2007, p. 245-274). If this is true, it confirms the value of the Maronite biography, even though it is clearly anti-Maximian.&lt;/ref&gt;
Maximus was most likely born in Constantinople even though a biography written by his [[Maronite]] opponents has him born in Palestine.&lt;ref name=&quot;Berthold&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Berthold | first = George C.|editor= Everett Ferguson| chapter=Maximus Confessor|title = Encyclopedia of Early Christianity | publisher = Garland Publishing| location = New York | year = 1997 | isbn = 0-8153-1663-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His position as the personal secretary to [[Heraclius]] has been taken as an indication that Maximus was born into [[Byzantine]] [[nobility]].&lt;ref&gt;See &quot;Maximos, St., Confessor&quot; in the ''Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church'', ed. F.L. Cross (London: Oxford Press, 1958) (ISBN 0-19-211522-7).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cathency&quot;&gt;{{CathEncy| wstitle =St. Maximus of Constantinople| title =St. Maximus of Constantinople |author=  M. Gildas| first = | last = | authorlink = | accessdate =2008-12-24}} ''&quot;This great man was of a noble family of Constantinople.&quot;''&lt;/ref&gt; For reasons unknown, Maximus left public life and took [[monastic vows]] at the monastery of [[Philippicus (general)|Philippicus]] in Chrysopolis, a city across the [[Bosporus]] from Constantinople (later known as Scutari, the modern Turkish city of [[Üsküdar]]). Maximus was elevated to the position of [[abbot]] of the monastery.&lt;ref name=&quot;cathency&quot; /&gt; &quot;Theology without practice is the theology of demons&quot;. (Most famous quote)

When the [[Sassanid Empire]] conquered [[Anatolia]], Maximus was forced to flee to a monastery near [[Carthage]]. It was there that he came under the tutelage of [[Sophronius of Jerusalem|Saint Sophronius]], and began studying the Christological writings of [[Gregory of Nazianzus]] and [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite]]. It was also during his stay in Carthage that Maximus began his career as a theological and spiritual writer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Berthold&quot; /&gt; Maximus was also held in very high esteem by the [[exarch]] and the population as a holy man, ostensibly becoming an influential unofficial political advisor and spiritual head in North Africa.

===Involvement in Monothelite controversy===
While Maximus was in Carthage, a controversy broke out regarding how to understand the interaction between the human and divine natures within the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|person]] of [[Jesus]]. This Christological debate was the latest development in disagreements that began following the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325, and were intensified following the [[Council of Chalcedon]] in 451. The [[Monothelite]] position was developed as a compromise between the [[dyophysite|dyophysitists]] and the [[miaphysitism|miaphysists]], who believed dyophysitism is conceptually indistinguishable from [[Nestorianism]]. The Monothelites adhered to the [[Chalcedonian]] definition of the [[hypostatic union]]: that two natures, one divine and one human, were united in the person of Christ. However, they went on to say that Christ had only a divine will and no human will (Monothelite is derived from the Greek for &quot;one will&quot;), which led some to charge them with [[Apollinarism|Apollinarian]] [[monophysitism]].

[[Image:Hexagram-Constans II and Constantine IV-sb0995.jpg|left|thumb|300px|A silver ''[[Hexagram (currency)|hexagramma]]'' showing Constans II with his son. Constans II supported [[Monothelitism]], and had Maximus exiled for his refusal to agree to Monothelite teachings.]]
The Monothelite position was promulgated by [[Patriarch Sergius I of Constantinople]] and by Maximus' friend and successor as the Abbot of Chrysopolis, [[Patriarch Pyrrhus of Constantinople|Pyrrhus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=St. Maximus of Constantinople}}: &quot;The first action of St. Maximus that we know of in this affair is a letter sent by him to Pyrrhus, then an abbot at Chrysopolis ...&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Following the death of Sergius in 638, Pyrrhus succeeded him as Patriarch, but was shortly deposed due to political circumstances. During Pyrrhus' exile from Constantinople, Maximus and the deposed Patriarch held a public debate on the issue of Monothelitism. In the debate, which was held in the presence of many North African bishops, Maximus took the position that Jesus possessed both a human and a divine will. The result of the debate was that Pyrrhus admitted the error of the Monothelite position, and Maximus accompanied him to Rome in 645.&lt;ref&gt;[[Philip Schaff]], ''History of the Christian Church'', Volume IV: Mediaeval Christianity. A.D. 590-1073 (online edition)[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/hcc4.i.xi.vi.html §111], accessed 15 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; However, on the death of Emperor Heraclius and the ascension of Emperor [[Constans II (Byzantine Empire)|Constans II]], Pyrrhus returned to Constantinople and recanted of his acceptance of the [[Dyothelite]] (&quot;two wills&quot;) position.

Maximus may have remained in Rome, because he was present when the newly elected [[Pope Martin I]] convened the [[Lateran Council of 649]] at the [[Basilica of St. John Lateran|Lateran Basilica]] in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Maximus the Confessor&quot;, in ''The Westminster Dictionary of Church History'', ed. Jerald Brauer (Philadelphia: Westminster Press, 1971) (ISBN 0-664-21285-9). This is generally known as the First or Second [[Lateran Synod]], and is not recognized as an [[Ecumenical Council]].&lt;/ref&gt; The 105 bishops present condemned Monothelitism in the official acts of the synod, which some believe may have been written by Maximus.&lt;ref&gt;For example, Gerald Berthold, &quot;Maximus Confessor&quot; in ''Encyclopedia of Early Christianity'', (New York:Garland, 1997) (ISBN 0-8153-1663-1).&lt;/ref&gt; It was in Rome that Pope Martin and Maximus were arrested in 653 under orders from [[Constans II (Byzantine Empire)|Constans II]], who supported the Monothelite doctrine. Pope Martin was condemned without a trial, and died before he could be sent to the Imperial Capital.&lt;ref&gt;David Hughes Farmer, ''The Oxford Dictionary of the Saints'' (Oxford:Oxford University Press, 1987) (ISBN 0-19-869149-1) p.288. This made Martin the last [[Bishop of Rome]] to be venerated as a martyr.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trial and exile===
Maximus' refusal to accept Monothelitism caused him to be brought to the imperial capital of [[Constantinople]] to be tried as a [[Heresy|heretic]] in 658. In Constantinople, the Monothelite position had gained the favor of both the Emperor and the Patriarch of Constantinople. Maximus stood behind the Dyothelite position, and was sent back into exile for four more years.

In 662, Maximus was placed on trial once more, and was once more convicted of [[heresy]]. Following the trial Maximus was [[tortured]], having his tongue cut out, so he could no longer speak his rebellion and his right hand cut off, so that he could no longer write letters .&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Berthold, &quot;Maximus Confessor&quot; in ''Encyclopedia of Early Christianity'', (New York:Garland, 1997) (ISBN 0-8153-1663-1).&lt;/ref&gt; Maximus was then exiled to the [[Lazica]] or [[Colchis]] region of modern-day [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and was cast in the fortress of Schemarum, perhaps Muris-Tsikhe near the modern town of [[Tsageri]].&lt;ref&gt;George C. Berthold (1985), ''Maximus Confessor: Selected Writings'', p. 31. Paulist Press, ISBN 0-8091-2659-1.&lt;/ref&gt; He died soon thereafter, on 13 August 662.&lt;ref&gt;For example, see [http://www.catholic-forum.com/Saints/saintm96.htm Catholic Forum]. The injuries Maximus sustained while being tortured and the conditions of his exile both contributed to his death, causing Maximus to be considered a martyr by many.&lt;/ref&gt; The events of the trials of Maximus were recorded by [[Anastasius Bibliothecarius]].

==Legacy==
[[Image:Maksim ispovednik.jpg|thumb|285px|''Maximus the Confessor and His Miracles''. An early 17th-century [[Stroganov school]] icon from [[Solvychegodsk]].]]
Along with Pope Martin I, Maximus was vindicated by the [[Third Council of Constantinople]] (the Sixth [[Ecumenical Council]], 680–681), which declared that [[Christ]] possessed both a human and a divine will. With this declaration Monothelitism became heresy, and Maximus was posthumously declared innocent of all charges against him.

Maximus is among those Christians who were venerated as [[saint]]s shortly after their deaths. The vindication of Maximus' theological position made him extremely popular within a generation after his death, and his cause was aided by the accounts of miracles at his tomb.&lt;ref&gt;For example, from the biography provided by the [http://ocafs.oca.org/FeastSaintsViewer.asp?SID=4&amp;ID=1&amp;FSID=100249 Orthodox Church in America]: &quot;Three candles appeared over the grave of St Maximus and burned miraculously. This was a sign that St Maximus was a beacon of Orthodoxy during his lifetime, and continues to shine forth as an example of virtue for all. Many healings occurred at his tomb.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Roman Catholic Church]] the veneration of Maximus began prior to the foundation of the [[Congregation for the Causes of Saints]].

Maximus is one of the last men to be recognized by both the Orthodox and Catholic Churches as a Father of the Church.

==Theology==
As a student of [[Pseudo-Dionysius]], Maximus was one of many Christian theologians who preserved and interpreted the earlier [[Neo-Platonic]] philosophy, including the thought of such figures as [[Plotinus]] and [[Proclus]]. Maximus' work on Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite was continued by [[Johannes Scotus Eriugena|John Scotus Erigena]] at the request of [[Charles the Bald]].&lt;ref name = CE&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=St. Maximus of Constantinople}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Platonic influence on Maximus' thought can be seen most clearly in his [[Philosophical anthropology|theological anthropology]]. Here, Maximus adopted the Platonic model of [[Neoplatonism#Teachings|exitus-reditus]] (exit and return), teaching that humanity was made in the [[Imago Dei|image of God]], and the purpose of salvation is to restore us to unity with God.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Maximos, St., Confessor&quot; in the Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church, ed. F.L. Cross (London: Oxford Press, 1958) (ISBN 0-19-211522-7). One sees this especially in Maximus' ''Mystagogy'' and ''Ambigua''.&lt;/ref&gt; This emphasis on [[divinization (Christian)|divinization]] or ''[[theosis]]'' helped secure Maximus' place in Eastern theology, as these concepts have always held an important place in Eastern Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Maximus the Confessor&quot; in Michael O'Carroll, ''Trinitas: A Theological Encyclopedia of the Holy Trinity'' (Delaware:Michael Glazier, Inc, 1987) (ISBN 0-8146-5595-5).&lt;/ref&gt;

Christologically Maximus insisted on a strict [[dyophysitism]], which can be seen as a corollary of the emphasis on ''theosis''. In terms of salvation, humanity is intended to be fully united with God. This is possible for Maximus because God was first fully united with humanity in the incarnation.&lt;ref name = CE/&gt; If Christ did not become fully human (if, for example, he only had a divine and not a human will), then salvation was no longer possible, as humanity could not become fully divine.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Maximos, St., Confessor&quot; in the Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church, ed. F.L. Cross (London: Oxford Press, 1958) (ISBN 0-19-211522-7).&lt;/ref&gt;
Furthermore in his works Maximus the Confessor argued the unconditionality of the divine incarnation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Radosavljević_1975&quot;&gt;Hieromonk Artemije Radosavljević, Τὸ Μυστήριον τῆς Σωτηρίας κατὰ τὸν Ἅγιον Μάξιμον τὸν Ὁμολογητήν. Αθήνα, 1975. English version: Bishop Artemije  Radosavljević [http://www.synodinresistance.org/pdfs/2009/03/26/20090326aGiatiEnsB7%20Folder/20090326aGiatiEnsB7.pdf Why Did God Become Man?

[The mystery of salvation according to St. Maximos the Confessor] (Athens: 1975), pp. 180-196&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding salvation, Maximus has been described as a proponent of ''[[apocatastasis]]'' or [[universal reconciliation]], the idea that all rational souls will eventually be redeemed, like [[Origen]] and [[St. Gregory of Nyssa]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.theandros.com/glossary.html Apokatastasis]&quot; ''Theandros: An Online Journal of Orthodox Christian Theology and Philosophy''. Accessed Aug. 12, 2007.  {{CathEncy|wstitle=Apocatastasis}}&lt;/ref&gt; While this claim has been disputed,&lt;ref&gt;Hans Urs von Balthasar, ''Cosmic Liturgy: The Universe According to Maximus the Confessor'' (Ignatius Press, 2003), 355-356. ISBN 0-89870-758-7.&lt;/ref&gt; others have argued that Maximus shared this belief in [[universal reconciliation]] with his most spiritually mature students.&lt;ref&gt;John C. Médaille. &quot;[http://www.medaille.com/hope.htm The Daring Hope of Hans Urs Von Balthasar]&quot;. Accessed Aug. 12, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Other than the work by the [[Christian Universalism|Christian universalist]] theologian [[Johannes Scotus Eriugena]] in [[Ireland]], Maximus was largely overlooked by Western theologians until recent years.&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford Dictionary of the Saints'' (David Hugh Farmer), which does not have an entry for Maximus, is an excellent example of how the West overlooked Maximus for years. The ''Systematic Theology'' of [[Robert Jenson]], written in the late 1990s, is an example of how Western theologians are rediscovering Maximus. See also &quot;Maximus the Confessor&quot; in Michael O'Carroll, ''Trinitas: A Theological Encyclopedia of the Holy Trinity'' (Delaware:Michael Glazier, Inc, 1987) (ISBN 0-8146-5595-5); O'Carroll names [[Hans Urs von Balthasar]] as a &quot;pioneer&quot; in the Western rediscovery of Maximus.&lt;/ref&gt; The situation is different in Eastern Christianity, where Maximus has always been influential. The Eastern theologians [[Symeon the New Theologian]] and [[Gregory Palamas]] are seen as intellectual heirs to Maximus. Further, a number of Maximus' works are included in the Greek [[Philokalia]] - a collection of some of the most influential [[Greek language|Greek]] Christian writers.
