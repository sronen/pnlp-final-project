'''William de St-Calais''' (also '''Calais''' or '''Carileph''' or '''Carilef'''; died 1096) was a medieval [[Normans|Norman]] [[monk]], [[abbot]] of the [[:fr:Abbaye Royale Saint-Vincent du Mans|abbey of Saint-Vincent]] in [[Le Mans]] in [[Maine (province)|Maine]], who was nominated by King [[William I of England]] as [[Bishop of Durham]] in 1080. During his term as bishop, St-Calais replaced the [[Canon (priest)|canons]] of his [[cathedral chapter]] with monks, and began the construction of [[Durham Cathedral]]. In addition to his ecclesiastical duties, he served as a commissioner for the [[Domesday Book]]. He was also a councilor and advisor to both King William I and his son, King [[William II of England|William II]], known as William Rufus. Following William Rufus' accession to the throne in 1087, St-Calais is considered by scholars to have been the new king's chief advisor.

However, when the king's uncle, [[Odo of Bayeux]], raised a rebellion against the king in 1088, St-Calais was implicated in the revolt. William Rufus laid siege to St-Calais in the bishop's stronghold of Durham, and later put him on trial for treason. A contemporary record of this trial, the ''[[De Iniusta Vexacione Willelmi Episcopi Primi]]'', is the earliest surviving detailed contemporary report of an English state-trial. Imprisoned briefly, St-Calais was allowed to go into exile after his castle at Durham was surrendered to the king. He went to [[Normandy]], where he became a leading advisor to [[Robert Curthose]], [[Duke of Normandy]], the elder brother of William Rufus. By 1091, St-Calais had returned to England and regained royal favour.

In England, St-Calais once more became a leading advisor to the king. In 1093 he negotiated with [[Anselm of Canterbury|Anselm, Abbot of Bec]], concerning Anselm's becoming [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]; in 1095 it was St-Calais who prosecuted the royal case against Anselm after he had become archbishop. During his bishopric, St-Calais stocked the cathedral library with books, especially [[canon law]] texts. He was also active in defending the north of England against Scots raids. Before his death, he had made his peace with Anselm, who blessed and consoled St-Calais on his deathbed.

==Early life==
St-Calais was a Norman, and a native of [[Bayeux]];&lt;ref name=Lords36&gt;Powell and Wallis ''House of Lords in the Middle Ages'' p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; he may have been a member of one of its clerical dynasties.&lt;ref name=DNB&gt;Barlow &quot;[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/4664 St Calais, William of (c.1030–1096)]&quot; ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''&lt;/ref&gt; His mother's name, Ascelina or Anselma, is given in Durham's records; his father, whose name is unknown, became a monk at the monastery of [[Saint-Calais]] in Maine, and may previously have been a knight.&lt;ref name=Aird287&gt;Aird &quot;Absent Friend&quot; ''Anglo-Norman Durham'' p. 287&lt;/ref&gt; Although St-Calais is generally referred to as Saint Calais or St-Calais, the main source of information about his life, the monastic chronicle of [[Symeon of Durham]], does not call him such.&lt;ref name=Aird288&gt;Aird &quot;Absent Friend&quot; ''Anglo-Norman Durham'' p. 288&lt;/ref&gt;

St-Calais studied under Odo, [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Bayeux|Bishop of Bayeux]], the half-brother of the future William I of England, who was then Duke of Normandy.&lt;ref name=Rufus60&gt;Barlow ''William Rufus'' pp. 60–62&lt;/ref&gt; Other bishops educated at Bayeux around this time included Archbishop [[Thomas of Bayeux|Thomas of York]] and [[Samson, Bishop of Worcester]].&lt;ref name=Church58&gt;Barlow ''English Church 1066–1154'' p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; Symeon of Durham considered St-Calais to be well-educated in [[Classics|classical literature]] and the scriptures; at some point St-Calais also acquired a knowledge of canon law.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; He became a [[Benedictine]] monk at Saint-Calais in Maine, where his father had become a monk,&lt;ref name=Aird288/&gt; and soon became the prior of that house. He became abbot of St Vincent-des-Prés near Le Mans in Maine,&lt;ref name=Rufus60/&gt; sometime around 1078.&lt;ref name=Aird288/&gt; As abbot, his only appearance in historical records is his upholding of the monasteries' right to some property, and his acceptance of a gift of property in the town.&lt;ref name=Aird288a&gt;Aird &quot;Absent Friend&quot; ''Anglo-Norman Durham'' pp. 288–289&lt;/ref&gt;

William the Conqueror nominated him to the [[Bishop of Durham|see of Durham]] on 9 November 1080, and he was duly consecrated on either 27 December 1080 or 3 January 1081.&lt;ref name=Handbook241&gt;Fryde, et al. ''Handbook of British Chronology'' p. 241&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BHODurham&gt;Greenway ''[http://british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=33859 Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066–1300: volume 2: Monastic cathedrals (northern and southern provinces): Durham: Bishops]''&lt;/ref&gt; His elevation may have been a reward for diplomatic services he rendered to the king in France,&lt;ref name=Church64&gt;Barlow ''English Church 1066–1154'' p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; or to help secure the see from further disorder following the death of the previous bishop, [[William Walcher]], during a feud. However, it was most likely in recognition of his administrative ability. Symeon of Durham stated that St-Calais was chosen as a bishop for this reason,&lt;ref name=Aird289&gt;Aird &quot;Absent Friend&quot; ''Anglo-Norman Durham'' pp. 289–290&lt;/ref&gt; describing him as &quot;very well versed in sacred and secular learning, very conscientious in matters of divine and worldly business, and so remarkable for good conduct that he had no equal amongst his contemporaries&quot;.&lt;ref name=QAird290&gt;Quoted in Aird &quot;Absent Friend&quot; ''Anglo-Norman Durham'' p. 290&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early ecclesiastical affairs==
The chronicler Symeon of Durham asserted that when St-Calais was consecrated bishop by Archbishop Thomas of York, he managed to avoid professing obedience to the archbishop, which, if true, would have freed St-Calais from interference in his diocese.&lt;ref name=Church39&gt;Barlow ''English Church 1066–1154'' p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; After his appointment, St-Calais decided to replace his cathedral chapter of [[Clergy|secular clergy]] with monks, and consulted the king and [[Lanfranc]], the Archbishop of Canterbury, before going to Rome to receive permission from Pope [[Pope Gregory VII|Gregory VII]].&lt;ref name=Monastic169&gt;Knowles ''Monastic Order in England'' p. 169&lt;/ref&gt; These consultations, and the conditions within his diocese, may have kept St-Calais from visiting Durham until some time after his elevation.&lt;ref name=Green109&gt;Green ''Aristocracy'' pp. 109–110&lt;/ref&gt; In 1083 he expelled the married clergy from the cathedral,&lt;ref name=Chibnall42&gt;Chibnall ''Anglo-Norman England'' p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; and moved a small community of monks from [[Bede]]'s old monastery at [[Jarrow]] to [[Durham]], to form the new chapter. This community had been founded at Jarrow by Reinfrid, a Norman ex-knight and monk of [[Evesham Abbey]], and Eadwine, an English monk from [[Winchcombe Abbey]].&lt;ref name=Douglas328&gt;Douglas ''William the Conqueror'' p. 328&lt;/ref&gt; After the community had settled in Durham, St-Calais named Eadwine as [[prior]], and arranged for lands to be set aside to support the monks.&lt;ref name=Monastic169/&gt; The expelled clergy were offered the option of joining the new monastic house, but only one actually joined.&lt;ref name=Green109/&gt;

St-Calais enjoyed good relations with his cathedral chapter, and they supported him when construction began on a new cathedral in 1093.&lt;ref name=Monastic170&gt;Knowles ''Monastic Order in England'' pp. 169–170&lt;/ref&gt; He also gave a set of constitutions to the cathedral chapter, modeled on Lanfranc's rule for Canterbury.&lt;ref name=Monastic131&gt;Knowles ''Monastic Order in England'' p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; Symeon of Durham said that the bishop acted towards the monks of his chapter as a &quot;loving father&quot;, and that the monks fully returned the sentiment.&lt;ref name=Monastic623&gt;Knowles ''Monastic Order in England'' p. 623&lt;/ref&gt; St-Calais is said to have researched exhaustively the pre-[[Norman conquest of England|Norman Conquest]] customs of the cathedral, before re-establishing monks in the cathedral.&lt;ref name=Monastic625&gt;Knowles ''Monastic Order in England'' p. 625&lt;/ref&gt; He imposed the ''[[Monastic Constitutions]]'' of Lanfranc on the community, instead of the older ''[[Regularis Concordia (Winchester)|Regularis Concordia]]''.&lt;ref name=Williams136&gt;Williams ''English and the Norman Conquest'' p. 136&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Williams153&gt;Williams ''English and the Norman Conquest'' p. 153&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work for William the Conqueror==
During William the Conqueror's reign, St-Calais was a frequent witness on charters. While it is often difficult to determine who was considered most important on a charter's witness list, placement near the top of the list is usually understood to mean that the signatory was considered important. Almost always during the Conqueror's reign, St-Calais is listed right below the royal family and the archbishops.&lt;ref name=Aird291/&gt;

The king sent St-Calais on diplomatic missions to the French royal court and to Rome.&lt;ref name=Aird291&gt;Aird &quot;Absent Friend&quot; ''Anglo-Norman Durham'' p. 291&lt;/ref&gt; After the king's imprisonment of Odo of Bayeux, Pope Gregory VII complained to him. The pope was also concerned about the king's refusal to allow the delivery of papal letters to the English bishops unless royal permission was secured. To placate the pope, the king dispatched St-Calais to Rome, possibly with Lanfranc, to explain to the pope the reasons for imprisoning Odo.&lt;ref name=Feudal130&gt;Barlow ''Feudal Kingdom of England'' p. 130&lt;/ref&gt; St-Calais also served as a commissioner in the south-western part of England for the Domesday Book, which aimed to survey the whole of England and record who owned the lands.&lt;ref name=Chibnall111&gt;Chibnall ''Anglo-Norman England'' p. 111&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Holt47&gt;Holt &quot;1086&quot; ''Domesday Studies'' p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; Some historians, including [[David Bates (historian)|David Bates]], have argued that St-Calais was the driving force behind the organization of the entire Domesday survey,&lt;ref name=Chaplais76&gt;Chaplais &quot;William of Saint-Calais&quot; ''Domesday Studies'' pp. 76–77&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BatesWC201&gt;Bates ''William the Conqueror'' p. 201&lt;/ref&gt; although other candidates have been put forward, including Samson, Bishop of Worcester, before he became bishop.&lt;ref name=Chaplais68&gt;Chaplais &quot;William of Saint-Calais&quot; ''Domesday Studies'' pp. 68–70&lt;/ref&gt; Pierre Chaplais, who argues for St-Calais being the main organizer of the survey, argues the bishop's exile in 1088 interrupted work on the ''Little Domesday Book'', a subproject of the survey which was left uncompleted.&lt;ref name=Decode98&gt;Roffe ''Decoding Domesday'' p. 98&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rebellion==
[[File:Durham Castle keep (April).jpg|thumb|left|300px|The keep of [[Durham Castle]], where St-Calais shut himself up in 1088|alt=A stone three-story building with small windows on a grassy hill]]
Soon after the accession of William Rufus, St-Calais became one of the king's most trusted lieutenants,&lt;ref name=Mason53&gt;Mason ''William II'' pp. 53–55&lt;/ref&gt; along with the recently released Odo of Bayeux.&lt;ref name=Poole100&gt;Poole ''Domesday Book to Magna Carta'' pp. 100–104&lt;/ref&gt; Later chroniclers often referred to the position that St-Calais held as [[justiciar]], although the formal office did not yet exist.&lt;ref name=Lyon152&gt;Lyon ''A Constitutional and Legal History of Medieval England'' pp. 152–153&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|The chroniclers' statements may have come about through confusion with St-Calais' position in Durham, which was a palatinate, or a territory where the ruler had powers which were normally exercised by a king, but without the title of king.&lt;ref name=Dict209&gt;Coredon ''Dictionary of Medieval Terms'' p. 209&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=West10&gt;West ''Justiciarship in England'' p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;}}  Around Easter 1088, Odo of Bayeux and many of the nobles revolted against the king and tried to place the king's elder brother Robert Curthose, Duke of Normandy, on the throne. After the king had set off with St-Calais and some troops to counter Odo in Kent, St-Calais suddenly deserted, shutting himself in Durham Castle.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; Why St-Calais joined the rebellion, or at least did nothing to aid the king, is unclear.&lt;ref name=Aird293&gt;Aird &quot;Absent Friend&quot; ''Anglo-Norman Durham'' p. 293&lt;/ref&gt; He and Odo had never been close, and despite the fact that St-Calais was educated at Bayeux, there is no evidence that Odo helped St-Calais' career.&lt;ref name=Aird287/&gt; Some historians, including W. M. Aird, have suggested that St-Calais felt the division of the Conqueror's realm between two sons was unwise. It has been suggested that St Calais joined the rebellion to reunite the Normans and English under one king.&lt;ref name=Aird293/&gt;

St-Calais was the only bishop who did not actively aid the king; the rebelling magnates included [[Roger de Montgomerie, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury|Roger de Montgomery]] [[Earl of Shrewsbury]], [[Robert de Mowbray]] [[Earl of Northumbria]], and Odo's brother [[Robert, Count of Mortain|Robert]] [[List of Counts of Mortain|Count of Mortain]]. The rebellion had failed by the end of the summer,&lt;ref name=Lords49&gt;Powell and Wallis ''House of Lords in the Middle Ages'' p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; but St-Calais continued to hold out in Durham, at first claiming he had never actually rebelled. When the king approached with an army, St-Calais agreed to come out, but only after receiving a safe conduct that would allow him to attend a trial while his men continued to hold the castle.&lt;ref name=Crouch135&gt;Crouch ''Normans'' p. 135&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mason64&gt;Mason ''William II'' pp. 64–71&lt;/ref&gt; St-Calais's actions suggest that he did rebel, whatever his claims to the contrary and affirmations of his innocence in northern chronicles.&lt;ref name=Mason53/&gt;&lt;ref name=Poole100/&gt;

==Trial==
St-Calais was brought before the king and royal court for trial on 2 November 1088, at [[Salisbury]],&lt;ref name=Crouch135/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rufus85&gt;Barlow ''William Rufus'' p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; before which the king seized his lands. At the trial, St-Calais held that as a bishop he could not be tried in a secular court, and refused to answer the accusations. Lanfranc presented the king's case, declaring that the confiscated lands had been held as [[Fiefdom|fiefs]], and thus St-Calais could be tried as a [[vassal]], not as a bishop. St-Calais objected, and continued to refuse to answer the allegations. After numerous conferences and discussions, the court held that St-Calais could be tried as a vassal in a [[feudal]] court. St-Calais then asked for an appeal to Rome, which was rejected by the king and the judges. Those judging the case held that because St-Calais never answered the formal accusation, and because he appealed to Rome, his fief, or lands, was forfeit.&lt;ref name=Mason64/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lyon146&gt;Lyon ''A Constitutional and Legal History of Medieval England'' p. 146&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rufus82&gt;Barlow ''William Rufus'' pp. 82–89&lt;/ref&gt; Although St-Calais claimed to be defending the rights of clergy to be tried in clerical courts and to appeal to Rome, his fellow bishops believed otherwise.&lt;ref name=Poole100/&gt; Lending support to their belief is the fact that St-Calais never pursued his appeal to Rome, and that later, in 1095, he took the side of the king against Anselm of Canterbury when Anselm tried to assert a right to appeal to Rome.&lt;ref name=Poole100/&gt;

During the course of the trial, Lanfranc is said to have stated that the court was &quot;trying you not in your capacity as bishop, but in regard to your fief; and in this way we judged the bishop of Bayeux in regard to his fief before the present king's father, and that king did not summon him to that plea as bishop but as brother and earl.&quot;&lt;ref name=QGovern285&gt;Quoted in Richardson ''The Governance of Mediaeval England'' p. 285&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the later case of [[Thomas Becket]], St-Calais received little sympathy from his fellow bishops. Most of the bishops and barons that judged the case seem to have felt that the appeal to Rome was made to avoid having to answer an accusation that St-Calais knew was true.&lt;ref name=Govern285&gt;Richardson ''Governance of Mediaeval England'' pp. 285–286&lt;/ref&gt; The final judgement was only reached after the king lost his temper and exclaimed: &quot;Believe me, bishop, you're not going back to Durham, and your men aren't going to stay at Durham, and you're not going to go free, until you release the castle.&quot;&lt;ref name=QCrouch135&gt;Quoted in Crouch ''Normans'' p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; The extant ''De Iniusta Vexacione Willelmi Episcopi Primi'', or ''Of the Unjust Persecution of the Bishop William I'',&lt;ref name=Aird284&gt;Aird &quot;Absent Friend&quot; ''Anglo-Norman Durham'' p. 284&lt;/ref&gt; details the trial of St-Calais before the king.&lt;ref name=Govern285/&gt; This work is the earliest surviving detailed contemporary report of an English state-trial;&lt;ref name=Poole100/&gt; some have doubted its authenticity, however, claiming St-Calais would not have been as knowledgeable in canon law as the work portrays him. The historian Mark Philpott, however, argues that St-Calais was knowledgeable in canon law, since he owned a copy of the canon law, the ''[[Pseudo-Isidore|False Decretals]]'', which still survives.&lt;ref name=Philpott129&gt;Philpott &quot;''De Iniusta''&quot; &quot;Anglo-Norman Durham&quot; pp. 129–137&lt;/ref&gt;

==Return to favour==
After the court adjourned, St-Calais was held as a prisoner at [[Wilton Abbey]] until his followers in Durham relinquished the castle.&lt;ref name=Crouch135/&gt; Once the castle was back under the king's control, St-Calais was released, and left for Normandy,&lt;ref name=Crouch135/&gt; and no more was heard of his appeal to Rome.&lt;ref name=Mason64/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lyon&gt;Lyon ''A Constitutional and Legal History of Medieval England'' p. 209&lt;/ref&gt; Pope [[Pope Urban II|Urban II]] did write to the king in 1089 requesting that St-Calais be restored to his see, but nothing came of it.&lt;ref name=Cantor51&gt;Cantor ''Church, Kingship, and Lay Investiture'' p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; In Normandy, St-Calais quickly became one of Duke Robert's principal advisors and his chief administrator.&lt;ref name=Aird294&gt;Aird &quot;Absent Friend&quot; ''Anglo-Norman Durham'' p. 294&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 November 1091 he regained the favour of William Rufus, and was restored to his see.&lt;ref name=BHODurham/&gt;&lt;ref name=Poole108&gt;Poole ''Domesday Book to Magna Carta'' p. 108 footnote 1&lt;/ref&gt; Duke Robert had persuaded the king to allow Bishop William's return,&lt;ref name=Crouch135/&gt; perhaps in recognition of a service St-Calais performed for the king by brokering the end of a siege in Normandy that the king's forces were about to lose. The end of the siege prevented the loss of the castle.&lt;ref name=Mason95&gt;Mason ''William II'' p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;

St-Calais returned to Durham on 11 September 1091,&lt;ref name=Rufus294&gt;Barlow ''William Rufus'' p. 294&lt;/ref&gt; with a large sum of money and gifts for his church.&lt;ref name=Aird295&gt;Aird &quot;Absent Friend&quot; ''Anglo-Norman Durham'' p. 295&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter he remained in the king's favour. In fact, in 1093 his lands were restored without the need to perform feudal services.&lt;ref name=Poole100/&gt; For the rest of his life, St-Calais remained a frequent advisor to the king.&lt;ref name=Cantor62&gt;Cantor ''Church, Kingship, and Lay Investiture'' p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cantor71&gt;Cantor ''Church, Kingship, and Lay Investiture'' p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; It was St-Calais, along with [[Robert de Beaumont, 1st Earl of Leicester|Robert, Count of Meulan]] who negotiated with Anselm, the abbot of Bec, in 1093 over the conditions under which Anselm would allow himself to be elected Archbishop of Canterbury.&lt;ref name=Rufus306&gt;Barlow ''William Rufus'' p. 306&lt;/ref&gt;

St-Calais managed the king's case against Anselm at [[Rockingham, Northamptonshire|Rockingham]] in 1095, when Anselm wished to go to receive his [[pallium]] from Pope Urban II.&lt;ref name=Lords52&gt;Powell and Wallis ''House of Lords in the Middle Ages'' p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; At that time St-Calais opposed Anselm's attempt to appeal to Rome over the issue, and steadfastly maintained the king's position against Anselm,&lt;ref name=Poole100/&gt; even advocating that the archbishop be deprived of his lands and sent into exile.&lt;ref name=Poole174&gt;Poole ''Domesday Book to Magna Carta'' p. 174&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Anselm182&gt;Vaughn ''Anselm of Bec and Robert of Meulan'' pp. 182–185&lt;/ref&gt; Later, when the king was negotiating with [[Walter of Albano]], the papal legate sent by Urban to convey the pallium to Anselm and to secure the king's recognition of Urban as pope,{{efn|There was a rival pope at the time, [[Antipope Clement III]] and the king had not recognized either yet.&lt;ref name=Cantor51/&gt;}} St-Calais was the king's chief negotiator.&lt;ref name=Cantor92&gt;Cantor ''Church, Kingship, and Lay Investiture'' p. 92&lt;/ref&gt; The clerical reformers, [[Eadmer]] among them, who supported Anselm in these quarrels, later tried to claim that St-Calais had supported the king out of a desire to succeed Anselm as archbishop if Anselm was deposed, but it is unlikely that St-Calais seriously believed that Anselm would be deposed.&lt;ref name=Cantor97&gt;Cantor ''Church, Kingship, and Lay Investiture'' p. 97&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Anselm188&gt;Vaughn ''Anselm of Bec and Robert of Meulan'' p. 188&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Church67&gt;Barlow ''English Church 1066–1154'' p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; St-Calais secured grants from the king in return for his services.&lt;ref name=Cantor97/&gt; His efforts on behalf of the king earned him hostile accounts in Eadmer's later writings.&lt;ref name=Aird285&gt;Aird &quot;Absent Friend&quot; ''Anglo-Norman Durham'' p. 285&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diocesan affairs==
[[Image:Durham Kathedrale Nahaufnahme.jpg|thumb|right|The facade of Durham Cathedral, which was started by William de St-Calais in 1093|alt=The two square front towers of a cathedral rising above some trees. Behind the paired towers is another taller square tower.]]

Durham's location in the north left it insecure, as [[Malcolm III of Scotland|Malcolm Canmore]], [[List of Scottish monarchs|King of Scots]], raided and invaded the north of England on a number of occasions. Malcolm claimed [[Northumbria]], in which Durham was located, as part of his kingdom. St-Calais managed to befriend Malcolm, and secured his support for the patron saint of Durham, [[Cuthbert of Lindisfarne|Saint Cuthbert]].&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; Malcolm and his wife helped lay the foundation stone of the new cathedral dedicated to Cuthbert.&lt;ref name=Green111&gt;Green ''Aristocracy'' p. 111&lt;/ref&gt; Respect for the saint did not mean that Malcolm refrained entirely from raiding the north; he was killed in 1093 while once more raiding Northumbria. Both the English king and St-Calais did all in their power to support Malcolm's sons, who had been educated in England, in their attempts to secure the Scottish throne.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

Later, in 1095, an English noble, Robert de Mowbray, who was Earl of Northumbria, challenged the bishop's authority in the north. When Mowbray rebelled again in 1095, St-Calais helped the king put down the rebellion,&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; and Mowbray was captured.&lt;ref name=Rufus354&gt;Barlow ''William Rufus'' pp. 354–355&lt;/ref&gt; The death of Malcolm and the capture of Mowbray did much to make the north more secure.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

In St-Calais' time as bishop, a long-running dispute began between the monks of the cathedral chapter and successive bishops. This arose because St-Calais did not make a formal division of the diocesan revenues between the bishop's household and the monks of the chapter. Nor had he allowed free elections of the prior. He may have promised these things to the monks before his death, but nothing was in writing. Thus, when a non-monk was selected to replace St-Calais, the monks began a long struggle to secure what they felt had been promised to them, including the forging of charters ascribed to St-Calais that supported their case.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; These forged charters date from the second half of the 12th century.&lt;ref name=Bates&gt;Bates &quot;Forged Charters&quot; ''Anglo-Norman Durham'' pp. 111–124&lt;/ref&gt;

St-Calais also ordered the destruction of the old cathedral that had been built by Aldhun, to make way for the construction of a new, larger cathedral,&lt;ref name=Aird283/&gt; the current [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque-style]] Durham Cathedral.&lt;ref name=Cantor36&gt;Cantor ''Church, Kingship, and Lay Investiture'' p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; The construction of the new cathedral began on 29 July 1093, when St-Calais led his cathedral chapter in dedicating the site. The first stones were laid shortly afterwards, on 11 August 1093.&lt;ref name=Aird283&gt;Aird &quot;Absent Friend&quot; ''Anglo-Norman Durham'' p. 283&lt;/ref&gt; However, St-Calais' exile after his trial as well as his employment in the royal service meant that he was often absent from his bishopric, and this probably is the cause of the medieval chronicler Symeon of Durham's comparatively neutral treatment of St-Calais in his works.&lt;ref name=Aird286&gt;Aird &quot;Absent Friend&quot; ''Anglo-Norman Durham'' pp. 286–287&lt;/ref&gt; There is no evidence of St-Calais performing any of the normal episcopal functions, including consecrating priests or churches.&lt;ref name=Aird291/&gt;

Probably dating from St-Calais' time is the [[confraternity]] relationship between the monks of Durham and the monks of the monastery of Saint Calais in Maine. The cult of Saint Calais appears to have been confined to the region around the monastery which the saint had founded. St-Calais appears to have been a devotee of the cult, and the most likely date for the creation of the confraternity link between the two houses is during St-Calais' time as bishop.&lt;ref name=Aird287a&gt;Aird &quot;Absent Friend&quot; ''Anglo-Norman Durham'' pp. 287–288&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and legacy==
[[Image:Durham Cathedral plan.jpg|thumb|left| upright=2.2 |A plan of Durham Cathedral, from William Greenwell's ''Durham Cathedral'' Eighth Edition 1913|alt=Architectural plan of a cross shaped cathedral]]
Shortly before Christmas 1095, one of St-Calais' knights, Boso, fell ill and dreamed he was transported to the afterlife, where he found a large house with gates made of iron. Suddenly, St-Calais emerged from the gates, asking the knight the whereabouts of one of his servants. Boso's guide in the dream then informed Boso that this was a warning that St-Calais would soon die. Boso recovered and warned St-Calais of the dream.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

St-Calais died on 2 January 1096&lt;ref name=BHODurham/&gt; after falling gravely ill on the previous [[Christmas|Christmas Day]]. Before his death he was consoled by Anselm and was blessed by his former opponent.&lt;ref name=Anselm194&gt;Vaughn ''Anselm of Bec and Robert of Meulan'' p. 194&lt;/ref&gt; He was buried on 16 January 1096 in the [[chapter house]] at Durham.&lt;ref name=Rufus356&gt;Barlow ''William Rufus'' p. 356&lt;/ref&gt; The king had summoned St-Calais shortly before Christmas to answer an unknown charge, and it is possible that the stress of this threat caused his death.&lt;ref name=Mason163&gt;Mason ''William II'' pp. 163–164&lt;/ref&gt; In 1796 St-Calais' grave was supposedly found during the demolition of the chapter house at Durham Cathedral. Found in the grave were a pair of sandals, which still survive, and fragments of a gold embroidered robe.&lt;ref name=Carver12&gt;Carver &quot;Early Medieval Durham&quot; ''Medieval Art and Architecture at Durham Cathedral'' p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

While in office as bishop, St-Calais gave a copy of the ''False Decretals'' to his cathedral library. The manuscript was an edition that had been collected or prepared by Lanfranc for the use of the chapter of Canterbury.&lt;ref name=BrookePapacy79&gt;Brooke ''English Church and the Papacy'' p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; St-Calais may have used this copy in his trial.&lt;ref name=BrookePapacy109&gt;Brooke ''English Church and the Papacy'' p. 109&lt;/ref&gt; His plea for an appeal to Rome was grounded in the ''False Decretals'', whether or not it was based on this particular manuscript.&lt;ref name=Stafford200&gt;Stafford ''Unification and Conquest'' p. 200&lt;/ref&gt; The manuscript itself is now in the [[Peterhouse, Cambridge|Peterhouse Library]].&lt;ref name=BrookePapacy162&gt;Brooke ''English Church and the Papacy'' p. 162&lt;/ref&gt; St-Calais also gave a copy of Bede's ''[[Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum]]'' to his cathedral chapter; this copy still survives.&lt;ref name=Williams153/&gt; Other works that St-Calais gave to the cathdral library were copies of [[Augustine of Hippo]]'s ''[[City of God (book)|De Civitae Dei]]'' and  ''[[Confessions (St. Augustine)|Confessions]]''; [[Gregory the Great]]'s ''[[Pastoral Care]]'', ''[[Commentary on Job |Moralia]]'', and ''Homilies''; and [[Ambrose]]'s ''De Poenitentia''.&lt;ref name=Dawtry97&gt;Dawtry &quot;Benedictine Revival in the North&quot; ''Studies in Church History 18'' pp. 97–98&lt;/ref&gt;

St-Calais was known to his contemporaries as an intelligent and able man. He had an excellent memory.&lt;ref name=Monastic169/&gt; [[Frank Barlow (historian)|Frank Barlow]], a historian, describes him as a &quot;good scholar and a monk of blameless life&quot;.&lt;ref name=Rufus60/&gt; Besides his copy of the ''Decretals'', he left at his death over fifty books to the monks of Durham, and the list of those volumes still exists.&lt;ref name=Monastic523&gt;Knowles ''Monastic Order in England'' p. 523&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|The list is given in ''Dunelmensis Ecclesiae Cathedralis Catalogi liborum'' published by the [[Surtees Society]] in volume VII of their works in 1838.&lt;ref name=Monastic523fn&gt;Knowles ''Monastic Order in England'' p. 523 footnote 4&lt;/ref&gt;}} His best-known legacy is the construction of Durham Cathedral, although the [[nave]] was not finished until 1130. The construction technique of combining a pointed arch with another [[rib vault|rib]] allowed a six-pointed [[vault (architecture)|vault]], which enabled the building to attain a greater height than earlier churches. This permitted larger [[Clerestory|celestory]] windows, and let more light into the building. The technique of the six-pointed vault spread to [[Abbaye-aux-Hommes|Saint-Etienne]] in [[Caen]] from which it influenced the development of [[Gothic architecture|early Gothic architecture]] near Paris.&lt;ref name=Adams200&gt;Adams ''A History of Western Art'' p. 200&lt;/ref&gt; The system of rib vaulting in the choir was the earliest use of that technique in Europe.&lt;ref name=ArtAges352&gt;Croix ''Gardner's Art Through the Ages'' p. 352&lt;/ref&gt; The historian Frank Barlow called the cathedral &quot;one of the architectural jewels of western Christendom&quot;.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;
