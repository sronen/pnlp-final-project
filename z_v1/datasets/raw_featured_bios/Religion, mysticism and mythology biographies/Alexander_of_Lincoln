'''Alexander of Lincoln''' (died February 1148) was a medieval English [[Bishop of Lincoln]], a member of an important administrative and ecclesiastical family. He was the nephew of [[Roger of Salisbury]], a [[Bishop of Salisbury]] and Chancellor of England under King [[Henry I of England|Henry I]], and he was also related to [[Nigel (Bishop of Ely)|Nigel, Bishop of Ely]]. Educated at [[Laon]], Alexander served in his uncle's diocese as an [[archdeacon]] in the early 1120s. Unlike his relatives, he held no office in the government before his appointment as Bishop of Lincoln in 1123. Alexander became a frequent visitor to King Henry's court after his elevation to the [[episcopate]], often witnessing royal documents, and he served as a royal justice in Lincolnshire.

Although Alexander was known for his ostentatious and luxurious lifestyle, he founded a number of religious houses in his diocese and was an active builder and literary patron. He also attended church councils and reorganized his diocese by increasing the number of archdeaconries and setting up [[prebend]]s to support his cathedral clergy. Under Henry's successor, King [[Stephen of England|Stephen]], Alexander was caught up in the fall from favour of his family, and was imprisoned together with his uncle Roger in 1139. He subsequently briefly supported Stephen's rival, [[Empress Matilda|Matilda]], but by the late 1140s Alexander was once again working with Stephen. He spent much of the late 1140s at the papal court in Rome, but died in England in early 1148. During his episcopate he began the rebuilding of his cathedral, which had been destroyed by fire. Alexander was the patron of medieval chroniclers [[Henry of Huntingdon]] and [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]], and also served as an ecclesiastical patron of the medieval hermit [[Christina of Markyate]] and [[Gilbert of Sempringham]], founder of the [[Gilbertines]].

==Early life==
[[File:Nigel Bishop of Ely family tree.svg|350px|left|thumb|alt=A Diagram|A simplified chart of Alexander's family tree]]

Alexander was a nephew of Roger, Bishop of Salisbury,&lt;ref name=BHOLincoln/&gt; probably the son of Roger's brother Humphrey.&lt;ref name=Kealey24/&gt;{{efn|Occasionally it is argued that Alexander, and Nigel, were really Roger's sons, but it is unlikely that Alexander was a son of Roger, as Alexander mentions his father and mother as well as his uncle Roger in a charter Alexander granted when founding Haverholme Priory in Lincolnshire.&lt;ref name=DNB&gt;Smith &quot;[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/324 Alexander (d. 1148)]&quot; ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''&lt;/ref&gt;}} His mother's name, Ada, is known from the Lincoln Cathedral ''[[Confraternity book|libri memoriales]]'', or obituary books.&lt;ref name=Kealey272&gt;Kealey ''Roger of Salisbury'' pp. 272–276&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander's brother David was [[archdeacon of Buckingham]] in the [[diocese of Lincoln]].&lt;ref name=BHOLincoln&gt;Greenway ''[http://british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=33560 Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066–1300: volume 3: Lincoln: Bishops]''&lt;/ref&gt; Other relatives included Nigel, another nephew of Roger's; and [[Adelelm (Lord High Treasurer)|Adelelm]], later Treasurer of England, who was recorded as Roger's nephew but perhaps was his son.&lt;ref name=Kealey272/&gt; It is possible, although unproven, that Nigel was really Alexander's brother rather than his cousin.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; Roger's son [[Roger le Poer]], who later became Chancellor of England, was also a cousin. Alexander's cousin Nigel had a son, [[Richard FitzNeal]], who later became Treasurer of England and Bishop of London. Alexander also had a nephew William, who became an archdeacon, and a great-nephew named Robert de Alvers.&lt;ref name=Kealey272/&gt;

Alexander's birthdate is unknown.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; Together with his cousin Nigel he was educated at Laon, under the schoolmaster [[Anselm of Laon]],&lt;ref name=AN128&gt;Chibnall ''Anglo-Norman England'' p. 128&lt;/ref&gt; and returned to England at some unknown date.&lt;ref name=Kealey49&gt;Kealey ''Roger of Salisbury'' p. 49 and footnote 74&lt;/ref&gt; The historian Martin Brett feels that Alexander probably served as a royal chaplain early in his career, although no sources support this conjecture.&lt;ref name=Brett107&gt;Brett ''English Church'' p. 107 footnote 5&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander was an archdeacon in the [[diocese of Salisbury]] by 1121, under his uncle. While occupying that office he was credited with a writing a glossary of [[Old English language|Old English]] legal terms in the [[Old Norman|Anglo Norman]] language,&lt;ref name=BHOSalis&gt;Greenway ''[http://british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=34224 Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066–1300: volume 4: Salisbury: Archdeacons of Salisbury]''&lt;/ref&gt; entitled the ''Expositiones Vocabulorum''.&lt;ref name=Kealey24&gt;Kealey ''Roger of Salisbury'' p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike his cousin Nigel, Alexander does not appear to have entered the king's household or administration before his appointment as a bishop, and only attested, or witnessed, one royal charter before his elevation to the episcopate in 1123.&lt;ref name=Green263&gt;Green ''Government of England'' p. 263 and footnote 309&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bishop==

Alexander was nominated to the [[episcopal see|see]] of Lincoln in April 1123 and was consecrated bishop on 22&amp;nbsp;July 1123,&lt;ref name=Handbook255&gt;Fryde, et al. ''Handbook of British Chronology'' p. 255&lt;/ref&gt; at a ceremony held in [[Canterbury]].&lt;ref name=BHOLincoln/&gt; He owed his appointment to his uncle's influence with King Henry I; the [[Peterborough Chronicle|Peterborough version]] of the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' noted that Alexander's elevation to the episcopate was done entirely for the love of Roger.&lt;ref name=Kealey135&gt;Kealey ''Roger of Salisbury'' p. 135&lt;/ref&gt;

During his time as bishop Alexander secured the submission of [[St Albans Abbey]] to his diocese&lt;ref name=Brett132&gt;Brett ''English Church'' p. 132&lt;/ref&gt; and founded a number of monasteries, including [[Haverholme Priory]] (a Gilbertine house),&lt;ref name=BHOLincoln/&gt; [[Dorchester on Thames]] (an [[Arrouaisian Order]] house), [[Louth Park Abbey|Louth Park]], and [[Thame]];&lt;ref name=Burton229&gt;Burton ''Monastic and Religious Orders'' p. 229&lt;/ref&gt; Louth was one of the first [[Cistercian]] houses founded in England,&lt;ref name=Brett137&gt;Brett ''English Church'' pp. 137–138&lt;/ref&gt; and Dorchester was the refoundation of a former [[collegiate church]].&lt;ref name=Brett140&gt;Brett ''English Church'' p. 140&lt;/ref&gt; During Alexander's episcopate 13&amp;nbsp;Cistercian abbeys and seven nunneries were founded in his diocese. Alexander himself consecrated the church at Markyate used by the medieval mystic Christina of Markyate and her nuns, and it was he who consecrated her as a hermit at St Albans Abbey. Alexander also founded a hospital for [[leper]]s at Newark-on-Trent.&lt;ref name=Church203&gt;Barlow ''English Church'' p. 203&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Alexander was a frequent witness to royal charters and documents, there is no evidence that he held an official government position after his appointment as bishop, unlike his relatives Roger and Nigel.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; Nevertheless, Alexander subsequently appears to have become a regular presence at the royal court. He frequently attested royal charters after 1123, and probably acted as a royal justice in Lincolnshire and the town of Lincoln.&lt;ref name=Green263/&gt; He also held the royal castles at [[Newark Castle, Nottinghamshire|Newark]], [[Sleaford Castle|Sleaford]] and [[Banbury Castle|Banbury]],&lt;ref name=Crouch94/&gt; and gave confirmations of grants to the church at Godstow.&lt;ref name=Brett126&gt;Brett ''English Church'' p. 126&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexander was probably at the 1125 church council held at Westminster by the papal legate [[John of Crema]], and shortly afterwards accompanied the legate on his journey back to Rome.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; He was still in Rome in 1126, and may have helped to obtain a papal confirmation of his uncle's possession of [[Malmesbury Abbey]], [[Abbotsbury Abbey]], and Horton.&lt;ref name=Kealey113&gt;Kealey ''Roger of Salisbury'' p. 113&lt;/ref&gt; At some point during his episcopate, an eighth archdeaconry was established in his diocese, for the West Riding area of Lindsey.&lt;ref name=Brett201&gt;Brett ''English Church'' p. 201&lt;/ref&gt; Besides these reorganizations, Alexander had a number of clerics in his personal household, including Gilbert of Sempringham, who later founded the Gilbertine order. Other members of the bishop's household were [[Ralph Gubion]], who became abbot of St Albans, and an Italian Bible scholar named Guido or Wido, who taught that subject while serving Alexander.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

Alexander presided over the organization of his diocese into prebends to support the cathedral clergy; he established at least one new prebend and augmented two others. He also attended the church councils in 1127 and 1129 that were convened by [[William de Corbeil]], the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. Later, during 1133 and 1134, he and the archbishop quarrelled, but the exact nature of their dispute is unknown. William and Alexander travelled to Normandy in 1134 to seek out King Henry to settle their dispute.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

==Reign of Stephen==
[[File:Sleaford Castle remains.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|All that remains of Sleaford Castle |alt=A small pile of stones overgrown with shrubs.]]

After Henry's death in 1135 the succession was disputed between the king's nephews—[[Stephen of England|Stephen]] and his elder brother [[Theobald II, Count of Champagne]]—and Henry's surviving legitimate child [[Empress Matilda|Matilda]], usually known as the Empress Matilda because of her first marriage to the [[Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry V]]. King Henry's only legitimate son, [[William Adelin|William]], had died in 1120. After Matilda was widowed in 1125 she returned to her father, who married her to [[Geoffrey V, Count of Anjou|Geoffrey, Count of Anjou]]. All the magnates of England and Normandy were required to declare [[fealty]] to Matilda as Henry's heir, but after Henry I's death in 1135 Stephen rushed to England and had himself crowned, before Theobald or Matilda could react. The Norman barons accepted Stephen as Duke of Normandy, and Theobald contented himself with his possessions in France. But Matilda was less sanguine and secured the support of the Scottish king, [[David I of Scotland|David]], her maternal uncle, and in 1138 that of her half-brother, [[Robert, 1st Earl of Gloucester|Robert, Earl of Gloucester]], an illegitimate son of Henry&amp;nbsp;I.&lt;ref name=Huscroft71&gt;Huscroft ''Ruling England'' pp. 71–73&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Henry I had more than 20 illegitimate children.&lt;ref name=HenryI41&gt;Hollister ''Henry I'' p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The election of [[Theobald of Bec]] to the Archbishopric of Canterbury was announced at the Council of Westminster in 1138.&lt;ref name=Crouch92&gt;Crouch ''Reign of King Stephen'' p. 92&lt;/ref&gt; The medieval chronicler [[Gervase of Canterbury]] writes that 17&amp;nbsp;bishops attended the council, which implies that Alexander was present.&lt;ref name=Crouch93&gt;Crouch ''Reign of King Stephen'' p. 93 footnote 25&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|There were only 17 dioceses in England at this time.&lt;ref name=Church322&gt;Barlow ''English Church'' p. 322&lt;/ref&gt;}} After a failed expedition to Normandy in 1137, the influence of Alexander's uncle, Roger of Salisbury, waned at the court of King Stephen, but the king took no action against the family that might incite them to rebel.&lt;ref name=Crouch94/&gt; In early 1139 Stephen may have named [[William d'Aubigny, 1st Earl of Arundel|William d'Aubigny]] as [[Earl of Lincoln]],{{efn|It is not certain that he was ever actually Earl of Lincoln, as by 1141 he was called Earl of Sussex.&lt;ref name=DD226/&gt;}}&lt;ref name=DD226&gt;Keats-Rohan ''Domesday Descendants'' pp. 226–227&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps in an effort to limit Alexander's influence in Lincolnshire.&lt;ref name=Crouch94&gt;Crouch ''Reign of King Stephen'' pp. 93–94&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1139 a knight was killed during a fight in Oxford between a party of Roger of Salisbury's men and a group of noblemen. The king ordered Roger to attend his court to explain the circumstances of the incident and to surrender custody of his castles, which Roger refused to do, resulting in his and Alexander's arrest; Roger's other nephew, Nigel, evaded capture.&lt;ref name=Matthew91&gt;Matthew ''King Stephen'' pp. 91–92&lt;/ref&gt; Another possible explanation for the arrests is offered by the ''[[Gesta Stephani]]'', a contemporary chronicle, which reported the king's fear that Roger and his nephews were plotting to hand their castles to the Empress Matilda. Stephen may alternatively have been attempting to assert his rights over the castles, and demonstrate his authority over powerful subjects.&lt;ref name=Chibnall79&gt;Chibnall ''Empress Matilda'' p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander was imprisoned in Oxford, in conditions described by some medieval chroniclers as bad.&lt;ref name=Kealey185&gt;Kealey ''Roger of Salisbury'' p. 185&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the work of Henry of Huntingdon, who wrote in the years before 1154 and who regarded Stephen's actions as treachery against the clergy that earned him punishment from God,&lt;ref name=Matthew84/&gt; Alexander's arrest has been seen by many historians as a turning point in Stephen's reign.&lt;ref name=Matthew2&gt;Matthew ''King Stephen'' p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in the 1870s, the historian [[William Stubbs]] felt that the arrest destroyed the royal administration, but modern historians have advanced differing explanations for the troubles that followed, not all of which are related to the bishop's arrest.&lt;ref name=Matthew84&gt;Matthew ''King Stephen'' pp. 84–85&lt;/ref&gt;

After Roger and Alexander's arrests Nigel defied the king. The bishops' castles refused to surrender to the king, therefore Stephen threatened to starve Alexander and Roger until they did.&lt;ref name=Matthew91/&gt; Sleaford and Newark surrendered and were given into the custody of [[Robert de Beaumont, 2nd Earl of Leicester|Robert]], the [[Earl of Leicester]]. Earl Robert also seized some of Lincoln's episcopal estates that had been disputed between the earl and the bishop.&lt;ref name=Crouch95&gt;Crouch ''Reign of King Stephen'' p. 95&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander subsequently [[Excommunication|excommunicated]] Earl Robert when the earl refused to return the castle to Alexander's custody.&lt;ref name=Kealey201&gt;Kealey ''Roger of Salisbury'' pp. 201–202&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander then successfully applied to Pope [[Pope Innocent II|Innocent II]] in 1139 for support in his efforts to recover Newark castle from Earl Robert.&lt;ref name=Crouch311&gt;Crouch ''Reign of King Stephen'' p. 311&lt;/ref&gt;

Stephen's brother, [[Henry of Blois]], [[Bishop of Winchester]] and one of the king's main supporters, had recently been appointed papal legate. Henry objected to Stephen's actions in arresting the bishops and confiscating their property, as they were in contravention of [[canon law]]. Henry called a [[legatine council]], a [[church council]] convened by a papal legate, at Winchester to discuss the issue, which ended in nothing being done, although both sides threatened excommunication and stated they would appeal to Rome and the papacy for support.&lt;ref name=AN93&gt;Chibnall ''Anglo-Norman England'' pp. 92–93&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander did not attend the council of Winchester, but his uncle did.&lt;ref name=Kealey190&gt;Kealey ''Roger of Salisbury'' p. 190&lt;/ref&gt; He seems to have borne Stephen no ill will over the arrest, and worked with the king during Stephen's later reign.&lt;ref name=Matthew102&gt;Matthew ''King Stephen'' p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1141 Alexander and the citizens of the town of Lincoln requested that Stephen come to Lincoln and intercede with [[Ranulf de Gernon, 4th Earl of Chester|Ranulf de Gernon]], the [[Earl of Chester]], who was attempting to enforce what he regarded as his rights to Lincoln Castle. Stephen arrived and besieged Ranulf's wife and half-brother in the castle, but the earl escaped and sought aid from Robert of Gloucester, Matilda's half-brother and leading supporter. Following Robert's arrival in Lincoln a battle took place there on 2&amp;nbsp;February 1141, during which Stephen was captured by Matilda's forces.&lt;ref name=Matthew102/&gt; Alexander was present at Oxford in July 1141, when the Empress Matilda held court and attempted to consolidate her hold on England.&lt;ref name=Crouch197&gt;Crouch ''Reign of King Stephen'' pp. 179–181&lt;/ref&gt; The citizens of London objected to Matilda's rule when she arrived in their city, and drove her away; Robert of Gloucester was captured shortly afterwards. This reversal of the Empress' fortunes resulted in Stephen's release, after he was exchanged for Robert. The next few years, until 1148, saw a period of civil war in England, often called [[The Anarchy]], when neither Matilda nor Stephen controlled the country.&lt;ref name=Huscroft74&gt;Huscroft ''Ruling England'' pp. 74–75&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexander was a supporter of Gilbert of Sempringham's new monastic order of the Gilbertines,&lt;ref name=Monasticism224&gt;Lawrence ''Medieval Monasticism'' pp. 224–225&lt;/ref&gt; and he was also known as a patron of literature.&lt;ref name=Brett184&gt;Brett ''English Church'' p. 184&lt;/ref&gt; He commissioned Geoffrey of Monmouth to compose the ''Prophecies of Merlin'',&lt;ref name=Williams217&gt;Williams ''English and the Norman Conquest'' p. 217&lt;/ref&gt; which Geoffrey dedicated to him.&lt;ref name=Short200&gt;Short &quot;Language and Literature&quot; ''Companion to the Anglo-Norman World'' p. 200&lt;/ref&gt;  Alexander was a patron of the medieval chronicler Henry of Huntingdon, and requested that Henry write his historical work.&lt;ref name=Matthew39&gt;Matthew ''King Stephen'' p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexander rebuilt Lincoln Cathedral after it had been destroyed by fire at an unknown date.&lt;ref name=Church86/&gt; He had the roof done with stone vaulting and began construction of the west front of the cathedral, which was finished under his successor.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; The only remaining major traces of Alexander's work on the west end are the carved doors and the frieze on the west front.&lt;ref name=Cannon73&gt;Cannon ''Cathedral'' p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; The author of the ''Gesta Stephani'' claimed that Alexander's additions made Lincoln Cathedral &quot;more beautiful than before and second to none in the realm&quot;.&lt;ref name=QCannon73&gt;Quoted in Cannon ''Cathedral'' p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, Alexander has been credited with the commissioning of the baptismal font in Lincoln Cathedral, made of [[Tournai#Geology|Tournai marble]]. Recent scholarship, however, has cast doubt upon this theory and suggests that the font was carved on the orders of Alexander's successor, [[Robert de Chesney]].&lt;ref name=King18&gt;King &quot;Tournai Marble Baptismal Font&quot; ''Journal of the British Archaeological Association'' pp. 18–19&lt;/ref&gt;

Stephen granted to Alexander the land on which the Old Palace of the bishops stands in Lincoln, although it is unclear whether it was Alexander or his successor as bishop who began the construction of the existing building. Stephen's grant added to an earlier one by King Henry, of the Eastgate in Lincoln as an episcopal residence. Work commissioned by Alexander has survived at the three castles he built at Newark-on-Trent, Sleaford, and probably Banbury.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

Alexander's nickname, &quot;the Magnificent&quot;,&lt;ref name=Monastic22&gt;Knowles ''Monastic Order'' p. 222&lt;/ref&gt; reflected his ostentatious and luxurious lifestyle.&lt;ref name=Church86&gt;Barlow ''English Church'' p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; Henry of Huntingdon records that this was a contemporary nickname. Alexander was rebuked by [[Bernard of Clairvaux]] for his lifestyle.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; He may have been responsible for the education of an illegitimate son of King Henry's, as two charters of Alexander's are witnessed by a William, who is described as a son of the king.&lt;ref name=Brett175&gt;Brett ''English Church'' p. 175 and footnote 1&lt;/ref&gt; He also advanced the careers of his family, naming his relative Adelelm as [[Dean of Lincoln]] during his episcopate. Another member of his household was Robert Gubion, who later became abbot of St Albans Abbey.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

The medieval chronicler [[William of Newburgh]] wrote that Alexander founded a number of monasteries, &quot;to remove the odium&quot; that he had incurred because of his castle building. Alexander himself stated explicitly that his foundation of Louth was intended to secure the remission of his sins, as well as the salvation of King Henry I, his uncle Roger of Salisbury, and his parents.&lt;ref name=Dalton95&gt;Dalton &quot;Churchmen and the Promotion of Peace&quot; ''Viator'' pp. 95–96&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander also played a part in the founding of [[Newhouse Abbey]] in about 1143. Although the actual foundation was by Peter of Goxhill, Alexander and his successor issued confirmation charters and took the new monastery into their protection.&lt;ref name=Dalton98&gt;Dalton &quot;Churchmen and the Promotion of Peace&quot; ''Viator'' p. 98&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==

Alexander spent most of 1145 and 1146 at the papal court in Rome,&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; although some time during that period he was in England as one of the witnesses to the peace accord signed between the earls of Chester and Leicester.&lt;ref name=Dalton94&gt;Dalton &quot;Churchmen and the Promotion of Peace&quot; ''Viator'' p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to the papal court, then at Auxerre, in 1147, but he was back in England by the time of his death the following year. Henry of Huntingdon says that Alexander picked up his last illness while travelling.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; Alexander died in February 1148,&lt;ref name=Handbook255/&gt; probably on the 20th, as that was the date on which his death was commemorated at Lincoln Cathedral,&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; and he was buried at [[Lincoln, Lincolnshire|Lincoln]] on 25&amp;nbsp;February 1148.&lt;ref name=BHOLincoln/&gt; No tomb remains, but 12th-century documents record that Alexander left the cathedral a number of books, mostly biblical works.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;
