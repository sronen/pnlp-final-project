'''Robert de Chesney''' (died December 1166) was a medieval English [[Bishop of Lincoln]]. He was the brother of an important royal official, [[William de Chesney]], and the uncle of [[Gilbert Foliot]], successively [[Bishop of Hereford]] and [[Bishop of London]]. Educated at Oxford or Paris, Chesney was [[List of Archdeacons of Leicester|Archdeacon of Leicester]] before his election as bishop in December 1148.

Chesney served as a royal justice in Lincolnshire during his bishopric, and maintained a close relationship with his nephew, Foliot. He was also an early patron of [[Thomas Becket]], and gave the young cleric an office in his diocese early in Becket's career. Although shown favour by King [[Stephen of England]], including the right to a [[Mint (coin)|mint]], Chesney was present at the coronation of King [[Henry II of England]] in 1154 and went on to serve Henry as a royal justice. In about 1160 Chesney became embroiled in a dispute with [[St Albans Abbey]] in the diocese of Lincoln, over his right as bishop to supervise the abbey. The dispute was eventually settled when the abbey granted Chesney land in return for his relinquishing any right to oversee St Albans.

Chesney was active in his diocese; more than 240&amp;nbsp;documents relating to his episcopal career survive. They show him mediating disputes between religious houses and granting exemptions and rights in his diocese. Chesney bought a house in London to serve as an episcopal residence, constructed an episcopal palace in Lincoln, and founded a religious house outside the city. He died in December 1166, probably on the 27th, and was buried in [[Lincoln Cathedral]].

==Historical background==

After King [[Henry I of England]]'s death in 1135 the succession was disputed, as the king's only legitimate son, [[William Adelin|William]], had died in 1120. The three main contenders were the king's nephews—[[Stephen of England|Stephen, Count of Boulogne]] and his elder brother [[Theobald II, Count of Champagne]]—and Henry's surviving legitimate child [[Empress Matilda|Matilda]], usually known as the Empress Matilda because of her first marriage to the [[Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry V]]. After Matilda was widowed in 1125 she returned to her father in England, who then secured her marriage to [[Geoffrey V, Count of Anjou|Geoffrey, Count of Anjou]]. All the magnates of England and [[Normandy]] were required to declare [[fealty]] to Matilda as Henry's heir, but after Henry I's death in 1135 Stephen rushed to England and had himself crowned, before Theobald or Matilda could react. The Norman barons accepted Stephen as Duke of Normandy, and Theobald contented himself with his possessions in France. But Matilda was less patient: she secured the support of King [[David I of Scotland]], her maternal uncle, and also the support of her half-brother [[Robert, 1st Earl of Gloucester|Robert, Earl of Gloucester]], an illegitimate son of Henry&amp;nbsp;I, in 1138.&lt;ref name=Huscroft71&gt;Huscroft ''Ruling England'' pp. 71–73&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Henry I had more than 20 illegitimate children.&lt;ref name=HenryI41&gt;Hollister ''Henry I'' p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Initially Stephen was secure on his throne, but by 1139 stresses had appeared. King David of Scotland invaded in 1138, and some of the English nobles rebelled, but Stephen had dealt with both threats by April 1139. Later that year he arrested [[Roger of Salisbury|Roger]], the [[Bishop of Salisbury]], and his nephews [[Nigel (Bishop of Ely)|Nigel]], the [[Bishop of Ely]], and [[Alexander of Lincoln|Alexander]], the [[Bishop of Lincoln]], who were not only powerful ecclesiastics but also important royal administrators. In September 1139 Matilda landed in England to contest the throne, supported by her half-brother Robert. Stephen himself was captured in February 1141 by Matilda's forces, but Robert's subsequent capture by forces loyal to Stephen later that year allowed his exchange for Stephen in November 1141. The result was an effective stalemate, with Stephen controlling parts of the country and others under the control of Matilda's supporters. During the 1140s, Matilda's husband Geoffrey of Anjou wrested Normandy from Stephen.&lt;ref name=Huscroft73&gt;Huscroft ''Ruling England'' pp. 73–75&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==

Chesney's family originated from [[Quesnay-Guesnon]] in the [[Calvados]] region of Normandy near [[Bayeux]] in France,&lt;ref name=BHOLincoln&gt;Greenway ''[http://british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=33560 Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066–1300: volume 3: Lincoln: Bishops of Lincoln]''&lt;/ref&gt; but they had settled in the Midlands of England and held lands there, particularly in Oxfordshire. His parents were Roger de Chesney and Alice de Langetot.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; His brother William de Chesney remained a layman, and became one of Oxfordshire's leading landowners.&lt;ref name=Crouch239note&gt;Crouch ''Reign of King Stephen'' p. 239 footnote 19&lt;/ref&gt; Another brother, Reginald, was the abbot of [[Evesham Abbey]].&lt;ref name=Reign327&gt;Crouch ''Reign of King Stephen'' p. 327&lt;/ref&gt; Chesney's sister Agnes was married to Robert Foliot, steward to the [[Earl of Huntingdon]]. Agnes and Robert were probably the parents of Gilbert Foliot, later Bishop of Hereford and Bishop of London. Although it is a surmise that Foliot's mother was a sibling of Chesney,&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; it is certain that Chesney was Gilbert's uncle.&lt;ref name=BHOHereford&gt;Barrow ''[http://british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=34422 Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066–1300: volume 8: Hereford: Bishops of Hereford]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Chesney probably attended schools in either Oxford or Paris, as later in life he was referred to with the title of ''magister'', signifying that he was educated.&lt;ref name=DNB&gt;Owen &quot;Chesney, Robert de (d. 1166)&quot; ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''&lt;/ref&gt; He was Archdeacon of Leicester by about 1146,&lt;ref name=BHOArchDLeicester&gt;Greenway ''[http://british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=33569 Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066–1300: volume 3: Lincoln: Archdeacons of Leicester]''&lt;/ref&gt; and held the [[prebend]] of Stow. He was also a [[canon (priest)|canon]] of the chapel of St. George at [[Oxford Castle]].&lt;ref name=Church100&gt;Barlow ''English Church'' pp. 100–101&lt;/ref&gt;

==Election==

Chesney was elected to the [[See of Lincoln]] on 13 December 1148,&lt;ref name=Handbook255&gt;Fryde, et. al ''Handbook of British Chronology'' p. 255&lt;/ref&gt; by his [[cathedral chapter]], apparently without outside interference. He was consecrated by [[Theobald of Bec]] at [[Canterbury Cathedral]]&lt;ref name=Church100/&gt; on 19&amp;nbsp;December,&lt;ref name=Handbook255/&gt; the day after his ordination as a priest.&lt;ref name=BHOLincoln/&gt;

Gilbert Foliot's letters provide some background to Chesney's election, showing that King Stephen of England and Stephen's brother [[Henry of Blois]], the [[Bishop of Winchester]], attempted to secure Lincoln for one of their relatives: the royal candidates were the abbots of [[Fecamp Abbey|Fecamp]], [[Westminster Abbey|Westminster]], and [[St Benet's Abbey|St Benet of Hulme]].{{efn|These three men were [[Henry de Sully (abbot)|Henry de Sully]], abbot of Fecamp, [[Gervase of Blois|Gervase]], abbot of Westminster, and Hugh, abbot of St Benet of Hulme.&lt;ref name=King246&gt;King ''King Stephen'' p. 246&lt;/ref&gt; Henry was the son of Stephen's eldest brother, [[William, count of Chartres|William, Count of Chartres]].&lt;ref name=Davis97&gt;Davis ''King Stephen'' p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; Gervase was the illegitimate son of Stephen.&lt;ref name=Handbook36&gt;Fryde, et al. ''Handbook of British Chronology'' p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; Hugh was the illegitimate son of Stephen's brother [[Theobald II, Count of Champagne]].&lt;ref name=Heads68&gt;Knowles, et al. ''Heads of Religious Houses'' p. 98&lt;/ref&gt;}} They were rejected by Pope [[Pope Eugene III|Eugene III]], paving the way for the chapter to elect Chesney. Foliot relates that the electors from the chapter travelled to London, where they proceeded to elect Chesney in front of Foliot, Theobald, and some other bishops. That account is contradicted by Chesney's profession of obedience to Theobald, which claims that the election took place on 13&amp;nbsp;December 1148 at Westminster. [[Henry of Huntingdon]] and [[Ralph Diceto]], both medieval chroniclers, approved of the election and mentioned the unanimous nature of Chesney's selection.&lt;ref name=Theo106&gt;Saltman ''Theobald'' pp. 106–107&lt;/ref&gt; That Chesney's brother William was a firm supporter of Stephen's probably helped reconcile Stephen and his brother to Chesney's election.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

Chesney returned to Lincoln on 6 January 1149,&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; where he received a letter from [[Arnulf of Lisieux|Arnulf]], the [[Bishop of Lisieux]] in Normandy, congratulating him on his appointment.&lt;ref name=Church100/&gt; Arnulf also asked Chesney to help the cause of [[Henry II of England|Henry fitzEmpress]], Empress Matilda's eldest son and a contender for the English throne.&lt;ref name=Matilda148&gt;Chibnall ''Empress Matilda'' p. 148&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bishop under Stephen==

Correspondence between Chesney and his nephew [[Gilbert Foliot]] suggests their relationship was quite close. Foliot strongly supported his uncle's candidacy for Lincoln, writing to Pope Eugene III to encourage papal approval of the election.&lt;ref name=Coll16&gt;Knowles ''Episcopal Colleagues'' p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;  Foliot  later ordered a copy of the ''[[Pandects|Digest]]'' for his uncle, which demonstrates Chesney's interest in [[Roman law]].&lt;ref name=Theo175&gt;Saltman ''Theobald'' p. 175 and footnote 6&lt;/ref&gt; Some of Archbishop  Theobald's letters, written to Chesney and recorded in [[John of Salisbury]]'s collection of letters, contain the earliest recorded quotations from [[Gratian (jurist)|Gratian]]'s ''[[Decretum Gratiani|Decretum]]'' in an English source. They were part of a letter sent by Theobald to Chesney discussing difficult legal cases, and giving advice on how to resolve them.&lt;ref name=Theo177&gt;Saltman ''Theobald'' p. 177&lt;/ref&gt; 

Shortly after his consecration, Chesney was presented with a copy of the newly updated version of Henry of Huntingdon's ''[[Historia Anglorum]]''; Huntingdon had been a fellow archdeacon.&lt;ref name=Matthew128&gt;Matthew ''King Stephen'' pp. 128–129&lt;/ref&gt; Chesney was present at several of King Stephen's courts, and the king named the bishop as the local justice for Lincolnshire.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

At the height of [[The Anarchy|the civil war]] during Stephen's reign, and shortly after Chesney's consecration, the bishop acted as a guarantor for the treaty between [[Ranulf de Gernon, 4th Earl of Chester|Ranulf de Gernon]], the [[Earl of Chester]], and [[Robert de Beaumont, 2nd Earl of Leicester|Robert de Beaumont]], the [[Earl of Leicester]], drawn up to limit the fighting between the two earls during the civil war.&lt;ref name=Reign238&gt;Crouch ''Reign of King Stephen'' p. 238&lt;/ref&gt; Chesney was present at the legatine council held by Theobald in March 1151, and was one of the judges, along with Theobald and [[Hilary of Chichester]], the [[Bishop of Chichester]], in a dispute between the monks of [[Belvoir Priory]] and a secular clerk over the right of the clerk to a church.&lt;ref name=Theo36&gt;Saltman ''Theobald'' p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; Chesney appointed the future Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Becket, to a prebend in his cathedral chapter during the latter part of Stephen's reign.&lt;ref name=Becket&gt;Barlow ''Thomas Becket'' p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

The civil war ended with the [[Treaty of Winchester]], late in 1153, which provided that Matilda's son Henry would succeed Stephen after his death. When Stephen died the next year, this became a lasting peace.&lt;ref name=Huscroft73/&gt; In the last year of Stephen's reign, in mid-1154, Chesney acquired the right to operate a mint in the town of Newark, granted in perpetuity. But as there are no surviving coins, it seems that the mint was not in operation for long. Chesney also acquired the right of justice in the city of Lincoln,&lt;ref name=King297&gt;King ''King Stephen'' p. 297&lt;/ref&gt; and was involved in the commercial life of his diocese, establishing a fair in the town of [[Banbury]] in 1154.&lt;ref name=Amt55&gt;Amt ''Accession of Henry II'' p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bishop under Henry II==

Chesney witnessed a charter of Henry fitzEmpress' before Henry's succession to the throne as Henry II,&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; and was present at the consecration of [[Roger de Pont L'Evêque]] as [[Archbishop of York]] on 10&amp;nbsp;October 1154.&lt;ref name=Theo123&gt;Saltman ''Theobald'' p. 123&lt;/ref&gt; The bishop then was present at Henry II's coronation on 19 December 1154,&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; and appears to have continued to act as a royal justice in Lincolnshire during the early part of King Henry II's reign; the 1156 [[Pipe Roll]] has the sheriff of the county accounting for 10 [[Mark (money)|marks]] arising from the pleas of the bishop in the county.&lt;ref name=Justice68&gt;Stenton ''English Justice'' p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; Chesney was often with the royal court, as he attested a number of Henry II's charters during the early part of the king's reign, and accompanied him to northern England in 1158 and to Normandy in 1160.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

The bishop served as the judge in a dispute in 1158 between a dean from the [[diocese of York]] and a citizen of Scarborough, in which the layman alleged that the dean had extorted large sums of money from him by repeatedly charging his wife with adultery and fining her. The dean's actions were contrary to a royal decree, but although he appeared before a royal court he escaped secular penalties because he was a clerk. The result of the case, a precursor to the later Becket dispute, aroused King Henry's anger, but the death of the king's brother Geoffrey and the king's subsequent travel to the Continent to deal with that issue meant that the matter was eventually dropped.&lt;ref name=Theo160&gt;Saltman ''Theobald'' pp. 160–161&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1161 Chesney became embroiled in a dispute with St Albans Abbey, resulting from his efforts to enforce his  right, as bishop, to supervise religious houses within his diocese. Although Pope [[Pope Alexander III|Alexander III]] sent a papal bull to England ordering the case to be heard by a panel of two bishops, King Henry II felt that the papal order infringed on his royal rights and had the case decided at the royal court instead.&lt;ref name=Theo159&gt;Saltman ''Theobald'' p. 159&lt;/ref&gt; In 1155–1156 St Albans had secured papal privileges from the English Pope [[Pope Adrian IV|Adrian IV]], who had previously been a monk there, that exempted the abbey from diocesan supervision, and it was these privileges that Chesney challenged. Chesney secured not only the papal bull but a royal commission to investigate the rights of the abbey as they were in the time of King [[Henry I of England|Henry I]]. The final disposition of the case took place in 1163, at a royal council at Westminster, where the abbey produced both the papal privileges and a forged charter of [[Offa of Mercia]] in support of their case. As Chesney was unable to produce any documents in support of his own position, the king and council told the bishop that they favoured the abbey's cause. The king also ruled that the abbey was a royal [[proprietary church]], and thus had special exemptions.&lt;ref name=Monastic587&gt;Knowles ''Monastic Order'' pp. 587–588&lt;/ref&gt; In the end, a compromise was reached, whereby the abbey compensated the bishopric with some land in return for the bishop renouncing his claims.&lt;ref name=Richardson292&gt;Richardson and Sayles ''Governance of Mediaeval England'' pp. 292–293&lt;/ref&gt;

Early in 1162 Chesney was summoned to Normandy by the king, along with Roger, the Archbishop of York, [[Hugh de Puiset]], the [[Bishop of Durham]], and Hilary of Chichester, in order to lend their support to the election of Thomas Becket to the see of Canterbury.&lt;ref name=Becket69&gt;Barlow ''Thomas Becket'' p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1163, Chesney was present at the royal court held at [[Woodstock]], which included the Welsh prince [[Rhys ap Gruffydd]], the prince of Northern Wales [[Owain Gwynedd]], and King [[Malcolm IV of Scotland]]. The two Welsh princes and the Scots' king did homage to Henry II while at this court.&lt;ref name=Becket88&gt;Barlow ''Thomas Becket'' p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; In 1163 Chesney was excused from attending a papal council at [[Tours]] because of his health, but he attended the royal councils of [[Council of Clarendon|Clarendon]] and [[Council of Northampton|Northampton]] in 1164, which dealt with the growing dispute, now known as the [[Becket controversy]], between the king and Becket. At those councils Chesney attempted to persuade Becket to compromise, but was unsuccessful. The king subsequently sent Chesney to northern England as an itinerant justice in 1166.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

Chesney's contributions to the king's military campaigns on the continent caused him financial difficulties; at the time of his death he was in debt to a Jewish moneylender.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

==Diocesan affairs==
[[File:Lincoln Cathedral - the Font - geograph.org.uk - 690770.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The marble baptismal font in Lincoln Cathedral, likely commissioned by Chesney]]

Chesney's ''acta'', or documents, contain many examples of him settling judicial disputes, demonstrating how active he was in his diocese. More than 240 of his ''acta'' have survived, many of them concerning the religious houses within his jurisdiction. Chesney was appointed a [[papal judge-delegate]] at least once, and it was in his court that the case of Philip de Broy, a canon in Bedfordshire accused of murdering a knight, was heard. The case was one of those that contributed to King Henry's determination that criminous clerks should be subject to royal justice, not just ecclesiastical justice.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

In addition to judicial affairs, Chesney worked to ensure good relations with his cathedral chapter, and allowed them exemptions from episcopal jurisdiction. He also permitted the clergy of his diocese to remit the payment of chrism money{{efn|This was a payment made by parish clergy to the bishop for the [[chrism]] they used in ecclesiastical functions. The payment was traditionally made on the fourth Sunday in [[Lent]].&lt;ref name=Moorman120&gt;Moorman ''Church Life in England'' p. 120&lt;/ref&gt;}} and forwent the traditional annual payment from the archdeacons of the diocese to the bishop. He suppressed unlicensed schools in Huntingdon and employed a number of educated clerks; his ''acta'' almost always include one witness entitled ''magister'', and often as many as six.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

Chesney was a builder in his diocese, where he ordered the construction of the episcopal palace.&lt;ref name=Coll16/&gt; He also founded a [[Gilbertine Order|Gilbertine]] house of canons just outside of the city of Lincoln,&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; the priory of St Catherine, shortly after the order was recognised by the papacy in 1148. Unusually for its time it was only founded for men,&lt;ref name=VCHLincoln&gt;Page (ed.) &quot;[http://british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=38031 Houses of the Gilbertine order]&quot; ''History of the County of Lincoln''&lt;/ref&gt; although Gilbertine monastic houses typically accommodated both men and women.&lt;ref name=Burton98&gt;Burton ''Monastic and Religious Orders'' pp. 98–99&lt;/ref&gt; In 1161 he bought the Old Temple in London as a house for himself. These expenditures contributed to his financial difficulties, along with royal demands, which led to complaints about Chesney's spending. Another cause for complaint was that he gave away some of his estates as marriage portions for his nieces. Chesney also was a benefactor to the town of Banbury, to whom he granted the right to hold a fair some time before 1154.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

==Death and legacy==

The exact date of Chesney's death is uncertain, but it may have been 27&amp;nbsp;December 1166,&lt;ref name=Handbook255/&gt;{{efn|The historian [[Katherine Keats-Rohan]] records his death date as definitively the 27th.&lt;ref name=DD&gt;Keats-Rohan ''Domesday Descendants'' p. 833&lt;/ref&gt;}} although the event is commemorated on both 26 and 27 December.&lt;ref name=BHOLincoln/&gt; He was buried in the eastern cross aisle of Lincoln Cathedral, along the north side. The modern historian [[David Knowles (scholar)|David Knowles]] wrote that Chesney was &quot;not a man of strong character or decided opinions&quot;.&lt;ref name=Coll16/&gt;

Chesney left at least ten books to Lincoln Cathedral, of which seven survive. Five of the seven show a uniformity of handwriting, leading to speculation that there may have been a scriptorium at Lincoln Cathedral during Chesney's tenure, but other surviving books that were in the cathedral library at the same time do not share any handwriting or other characteristics; Chesney may simply have commissioned the books at the same time from the same scribes.&lt;ref name=Cataxv&gt;Thomsom ''Catalogue of the Manuscripts'' p. xv&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Six of the surviving books are still at Lincoln Cathedral;&lt;ref name=Cataxv/&gt; the other is in the possession of [[Balliol College]], part of [[Oxford University]].&lt;ref name=Cata215&gt;Thomson ''Catalogue of the Manuscripts'' p. 215&lt;/ref&gt; The six manuscripts still at Lincoln are an edition of the letters of Pope [[Gregory the Great]],&lt;ref name=Cata5&gt;Thomsom ''Catalogue of the Manuscripts'' p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; the ''[[Sentences]]'' of [[Peter Lombard]],&lt;ref name=Cata23&gt;Thomsom ''Catalogue of the Manuscripts'' p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; a set of sermons by [[Geoffrey Babio]],&lt;ref name=Cata71&gt;Thomsom ''Catalogue of the Manuscripts'' pp. 71–72&lt;/ref&gt; the ''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]'' and ''[[The Jewish War]]'' by [[Josephus]],&lt;ref name=Cata112&gt;Thomsom ''Catalogue of the Manuscripts'' pp. 112–113&lt;/ref&gt; a psalter,&lt;ref name=Cata123&gt;Thomsom ''Catalogue of the Manuscripts'' pp. 123–124&lt;/ref&gt; and sermons by [[Bernard of Clairvaux]].&lt;ref name=Cata162&gt;Thomsom ''Catalogue of the Manuscripts'' pp. 162–164&lt;/ref&gt; The one book now held by Balliol College is another psalter and probably was already missing from the cathedral library before 1300. It was later owned by [[William Grey (Bishop of Ely)|William Grey]], the [[Bishop of Ely]], who left his library to Balliol College.&lt;ref name=Cata215/&gt;}}

In addition to Foliot, the brothers Gerard, a canon of Lincoln, and Martin, treasurer of Lincoln, were also Chesney's nephews. He may also have been related to Fulk de Chesney, another canon at Lincoln.&lt;ref name=BHOLincoln/&gt; Chesney helped to further the career of [[Richard Barre]], who became a writer and a royal judge and first appears in the record as a witness to some of Chesney's documents during 1160–1164.&lt;ref name=Turner185&gt;Turner &quot;Richard Barre&quot; ''Judges, Administrators, and the Common Law'' p. 185&lt;/ref&gt; [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]'s last work, the ''Vita Merlini'', was dedicated to Chesney.&lt;ref name=Williams217&gt;Williams ''English and the Norman Conquest'' p. 217&lt;/ref&gt; Foliot owned a copy of the ''[[Digest (Roman law)|Digest]]'', part of the ''[[Corpus Juris Civilis|Corpus iuris civilis]]'', that had originally been [[gloss]]ed for Chesney.&lt;ref name=Duggan11&gt;Duggan &quot;Roman, canon, and common law &quot; ''Historical Research'' pp. 11–12&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, Chesney's predecessor Alexander has been credited with commissioning the baptismal font in Lincoln Cathedral, made of [[Tournai#Geology|Tournai marble]]. But recent scholarship has cast doubt upon this idea, and suggests that the font was instead carved on Chesney's orders, and commissioned after 1150.&lt;ref name=King18&gt;King &quot;Tournai Marble Baptismal Font&quot; ''Journal of the British Archaeological Association'' pp. 18–19&lt;/ref&gt;
