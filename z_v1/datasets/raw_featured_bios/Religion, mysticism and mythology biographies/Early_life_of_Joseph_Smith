{{Joseph Smith, Jr.}}
|}
[[Joseph Smith]], Jr. (December 23, 1805 – June 27, 1844) was an American religious leader and the founder of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]]&lt;!--*****NOTE TO EDITORS: Do not change this to read &quot;The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.&quot;--&gt; whose current followers include [[Mormons]] and members of the [[Community of Christ]]. The '''early life of Joseph Smith''' covers his life from his birth to the end of 1827.

Smith was born in [[Sharon, Vermont]], the fifth of eleven children born to [[Joseph Smith, Sr.|Joseph]] and [[Lucy Mack Smith]]. By 1817, Smith's family had moved to the &quot;[[burned-over district]]&quot; of western New York, an area repeatedly swept by religious revivals during the [[Second Great Awakening]]. Smith family members held divergent views about organized religion, but they believed in visions and prophecies and engaged in [[folk religion|folk religious]] practices typical of the era. Smith briefly investigated Methodism, but he was generally disillusioned with the churches of his day.

In the early 1820s, along with other male members of his family, Smith began using a [[seer stone]] to search for buried treasure. Also during this period, Smith said he had a series of visions, the first of which he later said was a [[theophany]]. In 1823, Smith said angel directed him to a nearby [[Cumorah|hill]] where he said was buried a book of [[golden plates]] containing a Christian history of ancient American civilizations. According to Smith, the angel prevented him from taking the plates in 1823, but the angel told him to come back in exactly a year with the &quot;right person,&quot; perhaps his brother Alvin, who died before the 1824 visit. Nevertheless, Smith continued to return to Cumorah over the next three years, reporting to his family that he had not yet been allowed to take the plates.

Meanwhile, during one of Smith's treasure hunting expeditions, he fell in love with [[Emma Smith]] from [[Harmony, Pennsylvania]], and eloped with her in 1827. Returning with Emma to the hill in 1827, Smith said the angel allowed him to take the plates but forbade him from showing them to anyone except those to whom the angel directed.  As news of the plates spread, Smith's former treasure hunting associates sought to share in the proceeds. Intending to translate the plates himself, and hoping to avoid interference from his Palmyra associates, Smith moved to Harmony to live with his in-laws.

==Childhood==
Joseph Smith was born in [[Sharon, Vermont|Sharon]], [[Vermont]], the fifth of eleven children born to [[Joseph Smith, Sr.]] and [[Lucy Mack Smith]]. The Smiths were a middling farm family that suffered a fateful loss when Smith, Sr., after speculating in [[ginseng]] and being cheated by a business associate, was financially ruined.  After he sold the family farm to pay his debts, the Smiths &quot;crossed the boundary dividing independent ownership from tenancy and day labor.&quot;  In the next fourteen years, the Smiths moved seven times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|pp=18–19}}. Two of the Smiths' children died in infancy.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the moves and the financial woes, Lucy Smith remembered the period of Joseph Smith's early childhood as &quot;perfectly comfortable both for food and raiment as well as that which is necessary to a respectable appearance in society.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|pp=18–19}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Then during the winter of 1812–1813, [[typhoid fever]] struck along the [[Connecticut Valley]], including the area around [[Lebanon, New Hampshire]], where the Smiths had recently moved.  A number of family members fell ill, and Joseph experienced a common complication whereby typhoid bacteria [[Osteomyelitis|infected bone]], in Smith's case, the shin bone.  Lucy later claimed that she had refused to permit her son's leg to be amputated; in fact, the Smiths had chanced on one of New England's most respected physicians, [[Nathan Smith (physician)|Nathan Smith]], who &quot;probably alone in American medicine at this time&quot; advocated removal of the dead portion of the bone rather than [[amputation]] of the leg. After the typically horrific early nineteenth-century surgery without either anesthetic or antiseptic, Smith eventually recovered, though he used crutches for several years and had a slight limp for the remainder of his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|pp=18–19}};{{Harvtxt|Vogel|2004|pp=16–17}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1814 the Smiths moved back across the [[Connecticut River]] to [[Norwich, Vermont]], where they suffered three seasons of crop failures, the last the result of the [[Year Without a Summer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Vogel|2004|pp=19–20}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The extended Smith clan had already moved west to New York, and in 1817, Joseph Smith, Sr. traveled alone to [[Palmyra (town), New York|Palmyra, New York]], followed shortly by the rest of his family—although not before Lucy Smith was forced to settle with some last-minute creditors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|pp=27–28}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In Palmyra village, Smith, Sr. and his oldest sons hired themselves out as common laborers, ran a &quot;cake and beer shop,&quot; and peddled refreshments from a cart; Lucy painted cloth coverings for tables and stands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|p=31}};{{Harvtxt|Vogel|2004|pp=25–26}}. In 1818 the two Josephs and Hyrum Smith worked on a farm owned by one Jeremiah Hurlburt, but the relationship ended with each party suing the other.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1820, the family contracted to pay for a {{convert|100|acres|km2|1|sing=on}} farm just outside Palmyra in Manchester Township.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|pp=32–34}}. Manchester was part of [[Farmington, New York|Farmington]] until 1821.&lt;/ref&gt; The Smith family first built a log home,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Berge|1985}}. The log house was built just outside their property in the town of Palmyra.&lt;/ref&gt; then in 1822, under the supervision of Joseph Smith's oldest brother [[Alvin Smith (brother of Joseph Smith, Jr.)|Alvin]], they began building a larger frame house.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Vogel|2004|pp=53, 68.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alvin died in November 1823, possibly as a result of being given [[Mercury(I) chloride|calomel]] for &quot;bilious fever&quot;, and the house remained uncompleted for a year.&lt;ref&gt; Alvin Smith's death remains mysterious. Lucy thought it the result of a dose of [[Mercury(I) chloride]], or calomel, given for &quot;bilious fever&quot; after he ate green turnips. {{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|p=46}}. Alvin Smith may have died of [[appendicitis]], hastened by the laxative. [http://josephsmithpapers.org/person/alvin-smith Joseph Smith Papers].&lt;/ref&gt; By this time Joseph Smith, Sr. may have partially abdicated family leadership to Alvin,&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Smith, Sr. confessed in 1834, &quot;I have not always set that example before my family that I ought.&quot; Later, Joseph Smith, Sr. told Hyrum he had &quot;been out of the way through wine.&quot; {{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|p=42}} (noting that Smith's drinking was not excessive for the time and place). Vogel frankly calls Smith, Sr.'s difficulty &quot;low self-esteem and alcoholism.&quot;{{Harvtxt|Vogel|2004|p=xx}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1825, the Smiths were unable to make their mortgage payments. When their creditor foreclosed, the family persuaded a local [[Quaker]], Lemuel Durfee, to buy the farm and rent it to them.  Nevertheless, in 1829, the Smiths and five of their children moved back into the log house, with Hyrum Smith and his wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|p=47}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Joseph Smith had little formal schooling, but may have attended school briefly in Palmyra and received instruction in his home.&lt;ref&gt;Smith may have attended school briefly in Palmyra. He later wrote that he was &quot;deprived of the bennifit of an education&quot; and that he had been instructed only in reading, writing, and the ground rules of arithmetic. {{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|pp=41–42}}; Smith also may have been educated at home by his father, who had taught school some winters to make ends meet. {{Harvtxt|Ostling|1999|p=23}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Young Joseph worked on his family farm and perhaps took an occasional odd job or worked for nearby farmers.&lt;ref&gt; {{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|p=34}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  His mother described him as &quot;much less inclined to the perusal of books than any of the rest of the children, but far more given to [[meditation]] and deep study.&quot; Lucy Smith also noted that though he never read through the [[Bible]] until he was at least eighteen, he was imaginative and could regale the family with &quot;the most amusing recitals&quot; of the life and religion of ancient Native Americans &quot;with as much ease, seemingly, as if he had spent his whole life with them.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Vogel|2004|p=27}}; {{Harvtxt|Smith|1853|pp=84–85}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Smith was variously described as &quot;remarkably quiet,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Smith|1853|p=73}}; {{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|p=35}}.&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;taciturn,&quot; &quot;proverbially good-natured,&quot; and &quot;never known to laugh.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Tucker|1867|pp=16–17}}; {{Harvtxt|Vogel|2004|p=27}}.&lt;/ref&gt; One acquaintance said Smith had &quot;a jovial, easy, don't-care way about him,&quot; and he had an aptitude for debating moral and political issues in a local junior debating club, &quot;very likely the question of how to know God's existence.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Turner|1852|p=214}}; Quoted in {{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|pp=37–38}}, and {{Harvtxt|Brodie|1971|p=26}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Biographer [[Fawn Brodie]] wrote, &quot;He was a gregarious, cheerful, imaginative youth, born to leadership, but hampered by meager education and grinding poverty.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Brodie|1971|p=18}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious background==
Smith grew to maturity during the [[Second Great Awakening]], a period of religious excitement in the United States. New York west of the Catskill and Adirondack Mountains became known as the &quot;[[Burned-over district]]&quot; because it was &quot;repeatedly singed by the fires of revival that swept through the region in the early years of the nineteenth century.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Randall Balmer, ''Encyclopedia of Evangelicalism'' (Waco: Baylor University Press, 2004), 112; Michael McClymond, ed., ''Encyclopeida of Religious Revivals in America'' (Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 2007), I, 63; {{Harvtxt|Shipps|1985|p=7}}. The heightened religious interest increased membership in traditional denominations, but many new sects and [[communitarian]] experiments also sprang from the movement in upstate New York including the American [[Shakers]] and the [[Oneida Community]] of [[John Humphrey Noyes]]. {{Harvtxt|Ostling|1999|pp=20–21}}; Whitney R. Cross, ''The Burned-over District: The Social and Intellectual History of Enthusiastic Religion in Western New York, 1800-1850'' (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1950).&lt;/ref&gt; Major multi-denominational religious revivals occurred in the Palmyra area in both 1816-17 (when the Smiths were in the process of migrating from Vermont) and in 1824-25.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|pp=36–37, 46}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Small denominational revivals and camp meetings occurred during the intervals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Backman 1969 309&quot;&gt;{{Harvtxt|Backman|1969|p=309}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Norton 1991 255&quot;&gt;{{Harvtxt|Norton|1991|p=255}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Quinn 2006&quot;&gt;{{Harvtxt|Quinn|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Methodist camp meeting (1819 engraving).jpg|thumb|left|An [[engraving]] of a [[Methodism|Methodist]] [[camp meeting]] in 1819 (Library of Congress)]]
Joseph Smith's ancestors had an eclectic variety of religious views and affiliations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|p=26}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, Joseph Smith's paternal grandfather, Asael, was a [[Universalist]] who opposed evangelical religion.  According to Lucy Smith, Asael once came to Joseph Smith, Sr.'s door after he had attended a Methodist meeting with Lucy and &quot;threw [[Thomas Paine|Tom Paine's]] ''[[The Age of Reason|Age of Reason]]'' into the {{sic|?|the}} house and angrily bade him read that until he believed it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in {{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|p=25}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, in 1811 Smith's maternal grandfather, Solomon Mack, self-published a book describing a series of heavenly visions and voices he said had led to his conversion to Christianity at the age of seventy-six.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|pp=25–26}};{{Harvtxt|Mack|1811|p=25}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith's parents also experienced visions. Before Joseph was born, his mother [[Lucy Mack Smith|Lucy]], prayed in a grove about [[Joseph Smith, Sr.|her husband's]] refusal to attend church and later said she had had a dream-vision, which she interpreted as a [[prophecy]] that Joseph, Sr. would later accept the &quot;pure and undefiled Gospel of the Son of God.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|p=23}}; {{Harvtxt|Smith|1853|pp=55–56}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Lucy, [[Joseph Smith, Sr.]] also had seven visions between 1811 and 1819, coming at a time when he was &quot;much excited upon the subject of religion.&quot; These visions confirmed in his mind the correctness of his refusal to join any organized church and led him to believe that he would be directed in the proper path toward [[salvation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Smith|1853|pp=56, 58–59, 70–72, 74}}; {{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lucy's account, recorded thirty years after the period in which the visions are said to have occurred, suggests &quot;a tendency to make her husband the predecessor of her son&quot; by echoing passages in the Book of Mormon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Like perhaps thousands of contemporary Americans,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|p=50}}; {{Harvtxt|Quinn|1998|pp=25–30}}: &quot;Contemporary diaries, newspaper reports, and later town histories indicate that thousands of early Americans participated in treasure-digging nationwide.  A smaller number actually took the lead in practicing various forms of divination and magic.&quot; (25)&lt;/ref&gt; the Smith family practiced various forms of folk magic such as using divining rods and seer stones to search for buried treasure. Four witnesses reported that the Smiths used divining rods in the Palmyra area, and sometime between Joseph Smith, Jr.'s eleventh and thirteenth years, he began &quot;following his father's example in using a divining rod.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Quinn|1998|p=35}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Magical parchments handed down in the Hyrum Smith family may have belonged to Joseph, Sr.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|pp=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lucy Mack Smith noted in her memoirs that while family members were &quot;trying to win the faculty of Abrac, drawing magic circles or sooth saying,&quot; they did not neglect manual labor, &quot;but whilst we worked with our hands we endeavored to remember the service of &amp; the welfare of our souls.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in {{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|pp=50}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Smith's reputation among his Palmyra neighbors was that of a &quot;nondescript farm boy&quot; who was &quot;lazy and superstitious,&quot; and townspeople viewed his family as &quot;treasure-seekers, not eager Christians.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|pp=35–36}};{{Harvtxt|Brodie|1971|pp=16}} (&quot;his reputation before he organized his church was not that of an adolescent mystic brooding over visions, but of a likable ne'er-do-well who was notorious for tall tales and necromantic arts and who spent his leisure leading a band of idler in digging for buried treasure.&quot;); {{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|p=143}} (&quot;In the neighbors' reports, he was a plain rural visionary with little talent save a gift for seeing in a stone.&quot;)&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Smith was reared in a family that believed in prophecy and visions, was skeptical of organized religion, and was interested in both folk magic and new religious ideas.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bushman3637&quot;&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|pp=36&amp;ndash;37}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Smith said he had become concerned about religion &quot;at about the age of twelve years,&quot; although later he seems to have wondered whether &quot;a Supreme being did exist.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|pp=36–38}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Smith apparently attended the [[Presbyterian]] Sunday school as a child,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Matzko|2007|p=70}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and later as an adolescent, he displayed interest in [[Methodism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of Smith's acquaintances said that Smith had caught &quot;a spark of Methodism&quot; at camp meetings &quot;away down in the woods, on the Vienna road.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in {{Harvtxt|Bushman|2008|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; He even reportedly spoke during some of these meetings, and the acquaintance described Smith as a &quot;very passable exhorter.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Brodie|1971|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Nevertheless, at some point after 1822,&lt;ref&gt;Orsamus Turner who reported Smith &quot;catching a spark of Methodism on the Vienna road&quot; visited Palmyra only between 1822 and 1828.{{Harvtxt|Vogel|2004|p=59}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Smith withdrew from organized religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|pp=38}}; {{Harvtxt|Vogel|2004|p=61}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to his mother, Smith claimed, &quot;I can take my Bible, and go into the woods, and learn more in two hours, than you can learn at meeting in two years, if you should go all the time.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Smith|1853|p=90}}; Quoted in {{Harvtxt|Brodie|1971|p=26}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Still, Smith seems to have been significantly influenced by the interdenominational revival of 1824-25. &lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Vogel|2004|p=61}}&quot;The fact that Joseph twice lifted the revival out of its historical context, pushing it back to 1823, then to 1820, indicates that he considered the revival of 1824-25 important to his genesis as a prophet.  It seems evident that his quest for the true church began in 1824-25, not in 1820.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

==First Vision==
{{main|First Vision}}
In the 1830s, after the founding of the new church, Smith said that he had an experience about 1820 that modern Latter Day Saints call the [[First Vision]]. No account of this experience was published before 1840,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|pp=35, 38}} (placing the First Vision around 1820)&lt;/ref&gt; and details of this [[theophany]] varied considerably as Smith retold the story.&lt;ref&gt; {{Harvtxt|Brodie|1971|p=24}}; {{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|p=39}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to an account Smith dictated in 1838, he said that when he was about fourteen, he went into the woods to pray about which church to join.  There he fell into the grip of an evil power that nearly overtook him. At the last moment, he was rescued by two shining &quot;personages&quot; (presumably [[Jesus]] and [[God the Father]]) who hovered above him. One of the beings told Smith not to join any of the existing churches because &quot;they were all wrong&quot; and &quot;all their creeds were an abomination.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Smith-History]];{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|p=40}};{{Harvtxt|Brodie|1971|pp=21&amp;ndash;22}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Smith said that recounting his vision story to others &quot;excited a great deal of prejudice against me among professors of religion, and was the cause of great persecution, which continued to increase,&quot; there is no contemporary evidence of such persecution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Brodie|1971|pp=23–25}};{{Harvtxt|Palmer|2002|p=244}}: &quot;If his report that 'all the sects...united to persecute me&quot; were accurate, one would expect to find some hint of this in the local newspapers, narratives by ardent critics, and in the affidavits [[Doctor Philastus Hurlbut|D.P. Hurlbut]] gathered in 1833.  The record is nevertheless silent on this issue.  No one, friend or foe, in New York or Pennsylvania remembers either that there was 'great persecution' or even that Joseph claimed to have had a vision.  Not even his family remembers it.&quot; &lt;/ref&gt;

== Work as a treasure hunter and marriage to Emma Hale ==
[[File:JosephSmithTreasureHunting.jpg|thumb|right|Joseph Smith treasure hunting by looking at a stone in his hat.]]
From about 1819, Smith regularly practiced [[scrying]], a form of [[divination]] in which a &quot;seer&quot; looked into a [[Seer stones in Mormonism|seer stone]] to receive supernatural knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;When Joseph Smith first began to use his seer or &quot;peep&quot; stone he employed the folklore familiar to rural America. The details of his rituals and incantations are unimportant because they were commonplace, and Joseph gave up money-digging when he was twenty-one for a profession far more exciting.&quot; {{Harvtxt|Brodie|1971|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith usually practiced crystal gazing by putting a stone at the bottom of a white stovepipe hat, putting his face over the hat to block the light, then divining information from the stone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Harris|1859|p=164}}; {{Harvtxt|Mather|1880|p=199}}. According to an account of an interview with Joseph Smith, Sr., the 14-year-old Joseph borrowed a stone from a person working as a local crystal gazer {{Harvtxt|Lapham|1870|pp=305–306}} which reportedly showed him the underground location of another stone near his home, which he located at a depth of about twenty-two feet.  According to another story, in either 1819 {{Harvtxt|Tucker|1867|p=19}} or 1822 {{Harvtxt|Howe|1834|p=240}}, while the older Smith males were digging a well for a Palmyra neighbor, they found an unusual stone {{Harvtxt|Harris|1859|p=163}}, described as either white and glassy and shaped like a child's foot or &quot;chocolate-colored, somewhat egg-shaped.&quot; {{Harvtxt|Roberts|1930|loc=1:129}}. Smith then used this stone as a seer stone.{{Harvtxt|Tucker|1867|p=20}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Smith and his father achieved &quot;something of a mysterious local reputation in the profession—mysterious because there is no record that they ever found anything despite the readiness of some local residents to pay for their efforts.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Osling|1999|p=25}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

One Joseph Capron, who lived near the Smiths, said that Joseph had &quot;discovered ghosts, infernal spirits, mountains of gold and silver, and many other invaluable treasures deposited in the earth. He would often tell his neighbors of his wonderful discoveries.&quot; Joseph's uncle, Jesse Smith, said that Joseph had told him he had &quot;eyes to see things that are not&quot; and that &quot;the angel of the Lord&quot; had put him &quot;in possession of great wealth, gold &amp; silver and precious stones.&quot; Smith told one Jonathan Thompson that he had discovered the two Indians who had buried a trunk of treasure and that one of them continued to guard it. A childhood friend, Lorenzo Saunders, said that while digging in a hill, Smith said he could &quot;see a man sitting in a gold chair.&quot; W. R. Hine said Smith had told him that he had seen [[Captain Kidd]] sailing on the [[Susquehanna River]] at flood tide and that he also &quot;saw writing cut on the rocks in an unknown language&quot; telling where Kidd had buried his treasure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Palmer|2002|pp=186–88}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 1825, Joseiah Stowell, a well-to-do farmer from [[Bainbridge (town), New York|South Bainbridge]], [[Chenango County, New York]], who had been searching for a lost Spanish mine near [[Harmony Township, Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania]] with another seer, traveled to Manchester to hire Smith &quot;on account of having heard that he possessed certain keys, by which he could discern things invisible to the natural eye.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Vogel|2004|p=69}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith agreed to take the job of assisting Stowell and Hale, and he and his father worked with the Stowell-Hale team for approximately one month, attempting, according to their contract, to locate &quot;a valuable mine of either Gold or Silver and also...coined money and bars or ingots of Gold or Silver&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Wade|1880}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Smith boarded with an [[Isaac Hale]] (a relative of William Hale), and fell in love with Isaac Hale's daughter [[Emma Hale Smith|Emma]], a schoolteacher he would later marry in 1827. Isaac Hale, however, disapproved of their relationship and of Smith in general. According to an unsupported account by Hale, Smith attempted to locate the mine by burying his face in a hat containing the [[Seer stones in Mormonism|seer stone]]; however, as the [[Treasure hunting|treasure hunter]]s got close to their objective, Smith said that an enchantment became so strong that Smith could no longer see it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Howe|1834|pp=262–266}}.&lt;/ref&gt;, The failed project disbanded on November 17, 1825;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Howe|1834|p=262}}.&lt;/ref&gt; however, Smith continued to work for Stowell on other matters until 1826.

[[Image:EmmaSmith.jpg|thumb|upright|Emma Hale Smith]]
In 1826, three years after he was to later say that he had been visited by the angel Moroni, Smith was arrested and tried in [[Bainbridge (town), New York|Bainbridge, New York]], on the complaint of a neighbor who accused Smith of being &quot;a disorderly person and an imposter.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Vogel|2004|pp=81}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Court records show that Smith, identified as &quot;The Glass Looker,&quot; stood before the court on March 20, 1826, on a [[Warrant (law)|warrant]] for an unspecified [[misdemeanor]] charge,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Hill|1972|p=2}}; {{Harvtxt|Brodie|1971|pp=16}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and that the judge issued a ''[[mittimus]]'' for Smith to be held, either during or after the proceedings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hill 1972 5&quot;&gt;{{Harvtxt|Hill|1972|p=5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Smith's associate [[Oliver Cowdery]] (who had not met Smith as of 1826) later stated that Smith was &quot;honorably acquitted,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Cowdery|1835|p=200}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the result of the proceeding is unclear, with some eye-witnesses (including the court reporter) claiming he was found guilty, others claiming he was &quot;condemned&quot; but &quot;designedly allowed to escape,&quot; and yet others claiming he was &quot;discharged&quot; for lack of evidence.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hill 1972 5&quot;/&gt;  

By November 1826, Josiah Stowell could no longer afford to continue searching for buried treasure; Smith traveled to [[Colesville, New York]], for a few months to work for [[Joseph Knight, Sr.]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Jessee|1984|p=32}}.&lt;/ref&gt; one of Stowell's friends. There are reports that Smith directed further excavations on Knight's property and at other locations around Colesville.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Vogel|1994|pp=227, 229}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Smith later commented on his working as a treasure hunter: &quot;'Was not Joseph Smith a money digger?'  Yes, but it was never a very profitable job for him, as he only got fourteen dollars a month for it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Smith|1976|p=120}}; Quoted in {{Harvtxt|Brodie|1971|pp=20&amp;ndash;21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because Smith had been unable to gain Isaac Hale's approval, he and [[Emma Hale Smith]] [[elope]]d to [[Bainbridge (town), New York|South Bainbridge]] on January 18, 1827, after which Joseph and Emma went to live with Smith's parents in [[Manchester (town), New York|Manchester, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Roberts|1902|p=17}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Moroni and the golden plates==
{{main|Golden plates|Angel Moroni}}
While working as a treasure hunter, Smith said he acquired a set of golden plates he said had been deposited, along with other artifacts, in a [[Cumorah|prominent hill]] near his home.

In Smith's own account dated 1838, he stated that an [[angel]] visited him on the night of September 21, 1823.&lt;ref&gt;The date of Moroni's first visits is generally taken as 1823. However, Smith's 1832 history (his first written account) dates the visit of [[Moroni (prophet)|Moroni]] to September 22, 1822, a year earlier, although he also states he was seventeen years old {{Harv|Smith|1832|p=3}}, and his seventeenth birthday would not have been until December 23, 1822. Further possible ambiguity arises because in an 1830 interview, [[Joseph Smith, Sr.]] reportedly claimed that he was not told about Moroni's visit until a year after the fact, during which Smith, Jr. had been collecting items in preparation for receiving the plates {{Harv|Lapham|1870|p=305}}. [[Lucy Mack Smith]] asserts that Smith, Sr. was told about Moroni's visit in 1823, the day after Moroni's first visit ({{Harvtxt|Smith|1838|p=7}}; {{Harvtxt|Smith|1853|p=82}}); however, Lucy's history also indicates that after the appearance of the angel, Joseph had made two annual visits to the hill [[Cumorah]] before the 1823 death of her son Alvin {{Harv|Smith|1853|p=85}}, which Lucy incorrectly dated to 1824 {{Harv|Smith|1853|p=87}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Concerning the visit, Smith dictated the following:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
He called me by name, and said unto me that he was a messenger sent from the presence of God to me, and that his name was [[Moroni (prophet)|Moroni]];&lt;ref&gt;As originally taken down in dictation and published, the story stated that the angel was [[Nephi, son of Lehi|Nephi]] {{Harv|Smith|1838–1840|p=4}}. Long after Smith's death, however, this reference to Nephi in the official history was changed to [[Moroni (prophet)|Moroni]] {{Harv|Roberts|1902}} to conform to Smith's other statements from as early as 1835 that refer to the latter {{Harv|Smith|1835|loc=sec. 50:2, p. 180}}. Generally, modern historians refer to this angel as ''Moroni''.&lt;/ref&gt; that God had a work for me to do; and that my name should be had for good and evil among all nations, kindreds, and tongues, or that it should be both good and evil spoken of among all people.

He said there was a book deposited, written upon gold plates, giving an account of the former inhabitants of this continent, and the source from whence they sprang. He also said that the fulness[sic] of the everlasting [[Gospel]] was contained in it, as delivered by the Savior to the ancient inhabitants; also that there were two stones in silver bows&amp;mdash;and these stones, fastened to a breastplate, constituted what is called the [[Urim and Thummim]]&amp;mdash;deposited with the plates&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Smith|1838|p=4}}. (Punctuation has been modernized.)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The words ''[[Urim and Thummim]]'' derive from passages in the [[Old Testament]] which describe the use of &quot;the Urim and the Thummim&quot; as a means for [[divination]] by [[Israelite]] [[priest]]s (see, e.g., ''[[Book of Exodus]]'' 28:30).

After the messenger departed, Smith said he had two more encounters with him that night and an additional one the next morning, after which he told [[Joseph Smith, Sr.|his father]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Roberts|1902|loc=vol. 1, ch. 2, p. 14}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and soon thereafter the rest of his family, who believed his story, but generally kept it within the family.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Smith|1853|pp=83–84}}; {{Harvtxt|Smith|1883|pp=9–10}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Mormon Hill engraving (1841).gif|thumb|An 1841 engraving of [[Cumorah|&quot;Mormon Hill&quot;]] (looking south), where Smith said he found the golden plates on the west side, near the peak.]]
Thus, on September 22, 1823, a day listed in local [[almanac]]s as the [[autumn equinox]], Smith said that he went to a [[Cumorah|prominent hill]] near his home, and found the location of the artifacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Roberts|1902|loc=vol. 1, ch. 2, p. 15}}.&lt;/ref&gt; There are varying accounts as to how Smith reportedly found the precise location of the golden plates. In 1838, Smith stated that this location was shown to him in a vision while he conversed with Moroni.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Roberts|1902|loc=vol. 1, ch. 2, p. 13}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This conforms to an account by Smith's friend [[Joseph Knight, Sr.]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Knight 1833 2&quot;&gt;{{Harvtxt|Knight|1833|p=2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to a Palmyra resident Henry Harris, who said Smith told him he located the plates using his [[Seer stones in Mormonism|seer stone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Howe|1833|p=252}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In yet another account, the angel required Smith to follow a sequence of landmarks until he arrived at the correct location.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Lapham|1870|p=305}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The plates, according to Smith, were inside a covered stone box. However, Smith stated he was unable to obtain the plates at his first visit. According to an account by Willard Chase, the angel gave Smith a strict set of &quot;commandments&quot; which he was to follow in order to obtain the plates. Among these requirements, according to Chase, was that Smith must approach the site &quot;dressed in black clothes, and riding a black horse with a switch tail, and demand the book in a certain name, and after obtaining it, he must go directly away, and neither lay it down nor look behind him&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Howe|1834|p=242}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Smith's close friend [[Joseph Knight, Sr.]] corroborates the requirement that Smith was to &quot;take the Book and go right away&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Knight 1833 2&quot;/&gt; According to [[Lucy Mack Smith|Smith's mother]], the angel forbade him to put the plates on the ground until they were under lock and key.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Smith|1853|pp=85–86}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He was, however, according to a retelling of an account by Smith, Sr., allowed to put down the plates on a napkin he was to bring with him for that purpose &lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Lapham|1870| pp=305–306}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

When Smith arrived at the place where the plates were supposed to be, he reportedly took the plates from the stone box they were in and set them down on the ground nearby, looking to see if there were other items in the box that would &quot;be of some pecuniary advantage to him&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Smith|1853|p=85}}.&lt;/ref&gt; When he turned around, however, the plates were said to have disappeared into the box, which was then closed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Knight 1833 2&quot;/&gt; When Smith attempted to get the plates back out of the box, the angel hurled him back to the ground with a violent force (''id.'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Smith|1853|p=86}}; {{Harvtxt|Lapham|1870|p=305}}.&lt;/ref&gt; After three failed attempts to retrieve the plates, the angel told him that he could not have them then, because he &quot;had been tempted of the advisary [''sic''] and saught [''sic''] the Plates to obtain riches and kept not the commandments that I should have&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith 1832 3&quot;&gt;{{Harvtxt|Smith|1832|p=3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, Smith said the angel directed him to return the next year on September 22, 1824, with the &quot;right person&quot;, whom the angel reportedly said was his brother Alvin.&lt;ref name=&quot;Knight 1833 2&quot;/&gt; However, Alvin died within a few months, and when Smith returned to the hill in 1824, he did not return with the plates. Once again, the angel reportedly told Smith that he must return the next year with the &quot;right person&quot;, the identity of whom the angel would not say.&lt;ref name=&quot;Knight 1833 2&quot;/&gt; According to Smith's associate Willard Chase, Smith originally thought this person was to be Samuel T. Lawrence, a &quot;[[wikt:seer|seer]]&quot; himself who worked in Smith's treasure-seeking company in Palmyra,&lt;ref name=&quot;Harris 1859 164&quot;&gt;{{Harvtxt|Harris|1859|p=164}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and therefore Smith reportedly took Lawrence to the hill in 1825.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Howe|1834|p=243}}.&lt;/ref&gt; At Lawrence's prompting, Smith reportedly ascertained through his [[Seer stone (Latter Day Saints)|seer stone]] that there was an additional item together with the plates in the box, which Smith later called the ''[[Urim and Thummim]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Howe|1834|p=243}}. In addition to the [[Urim and Thummim]], Smith also reportedly discovered at some point that the box, or the ground nearby, contained several other artifacts, including the [[Liahona (Book of Mormon)|Liahona]], the [[sword of Laban]] {{Harv|Lapham|1870|p=306}}, the vessel in which the gold was melted, a rolling machine for gold plates, and three balls of gold as large as a fist {{Harv|Howe|1834|p=253}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Lawrence was apparently not the &quot;right person&quot;, because Smith did not obtain the plates in his 1825 visit.

Later, Smith reportedly determined by looking into his [[Seer stones in Mormonism|seer stone]] that the &quot;right person&quot; was [[Emma Hale Smith]], his future wife.&lt;ref name=&quot;Knight 1833 2&quot;/&gt; There is no specific record of Smith seeing the angel in 1826, however, after Joseph and Emma were married on January 18, 1827, Smith returned to Manchester, and as he passed by [[Cumorah]], he said he was chastised by the angel for not being &quot;engaged enough in the work of the Lord&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Smith|1853|p=99}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He was reportedly told that the next annual meeting was his last chance to get the plates and the [[Urim and Thummim]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Knight 1833 3&quot;&gt;{{Harvtxt|Knight|1833|p=3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Joseph Smith receiving golden plates.jpg|thumb|An 1893 engraving of Joseph Smith receiving the [[golden plates]] and the ''[[Urim and Thummim]]'' from [[Moroni (prophet)|Moroni]].]]
Just days prior to the day Smith said he was to meet with the angel on September 22, 1827, Smith's treasure-seeking associate, Josiah Stowell, and [[Joseph Knight, Sr.]] arranged to be in Palmyra for the attempt to retrieve the plates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Kight|1833|p=3}}; {{Harvtxt|Smith|1853|p=99}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Because Smith was concerned that Samuel Lawrence, his earlier confidant, might interfere, Smith sent [[Joseph Smith, Sr.|his father]] to spy on Lawrence's house the night of September 21 until dark.&lt;ref name=&quot;Knight 1833 3&quot;/&gt; Late that night, Smith took the horse and carriage of [[Joseph Knight, Sr.]] to [[Cumorah]] with his wife Emma.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Smith|1853|p=100}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Leaving Emma in the wagon, where she knelt in prayer,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Harris|1853|p=164}}.&lt;/ref&gt; he reportedly walked to the site of the golden plates, retrieved them, and hid them in a fallen tree-top on or near the hill.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Howe|1976|p=246}}; {{Harvtxt|Harris|1859|p=165}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He also reportedly retrieved the ''Urim and Thummim'', which he showed to [[Lucy Mack Smith|his mother]] the next morning.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith 1853 101&quot;&gt;{{Harvtxt|Smith|1853|p=101}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Knight, Smith was more fascinated by this artifact than he was the plates.&lt;ref name=&quot;Knight 1833 3&quot;/&gt;

Over the next few days, Smith took a well-digging job in nearby [[Macedon (town), New York|Macedon]] to obtain money to buy a solid lockable chest in which he said he would put the plates.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith 1853 101&quot;/&gt; By then, however, some of Smith's treasure-seeking company had heard that Smith was successful in obtaining the plates, and they wanted what they believed was their cut of the profits from what they saw as part of their joint venture.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harris 1859 167&quot;&gt;{{Harvtxt|Harris|1859|p=167}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Spying once again on the house of Samuel Lawrence, Smith, Sr. determined that a group of ten&amp;ndash;twelve of these men, including Lawrence and Willard Chase, had enlisted the talents of a renowned and supposedly talented seer from sixty miles away, in an effort to locate where the plates were hidden by means of [[divination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Smith|1853|p=102}}.&lt;/ref&gt; When Emma heard of this, she went to Macedon and informed Smith, Jr., who reportedly determined through his ''Urim and Thummim'' that the plates were safe, but nevertheless he hurriedly traveled home by horseback.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Smith|1853|pp=103–104}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Once home in Palmyra, he then walked to [[Cumorah]] and said he removed the plates from their hiding place, and walked back home with the plates wrapped in a linen frock under his arm, suffering a dislocated thumb as he fended off attackers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Howe|1834|p=246}}; {{Harvtxt|Smith|1853|pp=104–06}}; {{Harvtxt|Harris|1859|p=166}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Smith, the plates &quot;had the appearance of gold&quot;, and were:
&lt;blockquote&gt;...six inches wide and eight inches long and not quite so thick as common [[tin]]. They were filled with engravings, in [[Ancient Egypt]]ian characters and bound together in a volume, as the leaves of a book with three rings running through the whole. The volume was something near six inches in thickness, a part of which was sealed. The characters on the unsealed part were small, and beautifully engraved. The whole book exhibited many marks of antiquity in its construction and much skill in the art of [[engraving]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Smith|1842}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Smith refused to allow anyone, including his family, to view the plates directly. Some people, however, were allowed to heft them or feel them through a cloth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Howe|1834|p=264}}; {{Harvtxt|Harris|1859|169–70}}; {{Harvtxt|Smith|1884}}.&lt;/ref&gt; At first, he reportedly kept the plates in a chest under the hearth in his parents' home.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith 1853&quot;&gt;{{Harvtxt|Smith|1853}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Fearing it might be discovered, however, Smith hid the chest under the floor boards of his parents' old log home nearby.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harris 1859 167&quot;/&gt; Later, he said he took the plates out of the chest, left the empty chest under the floor boards, and hid the plates in a barrel of flax, not long before the location of the empty box was discovered and the place ransacked by Smith's former treasure-seeking associates, who had enlisted one of the men's sisters to find that location by looking in her [[Seer stones in Mormonism|seer stone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Smith|1853|pp=107–09}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Move to Harmony Township, Pennsylvania==
Joseph Smith's intention was to keep the box reportedly containing the golden plates safe from his Palymra neighbors while he dictated a translation of the book's reputed contents, which he would then publish. To do so, however, he needed an investment of money, and at the time he was penniless.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith 1853&quot;/&gt; Therefore, Smith sent [[Lucy Mack Smith|his mother]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Smith|1853|p=110}}.&lt;/ref&gt; to the home of [[Martin Harris (Latter Day Saints)|Martin Harris]], a local landowner said at the time to be worth about $8,000 to $10,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Howe|1834|p=260}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Harris had apparently been a close confidant of the Smith family since at least 1826,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Howe|1834|pp=255}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and he may have heard about Smith's attempts to obtain the plates from the angel even earlier from Smith, Sr.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Smith|1853|p=109}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He was also a believer in Smith's powers with his [[Seer stones in Mormonism|seer stone]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Harris 1859 164&quot;/&gt; When Lucy visited Harris, he had heard about Smith's report to have found golden plates through the [[Grapevine (gossip)|grapevine]] in Palmyra, and was interested in finding out more.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Harris|1859|pp=167–68}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, at Lucy Smith's request, Harris went to the Smith home, heard the story from Smith, and hefted a glass box that Smith said contained the plates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Harris|1859|pp=168–69}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Smith convinced Harris that he had the plates, and that the angel had told him to &quot;quit the company of the money-diggers&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Harris|1859|p=169}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Convinced, Harris immediately gave Smith $50, and committed to sponsor the translation of the plates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Smith|1853|p=113}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The money provided by Harris was enough to pay all of Smith's debts in Palmyra, and for him to travel with Emma and all of their belongings to [[Harmony Township, Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania]], where they would be able to avoid the public commotion in Palmyra over the plates.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harris 1859 170&quot;&gt;{{Harvtxt|Harris|1859|p=170}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, in early October 1827, they moved to Harmony, with the glass box reportedly holding the plates hidden during the trip in a barrel of beans.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harris 1859 170&quot;/&gt;
