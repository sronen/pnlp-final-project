'''AC/DC''' are an Australian rock band, formed in 1973 by brothers [[Malcolm Young|Malcolm]] and [[Angus Young]], who have remained the sole constant members. Commonly classified as [[hard rock]], they are considered pioneers of [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] and are sometimes classified as so,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |editor = Dale Hoiberg |encyclopedia = [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] Ultimate Reference Suite |title = AC/DC |edition = 2008 |date = 24 September 2007 |isbn = 1-59339-292-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |editor = Dale Hoiberg |encyclopedia = Encyclopædia Britannica Ultimate Reference Suite |title = heavy metal |edition = 2008 |date = 24 September 2007 |isbn = 1-59339-292-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; though they themselves have always classified their music as simply &quot;[[rock and roll]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bonfire&quot;&gt;{{cite book |first = Murray |last = Engleheart |title = AC/DC&amp;nbsp;— Bonfire |date = 18 November 1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To date they are one of the highest grossing bands of all time.
AC/DC underwent several line-up changes before releasing their first album, ''[[High Voltage (1975 album)|High Voltage]]'', on 17 February 1975. Membership remained stable until bassist [[Mark Evans (musician)|Mark Evans]] was replaced by [[Cliff Williams]] in 1977 for the album ''[[Powerage]]''. Within months of recording the album ''[[Highway to Hell]]'', lead singer and co-songwriter [[Bon Scott]] died on 19 February 1980, after a night of heavy alcohol consumption. The group briefly considered disbanding, but Scott's parents urged them to continue and hire a new vocalist. Ex-[[Geordie (band)|Geordie]] singer [[Brian Johnson]] was auditioned and selected to replace Scott. Later that year, the band released their highest selling album, and ultimately the [[List of best-selling albums worldwide|third highest-selling album by any artist]], ''[[Back in Black]]''.

The band's next album, ''[[For Those About to Rock We Salute You]]'', was their first album to reach number one in the United States. AC/DC declined in popularity soon after drummer [[Phil Rudd]] was fired in 1983 and was replaced by future [[Dio (band)|Dio]] drummer [[Simon Wright (musician)|Simon Wright]], though the band resurged in the early 1990s with the release of ''[[The Razors Edge (album)|The Razors Edge]]''. Phil Rudd returned in 1994 (after [[Chris Slade]], who was with the band from 1989–1994, was asked to leave in favour of him) and contributed to the band's 1995 album ''[[Ballbreaker]]''. Since then, the band's line-up has remained the same. ''[[Stiff Upper Lip]]'' was released in 2000 and was well received by critics, and the band's latest studio album, ''[[Black Ice (album)|Black Ice]]'', was released on 20 October 2008. It was their biggest hit on the charts since ''For Those About to Rock'', reaching No.1 on all the charts eventually.&lt;ref name=&quot;currentstatus&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/BLABBERMOUTH.NET/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=95431 |title = AC/DC Completes Recording New Album |work=[[Blabbermouth.net]] |accessdate =22 April 2008 |date = 22 April 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080424091345/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=95431| archivedate= 24 April 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Background and name===
Brothers Malcolm, Angus, and [[George Young (rock musician)|George Young]] were born in [[Glasgow]], Scotland, and moved to Sydney with most of their family in 1963. George was the first to learn to play the guitar. He became a member of [[the Easybeats]], one of Australia's most successful bands of the 1960s. In 1966, they became the first local rock act to have an international hit, with the song &quot;[[Friday on My Mind]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=albertmusic&gt;{{cite web |title = History of Albert Music |first = Glenn A. |last = Baker |url = http://www.albertmusic.com/history.htm |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071230073123/http://www.albertmusic.com/history.htm |archivedate = 30 December 2007 |work=[[Albert Productions|Albert Music]] |accessdate =2 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Malcolm followed in George's footsteps by playing with a [[Newcastle, New South Wales]], band called the Velvet Underground (not to be confused with the New York–based [[The Velvet Underground|Velvet Underground]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;cwalker&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Highway to Hell: The Life and Times of AC/DC Legend Bon Scott |year=2001 |isbn=1-891241-13-3 |author=Walker, Clinton |pages=128–133}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their oldest brother Alex Young chose to remain in Britain to pursue musical interests. In 1967, Alexander formed and played bass in the London-based band Grapefruit—initially called &quot;The Grapefruit&quot;—with three former members of Tony Rivers and the Castaways, John Perry, Geoff Swettenham, and Pete Swettenham.

[[File:ACDC logo.gif|thumb|The band's logo was designed in 1977 by Gerard Huerta. It first appeared on the international version of ''Let There Be Rock''.]]
Malcolm and Angus Young developed the idea for the band's name after their older sister, Margaret Young, saw the initials &quot;[[AC/DC (electricity)|AC/DC]]&quot; on a sewing machine. &quot;AC/DC&quot; is an abbreviation meaning &quot;[[alternating current]]/[[direct current]]&quot; electricity. The brothers felt that this name symbolised the band's raw energy, power-driven performances, and a love for their music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://classicrock.about.com/od/artistsae1/p/ac_dc.htm | title = AC/DC | accessdate =2 August 2008 | last = White | first = Dave | work=[[About.com|About.com – Classic rock]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;acdc.cc&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=AC/DC History | work=AC/DC&amp;nbsp;— Bedlam in Belgium | url=http://www.ac-dc.cc | accessdate =2 August 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080913173941/http://www.ac-dc.cc/| archivedate= 13 September 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;AC/DC&quot; is pronounced one letter at a time, though the band are colloquially known as &quot;Acca Dacca&quot; in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/05/16/1084646066908.html |title=Tracker to Acca Dacca |accessdate=18 October 2008 |last= |authorlink= |date=17 May 2004 |month= |work=The Age (theage.com.au) |publisher=Fairfax Digital |location=Melbourne, Australia |language= |archiveurl= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.onlymelbourne.com.au/melbourne_details.php?id=11169 |title=AC/DC ACDC |accessdate=18 October 2008 |last= |authorlink= |date=1 October 2004 |month= |work=Only Melbourne (onlymelbourne.com.au) |pages=Melbourne, Australia |doi= |archivedate= |quote=Its now rock 'n' roll history after Melbourne discovered acca-dacca so did the rest of the world, going on to become one of the biggest bands in the world. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early years (the Dave Evans era, 1973–1974)===
In November 1973 Malcolm and Angus Young formed AC/DC and recruited bassist [[Larry Van Kriedt]], vocalist [[Dave Evans (singer)|Dave Evans]], and [[Colin Burgess (musician)|Colin Burgess]], ex-[[The Masters Apprentices|Masters Apprentices]] drummer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Rock Snaps |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation | url = http://www.abc.net.au/arts/rocksnaps/photos/s33884.htm | accessdate =2 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pushing hard for the bands success were Australia’s legendary roadie Ray Arnold and his partner Alan Kissack. The two men convinced Chequers entertainment manager [[Gene Pierson]] to let the band play at the popular Sydney nightclub on New Year's Eve, 1973.&lt;ref name=&quot;longwaytimeline&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Long Way to the Top |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation | url = http://www.abc.net.au/longway/timeline/ | accessdate =2 August 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080725161207/http://www.abc.net.au/longway/timeline/| archivedate= 25 July 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band was so loud however that management complained. Pierson however took an interest, and booked them into the Bondi an bbb(important)
ifesaver and other venues where they further developed their stage show. The early line-up of the band changed often; [[Colin Burgess (musician)|Colin Burgess]] was the first member fired, and several bassists and drummers passed through the band during the next year.

ted his characteristic school-uniform stage outfit. The idea was his sister Margaret's. Angus had tried other costumes, such as [[Spider-Man]], [[Zorro]], a gorilla, and a parody of [[Superman]], named Super-Ang.&lt;ref name=&quot;cwalker&quot; /&gt; In fact in its early days, most members of the band dressed in some form of glam or satin outfit but this approach was abandoned when it was discovered Melbourne band [[Skyhooks (band)|Skyhooks]] had already adopted this approach to their stage presentation.

The Young brothers decided that Evans was not a suitable frontman for the group, because they felt he was more of a [[glam rock]]er like [[Gary Glitter]].&lt;ref name=&quot;paulstenning&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last=Stenning | first=Paul | coauthors=Rob Johnstone | year=2005 | month=November | title=AC/DC&amp;nbsp;— Two Sides to Every Glory | publisher=Chrome Dreams | isbn=1-84240-308-7 | pages=32–34 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On stage, Evans was occasionally replaced by the band's first [[Music management|manager]], Dennis Laughlin, who was the original lead singer with [[Sherbet (band)|Sherbet]] prior to [[Daryl Braithwaite]] joining the band. Evans did not get along with Laughlin, which also contributed to the band's ill feeling toward Evans.&lt;ref name=&quot;paulstenning&quot; /&gt;

It was [[Gene Pierson]] who brokered the arrangement for [[Bon Scott]] from Fraternity to join them as lead singer. He was also instrumental in getting personal friend [[Ted Albert]] of [[Albert Productions]] to listen to AC/DC and arranged with programme manager Rod Muir of Australia’s biggest rock station [[2SM]] to have them on the bill for one of their massive school holiday concerts back at Chequers which helped launch AC/DC's career and led to their being signed to the EMI-distributed [[Albert Productions]] label for Australia and New Zealand.

===The Bon Scott era (1974–1980)===
====The journey begins (1974–77)====
In September 1974 [[Bon Scott|Ronald Belford &quot;Bon&quot; Scott]], an experienced vocalist and friend of George Young, replaced Dave Evans. Like the Young brothers, Scott had been born in Scotland before emigrating to Australia in his childhood. The band had recorded only one single with Evans, &quot;Can I Sit Next to You, Girl&quot; / &quot;Rockin' in the Parlour&quot;; eventually, the song was re-recorded with Bon Scott as &quot;[[Can I Sit Next to You Girl]]&quot; (Track 7 on the Australian album ''[[T.N.T. (album)|T.N.T.]]'' (1975), and Track 6 on the international release of ''[[High Voltage (1976 album)|High Voltage]]'') (1976).

By October 1974, the Australia-only album ''[[High Voltage (1975 album)|High Voltage]]'' had been recorded. It took only ten days&lt;ref name=&quot;timeline&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.acdcrocks.com/TIMELINE_index.html | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070612165328/http://www.acdcrocks.com/TIMELINE_index.html | archivedate = 12 June 2007 | title = Timeline | work=AC/DC official website | accessdate =2 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was based on instrumental songs written by the Young brothers, with lyrics added by Scott. Within a few months, the band's line-up had stabilised, featuring Scott, the Young brothers, bassist [[Mark Evans (musician)|Mark Evans]] and drummer [[Phil Rudd]]. Later that year they released the single &quot;[[It's a Long Way to the Top (If You Wanna Rock 'n' Roll)]]&quot;, which became their perennial rock anthem.&lt;ref name=&quot;acdclane&quot;&gt;{{cite news | first = Martin | last = Boulton | title = Laneway to the top for AC/DC | url = http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/09/09/1094530766163.html |work=The Age |location=Australia | date = 10 September 2004 | accessdate =2 August 2008 | location=Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was included on their second album, ''[[T.N.T. (album)|T.N.T.]]'', (1975) which was also released only in Australia and New Zealand. The album featured another classic song, &quot;[[High Voltage (song)|High Voltage]]&quot;.

Between 1974 and 1977, aided by regular appearances on [[Molly Meldrum]]'s ''[[Countdown (Australian TV series)|Countdown]]'', the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]]’s nationally broadcast pop-music television show, AC/DC became one of the most popular and successful acts in Australia. Their performance on 3 April 1977 was their last live TV appearance for more than 20 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;timeline&quot; /&gt;

====International success (1976–80)====
[[File:ACDC-Hughes-long ago.jpg|thumb|upright|Former vocalist [[Bon Scott]] (centre) pictured with guitarist [[Angus Young]] (left) and bassist [[Cliff Williams]] (back), performing at the [[Ulster Hall]] in August 1979]]
In 1976, the band signed an international deal with [[Atlantic Records]] and toured extensively throughout Europe including their first UK tour with 'Sounds' Magazine called The 'Lock up your Daughters Summer Tour'. They gained invaluable experience of the stadium circuit, supporting leading rock acts such as [[Black Sabbath (band)|Black Sabbath]], [[Aerosmith]], [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]], [[Styx (band)|Styx]], UFO, and [[Blue Öyster Cult]], and co-headlined with [[Cheap Trick]].&lt;ref name=&quot;timeline&quot; /&gt;

The first AC/DC album to gain worldwide distribution was a 1976 compilation of tracks taken from the ''High Voltage'' and ''T.N.T.'' [[LP album|LP]]s. Also titled ''[[High Voltage (1976 album)|High Voltage]]'', and released on the Atlantic Records label, the album, which has to date sold three million copies worldwide,&lt;ref name=&quot;BiBBillboard&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1000947787 |title = ''Back In Black'' tips 21M mark |accessdate =2 August 2008 |last = Jeckell |first = Barry A. |date = 7 June 2005 |work=Billboard | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080623211559/http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1000947787| archivedate= 23 June 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; gained the band a following among the then-substantial British punk audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = {{Allmusic|class=album|id=r78|pure_url=yes}} |title = AC/DC&amp;nbsp;— High Voltage |accessdate =2 August 2008 |first = Steve |last = Huey |work=[[Allmusic]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The track selection was heavily weighted toward the more recent ''T.N.T.'', and included only two songs from their first LP. The band's next album, ''[[Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap (album)|Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap]]'', was released in the same year in both Australian and international versions, like its predecessor. Track listings varied worldwide, and the international version of the album also featured &quot;Rocker&quot; from ''T.N.T.'' The original Australian version included &quot;[[Jailbreak (AC/DC song)|Jailbreak]]&quot; (now more readily available on the 1984 compilation [[Extended play|EP]] ''[['74 Jailbreak]]'' or as a live version on the 1992 ''[[Live (AC/DC album)|Live]]'' album). ''Dirty Deeds'' was not released in the US until 1981, by which time the band were at the peak of their popularity.

Following the 1977 recording ''[[Let There Be Rock (album)|Let There Be Rock]]'', bassist Mark Evans was sacked because of personal differences with Angus Young. He was replaced by [[Cliff Williams]], who also provided backing vocals alongside [[Malcolm Young]]. Neither of the Young brothers has elaborated on the departure of Evans, though Richard Griffiths, the CEO of [[Epic Records]] and a booking agent for AC/DC in the mid-1970s, later commented, &quot;You knew Mark wasn't going to last, he was just too much of a nice guy.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;cwalker&quot; /&gt; Mark Evans' autobiography, ''DIRTY DEEDS: My Life Inside/Outside of AC/DC'' is scheduled to be released fall 2011 by [[Bazillion Points]], and will predominantly deal with his time in AC/DC, including being fired.&lt;ref name=BazillionPoints&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bazillionpoints.com/dirty-deeds-my-life-insideoutside-of-acdc-by-mark-evans/ |title=DIRTY DEEDS: My Life Inside/Outside of AC/DC, by Mark Evans |publisher=Bazillionpoints.com |date= |accessdate=26 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:BonScottStatue3 gobeirne.jpg|left|thumb|Bronze statue of Bon Scott, unveiled in [[Fremantle, Western Australia|Fremantle]], Western Australia, in October 2008]]
AC/DC were a somewhat formative influence on [[New Wave of British Heavy Metal]] bands who emerged in the late 1970s, such as [[Saxon (band)|Saxon]] and [[Iron Maiden]], in part as a reaction to the decline of traditional early 1970s hard rock bands. In 2007, critics noted that AC/DC, along with [[Thin Lizzy]], [[UFO (band)|UFO]], [[Scorpions (band)|Scorpions]] and [[Judas Priest]], were among &quot;the second generation of rising stars ready to step into the breach as the old guard waned.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Elliott, Paul. ''&quot;Never Mind the Bollocks&quot;''. [[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]] (February 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

AC/DC's first American exposure was through the [[Michigan]] radio station AM 600 [[WTAC]] in 1977. The station's manager, Peter C. Cavanaugh, booked the band to play at [[Flint, Michigan|Flint]]'s Capitol Theater. The supporting act was [[MC5]], who had just briefly reunited and agreed to play at the event. The band opened with their popular song &quot;[[Live Wire (AC/DC song)|Live Wire]]&quot; and closed with &quot;It's a Long Way to the Top (If You Wanna Rock 'n' Roll)&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Peter Cavanaugh |work=Wild Wednesday |url = http://wildwednesday.com/index.html |accessdate =2 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AC/DC came to be identified with the [[punk rock]] movement by the British press. Their reputation, however, managed to survive the punk upheavals of the late 1970s, and they maintained a cult following in the UK throughout this time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bonfire&quot; /&gt; Angus Young gained notoriety for [[mooning]] the audience during live performances.

The 1978 release of ''[[Powerage]]'' marked the debut of bassist Cliff Williams, and with its harder [[riffs]], followed the blueprint set by ''Let There Be Rock''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = {{Allmusic|class=album|id=r81|pure_url=yes}} |title = AC/DC&amp;nbsp;— Powerage |publisher=Allmusic |first = Greg |last = Prato |accessdate =2 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Only one single was released for ''Powerage'', &quot;[[Rock 'n' Roll Damnation]]&quot; and gave AC/DC the highest mark at the time, reaching #24. [[Eddie Van Halen]] notes this to be his favourite AC/DC record, along with [[Highway To Hell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spinner.com/2009/06/11/eddie-van-halen-thanks-god-for-sobriety-and-guitar-riffs/ |title=Eddie Van Halen Thanks God for Sobriety and Guitar Riffs |publisher=Spinner |date=11 June 2009 |accessdate=1 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; An appearance at the [[The Apollo (Glasgow)|Apollo Theatre, Glasgow]] during the ''Powerage'' tour was recorded and released as ''[[If You Want Blood You've Got It]]'', featuring such songs as &quot;[[Whole Lotta Rosie]]&quot;, &quot;Problem Child&quot;, and &quot;[[Let There Be Rock (song)|Let There Be Rock]]&quot;, as well as lesser-known album tracks like &quot;[[Riff Raff (song)|Riff Raff]]&quot;. The album was the last produced by [[Harry Vanda]] and George Young with Bon Scott on vocals and is claimed to be AC/DC's most under-rated album.&lt;ref name=&quot;popmatters&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.popmatters.com/music/reviews/a/acdc-reissues2.shtml |title = Epic Records AC/DC Re-issues: Second Wave |accessdate =2 August 2008 |author=Christopher, Michael |date = 30 June 2003 |work=[[PopMatters]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The major breakthrough in the band's career came in their collaboration with producer [[Robert Lange|&quot;Mutt&quot; Lange]] on a sixth album ''[[Highway to Hell]]'', released in 1979. It became the first AC/DC LP to break into the US top 100, eventually reaching #17,&lt;ref name=&quot;timeline&quot; /&gt; and it propelled AC/DC into the top ranks of hard rock acts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bonfire&quot; /&gt; ''Highway to Hell'' had lyrics that shifted away from flippant and comical toward more central rock themes, putting increased emphasis on backing vocals but still featured AC/DC's signature sound: loud, simple, pounding riffs and grooving backbeats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = {{Allmusic|class=album|id=r82|pure_url=yes}} |title = AC/DC&amp;nbsp;— Highway to Hell |publisher=Allmusic |first = Steve |last = Huey |accessdate =2 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The final track, &quot;[[Night Prowler]]&quot;, has two breaths in quick succession at the start of the song, intended to create a tone of fear and loathing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bonfire&quot; /&gt;

====Scott's death (1980)====
As 1980 began, the band began work on a new album that would eventually become ''[[Back in Black]]'', but Bon Scott would not live to see the project being finished. On 19 February 1980, Scott passed out in the car on the way back to friend Alistair Kinnear's house after a night of heavy drinking at the Music Machine club in London. Upon arrival at his home, Kinnear was unable to move Scott from the car into his home for the night, so he left him in the car overnight to sleep off the effects of the alcohol. Unable to wake Scott late the next morning, Kinnear rushed him to [[King's College Hospital]] in Camberwell, where Scott was pronounced dead on arrival. [[Pulmonary aspiration]] of vomit was the cause of Scott's death,&lt;ref name=&quot;BScottDeath2&quot;&gt;&quot;Scott [had] choked on his own vomit [in his sleep].&quot; [[Back in Black]] 1980,2003 CD booklet.&lt;/ref&gt; and the official cause was listed as &quot;[[alcohol poisoning|acute alcohol poisoning]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;BScottDeath&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first = Richard |last = Jinman |title = 25 years on, AC/DC fans recall how wild rocker met his end |url = http://arts.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,11711,1418115,00.html |work=The Guardian |location=UK |date = 19 February 2005 |accessdate =2 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Scott's family buried him in [[Fremantle, Western Australia]], the area they immigrated to when he was a boy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Bon's Highway leads to the National Trust |date = 15 February 2006 |accessdate =9 December 2007 |work=Metropolitan Cemeteries Board |url = http://www.mcb.wa.gov.au/MCBNews/mediaRel.html |archiveurl =http://web.archive.org/web/20071116103758/http://www.mcb.wa.gov.au/MCBNews/mediaRel.html &lt;!-- Added by H3llBot --&gt; |archivedate =16 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inconsistencies in the official accounts of Scott's death have been cited in conspiracy theories, which suggest that Scott died of a heroin overdose, or was killed by exhaust fumes redirected into the car, or that Kinnear did not exist.&lt;ref name=&quot;BScottDeath&quot; /&gt; Additionally, Scott was [[asthma]]tic,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://jam.canoe.ca/Music/Artists/A/Acdc/1997/11/22/742716.html | title = AC/DC lights a Bonfire in tribute | accessdate =2 August 2008 | last = Stevenson | first = Jane | date = 22 November 1997 | work=[[Jam!|Canoe JAM! music]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the temperature was below freezing on the morning of his death.

===The Brian Johnson era (1980–present)===
====The rebirth (1980–83)====
Following Scott's death, the band briefly considered quitting; they eventually concluded, however, that Scott would have wanted AC/DC to continue, and various candidates were considered for his replacement, including Buzz Shearman, ex-[[Moxy (band)|Moxy]] member, who was not able to join because of voice problems,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Moxy Bio | work=CANOE JAM! MUSIC&amp;nbsp;— Pop Encyclopedia |url= http://jam.canoe.ca/Music/Pop_Encyclopedia/M/Moxy.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; ex-[[Back Street Crawler (band)|Back Street Crawler]] vocalist [[Terry Slesser]] and then [[Slade]] vocalist, [[Noddy Holder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soundchecks.co.uk/articles/noholder.html |title=Noddy Holder interview |publisher=Soundchecks.co.uk |accessdate=9 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining AC/DC members finally decided on ex-[[Geordie (band)|Geordie]] singer [[Brian Johnson]].
[[File:Cliffwilliams.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Cliff Williams]] in 1981 during the [[For Those About to Rock Tour]]]]

Angus Young later recalled, &quot;I remember the first time I had ever heard Brian's (Johnson) name was from Bon. Bon had mentioned that he had been in England once touring with a band and he had mentioned that Brian had been in a band called Geordie and Bon had said 'Brian Johnson, he was a great rock and roll singer in the style of [[Little Richard]].' And that was Bon's big idol, Little Richard. I think when he saw Brian at that time, to Bon it was 'Well he's a guy that knows what rock and roll is all about.' He mentioned that to us in Australia. I suppose when we decided to continue, Brian was the first name that Malcolm and myself came up with, so we said we should see if we can find him.&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=bravewords.com |url=http://www.bravewords.com/news/132727 |title=AC/DC Guitarist Angus Young Remembers Bon Scott – &quot;When I Think Back In Hindsight, He Was A Guy That I Always Knew Was Full Of Life&quot; |publisher=Bravewords.com |accessdate=9 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For the audition, Johnson sang &quot;[[Whole Lotta Rosie]]&quot; from ''[[Let There Be Rock]]'' and [[Ike &amp; Tina Turner]]'s &quot;[[Nutbush City Limits]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;acdc.cc&quot; /&gt; He was hired a few days after the audition.

With Brian Johnson the band completed the songwriting that they had begun with Bon Scott for the album ''[[Back in Black]]''. Recording took place at [[Compass Point Studios]] in the [[Bahamas]] a few months after Scott's death. ''Back in Black'', produced by [[Mutt Lange]] and recorded by [[Tony Platt]], became their biggest-selling album and a hard-rock landmark; hits include &quot;[[Hells Bells (song)|Hells Bells]]&quot;, &quot;[[You Shook Me All Night Long]]&quot;, and [[Back in Black (song)|the title track]]. The album was certified platinum three months after its release, and by 2007 it had sold more than 22&amp;nbsp;million copies in the United States and over 45&amp;nbsp;million world wide, making it the fourth-highest-selling album ever in the US and the second highest selling in the world (second to [[Michael Jackson]]'s ''[[Thriller (album)|Thriller]]'').&lt;ref name=&quot;riaa2&quot; /&gt; The album reached No.1 in the UK and No.4 in the US, where it spent 131 weeks on the [[Billboard 200]] album chart.&lt;ref name=&quot;timeline&quot; /&gt;

The follow-up album, 1981's ''[[For Those About to Rock We Salute You]]'', also sold well and was positively received by critics. The album featured two of the band's most popular singles: &quot;Let's Get It Up&quot;&lt;ref name=everyhit&gt;{{cite web | title= EveryHit | url = http://www.everyhit.com | accessdate =2 August 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080913103452/http://www.everyhit.com/| archivedate= 13 September 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the title track, &quot;[[For Those About to Rock (We Salute You)|For Those About to Rock]]&quot;, which reached No.13 and No.15 in the UK, respectively. The band split with Lange for their self-produced 1983 album, ''[[Flick of the Switch]]'', in an effort to recover the rawness and simplicity of their early albums.&lt;ref name=&quot;flickof&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = {{Allmusic|class=album|id=r86|pure_url=yes}} | title = AC/DC&amp;nbsp;— Flick of the Switch |publisher=Allmusic | first = Steve | last = Huey | accessdate =2 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Departure of Rudd and commercial decline (1983–87)====

Amid rumours of alcoholism and drug-induced paranoia, drummer [[Phil Rudd]]'s friendship with Malcolm Young deteriorated and, after a long period of unfriendliness, the men's dislike for each other grew so strong that they fought. Rudd was fired two hours after the fight.&lt;ref name=&quot;acdc.cc&quot; /&gt; Session drummer [[B.J. Wilson]] was drafted in to help complete the recordings, but his drum parts were eventually not used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Stenning | first = Paul | year = 2005 | title = AC/DC: Two Sides to Every Glory | publisher=Chrome Dreams | isbn = 1-84240-308-7 | postscript = .}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Although Rudd had finished the drum tracks for their next album, he was replaced by [[Simon Wright (musician)|Simon Wright]] in the summer of 1983 after the band held an anonymous audition.

Later in the year, AC/DC released the self-produced album ''[[Flick of the Switch]]'', which was less successful than their previous albums, and was considered underdeveloped and unmemorable.&lt;ref name=&quot;flickof&quot; /&gt; One critic stated that the band &quot;had made the same album nine times&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/acdc/albums/album/174854/review/5945613/flick_of_the_switch | title = AC/DC: Flick of the Switch | accessdate =2 August 2008 | last = Fricke | first = David | date = 27 October 1987 | work=Rolling Stone | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080618141735/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/acdc/albums/album/174854/review/5945613/flick_of_the_switch| archivedate= 18 June 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}{{dead link|date=July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; AC/DC was voted the eighth-biggest disappointment of the year in the 1984 ''[[Kerrang!]]'' readers' poll. However, ''Flick of the Switch'' eventually reached No.4 on the UK charts,&lt;ref name=&quot;acdc.cc&quot; /&gt; and AC/DC had minor success with the singles &quot;[[Nervous Shakedown]]&quot; and &quot;[[Flick of the Switch (song)|Flick of the Switch]]&quot;. ''[[Fly on the Wall (AC/DC album)|Fly on the Wall]]'', produced by the Young brothers in 1985, was also regarded as uninspired and directionless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = {{Allmusic|class=album|id=r88|pure_url=yes}} | title = AC/DC&amp;nbsp;— Fly on the Wall |publisher=Allmusic | first = Steve | last = Huey | accessdate =2 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A music concept video of [[Fly on the Wall (video)|the same name]] featured the band at a bar, playing five of the album's ten songs.

In 1986, the group returned to the charts with the made-for-radio &quot;[[Who Made Who (song)|Who Made Who]]&quot;. The album ''[[Who Made Who]]'' was the soundtrack to [[Stephen King]]'s film ''[[Maximum Overdrive]]'',&lt;ref name=&quot;popmatters&quot; /&gt; It brought together older hits, such as &quot;[[You Shook Me All Night Long]]&quot; and &quot;Ride On&quot;, with newer songs such as title track &quot;Who Made Who&quot;, and two new instrumentals, &quot;D.T.&quot; and &quot;Chase the Ace&quot;.

In February 1988, AC/DC were inducted into the [[Australian Recording Industry Association]]'s [[ARIA Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = ARIA Icons: Hall of Fame | work=[[Australian Recording Industry Association]] | url = http://www.aria.com.au/pages/hall-of-fame.htm |accessdate =2 August 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080718214652/http://aria.com.au/pages/hall-of-fame.htm| archivedate= 18 July 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Back to commercial success (1987–90)====
AC/DC's 1988 album, ''[[Blow Up Your Video]]'', was recorded at [[Studio Miraval]] in [[Le Val]] ([[Occitania]]), France, and reunited the band with their original producers, [[Harry Vanda]] and [[George Young (rock musician)|George Young]]. The group recorded nineteen songs, choosing ten for the final release; though the album was later criticised for containing excessive &quot;[[filler (media)|filler]]&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;blowup&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = {{Allmusic|class=album|id=r90|pure_url=yes}} | title = AC/DC&amp;nbsp;— Blow Up your Video |publisher=Allmusic | first = Greg | last = Prato | accessdate =2 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; it was a commercial success. ''Blow Up Your Video'' sold more copies than the previous two studio releases combined, reaching No.2 on the UK charts—AC/DC's highest position since &quot;Back in Black&quot; in 1980. The album featured the UK top-twenty single &quot;[[Heatseeker (song)|Heatseeker]]&quot;&lt;ref name=everyhit /&gt; and popular songs such as &quot;[[That's the Way I Wanna Rock 'n' Roll]]&quot;. The ''Blow Up Your Video'' World Tour began in February 1988, in [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], Australia. That April, following live appearances across Europe, [[Malcolm Young]] announced that he was taking time off from touring, principally to begin recovery from his alcoholism. Another member of the Young family, [[Stevie Young]], temporarily took Malcolm's place.
[[File:Ac-dcphil-rudd.jpg|left|thumb|[[Phil Rudd]] performs at the [[KeyArena]] in Seattle on 12 August 1996 during the [[Ballbreaker World Tour]]]]
Following the tour, Wright left the group to work on the upcoming [[Dio (band)|Dio]] album ''[[Lock Up the Wolves]]'', and was replaced by session veteran [[Chris Slade]]. Johnson was unavailable for several months while finalising his divorce,&lt;ref name=&quot;acdc.cc&quot; /&gt; so the Young brothers wrote all the songs for the next album, a practice they continued for all subsequent releases through ''[[Black Ice (album)|Black Ice]]'' in 2008.

====Popularity regained (1990–94)====
The next album, ''[[The Razors Edge (album)|The Razors Edge]]'', was recorded in Vancouver, Canada, and was mixed and engineered by [[Mike Fraser]] and produced by [[Bruce Fairbairn]], who had previously worked with [[Aerosmith]] and [[Bon Jovi]]. Released in 1990, it was a major comeback for the band, and included the hits &quot;[[Thunderstruck (song)|Thunderstruck]]&quot; and &quot;[[Are You Ready (AC/DC song)|Are You Ready]]&quot;, which reached No.5 and No.16 respectively on ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'''s [[Mainstream Rock Tracks]] Chart, and &quot;[[Moneytalks]]&quot;, which peaked at No.23 on the [[Billboard Hot 100]].&lt;ref name=everyhit /&gt; The album went [[multi-platinum]] and reached the US top ten. Several shows on the Razors Edge tour were recorded for the 1992 live album, titled ''[[Live (AC/DC album)|Live]]''. ''Live'' was produced by Fairbairn, and is considered one of the best live albums of the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = {{Allmusic|class=album|id=r53486|pure_url=yes}} | title = AC/DC&amp;nbsp;— AC/DC Live |publisher=Allmusic | first = Barry | last = Weber | accessdate =2 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was during this tour when AC/DC headlined the [[Monsters of Rock]] show, which was released on DVD as ''[[Live at Donington (AC/DC)|Live at Donington]]''. A year later, AC/DC recorded &quot;[[Big Gun]]&quot; for the soundtrack of the [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] movie ''[[Last Action Hero]]'', and was released as a single, reaching No.1 on the US [[Mainstream Rock Tracks|Mainstream Rock]] chart, the band's first No.1 single on that chart.&lt;ref name=&quot;timeline&quot; /&gt;

====Popularity confirmed (1994–2008)====
In 1994, Angus and Malcolm invited Rudd to several [[jam session]]s. He was eventually rehired to replace Slade, whose amicable departure arose in part because of the band's strong desire to again work with Rudd. Recorded at the [[Ocean Way Recording|Ocean Way Studios]] in Los Angeles, California by a 1980–83 line-up back together and produced by [[Rick Rubin]], ''[[Ballbreaker]]'' was released in 1995. The first single from the album was &quot;[[Hard as a Rock]]&quot;. Two more singles were released from the album: &quot;[[Hail Caesar (song)|Hail Caesar]]&quot; and &quot;[[Cover You in Oil]]&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
In 1997, a box set named ''[[Bonfire (album)|Bonfire]]'' was released. It contained four albums; a [[remaster]]ed version of ''Back in Black''; ''[[Volts (album)|Volts]]'' (a disc with alternate takes, outtakes, and stray live cuts) and two live albums, ''[[Live from the Atlantic Studios]]'' and ''[[Let There Be Rock: The Movie – Live in Paris|Let There Be Rock: The Movie]]''. ''Live from the Atlantic Studios'' was recorded on 7 December 1977 at the Atlantic Studios in New York. ''Let There Be Rock: The Movie'' was a double album recorded in 1979 at the [[Pavillon de Paris]] and was the soundtrack of a motion picture, ''[[AC/DC: Let There Be Rock]]''. The US version of the box set included a colour booklet, a two-sided poster, a sticker, a temporary tattoo, a keychain bottle opener, and a guitar pick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.acdc-discography.com/CDBoxSets.html | title = Boxsets | accessdate =2 August 2008 | work=AC/DC discography | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080728070955/http://www.acdc-discography.com/CDBoxSets.html| archivedate= 28 July 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:AngusYoung1.JPG|left|thumb|Angus Young performs in [[Cologne]], Germany in 2001 during the [[Stiff Upper Lip World Tour|Stiff Upper Lip Tour]]]] In 2000, the band released ''[[Stiff Upper Lip World Tour|Stiff Upper Lip]]'', produced by brother [[George Young (rock musician)|George Young]] at the Warehouse Studio, again in Vancouver. The album was better received by critics than ''Ballbreaker'' but was considered lacking in new ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/acdc/albums/album/198241/review/5941859/stiff_upper_lip | title = AC/DC: Stiff Upper Lip | accessdate =2 August 2008 | last = Wild | first = David | date = 30 March 2000 | work=Rolling Stone | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080727012816/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/acdc/albums/album/198241/review/5941859/stiff_upper_lip| archivedate= 27 July 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}{{dead link|date=July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = {{Allmusic|class=album|id=r465726|pure_url=yes}} | title = AC/DC&amp;nbsp;— Stiff Upper Lip |publisher=Allmusic | first = Stephen Thomas | last = Erlewine | accessdate =2 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Australian release included a bonus disc with three promotional videos and several live performances recorded in Madrid, Spain in 1996. ''Stiff Upper Lip'' reached No.1 in five countries, including Argentina and Germany; No.2 in three countries, Spain, France and Switzerland; No.3 in Australia; No.5 in Canada and Portugal; and No.7 in Norway, the US and Hungary. The first single, &quot;[[Stiff Upper Lip (song)|Stiff Upper Lip]]&quot;, remained at No.1 on the US Mainstream Rock charts for four weeks.&lt;ref name=&quot;timeline&quot; /&gt; The other singles released also did very well; &quot;[[Satellite Blues]]&quot; and &quot;[[Safe in New York City]]&quot; reached No.7 and No.31 on Billboard's Mainstream Rock Tracks, respectively.

In 2002, AC/DC signed a long-term, multi-album deal with [[Sony Music Entertainment|Sony Music]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | date = 6 December 2002 | title = AC/DC Sign big contract with Sony | accessdate =16 September 2009 | work=[[Chart (magazine)|ChartAttack]] | url = http://www.chartattack.com/news/32768/acdc-sign-big-contract-with-sony | first=Pete | last=Richards &lt;!-- archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20030321215700/http://www.chartattack.com/damn/2002/12/0608.cfm | archivedate = 21 March 2003 --&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; who went on to release a series of [[remaster]]ed albums as part of their AC/DC remasters series.

''Ballbreaker'' was eventually re-released in October 2005; ''Stiff Upper Lip'' was later re-released in April 2007.

On 30 July 2003, the band performed with [[the Rolling Stones]] and [[Rush (band)|Rush]] at [[Molson Canadian Rocks for Toronto]]. The concert, held before an audience of half a million, was intended to help the city overcome the negative publicity stemming from the effects of a 2003 [[severe acute respiratory syndrome|SARS]] epidemic. The concert holds the record for the largest paid [[Concert|music event]] in North American history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | date = 31 July 2003 | url = http://www.cbc.ca/news/story/2003/07/30/concert_opener030730.html | title = Stones rock out at Toronto's 'biggest party' |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation | accessdate =2 August 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080630093945/http://www.cbc.ca/news/story/2003/07/30/concert_opener030730.html| archivedate= 30 June 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band came second in a list of Australia's highest-earning entertainers for 2005,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Daniel | last = Ziffer | title = Wiggles wriggle back into top spot | url = http://www.theage.com.au/news/people/wiggles-wriggle-back-into-top-spot/2006/04/12/1144521401699.html |work=The Age |location=Australia | date = 13 April 2006 | accessdate =2 August 2008 | location=Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sixth for 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.smh.com.au/news/people/a-wobble-but-the-wiggles-still-rule/2007/07/17/1184559786837.html | title = A wobble, but the Wiggles still rule |work=The Sydney Morning Herald | date = 18 July 2007 | first = Emily | last = Dunn | accessdate =17 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite having neither toured since 2003 nor released an album since 2000.

On 18 August 2008, [[Columbia Records]] announced 18 October Australian release, and 20 October worldwide release, of the studio album ''[[Black Ice (album)|Black Ice]]''. The 15-track album was the band's first studio release in eight years, was produced by [[Brendan O'Brien (music producer)|Brendan O'Brien]] and was mixed and engineered by [[Mike Fraser]]. Like ''Stiff Upper Lip'', it was recorded at [[The Warehouse Studio]] in Vancouver, British Columbia. ''Black Ice'' was sold in the US exclusively at [[Wal-Mart]] and [[Sam's Club]] and the band's official website.&lt;ref name=&quot;Black Ice&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.acdc.com/news/news.php?uid=19 |title = AC/DC's 'Black Ice' Set For Release 20&amp;nbsp;October |work=AC/DC.com |accessdate =18 August 2008 |date = 18 August 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080821031940/http://www.acdc.com/news/news.php?uid=19| archivedate= 21 August 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;Rock 'n' Roll Train&quot;, the album's first single, was released to radio on 28 August.

Black Ice made history debuting at No.1 on album charts in 29 countries and also has the distinction of being Columbia Records' biggest debut album (since Nielsen SoundScan began tracking sales data for Billboard in March 1991). Black Ice has been certified Multi Platinum in eight countries, including the US, Australia, Canada, Switzerland, Sweden, Norway, Germany and the Czech Republic. Additionally Black Ice has achieved Platinum status in twelve countries (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, UK, Argentina, Singapore and New Zealand) and Gold status in four countries (The Netherlands, Spain, Poland and Brazil). With over 6.5&amp;nbsp;million copies of Black Ice shipped worldwide, combined with over 5.5&amp;nbsp;million in catalogue sold, AC/DC have surpassed The Beatles as the No.1 selling catalogue artist in the US for 2008. The 18-month [[Black Ice World Tour]] supporting the new album was announced on 11 September and began on 28 October in [[Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania|Wilkes-Barre]], Pennsylvania.&lt;ref name=&quot;Black Ice World Tour&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.acdc.com/news/news.php?uid=24 |title = AC/DC Announce 'Black Ice' World Tour |work=AC/DC.com |accessdate =17 September 2008 |date = 17 September 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080913214645/http://www.acdc.com/news/news.php?uid=24| archivedate= 13 September 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the North American release of ''Black Ice'' on 20 October 2008, Columbia Records and Walmart created &quot;Rock Again AC/DC Stores&quot; to promote the album. In October 2008, MTV, Walmart, and Columbia created &quot;AC/DC Rock Band Stores&quot; in New York City, at [[Times Square]], and in Los Angeles. &quot;Black Ice&quot; trucks were also dispatched on the streets of these two cities after the release, playing AC/DC music aloud and making various stops each day to sell merchandise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.hispanicbusiness.com/news/2008/10/17/acdcs_black_ice_rocks_into_walmart.htm |title = AC/DC's Black Ice Rocks Into Walmart Nationwide October&amp;nbsp;20 |publisher=[[PR Newswire]] |date=11 October 2008 |accessdate =19 November 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081022184111/http://www.hispanicbusiness.com/news/2008/10/17/acdcs_black_ice_rocks_into_walmart.htm| archivedate= 22 October 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late September 2009, the band rescheduled six shows when Brian Johnson underwent an operation for ulcers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acdc.com/news/news.php?uid=107 ACDC.com news.news].&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 September, the band announced a collection of studio and live rarities, ''[[Backtracks (AC/DC album)|Backtracks]]'', which was released on 10 November 2009 as a 3-CD/2-DVD/1-LP box-set.&lt;ref&gt;http://sev.prnewswire.com/music/20090929/NY8281729092009-1.html&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 November AC/DC were announced as the [[Business Review Weekly]] top Australian earner (entertainment) for 2009 with earnings of $105&amp;nbsp;million. This displaced [[The Wiggles]] from the number one spot for the first time in four years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/acdc-tops-brw-entertainment-rich-list-ahead-of-kylie-minogue-and-the-wiggles/story-e6frf7jo-1225794320822 |title = AC/DC tops BRW entertainment rich list, ahead of Kylie Minogue and the Wiggles |work=Herald Sun |location=Australia |date=11 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Future album and tour (2011–Present)====
Angus stated in an interview in early May 2011 that the band was beginning to plan another world tour, saying that &quot;now we're thinking, 'How can we ever better the 'Black Ice' world tour?' But we will&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=157776 | title=AC/DC Planning New World Tour | publisher=Blabbermouth.net | date=6 May 2011 | accessdate=8 May 2011 | archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5yX6hdeGC | archivedate=8 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the band's ''Live at River Plate'' DVD premiere on 6 May 2011 at the Hammersmith Apollo in London, England, Angus said that there were plans for the group to release a new studio album &quot;within the next couple of years&quot;, which the tour would support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=157804 | title=AC/DC To Release New Album 'Within The Next Couple Of Years' | publisher=Blabbermouth.net | date=7 May 2011 | accessdate=8 May 2011 | archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5yX6ljYGO | archivedate=8 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, AC/DC's 40th anniversary will be marked for 2013. Most recently, Brian Johnson was a guest on VH1 Classic's &quot;That Metal Show&quot; saying the band would get back in the studio and release an album in mid-to-late 2012. Even more recently, Johnson called in to &quot;The Cowhead Show&quot; and reported that the next album has been delayed due to a health issue with one of the band members. He stated that an illness suffered by one of his bandmates may have temporarily put plans for a new album on hold. He wouldn’t go into specifics about which member or what the illness is, but he did say it’s not terminal and that the afflicted member is on the path to recovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Joe|first=Robinson|title=AC/DC Singer Reveals Bandmate’s Health Issues Held Up Work on New Album|url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/ac-dc-health-issues-new-album/|work=Ultimate Classic Rock|publisher=Ultimate Classic Rock|accessdate=26 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 March 2000, the municipality of [[Leganés]] (near [[Madrid]]) named a street in honour of the band as &quot;Calle de AC/DC&quot; (&quot;AC/DC Street&quot;). Malcolm and Angus assisted in the inauguration with many fans. Later that day, the plaque with the name of the group was stolen, perhaps by an enthusiast or collector. The plaque was replaced two hours later, and stolen once again a mere three days after the fact. The plaque had since been stolen numerous times, forcing the municipality of Leganés to begin selling replicas of the official street plaque.

In May 2003, Malcolm Young accepted a [[Edward 'Ted' Albert|Ted Albert]] Award for Outstanding Service to Australian Music at the 2003 Music Winners Awards, during which he paid special tribute to Bon Scott.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.apra.com.au/awards/music/media_releases/03-music_award_winners_announced.asp | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080723033156/http://apra.com.au/awards/music/media_releases/03-music_award_winners_announced.asp | archivedate = 23 July 2008 | title = 2003 Music Winners Awards Announced | work=[[Australasian Performing Right Association]] | accessdate =2 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 October 2004, a central Melbourne thoroughfare, Corporation Lane, was renamed [[ACDC Lane, Melbourne|ACDC Lane]] in honour of the band. However, the [[City of Melbourne]] forbade the use of the [[slash (punctuation)|slash]] character in street names, so the four letters were combined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/info.cfm?top=228&amp;pg=715&amp;st=191 | title = Next stage in AC/DC Lane proposal wins in-principle support | accessdate =2 August 2008 | date = 8 July 2004 | work=City of Melbourne }}&lt;/ref&gt; The lane is near [[Swanston Street, Melbourne|Swanston Street]] where, on the back of a truck, the band recorded their video for the 1975 hit &quot;[[It's a Long Way to the Top (If You Wanna Rock 'n' Roll)]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;acdclane&quot; /&gt;

They sold over 1.3&amp;nbsp;million CDs in the US during 2007 despite not having released a new album since 2000 at that point.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/12/arts/music/12levi.html|title= Ageless and Defiant, AC/DC Stays on Top Without Going Digital|work=The New York Times |author=Levine, Robert|date=10 October 2008|accessdate=19 November 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081219213927/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/12/arts/music/12levi.html| archivedate= 19 December 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] upgraded the group's US sales figures from 69&amp;nbsp;million to 71&amp;nbsp;million, making AC/DC the fifth-best-selling band in US history and the ninth-best-selling artist, selling more albums than [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Mariah Carey]] and [[Michael Jackson]].&lt;ref name=&quot;riaa1&quot; /&gt; The RIAA also certified ''Back in Black'' as double Diamond (20&amp;nbsp;million) in US sales, and by 2007 the album had sold 22&amp;nbsp;million copies, which moved it into fifth place.&lt;ref name=&quot;riaa2&quot; /&gt;
