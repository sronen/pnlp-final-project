'''The Orb''' are an English [[electronic music]] group known for spawning the genre of [[ambient house]]. Founded in 1988 by [[Alex Paterson]] and [[The KLF|KLF]] member [[Jimmy Cauty]], The Orb began as [[ambient music|ambient]] and [[dub music|dub]] [[disc jockey|DJs]] in London. Its early performances were inspired by ambient and electronic artists of the 1970s and 1980s, most notably [[Brian Eno]] and [[Kraftwerk]]. Because of its [[Psychedelic experience|trippy]] sound, the Orb developed a cult following among [[nightclub|clubbers]] &quot;coming down&quot; from drug-induced highs.&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian-chills&quot;&gt;{{cite web|work=[[The Guardian]]|last=Hodgkinson |first=Will |date=2003-01-31 |url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/fridayreview/story/0,,885369,00.html |title=Chills and thrills |accessdate=2007-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Orb has maintained its drug-related and science fiction themes despite personnel changes including the departure of Cauty and other Orb members [[Kris Weston]], Andy Falconer, [[Simon Phillips (producer)|Simon Phillips]], and [[Andy Hughes]]. Paterson has been the only permanent member, continuing to work as the Orb with the [[Switzerland|Swiss]]-German producer [[Thomas Fehlmann]] and, later, with [[Killing Joke|Killing Joke's]] [[Martin &quot;Youth&quot; Glover]] and Tim Bran of [[Dreadzone]].&lt;ref name=&quot;amg-dream&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.allmovie.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:39fyxzljldte~T1 |title = The Dream &gt; Review |work = [[Allmusic]] |accessdate = 2008-06-11 |last = Bush |first = John}} {{dead link| date=June 2010 | bot=DASHBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alex Paterson prides the Orb on manipulating obscure samples beyond recognition on its albums and during its concerts; his unauthorised use of other artists' works has led to disputes with musicians, most notably with [[Rickie Lee Jones]]&lt;ref name=&quot;remixmag-orblivion&quot;&gt;{{cite web|work=[[Remix Magazine]] |last=Silva |first=Joe |date=2001-02-01 |title=Living in Orblivion |url=http://remixmag.com/mag/remix_living_orblivion/ |accessdate=2007-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Steve Reich]].{{cn|date=April 2012}} During its live shows of the 1990s, the Orb performed using digital audio tape machines optimised for live mixing and sampling before switching to laptops and digital media. Despite changes in performance method, the Orb maintained its colourful light shows and psychedelic imagery in concert. These visually intensive performances prompted critics to compare the group to [[Pink Floyd]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://homepage.ntlworld.com/david.bennun/musicint/floyd.html Melody Maker, 1993]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Orb's critical and commercial success in the United Kingdom peaked in the early 1990s with the albums ''[[The Orb's Adventures Beyond The Ultraworld]]'' and ''[[U.F.Orb]]'', the latter of which reached #1 on the [[UK Albums Chart|British album charts]] in 1992. This success led to its infamous appearance on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'', where the group showcased its quirky style by playing chess (an interest of Paterson's since his early youth) while the group's single &quot;[[Blue Room (The Orb)|Blue Room]]&quot; ran in the background. The Orb's mid-1990s albums were met with mixed reactions from British critics; however, its work received praise from American publications such as ''[[Rolling Stone]]''. The group experimented with vocalists on its next two albums, which critics generally described as bland and uninspired. The Orb then shifted gears to a [[minimal techno]] style spearheaded by member Thomas Fehlmann, releasing its new material on the record label [[Kompakt]].

== History ==
=== 1988–1990: Paterson &amp; Cauty ===
[[Alex Paterson]] began his music career in the early 1980s as a [[roadie]] for the [[post-punk]] rock band [[Killing Joke]], for whom his childhood friend [[Martin Glover|Martin &quot;Youth&quot; Glover]] played bass.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scotsman&quot;&gt;{{cite news|work=[[The Scotsman]] |last=Smith |first=Aidan |date=2001-02-16 |title=A master of the ballistic |page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; After leaving Killing Joke in 1986, Paterson met future [[The KLF|KLF]] member [[Jimmy Cauty]]&lt;ref name=&quot;century&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Prendergast |first=Mark |title=The Ambient Century: From Mahler to Moby-The Evolution of Sound in the Electronic Age |publisher=[[Bloomsbury Publishing PLC]] |year=2003 |isbn= 1-58234-323-3 |pages = 407–412}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the duo began DJ-ing and producing music together under the name ''The Orb''. Paterson and Cauty's first release was a 1988 [[acid house]] anthem track, &quot;Tripping on Sunshine&quot;, released on the German record compilation ''[[Eternity Project One]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;rough&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Shapiro |first=Peter |title =The Rough Guide to Drum 'n' Bass| authorlink=Peter Shapiro (journalist) |year=1999 |isbn=1-85828-433-3 |publisher= [[Rough Guides]] |pages=327–329}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, The Orb released the ''[[Kiss EP]]'', a four-track [[Extended play|EP]] based on samples from New York City's [[KISS FM]].&lt;ref name=&quot;rough&quot;/&gt; It was released on Paterson and Glover's new record label [[WAU! Mr. Modo Records]], which Paterson and Glover created out of a desire to maintain financial independence from larger record labels.&lt;ref name=&quot;century&quot;/&gt; After spending a weekend of making what Paterson described as &quot;really shit drum sounds&quot;, the duo decided to abandon beat-heavy music and instead work on music for after-hours listening by removing the percussion tracks.&lt;ref name=&quot;keyboard&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Doerschuck |first=Robert |work = [[Keyboard Magazine]] |date=1995-06-01|title=Alex Paterson/The Orb - Inside the Ambient Techno Ultraworld

Resident DJ [[Paul Oakenfold]] brought in the duo specifically as ambient DJs for his &quot;The Land of Oz&quot; event at Heaven.&lt;ref name=&quot;Irish-boyd&quot;&gt;{{cite news|work=[[The Irish Times]] |last=Boyd |first=Brian |date=1998-10-23 |page=12 |title=Unidentified Flying Orb}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though The Orb's Monday night performances had only several hardcore followers initially, its chill-out room act grew popular over the course of its six-month stay to the point that the small room was often packed with around 100&amp;nbsp;people.&lt;ref name=&quot;ocean&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last = Toop|first = David|authorlink = David Toop|title=Ocean of Sound|publisher=Serpent's Tail|pages=59–62|year=2001|isbn = 1-85242-743-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Orb's performances became most popular among weary DJs and clubbers seeking solace from the loud, rhythmic music of the dancefloor.&lt;ref name=&quot;amg-bio&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p5071|pure_url=yes}} |title=The Orb Biography |accessdate=2006-10-09 |last = Bush |first = John |publisher = [[Allmusic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Orb would build up melodies using [[multitrack recording]]s linked to multiple [[record deck]]s and a [[mixing console|mixer]]. The group incorporated many CDs, cassettes, and [[BBC Radiophonic Workshop|BBC sound effects]] into the act, often accompanied with pieces of popular dance tracks such as &quot;[[Sueño Latino]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ocean&quot;/&gt; Though the group used a variety of samples, it avoided heavy rhythm and drums so that the intended ambient atmosphere wasn't disrupted. Most often, the group played [[dub reggae]] and other [[chill out music]], which it described as ambient house for the E generation.&lt;ref name=&quot;rough&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;metropolis&quot;&gt;This phrase was printed on the reverse of the &quot;A Huge Ever-Growing Pulsating Brain...&quot; vinyl single - {{cite web|last = Crispy |first = Don |url= http://metropolis.co.jp/tokyo/590/clubs.asp |title = Alex Paterson: The UK ambient house prodigy sits down with Metropolis |publisher = ''[[Metropolis (Japanese magazine)|Metropolis]]'' |accessdate = 2007-01-14 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070704194423/http://metropolis.co.jp/tokyo/590/clubs.asp |archivedate = July 4, 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout 1989 the Orb, along with Martin Glover, developed a [[music production]] style that incorporated [[ambient music]] with a diverse array of [[sampling (music)|samples]] and recordings. The British music press would later label the music [[ambient house]]. The culmination of the groups musical work came toward the end of the same year when they recorded a session for [[John Peel]] on [[BBC Radio 1]]. The track, then known as &quot;Loving You,&quot; was largely improvisational and featured a wealth of sound effects and samples from [[science fiction]] radio plays, nature sounds, and [[Minnie Riperton]]'s &quot;[[Lovin' You (Minnie Riperton song)|Lovin' You]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;amg-peel&quot;&gt;{{cite web|work=[[Allmusic]] |last=Thompson |first=Dave |accessdate=2006-11-06 |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r14521|pure_url=yes}} |title=The Orb: Peel Sessions - Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; For its release as a single on the record label [[Big Life]], the Orb changed the title to &quot;[[A Huge Ever Growing Pulsating Brain That Rules from the Centre of the Ultraworld]].&quot; Upon the single's release, Riperton's management forced Big Life to remove the unlicensed Riperton sample, ensuring that only the initial first-week release of the single contained the original vocals of Minnie Riperton; subsequent pressings used vocals from a sound-alike.&lt;ref name=&quot;Irish-boyd&quot;/&gt; Despite its running time of 22 minutes, the sample-laden single reached #78 on the [[UK singles chart|British singles charts]]. Soon thereafter, the Orb was commissioned by [[David A. Stewart|Dave Stewart]] to remix his top-20 single &quot;[[Lily Was Here]].&quot; The group obliged and was soon offered several more remix jobs from artists including [[Erasure]] and [[System 7 (band)|System 7]].

In 1990, Paterson and Cauty held several recording sessions at Cauty's studio, [[Trancentral]]. When offered an album deal by Big Life, the Orb found itself at a crossroads: Cauty preferred that the Orb release its music through his [[KLF Communications]] label, whereas Paterson wanted to ensure that the group did not become a side-project of The KLF.&lt;ref name=&quot;times-waves&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Don't make negative waves |last=Toop |first=David |authorlink=David Toop |date=1994-06-03 |work=[[The Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of these issues, Cauty and Paterson split in April 1990, with Paterson keeping the name the Orb.&lt;ref name=&quot;amg-bio&quot;/&gt; As a result of the break-up, Cauty removed Paterson's contributions from the in-progress recordings and released the album as ''[[Space (Jimmy Cauty album)|Space]]'' on KLF Communications.&lt;ref name=&quot;klfcomm&quot;&gt;{{cite press release | title =KLF Communications Info Sheet Nine | publisher = [[KLF Communications]]| year = 1990| url =http://www.libraryofmu.org/display-resource.php?id=509 | accessdate =2006-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also out of these sessions came [[The KLF]] album ''[[Chill Out]]'', on which Paterson appeared in an uncredited role.&lt;ref name=&quot;century&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;generation&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last = Reynolds |first = Simon |year = 1999 |isbn = 0-415-92373-5 |publisher = Routledge |title = Generation Ecstasy: Into the World of Techno and Rave Culture |page=191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the split, Paterson began working with Youth on the track &quot;[[Little Fluffy Clouds]]&quot;. The group incorporated samples from [[Steve Reich]]'s ''[[Electric Counterpoint]]'' and vocal clips from an interview with [[Rickie Lee Jones]] in which she recalls picturesque images from her childhood.&lt;ref name=&quot;slant&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last = Cinquemani |first = Sal |url= http://www.slantmagazine.com/music/music_review.asp?ID=238 |title = Adventures Beyond The Ultraworld Review |publisher = ''[[Slant Magazine]]'' |accessdate = 2006-10-09 |year = 2002 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20051122000926/http://www.slantmagazine.com/music/music_review.asp?ID=238 | archivedate=2005-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Reich was flattered by the Orb's use of his work,&lt;ref name=&quot;reich-bn&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Classical Composer Steve Reich Gets Remixed and Loves It|url=http://music.barnesandnoble.com/features/interview.asp?z=y&amp;NID=113694 |publisher=[[Barnes &amp; Noble]] |author=Martin Johnson |accessdate=2006-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jones pursued the issue in the legal system.&lt;ref name=&quot;amg-bio&quot;/&gt; Big Life chose to [[settlement (law)|settle]] out of court for an undisclosed sum of money for use of her voice on the Orb's recording.&lt;ref name=&quot;amg-bio&quot;/&gt; &quot;Little Fluffy Clouds&quot; reached #87 on the British singles chart; however, due to Glover's other production obligations (and subsequently rejoining Killing Joke), he did not become a permanent member of The Orb.&lt;ref name=&quot;amg-bio&quot;/&gt; According to an interview on ''The South Bank Show'', Reich demanded twenty-five percent of royalties from the use of his &quot;Electric Counterpoint&quot; (performed by guitarist [[Pat Metheny]]) on all sales of &quot;Clouds.&quot;

In 1991, Paterson invited freelance studio engineer Andy Falconer to join the Orb and was closely followed by energetic studio engineer [[Kris Weston|Kris &quot;Thrash&quot; Weston]].&lt;ref name=&quot;melody-93&quot;&gt;{{cite news|date=1993-03-27 |title = Pink Floyd Meets The Orb |last = Bennum |first = David |work = [[Melody Maker]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Steve Hillage]], whom Patterson had met while DJ-ing in London, also joined as a contributing guitarist. Along with producer [[Thomas Fehlmann]], The Orb completed several additional tracks for its first album, ''[[The Orb's Adventures Beyond The Ultraworld]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;amg-bio&quot;/&gt; At least six studios and twenty outside musicians were used during the three weeks of recording.&lt;ref name=&quot;century&quot;/&gt; Falconer's and Weston's technical abilities and Hillages's guitar work allowed the group to craft panoramic sounds portraying aspects of space travel, most notably the launch of ''[[Apollo 11]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;century&quot;/&gt; ''Adventures'' sold well in the United Kingdom and received praise for its balance of ambient music, house music, and sampling.&lt;ref name=&quot;amg-adventures&quot;&gt;{{cite web|publisher = [[Allmusic]] |last = Bush |first = John |title = The Orb's Adventures Beyond the Ultraworld Review |url = {{Allmusic|class=album|id=r14519|pure_url=yes}} |accessdate = 2006-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Retrospectively, ''Adventures'' is considered ground-breaking for changing the way musicians view sampling and as a seminal work for the genres of ambient and dance music.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sunday-adventures&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Crucial Cuts: The Orb's Adventures Beyond the Ultraworld |work=[[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]] |last=Sandall |first=Robert |date=2001-10-21 |page=22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The completion of ''Adventures'' saw the departure of Andy Falconer, whose last contribution was to one of the Orb's Peel Sessions. To promote the release of an edited single-disc version for an American release on [[Mercury Records]], the Orb embarked on their first tour of the United States beginning in [[Phoenix, Arizona]], in October 1991.&lt;ref name=&quot;phoenix&quot;&gt;{{cite news|work=[[Phoenix New Times]] |date=1997-04-30 |title=Eye of the Orb |last=Holthouse |first=David}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 1991 and early 1992, Paterson and Weston wrote their next single, &quot;[[Blue Room (single)|Blue Room]]&quot;. Assisting with the recording was bassist [[Jah Wobble]], keyboardist [[Miquette Giraudy]], and guitarist Hillage.&lt;ref name=&quot;amg-bio&quot;/&gt; Despite its playing time of almost 40 minutes, &quot;Blue Room&quot; entered the British charts at #12 and peaked at #8, making it the longest track to reach the charts.&lt;ref name=&quot;amg-bio&quot;/&gt; The Orb promoted this single with a &quot;legendary avant-garde&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;stylus&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stylusmagazine.com/articles/weekly_article/brian-eno-and-the-ambient-series.htm |title=Brian Eno and the Ambient Series |last=Weiner |first=Matthew |date=2004-09-27 |accessdate=2007-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; performance on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' where Patterson and Weston played a game of [[chess]] in space suits while footage of dolphins and an edited version of &quot;Blue Room&quot; ran in the background.&lt;ref name=&quot;Irish-boyd&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian-breakdown&quot;&gt;{{cite news|work=[[The Guardian]] |last=Sullivan |first=Caroline |date=1993-04-09 |title=The Guardian Features Page: Breakdown}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1992, ''[[U.F.Orb]]'' was released featuring &quot;Blue Room&quot; and, in the US release, The Orb's next single, &quot;[[Assassin (single)|Assassin]]&quot;. Weston integrated his technical and creative expertise with Paterson's [[Brian Eno|Eno]]-influenced ambience on ''U.F.Orb'', combining &quot;drum and bass rhythms&quot; with &quot;velvet keyboards&quot; and &quot;rippling synth lines&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;century&quot;/&gt; ''U.F.Orb'' reached #1 on the British album charts to the shock of critics, who were surprised that fans had embraced what journalists considered to be [[progressive rock]].&lt;ref name=&quot;melody-93&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian-breakdown&quot;/&gt; Despite The Orb's success, Paterson and Weston preferred to avoid personal publicity and instead allow their music to be the focus of attention.&lt;ref name=&quot;independent-pomme&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Gallivan |first=Joseph |date=1994-06-10 |work=[[The Independent]] |title=POP: Pomme Fritz}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this partial anonymity and The Orb's rotating membership, they are often recognised as more of a musical collective than a &quot;band&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;tandt&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last = Tandt |first = Christophe Den |date=2004-05-20 |publisher = [[Routledge]] |url = http://taylorandfrancis.metapress.com/content/uhyu78vgu3kteu73/fulltext.pdf |title = From Craft to Corporate Interfacing: Rock Musicianship in the Age of Music Television and Computer-Programmed Music |journal = Popular Music &amp; Society |issn = 0300-7766 |doi = 10.1080/03007760410001685804 |pages=139–160 |volume = 27 |issue = 2 |accessdate=2007-03-27|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the next year and a half, Paterson and Weston continued to produce new material, but releases stalled when Paterson began to feel that Big Life was trying to dictate the direction of The Orb's music.&lt;ref name=&quot;times-waves&quot;/&gt; This led to intense disagreements with Big Life and The Orb soon left the label to sign a deal with [[Island Records]].&lt;ref name=&quot;citypaper&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Q and A: Alex Paterson |last=O'Neal |first=Sean |date=2001-04-19 |url=http://www.citypaper.net/articles/041901/music.qa.shtml |work=Philadelphia City Paper |archivedate=2005-12-08 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20051208004742/http://citypaper.net/articles/041901/music.qa.shtml |accessdate=2007-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their first release on Island Records was the live album ''[[Live 93]]'', which gathered highlights from The Orb's recent performances in Europe and Asia.

Paterson claimed that Weston's departure was due to Weston's desire to have more control in The Orb.&lt;ref name=&quot;keyboard&quot;/&gt; However, in an interview with ''[[i-D]]'', Weston attributed the split to Paterson, saying that Paterson &quot;didn't do his 50 per cent of the work.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian-simpson&quot;/&gt; Paterson reaffirmed the status of The Orb saying, &quot;The Orb is The Orb, and nothing can change that&quot; and continued work with Hughes and Fehlmann.&lt;ref name=&quot;independent-earth&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Prendergast |first=Mark |work=[[The Independent]] |date=1995-03-17 |page=34 |title=Earth Calling Orb, Come In}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1995–2001: Paterson, Fehlmann &amp; Hughes ===
Following Weston's departure from The Orb, Thomas Fehlmann joined as a full-time studio member, though he would not always participate in live performances. Paterson, Hughes, and Fehlmann then finished producing the album ''[[Orbus Terrarum]]'', on which Paterson and Weston had been working. ''Orbus Terrarum'', released in 1995, featured more &quot;earthbound&quot; and &quot;organic&quot; sounds than their previous trippy science fiction themed music.&lt;ref name=&quot;keyboard&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;independent-terra&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Gill |first=Andy |title=Oh, the Pity and Terra of It All |work=[[The Independent]] |date=1995-03-31 |page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Orbus Terrarum'' suffered, as Paterson described it, &quot;a good kicking&quot; at the hands of the British press,&lt;ref name=&quot;future-98&quot;&gt;{{cite news|work=Future Music N|title=Alex Paterson: Interview |date=1998-10-01 |issue=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; who described it as &quot;generic&quot; and a low point for Paterson's creativity.&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian-simpson&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;times-orbus&quot;&gt;{{cite news|work=[[The Times]] |last=Sinclair |first=David |title=Pop on Friday|date=1995-03-24 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Orbus Terrarum'' alienated many of the group's fans,&lt;ref name=&quot;rs-orblivion&quot;&gt;{{cite web|work=[[Rolling Stone]] |last=Wiederhorn |first=Jon |title=The Orb: Orblivion |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/theorb/albums/album/145147/review/5940398/orblivion |date=1997-03-19 |accessdate=2007-03-20|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070930220941/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/theorb/albums/album/145147/review/5940398/orblivion |archivedate = September 30, 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; causing the album to only reach #20 on the British charts.&lt;ref name=&quot;everyhit&quot;&gt;{{cite web|work=Everyhit.com |title=Orbus Terrarum|url=http://www.everyhit.com |accessdate=2006-10-24}} (search for Orb albums)&lt;/ref&gt; American critics, however, gave it great acclaim including ''Rolling Stone'' who made it their album of the month, citing the album's symphonic flow coupled with The Orb's &quot;uniquely British wit&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;century&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;rs-orbus&quot;&gt;{{cite web|work=[[Rolling Stone]] |last=Wiederhorn |first=Jon |date=1998-02-02 |title=The Orb: Orbus Terrarum |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/theorb/albums/album/98991/review/5945472/orbus_terrarum |accessdate=2007-03-20|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071001200030/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/theorb/albums/album/98991/review/5945472/orbus_terrarum |archivedate = October 1, 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;amg-orbus&quot;&gt;{{cite web|work = [[Allmusic]] |first = John |last = Bush |url = {{Allmusic|class=album|id=r210890|pure_url=yes}} |title = Orbus Terrarum: The Orb}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a long world tour, The Orb, with Andy Hughes and Steve Hillage, settled down to produce their next album, ''[[Orblivion]]''—the process of which saw a return to their spacy sounds. Though ''Orblivion'' was recorded in May 1996, it was not released until almost a year later, due to Island Records' desire to promote it as a follow up to [[U2]]'s techno-rock album ''[[Pop (U2 album)|Pop]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;shih&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Orb:Interview |last=Shih |first=Howard |work=Perfect Sound Forever |url=http://www.furious.com/Perfect/orb.html|accessdate=2006-10-11 |archivedate=2004-07-01 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20040701192125/http://www.furious.com/Perfect/orb.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Orblivion'' sold well in Europe as well as the United States, where it reached the [[Billboard Top 200]]. The first ''Orblivion'' single, &quot;[[Toxygene]]&quot;, was the highest charting single by The Orb, reaching #4 in the United Kingdom on 8 February 1997.

Paterson and Fehlmann, along with usual collaborators Hughes, Burton, and Phillips, wrote and produced ''[[Cydonia (album)|Cydonia]]'' for a planned 1999 release.&lt;ref name=&quot;amg-bio&quot;/&gt; Featured on the album were appearances from Robert Fripp, [[John Roome]] (Witchman), and Fil Le Gonidec, one of The Orb's live performers. Singers Nina Walsh and Aki Omori appeared on two tracks each, providing vocals and co-writing lyrics with Paterson. Paterson felt that this new direction of songwriting for The Orb was more similar to the experimental work of ''Orbus Terrarum'' than to the techno-pop of ''Orblivion''.&lt;ref name=&quot;vh1-cydoniareview&quot;&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[VH1]] |date=2001-02-27 |last=Demby |first=Eric |url=http://www.vh1.com/artists/news/1440987/02262001/orb.jhtml |title=Orb Back From Orblivion With New LP, Cydonia |archivedate=2004-11-29 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20041129193833/http://www.vh1.com/artists/news/1440987/02262001/orb.jhtml |accessdate=2007-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Island Records was in a period of restructuring due to its recent purchase by [[Universal Music Group]], ''Cydonia'' was not released until 2001.&lt;ref name=&quot;citypaper&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;amg-cydonia&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last = Bush |first= John |url= {{Allmusic|class=album|id=r518403|pure_url=yes}} |title=Cydonia Review |accessdate=2006-10-10 |publisher=[[Allmusic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon release, critics noted that ''Cydonia'' merged together pop, trance, and ambient-dub music, which they felt to be a conglomeration of bland vocals and uninventive ambience that lacked the appeal of The Orb's earlier work.&lt;ref name=&quot;amg-cydonia&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;sherald&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=A dance pioneer who's just going round in circles |last=Walker |first=Richard |page=10 |date=2001-03-04 |work=[[Sunday Herald]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;birmingham-cydonia&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Cowen |first=Andrew |title=What goes around comes around |date=2001-03-19 |page=13 |work=[[Birmingham Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[NME]]'' harshly described it as &quot;a stillborn relic, flawed throughout by chronically stunted ambitions&quot; and describing its only appropriate audience to be &quot;old ravers&quot; seeking nostalgia.&lt;ref name=&quot;nme-cydonia&quot;&gt;{{cite web|work=[[New Musical Express]] |last=Pattison |first=Louis |year=2001 |accessdate=2006-10-13 |title=Orb : Cydonia |url=http://www.nme.com/reviews/3953.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not only did the album receive poor reviews, but The Orb was generally regarded by the British press as past their prime and an &quot;ambient dinosaur&quot; out of place in the current dance music environment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scotsman&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;sherald&quot;/&gt; After the release of ''Cydonia'', Hughes left the group for undisclosed reasons, becoming &quot;another acrimonious departure from The Orb&quot; according to ''The Guardian''.&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian-simpson&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Badorb.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Paterson's record label [[Badorb.com]] had only fourteen releases in its brief existence.]]
In 2001, Alex Paterson formed the record label [[Badorb.com]] as an outlet for Orb members' side projects. To promote both Badorb.com and ''Cydonia'', The Orb toured internationally, including their first visit to the United States in four years.&lt;ref name=&quot;vh1-tour&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=The Orb Rolling Through U.S. On Tour |first=Eric |last=Demby |publisher=[[VH1]] |date=2001-03-06 |url=http://www.vh1.com/artists/news/1441340/03062001/orb.jhtml |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20050123102639/http://www.vh1.com/artists/news/1441340/03062001/orb.jhtml |archivedate=2005-01-23 |accessdate=2007-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''NME'' described The Orb's tour as &quot;charming&quot; and that The Orb was &quot;freed from the [[Pink Floyd|Floydian]] pretensions that dogged the band throughout the mid-'90s.&lt;ref name=&quot;nme-concert&quot;&gt;{{cite web|work=[[New Musical Express]]|last=Hall |first=John |title=The Orb: Brighton Concorde II |url=http://www.nme.com/reviews/orb/4544 |accessdate=2006-10-13 |year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Orb, now composed of Paterson, Phillips and Fehlmann, with guest John Roome, accepted an invitation to join the [[Area:One]] concert tour with [[Moby]], [[Paul Oakenfold]], [[New Order]] and other alternative and electronic artists.&lt;ref name=&quot;mtv-area&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1443083/04232001/moby.jhtml#/news/articles/1443083/04232001/moby.jhtml |title=Area:One Festival's Details Come Into Focus |date=2001-04-23 |last=Reimer |first=Courtney |publisher=MTV |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20040606125600/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1443083/04232001/moby.jhtml |archivedate = 2004-06-06 |accessdate=2007-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though The Orb was paired with more mainstream artists during the tour such as [[Incubus (band)|Incubus]], Paterson and Fehlmann chose to make their next releases a series of several low-key EPs for German label [[Kompakt]] in 2002.

Badorb.com had released fourteen records over the course of fourteen months from artists including [[Guy Pratt]] (Conduit), [[Ayumi Hamasaki]], and [[Takayuki Shiraishi]], as well as The Orb's three-track ''[[Daleth of Elphame EP]]''. Though Badorb.com was an internet-based record label, they only sold vinyl releases (with one exception, the aforementioned Orb EP), which Paterson later remarked was a poor idea because &quot;not many people... have record players&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian-interview&quot;&gt;{{cite web|work=[[The Guardian]] |last = Peel |first=Ian |date=2004-05-06 |url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/features/story/0,,1210131,00.html |title=Talk time: Alex Paterson |accessdate=2007-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Autumn of 2008 a double-cd compilation of [[BBC Radio 1]] [[List of Peel sessions|sessions]] called ''The Orb: Complete BBC Sessions 1989-2001'' was released.

March 2010 saw Internet station [[Dandelion Radio]] broadcast a seventeen and a half minute long Orb session track by Patterson and Fehlmann on the Andrew Morrison show. This new track was titled 'Battersea Bunches' and was a remixed version of the soundtrack to a short movie, also entitled 'Battersea Bunches' by Mike Coles and Alex Patterson - a film installation to be seen at London’s Battersea Power Station on 1 June 2010 as part of an evening of art and music. The film and its soundtrack (together with remixes) were later released as the CD/DVD album ''[[C Batter C]]'' on 11 November 2011.

In the summer of 2010 [[Alex Paterson]] teamed up with Youth aka [[Martin Glover]] to compile a retrospective compilation album of tracks from the [[WAU]]{{dn|date=February 2012}}! Mr Modo label. The album titled ''Impossible Oddities'' is set to be released on CD and double Vinyl on 25 October 2010 via Year Zero records.

The Orb's members have drawn from an assortment of influences in their music.&lt;ref name=&quot;ps-aubrey&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Auntie Aubrey's Excursions Beyond the Call of Duty Part 2 Review |last=Hart |first=Vince |date=2002-04-01 |url=http://www.progressive-sounds.com/Music-Reviews/orb-aunt-aubries-excursions.asp |accessdate=2007-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Orb's central figure, Alex Paterson, had early musical tastes and influences which included [[King Tubby]], [[Alice Cooper]], [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], [[Kraftwerk]], and [[T.Rex (band)|T.Rex]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ra-interview&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Dr Alex Paterson - music as medicine| url=http://www.residentadvisor.net/feature_view.asp?id=444 |last = Jarvis |first=Matt |coauthors=Helen Hayden |publisher=[[Resident Advisor]] |date=2004-03-30 |archivedate=2005-03-01 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20050301035432/http://www.residentadvisor.net/feature_view.asp?id=444 |accessdate=2007-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among these, Paterson cites Kraftwerk as one of the most important, claiming they created the foundation from which all modern dance music has been built.&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian-chills&quot;/&gt; While in [[Brixton]] with Martin Glover as a teenager, Paterson was also exposed to a large amount of reggae music, such as [[The Mighty Diamonds]], [[The Abyssinians]], and [[Bob Marley]].&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian-chills&quot;/&gt; The reggae influence on Paterson and The Orb can readily be heard in tracks such as the single &quot;Perpetual Dawn&quot; and ''U.F.Orb'''s &quot;Towers of Dub&quot;. The earliest ambient influences of The Orb came in 1979 during Paterson's roadie days with Killing Joke. While with the band in [[Neuss]], Paterson listened to Brian Eno's ''[[Music for Films]]'' while on [[LSD]] and watched &quot;the [[Ruhr Area|Ruhr]] steel works explode in the distance&quot;, noting that &quot;[t]he scene seemed to be taking place in the music as well&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;century&quot;/&gt; That same night, Paterson was also inspired while listening to [[Cluster (band)|Cluster]]'s ''[[Grosses Wasser]]'' and found that the steel works' &quot;huge metal arms were crushing molten rocks in time to the music&quot;, which was something he'd &quot;never seen, or heard, anything like it before&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian-chills&quot;/&gt; Along with Cluster and Kraftwerk, Paterson was also influenced by other German experimental music from [[Can (band)|Can]] and composer [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]].&lt;ref name=&quot;keyboard&quot;/&gt; ''[[Modulations]]'' calls Paterson's music a &quot;maximal&quot; version of Brian Eno's &quot;minimal&quot; ambience,&lt;ref name=&quot;modulations&quot;&gt;{{cite book|editor=[[Peter Shapiro (journalist)|Shapiro, Peter]] (ed.) |title=[[Modulations|Modulations - A History of Electronic Music: Throbbing Words on Sound]] |publisher=Caipirinha Productions |year=2000 |isbn= 1-891024-06-X |pages = 160–162}}&lt;/ref&gt; though according to Paterson, Eno resents Paterson's use of his music as an influence.&lt;ref name=&quot;metropolis&quot; /&gt;

The Orb has often been described as &quot;The Pink Floyd of the Nineties&quot;,&lt;ref name=guardian-spencer&gt;{{cite news|work=[[The Guardian]] |date=1994-06-05 |last=Spencer |first=Neil |title=Neil Spencer meets their inspirational founder, Alex Paterson}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, Paterson has stated that The Orb's music is more influenced by experimental electronic music more so than progressive rock of the 1970s.&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian-chills&quot;/&gt; He has noted though that the Pink Floyd album ''[[Meddle (album)|Meddle]]'' was influential to him as a child in the 1970s.&lt;ref name=&quot;melody-93&quot;/&gt; The psychedelic prog-rock similarities have led critics to describe The Orb as [[hippie]] revivalists;&lt;ref name=&quot;birmingham-adventures&quot;&gt;{{cite news|work=[[Birmingham Post]] |last=Cowen |first=Andrew |date=2001-02-10 |title=CD Reviews: Adventures Beyond the Ultraworld |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, Paterson has strongly rejected the tag, claiming that even as a youth, he was &quot;one of those punks who hated hippies&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;times-hippie&quot;&gt;{{cite news|work=[[The Times]] |last=Sandall |first=Robert |date=1992-07-12 |title=Hippie dippie draw: Orb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During production of ''Cydonia'' and ''Bicycles &amp; Tricycles'', Paterson's biggest influences were [[drum and bass]] and [[trip hop]] music, as seen on the tracks &quot;Ghostdancing&quot;, &quot;Thursday's Keeper&quot;, and &quot;Aftermath&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;birmingham-guru&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Ambient gurus refuse to lie down |work=[[Birmingham Post]] |date=1998-10-21 |page=15 |last=Cowen |first=Andrew}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Orb's more recent influences consist largely of German techno producers, such as [[Triola (producer)|Triola]], who themselves were inspired by The Orb's earlier work.&lt;ref name=&quot;amg-okie&quot;/&gt; Paterson cites the music of Kompakt as one of his primary modern influences and claims it to be among the best modern ambient music.&lt;ref name=&quot;independent-top10&quot;&gt;{{cite news|work=[[The Independent]] |last=Paterson |first=Alex |page=16 |date=2004-05-07 |title=The Ten Best Ambient Works}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Drug use ===
As chill out DJs in the late 1980s, the Orb often played to the needs of the chemical generation ([[rave]]rs of the 1980s and 1990s), making music to come down from drugs to.&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian-chills&quot;/&gt; Paterson described the Orb's original intent as &quot;basically about taking lots of drugs and going clubbing.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;keyboard&quot;/&gt; Similarly, one of the Orb's early taglines was &quot;Ambient house for the [[ecstasy (drug)|E generation]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;rough&quot;/&gt; Often during interviews, Alex Paterson smoked [[joint (cannabis)|joints]],&lt;ref name=&quot;ocean&quot;/&gt; including a 2003 interview with ''The Guardian'', during which interviewer Will Hodgkinson noted the assorted &quot;[[hashish|hash]]-smoking paraphernalia&quot; around Paterson's [[Battersea]] apartment.&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian-chills&quot;/&gt; Drug references often turn up in tracks, such as &quot;72,&quot; from ''Orblivion'', which features a clip from the musical ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]'' proclaiming, &quot;The youth of America on [[LSD]]!&quot;  Another notable case is on &quot;Little Fluffy Clouds,&quot; which features the odd nasal tonality of [[Rickie Lee Jones]]' influenced voice, though Jones said it was the result of a heavy cold.&lt;ref name=&quot;cdtimes&quot;&gt;{{cite web|work=CD Times |url=http://www.cdtimes.co.uk/content.php?contentid=81 |title=The Orb - Adventures Beyond the Ultraworld |date=2003-10-15 |last=McCusker |first=Eamonn |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060315153349/http://www.cdtimes.co.uk/content.php?contentid=81 |archivedate=2006-03-15 |accessdate=2007-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Imagery ===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:OrbColors.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The Orb's performances are noted for the use of psychedelic and science fiction images.]] --&gt;
Imagery has always been an important part of The Orb's persona.&lt;ref name=&quot;toop-live&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Live and on the record |work=[[The Times]] |date=1992-10-28 |last=Toop |first=David |authorlink = David Toop}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is most prominent during live performances, where The Orb often projects surreal images against onstage screens. Common images include morphing faces, futuristic cityscapes, and ubiquitous alien references.&lt;ref name=&quot;rollingstone-live97&quot;&gt;{{cite news|work=[[Rolling Stone]] |title=Review of the Hammerstein Ballroom, NY live show |date=1997-05-09 |url = http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/theorb/articles/story/5925017/the_orb}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have long associated their act with absurd symbology with images such as floating pigs.&lt;ref name=&quot;birmingham-guru&quot;/&gt; This has carried over to their music videos, most of which are spacy, brightly coloured montages of surreal images including astronauts, clouds, and neon dolphins. Because of their use of psychedelic images at shows, The Orb's shows are frequently compared to those of Pink Floyd, who also used in-show imagery and films.&lt;ref name=&quot;rollingstone-live97&quot;/&gt; Paterson cites [[Godfrey Reggio]]'s and [[Philip Glass]]'s film [[Koyaanisqatsi]] as a primary influence to their concert imagery.&lt;ref name=&quot;option-97&quot;/&gt;

The Orb is also been noted for their original album art, which features much of the same imagery as their live act. Noted graphic design group [[The Designers Republic]] created the cover art for The Orb's earlier work, including ''Adventures Beyond the Ultraworld'', ''U.F.Orb'', and the singles from those two albums.&lt;ref name=&quot;backside&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Orb:Albums|url=http://www.backsideoftheorb.com/index.php?view=albums|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060529002106/http://www.backsideoftheorb.com/index.php?view=albums |archivedate=2006-05-29 |accessdate=2007-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; For their next album, The Orb poked fun at their Pink Floyd comparisons with the cover of ''Live 93'' featuring a floating stuffed sheep over the [[Battersea Power Station]], which had appeared on the cover of Pink Floyd's ''[[Animals (Pink Floyd album)|Animals]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;JAM&quot;&gt;{{cite news|work=JAM (Florida Music Magazine) |date=1995-04-26 |title=Alex Paterson Interview}}&lt;/ref&gt; The artwork found in Badorb.com releases was similar to The Orb's odd artwork of the mid-1990s, as it was stylistically similar and contained little writing.&lt;ref name=&quot;citypaper&quot;/&gt; Paterson has also dabbled in the creation of cover art himself, designing the cover of ''Okie Dokie It's The Orb on Kompakt''.&lt;ref name=&quot;discogs-okie&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Okie Dokie It's The Orb on Kompakt |url=http://www.discogs.com/release/547681 |publisher=[[Discogs]] |accessdate=2006-11-08 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060503112148/http://www.discogs.com/release/547681 |archivedate=2006-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Science fiction and space ===
Some of the more prominent motifs in The Orb's work are outer space and science fiction, including alien visitations, [[space flight]], and [[mind control]]. These have included The Orb's use of samples from serious sources such as [[NASA]] transmissions to comedic clips from films like [[Woody Allen]]'s ''[[Sleeper (film)|Sleeper]]''. ''U.F.Orb'' especially expressed a fascination with alien life with its bizarre sound samples and in the album's title itself.&lt;ref name=&quot;phoenix&quot;/&gt; The title of its most popular single, &quot;Blue Room&quot;, is itself a reference to the supposed Blue Room of [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base]], which was heavily investigated as a possible UFO evidence holding room.&lt;ref name=&quot;times-hippie&quot;/&gt; Their 2001 album, too, is named for a space-related subject, specifically the [[Cydonia Mensae]] region of Mars.&lt;ref name=&quot;remixmag-orblivion&quot;/&gt; Due to Paterson's focus on science fiction and astronomical phenomena, ''The Guardian'' described Paterson as &quot;pop [music]'s primary spokesperson on aliens&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian-simpson&quot;/&gt;

== Techniques, technology, live performances ==
[[File:OrbDisney.jpg|thumb|250px|left|[[Alex Paterson|Paterson]] and [[Thomas Fehlmann|Fehlmann]] at a 2006 performance at the [[Walt Disney Concert Hall]].]]
''[[The Orb's Adventures Beyond the Ultraworld]]'' was mainly recorded on a Mitsubishi 48 Track digital machine running in sync with an Otari 24 Track analogue machine. The majority of the parts regardless of bass, drum loops etc. were recorded to tape for the entire time available (15 minutes as limited by the Otari analogue machine) without a break. As well as parts committed to tape there would invariably be other elements running &quot;live&quot; from Akai Samplers, triggered from an Atari 1040 computer synced to tape. Once all parts were assembled a mix would be built up by Falconer. Having completed this multiple mixes would be run off to DAT. It was also normal at this stage for Paterson to free form extra material and effects from either CD, Vinyl or DAT as a live source being combined with the final mixes. After Falconer had completed an initial &quot;safe&quot; mix, Weston would then take over the mixing desk and produce multiple mixes and would in turn be followed by Paterson. Once multiple mixes produced, a final mix would be edited together by Falconer from the source DATs. This was done by transferring the required elements to a 1/4&quot; analogue tape machine and editing them together with a razor blade to produce the final version.{{citation needed|date=July 2010}}

In The Orb's early DJ events in the 1980s, Paterson and Cauty performed with three record decks, a cassette player, and a CD player all of which were mixed through an [[Akai]] 12-track [[mixing console|mixer]].&lt;ref name=&quot;shih&quot;/&gt; They used their equipment to harmonise recorded music and sound effect samples into an &quot;endless sound continuum&quot; for audiences of worn out dancers.&lt;ref name=&quot;century&quot;/&gt; Even after The Orb began producing original material, they kept the same sample-heavy model for live acts by spontaneously integrating obscure samples into their pre-recorded tracks. During promotional tours for ''Adventures Beyond the Ultraworld'' and ''U.F.Orb'', The Orb performed using a [[digital audio tape]] machine and experimented with other media sources such as [[dubplate]]s. The tape machines held individual chords, rhythms, and basslines for each composition, allowing The Orb to reprocess them and mimic the act of DJ-ing.&lt;ref name=&quot;tandt&quot;/&gt; Members could then easily improvise with these samples and manipulate them using sound effect [[amp rack|racks]].&lt;ref name=&quot;keyboard&quot;/&gt; Often, The Orb had a live musician accompanying them, such as Steve Hillage on guitar. Their shows in the early 1990s would often be three hours of semi-improvised, continuous music featuring a wealth of triggered samples, voices, and pre-recorded tracks which were barely identifiable as the original piece.&lt;ref name=&quot;times-anything&quot;&gt;{{cite news|work=[[The Times]] |last=Gray |first=Louise |date=1993-11-18 |title=Where anything goes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;times-anything&quot;/&gt;

The Orb began performing regularly at the [[Brixton Academy]] in the early 1990s, where they used the high ceilings and large space for their &quot;well-suited amorphous sound&quot;, frequently performing their newest and more experimental pieces there.&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian-performance97&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Cartwright |first=Garth |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=1997-04-02 |title=Pop the Orb: Brixton Academy Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andy Hughes took Weston's place at live performances after the 1993 tour, though Weston did reappear for The Orb's concert at the rainy [[Woodstock '94]].&lt;ref name=&quot;amg-bio&quot;/&gt; The Orb played for late night raves on the first two nights of Woodstock '94 in addition to artists including [[Aphex Twin]], [[Orbital (band)|Orbital]], and [[Deee-Lite]]. The next year, The Orb's touring group consisted of Paterson, Hughes, Nick Burton on percussion, and Simon Phillips on bass. This ensemble of live performers and electronic music created a &quot;cacophony&quot; of &quot;gigantic, swarming sounds&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;times-something&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Gray |first=Louise |work=[[The Times]] |page=1 |date=1995-04-11 |title=Something in the Air: The Orb}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though The Orb's performances use much onstage equipment and many props, Paterson prefers to present The Orb as &quot;a non-centralised figure of amusement on stage&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;independent-earth&quot;/&gt;

The Orb used [[ADAT]] recorders for performances from 1993 to 2001 and utilised large 48-track decks, which Paterson described as basically being a &quot;studio onstage&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;remix&quot;&gt;{{cite web|work=[[Remix Magazine]] |last=Micallef |first=Ken |date=2004-09-01 |title=The Orb |url=http://remixmag.com/mag/remix_orb/ |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20050913095705/remixmag.com/mag/remix_orb/ |archivedate=2005-12-26 |accessdate=2007-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; They hooked synthesisers, such as the [[ARP 2600]], to [[MIDI]] interfaces to recreate specific sounds that appeared on their albums.&lt;ref name=&quot;keyboard&quot;/&gt; The Orb's methods of studio music creation changed as well. For more recent albums such as ''Cydonia'', The Orb used inexpensive equipment such as [[Korg]]'s [[Electribe]] products, which Paterson described as employing more of a &quot;bedroom techno&quot; approach.&lt;ref name=&quot;remixmag-orblivion&quot;/&gt; Despite their use of laptops during performances and in-studio computers, Paterson says that he still cherishes vinyl and does not find purchasing CDs or downloading music to be nearly as satisfying.&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian-interview&quot;/&gt;

=== Sampling and remixing ===
One of The Orb's most notable contributions to electronic music is their idea of blurring the distinction between sampling and remixing.&lt;ref name=&quot;tandt&quot;/&gt; Albums such as ''Pomme Fritz'', though released as a piece of original work, consist largely of manipulated samples. Conversely, The Orb's remixes typically use only small sections of the original track, most notably in the case of their single &quot;Toxygene&quot;. &quot;Toxygene&quot; was originally commissioned as a remix of [[Jean Michel Jarre]]'s &quot;Oxygene 8&quot; from ''[[Oxygene 7-13]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;spheres&quot;&gt;{{cite news|work=[[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]] |title=Music of the Spheres: Orb |last=Smith |first=Andrew |date=1997-02-16 |page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, The Orb &quot;obliterated it&quot; and reassembled only a few fragments for their remix, much to the chagrin of Jarre, who reportedly refused to release it;&lt;ref name=&quot;spheres&quot;/&gt; The Orb released the track themselves under the name &quot;Toxygene&quot;, which further irritated Jarre, to whom Paterson retorted &quot;The French are always five years behind us, anyway.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;spheres&quot;/&gt; In statements made after the release of &quot;Toxygene&quot;, however, Jarre denied that he rejected the original remix because of disliking it.&lt;ref name=&quot;dotmusic&quot;&gt;{{cite web|date=1997-01-27 |last=Aston |first=Martin |title=Dotmusic Talent: Jean Michel Jarre |url=http://www.dotmusic.co.uk/MWtalentjjarre.html  |work=Dotmusic (retrieved from the [[Internet Archive]]) |accessdate=2007-04-30 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/19980708105644/http://www.dotmusic.co.uk/MWtalentjjarre.html |archivedate = 1998-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other artists have become agitated due to The Orb sampling their work, though Paterson jokingly suggests that &quot;[t]hey don't know the half of it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;citypaper&quot;/&gt; Paterson says that he finds a &quot;beauty&quot; and a &quot;cleverness&quot; with slipping unlicensed samples into compositions without anyone recognizing it.&lt;ref name=&quot;keyboard&quot;/&gt; Even though fans often try to guess the origins of many of The Orb's samples, Paterson states that they are rarely correct and that they would &quot;die&quot; if they discovered, for example, where the drums on &quot;Little Fluffy Clouds&quot; originated from.&lt;ref name=&quot;remixmag-orblivion&quot;/&gt; He has said that record labels have cautioned him, &quot;Don't tell anyone where you got your samples until we get them cleared!&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;remixmag-orblivion&quot;/&gt;

The Orb has used a wide variety of audio clips from sources ranging from [[McCarthy era]] speeches to prank phone calls by [[Victor Lewis-Smith]] to [[David Thewlis]]' apocalypse-driven rant from the film ''[[Naked (film)|Naked]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;rollingstone-live97&quot;/&gt; Paterson obtains many samples from recording TV and radio for hours at a time and picking out his favorite clips.&lt;ref name=&quot;keyboard&quot;/&gt; He and other members of The Orb record nature sounds for use on albums, most notably on ''FFWD'' and ''Orbus Terrarum''. The Orb's combination of ambient music and sampling from lower fidelity audio sources often creates a &quot;fuzzy texture&quot; in the sound quality, depersonalising The Orb's music.&lt;ref name=&quot;tandt&quot;/&gt; The Orb is lauded for their &quot;Monty Python-esque levity&quot; in their use of audio samples,&lt;ref name=&quot;rs-orblivion&quot;/&gt; though ''NME'' asserts that Paterson &quot;sabotage[s] his majestic soundscapes&quot; with &quot;irritatingly zany&quot; sounds.&lt;ref name=&quot;nme-aubrey&quot;&gt;{{cite web|year=2002 |last=Thomas |first=Olly |title=Orb : Auntie Aubrey's Excursions Beyond The Call Of Duty Part 2 |url=http://www.nme.com/reviews/orb/6159 |work=[[New Musical Express]] |accessdate=2007-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Orb has been a prolific remixing team, having completed over 80 commissioned remixes since 1989.&lt;ref name=&quot;backside&quot;/&gt; Even during periods of label conflict and contractual limbo, The Orb found steady work remixing for artists including [[Depeche Mode]], [[Lisa Stansfield]], and [[Front 242]]. Though The Orb's remixes from the early and mid-1990s feature a large number of comical samples, ''[[Progressive-Sounds]]'' describe them as &quot;ahead of their time&quot; and ''NME'' notes them as &quot;not entirely incompatible with contemporary chilling.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ps-aubrey&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nme-aubrey&quot;/&gt; However, some pieces, such as their [[Bee Gees]] cover collaboration with [[Robbie Williams]], received criticism for being &quot;beyond a joke&quot; for their use of strange noises.&lt;ref name=&quot;nme-aubrey&quot;/&gt; The Orb's remix of [[Nine Inch Nails]]' &quot;[[The Perfect Drug]]&quot;, too, was described as &quot;silly&quot;, as they made it sound like [[Trent Reznor]] was &quot;drowning in his bathtub&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;amazon-nin&quot;&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Amazon.com]] |accessdate=2006-10-23 |last=Bateman |first=Jeff |title=The Perfect Drug Editorial Review |url=http://www.amazon.com/Perfect-Drug-Nine-Inch-Nails/dp/B000001Y7W}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though Paterson maintains that much of The Orb's remix work is done to support other artists, he admits some of their remixes for major artists were performed so that The Orb could &quot;pay the bills&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;birmingham-guru&quot;/&gt;
