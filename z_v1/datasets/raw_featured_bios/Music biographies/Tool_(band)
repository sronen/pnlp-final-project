'''Tool''' is an American [[rock music|rock]] band from Los Angeles, California. Formed in 1990, the group's line-up has included drummer [[Danny Carey]], guitarist [[Adam Jones (musician)|Adam Jones]], and vocalist [[Maynard James Keenan]]. Since 1995, [[Justin Chancellor]] has been the band's bassist, replacing their original bassist [[Paul D'Amour]]. Tool has won three [[Grammy Awards]], performed worldwide tours, and produced albums topping the charts in several countries.

Tool emerged with a [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] sound on their first studio album &lt;!--Undertow was Tool's first full-length album; Opiate was only an EP, and does not need mention here--&gt;''[[Undertow (Tool album)|Undertow]]'' in 1993, and later became a dominant act in the [[alternative metal]] movement with the release of their second effort, ''[[Ænima]]'', in 1996. Their efforts to unify musical experimentation, [[visual arts]], and a message of personal evolution continued with ''[[Lateralus]]'' (2001) and the most recent album ''[[10,000 Days]]'' (2006), gaining the band critical acclaim and success around the world.

Due to Tool's incorporation of visual arts and relatively long and complex releases, the band is generally described as a style-transcending act and part of [[progressive rock]] and [[art rock]]. The relationship between the band and today's [[music industry]] is ambivalent, at times marked by [[Censorship of music|censorship]] and the band members' insistence on [[privacy]].

Keenan and Jones met through a mutual friend in 1989.&lt;ref name=&quot;guitarworldnumetal&quot;&gt;Kitts, pp. 1965–1969.&lt;/ref&gt; After Keenan played a tape recording for Jones of his previous band project, Jones was so impressed by his voice that he eventually talked his friend into forming their own band.&lt;ref name=&quot;guitarworldnumetal&quot;/&gt; They started [[jam session|jamming]] together and were on the lookout for a drummer and a bass player. Danny Carey happened to live above Keenan and was introduced to Jones by [[Tom Morello]], an old high school friend of Jones and former bandmate of [[Electric Sheep (band)|Electric Sheep]].&lt;ref name=&quot;metalmasters&quot;&gt;Newquist, pp. 11–15.&lt;/ref&gt; Carey began playing in their sessions because he &quot;felt kinda sorry for them&quot;, as other invited musicians were not showing up.&lt;ref&gt;Akhtar, C3.&lt;/ref&gt; Tool's lineup was completed when a friend of Jones introduced them to bassist D'Amour.&lt;ref name=&quot;circusmagazine&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

The following year, at a time when [[alternative rock]] and [[grunge]] was at its height, Tool released their first full-length album, ''[[Undertow (Tool album)|Undertow]]'' (1993). It expressed more diverse dynamics than ''Opiate'' and included songs the band had chosen not to publish on their previous release, when they had opted for a heavier sound.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jones a Master of Many Trades&quot;/&gt; The band began touring again as planned, with an exception in May 1993. Tool was scheduled to play at the Garden Pavilion in Hollywood but learned at the last minute that the Garden Pavilion belonged to [[L. Ron Hubbard]]'s [[Church of Scientology]], which was perceived as a clash with &quot;the band's ethics about how a person should not follow a belief system that constricts their development as a human being.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stepping Out From the Shadows&quot; /&gt; Keenan &quot;spent most of the show baa-ing like a sheep at the audience.&quot;{{dead link|date=February 2012}}&lt;ref name=&quot;33 things&quot;&gt;{{cite web

With the release of Tool's follow-up single &quot;[[Prison Sex (song)|Prison Sex]]&quot;, the band again became the target of censorship.

I've got my hands bound and my head down and my eyes closed and my throat wide open.&quot; The video was created primarily by guitarist Adam Jones, who saw it as his &quot;surrealistic interpretation&quot; of the subject matter.&lt;ref name=&quot;hypno&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

In September 1995, the band started writing and recording their second studio album. At that time Tool experienced its only lineup change to date, with bassist D'Amour leaving the band amicably to pursue other projects.

The band enlisted the help of producer [[David Bottrill]], who had produced some of [[King Crimson]]'s albums while Jones collaborated with [[Cam de Leon]] to create ''Ænima'''s Grammy-nominated artwork. 

The album was dedicated to [[Satire|satirist]] [[Bill Hicks]], who had died two and a half years earlier.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stepping Out From the Shadows&quot;/&gt; The band intended to raise awareness about Hicks's material and ideas, because they felt that Tool and Hicks &quot;were resonating similar concepts&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;austinkeenanhicks&quot;&gt;{{cite news

The first single, &quot;[[Stinkfist]]&quot;, garnered limited and imperfect airplay: It was shortened by radio programmers, MTV (U.S.) renamed the music video of &quot;Stinkfist&quot; to &quot;Track #1&quot; due to offensive connotations,&lt;ref name=&quot;stinkfist&quot;&gt;{{cite web

A tour began in October 1996, only two weeks after ''Ænima'''s release. Following numerous appearances in the United States and Europe, Tool headed for Australia and New Zealand in late March 1997. April 1 of that year saw the first of several [[April Fools' Day|April Fools']] pranks related to the band.

Eventually returning to the United States, Tool appeared at [[Lollapalooza]] '97 in July, this time as a headliner, where they gained critical praise from ''[[The New York Times]]'':

{{quote|Tool was returning in triumph to Lollapalooza after appearing among the obscure bands on the festival's smaller stage in 1993.

A legal battle that began the same year interfered with the band's working on another release. [[Volcano Entertainment]]—the successor of Tool's by-then defunct label Zoo Entertainment—alleged contract violations by Tool and filed [[lawsuit|suit]]. According to Volcano, Tool had violated their contract when the band looked at offers from other record labels. After Tool filed a countersuit stating that Volcano had failed to use a renewal option in their contract, the parties settled out of court. In December 1998 Tool agreed to a new contract, a three-record joint venture deal.&lt;ref&gt;Akhtar, C15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Extensive touring throughout 2001 and 2002 supported ''Lateralus'' and included a personal highlight for the band: a 10-show joint mini-tour with [[King Crimson]] in August 2001. Comparisons between the two were made, MTV describing the bands as &quot;the once and future kings of progressive rock&quot;. Keenan stated of the minitour: &quot;For me, being on stage with King Crimson is like [[Lenny Kravitz]] playing with [[Led Zeppelin]], or [[Britney Spears]] onstage with [[Debbie Gibson]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;kingcrimsonminitour&quot;/&gt; 

Although the end of the tour in November 2002 seemed to signal the start of another dormancy for the band, they did not become completely inactive. While Keenan recorded and toured with [[A Perfect Circle]], the other band members released an interview and a recording of new material, both exclusive to the fan club. On April 1, 2005, the official Tool website announced that &quot;Maynard has found Jesus&quot; and would be abandoning the recording of the new Tool album temporarily and possibly permanently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Musical style and influences==
Tool was described by Patrick Donovan of ''[[The Age]]'' as &quot;the thinking person's metal band. Cerebral and visceral, soft and heavy, melodic and abrasive, tender and brutal, familiar and strange, western and eastern, beautiful and ugly, taut yet sprawling and epic, they are a tangle of contradictions.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;theage10kdays&quot;/&gt; Tool has gained critical praise from the ''[[International Herald Tribune]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'s&lt;/nowiki&gt; C.B.

===Musical style===
A component of Tool's song repertoire relies on the use of [[Unusual time signatures|odd time signatures]]. For instance, bassist [[Justin Chancellor]] describes the time signature employed on ''[[Lateralus]]'' first single, &quot;[[Schism (song)|Schism]]&quot;, as 13/16 and that it later &quot;goes into all kinds of other times&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;bassplayer052001&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

Beyond this aspect of the band's sound, each band member experiments within his musical scope. [[Bass Player (magazine)|''Bass Player'' magazine]] described Chancellor's bass playing as a &quot;thick midrange tone, guitar-style techniques, and elastic versatility&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;bassplayer052001&quot;/&gt; As an example of this, the magazine mentioned the use of a [[Wah-wah (music)|wah effect]] by [[Hammer-on|hammering]] &quot;the notes with the left hand and using the bass's tone controls to get a tone sweep&quot;, such as on the song &quot;The Patient&quot;, from ''Lateralus''.&lt;ref name=&quot;bassplayer052001&quot;/&gt;

Completing the band's [[rhythm section]], drummer Danny Carey uses [[polyrhythm]]s, [[tabla]]-style techniques, and the incorporation of custom [[Electronic drum|electronic drum pads]] to trigger samples, such as prerecorded [[tabla]] and [[octoban]] sounds.&lt;ref name=&quot;moderndrummer072006&quot;/&gt;

Maynard James Keenan's ability as a vocalist has been characterized more subjectively by the ''[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]'': After his performance during an [[Alice in Chains]] reunion concert in 2005, freelancer Travis Hay saw him as &quot;a natural fit at replacing [[Layne Staley]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Influences===

In an interview with Tool, he touched briefly on how the two bands relate to each other, stating &quot;Do you hear the influence? There's just one figure where I hear an influence, just one. It was a piece we were developing that we dropped. And it's almost exactly the same figure: three note arpeggio with a particular accent from the guitar. So I do not think you could have heard it.

===Album artwork===
Adam Jones is responsible for most of the band's artwork concepts. Their album, ''[[Undertow (Tool album)|Undertow]]'', featured a ribcage sculpture by Jones on its cover and photos contributed by the band members.&lt;ref name=&quot;hypno&quot;/&gt; Later albums included artwork by collaborating artists: ''[[Ænima]]''&lt;ref&gt;Akhtar, G4.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Salival]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The releases garnered positive critical reception, with a music journalist of the [[Associated Press]] attributing to the band a reputation for innovative album packaging.&lt;ref name=&quot;alexgreyinterview&quot;/&gt;

Both ''Ænima''&lt;ref&gt;Akhtar, D11.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''10,000 Days''&lt;ref name=&quot;49thgrammyawards&quot;/&gt; were nominated for the [[Grammy Award for Best Recording Package]], but while the former failed to win in 1997, the latter did win in 2007. As art director, Adam Jones created packaging for ''10,000 Days'' that features a pair of [[stereoscopic]] lenses for viewing 3-D artwork and photos. Jones has been a lifelong fan of stereoscopic photography and expressed a desire for the packaging to be unique and to reflect the '70s artwork he appreciates.&lt;ref name=&quot;newsgrammypackage&quot;&gt;{{cite web

He explains, &quot;[a] lot of the songs are a personal journey for him and he has a hard time with the glare of the lights when he’s trying to reproduce these emotions for the audience. He needs a bit of personal space, and he feels more comfortable in the shadows.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;plsnews&quot;/&gt;
The big screens are used to play back &quot;looped clips that aren’t tracked to a song like a music video. The band has never used any sort of timecode. They’ve always made sure the video can change on-the-fly, in a way that can be improvised. ... The show is never the same twice.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;plsnews&quot;/&gt; As of 2010, Andres Abrego is their new live video director.
