'''The Greencards''' are a [[progressive bluegrass]] band that formed in [[Austin, Texas]], and are currently based in [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. The band was founded in 2003 in Texas by [[Eamon McLoughlin]], an Englishman, and Australians [[Kym Warner]] and [[Carol Young]]. The musicians originally performed in local Austin bars, and soon found increasing acclaim. They have released one independent album, ''[[Movin' On (The Greencards album)|Movin' On]]'', in 2003, and two albums, ''[[Weather and Water]]'', and ''[[Viridian (album)|Viridian]]'', on the [[Dualtone Records|Dualtone]] [[record label]]. Their fourth album, ''[[Fascination (album)|Fascination]]'', was released on [[Sugar Hill Records (bluegrass)|Sugar Hill]] in 2009.

Their debut album, ''Movin' On'', was the recipient of local Texas awards and charted on Americana radio stations. [[Country Music Television]] named their follow-up ''Weather and Water'' as one of the ten best bluegrass albums of 2005, and The Greencards were invited to tour with [[Bob Dylan]] and [[Willie Nelson]] in the same year. ''Viridian'' would go on to take the number one position on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine's [[Billboard charts|Bluegrass Music Chart]], making The Greencards the first international band to ever do so. ''Viridian'' was a critically praised album, and was nominated for Best Country Album by the Australian Recording Industry Association. The track &quot;Mucky the Duck&quot; from ''Viridian'' was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]] at the [[50th Grammy Awards]].

The Greencards are noted for their playing of American bluegrass with a worldly feel, and for their incorporation of other genres of music. Often labeled as part of, and said to be representative of, the &quot;[[newgrass]]&quot; movement, they draw from [[Irish folk music]], [[Romani music|gypsy music]], [[rock 'n' roll]], [[folk ballad]]ry, and [[Latin American music]]al sources. The Greencards' sound has been compared to progressive American [[folk rock]], and they have been credited with helping to expand bluegrass music.

Eamon McLoughlin left the band in December 2009, and currently resides in Nashville TN. He was replaced by [[Tyler Andal]], a talented 22 year old fiddle player from White House, TN.  [[Carl Miner]], originally from Oregon, joined the group in May 2010, playing acoustic guitar.  Carl won the 1999 National Flatpicking Championship at the Walnut Valley Festival, and currently resides in Nashville, TN.

The Greencards were initially composed of two Australians, Kym Warner on [[mandolin]] and Carol Young on [[bass guitar|bass]], and an Englishman, Eamon McLoughlin on [[fiddle]].&lt;ref name=&quot;WFAA Dallas-Fort Worth November 2007&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.wfaa.com/sharedcontent/dws/ent/wfaa/stories/DN-greencards_1102gui.ART.State.Edition1.426cc06.html | title = The Greencards | first = Mario | last = Tarradell | date=November 2, 2007 | publisher = [[WFAA-TV]] (Dallas-Fort Worth) | accessdate = 2008-06-01}} {{dead link| date=June 2010 | bot=DASHBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Raised in [[South London]], McLoughlin began to perform country music shows with his family on weekends, influenced by [[George Jones]], [[George Strait]], and [[Ricky Skaggs]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Country Music Television blogs&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Americana Homeplace January 2008&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.americanahomeplace.com/news.2005WhatYearforGreencards.htm | title = 2005: What a Year for The Greencards | date = January 8, 2006 | publisher = Americana Homeplace | accessdate = 2008-06-01}} {{dead link| date=June 2010 | bot=DASHBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Born to [[Irish people|Irish]] parents, McLoughlin's father was head of a London-based country band.

Warner was an aspiring bluegrass musician (which was unusual in Australia) after inheriting the music from his father, an early Australian bluegrass pioneer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rolling Stone May 2005&quot; /&gt; The winner of the Australian National Bluegrass Mandolin Championship for four consecutive years, Warner had toured with country music artists including Gina Jeffreys, and with Young in [[Kasey Chambers]]'s band.&lt;ref name=&quot;OZtrax, ABC 2007&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.abc.net.au/oztrax/stories/s1870606.htm | title = Waiting On The Night | date = April 21, 2007 | work = OzTrax | publisher = [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] | accessdate = 2008-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sydney Morning Herald April 2007&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2007/04/27/1177459962722.html | first = Bruce | last = Elder | title = Viridian | date = April 28, 2007 | work = [[The Sydney Morning Herald]] | accessdate = 2008-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Young and Warner knew each other previously, and according to Warner, had been drawn to bluegrass and [[American roots music]] through an appreciation of George Jones and Merle Haggard.&lt;ref name=&quot;Desert News June 2007&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url = http://deseretnews.com/dn/view/0,1249,665193587,00.html | title = Greencards drawn to American roots music | first = Scott | last = Iwasaki | date = June 15, 2007 | work = [[Deseret Morning News]] | accessdate = 2008-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Warner and Young made the decision to emigrate to America to pursue musical careers in that country, after they met. Young and Warner later lived together in Sydney while trying to find work in the moribund Australian bluegrass scene. After leaving Australia, they spent time in [[West Texas]] before relocating to Austin.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rolling Stone May 2005&quot; /&gt;

On an early trip the pair took to Austin, Warner and Young met McLoughlin at a recording session.&lt;ref name=&quot;Desert News June 2007&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Middletown Journal April 2007&quot; /&gt; Warner was producing an album for the recording artist Bill Atkins and found they needed a fiddle player, which led to the recruitment of McLoughlin.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Patriot Ledger February 2006&quot; /&gt; Initially the immigrants came to know one another through their mutual love of [[Monty Python]], [[Benny Hill]], and [[Fawlty Towers]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Rolling Stone May 2005&quot; /&gt; They began to have jam sessions afterwards and there was evident chemistry between the trio, which led to their writing songs together.&lt;ref name=&quot;Desert News June 2007&quot; /&gt; They named themselves The Greencards in honor of the fact that all three band members carried [[United States Permanent Resident Card|United States green cards]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Graham Weekly Album Review Viridian 2007&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://georgegraham.com/reviews/greencrd.html | title = The Greencards: Viridian | date = 2007-02-07 | publisher = The Graham Weekly Album Review | first = George | last = Graham | accessdate = 2008-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; They eventually began to perform shows locally in Austin to finance the recording of what would become their debut album, 2003's ''Movin' On''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Desert News June 2007&quot; /&gt; In the process, they became one of the most popular musical groups in Austin.&lt;ref name=&quot;Middletown Journal April 2007&quot; /&gt; Representative of an emerging &quot;newgrass&quot; movement, The Greencards' acoustic sound was said to incorporate eclectic influences from Irish traditional, Romani gypsy, and Latin American musical sources.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cybergrass 2008-09-05&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Irish Times July 2007&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.irishtimes.com/theticket/articles/2006/0707/1146660098050.html | title = Who the hell are?

Their first performance together as a band was at the Austin [[Irish pub]], Mother Egan's. Given a noon to 3&amp;nbsp;pm Central time slot, they surprisingly began to fill the pub with patrons week after week. Their fans at Mother Egan's soon began calling them the &quot;Bluegrass Bunch&quot;. Several months later, The Greencards began performing an additional three to five times per week in Austin, in addition to their Mother Egan's Sunday show. Warner credited the frantic pace of their performance schedule during their Austin formation to their cohesion as a group and with driving them to create more new original music.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Patriot Ledger February 2006&quot; /&gt; During their time performing locally in Austin, they toured with various local Texas musicians, including [[Robert Earl Keen]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Graham Weekly Album Review Viridian 2007&quot; /&gt; Warner said that during their early career performing together, audiences would always assume they were American musicians until they finally spoke between songs, revealing their English and Australian accents.&lt;ref name=&quot;Knoxville News 2008-03-07&quot; /&gt;

Mario Tarradell of [[WFAA-TV]] news called the idea of an American bluegrass band composed of two Australians and an Englishman not as &quot;outrageous&quot; as it may seem. He quoted McLoughlin in an interview:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The ironic thing is that we grew up listening to primarily American music and fell in love with American music. I love [[country music]]. I grew up with George Jones and [[Charley Pride]] and [[Jim Reeves]]. All that stuff was playing in the house. That's what I wanted to seek out. That's what I wanted to play. Carol was into [[Tammy Wynette]]. [[Trev Warner]] is Kym's dad, and he was the first person to bring bluegrass music to Australia.&lt;ref name=&quot;WFAA Dallas-Fort Worth November 2007&quot; /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At the end of 2005, The Greencards relocated from Austin to Nashville, Tennessee to be closer to their production company and its staff.&lt;ref name=&quot;Americana Homeplace January 2008&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Washington Post review April 2007&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/12/AR2007041200771.html | title = The Greencards &quot;Viridian&quot; Dualtone | first = Geoffrey | last = Himes | date = April 13, 2007 | work = [[The Washington Post]] | accessdate = 2008-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coinciding with their move to Nashville and work on their second album ''Weather and Water'', the changes in location and sound were observed by critics to be a deliberate move from the jam-style of their debut album ''Movin' On'' to instead concentrate on [[Americana (music)|Americana]]-focused music.&lt;ref name=&quot;Washington Post review April 2007&quot; /&gt; By 2006, The Greencards had an annual slot at Merlefest, held yearly in [[Wilkesboro, North Carolina]].&lt;ref name=&quot;The Patriot Ledger February 2006&quot; /&gt; The band was nominated in the Americana Music Association Awards for 2006 in the category of New/Emerging Artist of the Year, winning the award.&lt;ref name=&quot;Americana Music Awards 2006&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.americanamusic.org/site.php?content=honors_awards | title = 5th Annual Americana Honors &amp; Awards Nominees | year=2006 | publisher = ''Americana Music Awards'' | accessdate = 2008-05-29|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071012213145/http://www.americanamusic.org/site.php?content=honors_awards |archivedate = October 12, 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2006, their tour van rolled over on a patch of ice after leaving a performance in [[Bryan, Texas]], on the way back to Austin, but with no serious injuries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Americana Homeplace January 2008&quot; /&gt;

=== ''Viridian'' (2007–2008) ===
{{main|Viridian (album)}}
[[Image:The Greencards 5.jpg|thumb|The Greencards performing at The Mucky Duck, the inspiration for their Grammy-nominated song &quot;Mucky the Duck&quot;]]
On their previous albums, The Greencards had individually recorded their musical tracks separately in isolation booths of recording studios.  For ''Viridian'', however, the bandmembers recorded their album together in real time in an open room, which was said to be a factor in creating a spontaneous feel for some of the album.&lt;ref name=&quot;OZtrax, ABC 2007&quot; /&gt; Most of the songs on ''Viridian'' are sung by Young, and all of the tracks on ''Viridian'' were written by The Greencards, with the exception of &quot;Travel On&quot;, which was penned by [[Kim Richey]] of Nashville.&lt;ref name=&quot;Washington Post review April 2007&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Country Stars Online review 2007&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.countrystarsonline.com/reviewarchives/2007/Greencards%20_JM.htm | archivedate=2008-02-07|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080207052239/http://www.countrystarsonline.com/reviewarchives/2007/Greencards+_JM.htm|title = The Greencards - Viridian | first = Jim | last = Moulton &lt;!-- this is the date of album release, not of the review | date = 2007-03-06 --&gt; | publisher = Country Stars Online | accessdate = 2008-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their sound, through ''Viridian'', was likened to the Canadian [[alternative country]] band [[The Duhks]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Country Stars Online review 2007&quot; /&gt; After its release, ''Viridian'' claimed the #1 position on ''Billboard'' magazine's Bluegrass Music Chart.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sun Journal October 2007&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.newbernsj.com/entertainment/pamlico_36962___article.html/bluegrass_music.html | title = The Greencards blend bluegrass, country and pop in Bayboro | first = Tom | last = Mayer | date = October 11, 2007 | work = [[Sun Journal (New Bern)|Sun Journal]] | location = [[New Bern, North Carolina]] | accessdate = 2008-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Doug Lancio, a producer who had previously worked with [[Patty Griffin]], was said to have been a positive factor in the success of ''Viridian''. Prior to the 2007 album, Lancio had not previously worked with The Greencards.&lt;ref name=&quot;Desert News June 2007&quot; /&gt;  The Greencards are the first international musical act to ever reach #1 on the Bluegrass Music Chart.&lt;ref name=&quot;Middletown Journal April 2007&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.middletownjournal.com/hp/content/oh/story/news/local/2007/04/27/go042707greencards.html | title = Bluegrass chart toppers perform at Southgate House | first = Richard O | last = Jones | date = April 27, 2007 | work = [[The Middletown Journal]] | accessdate = 2008-06-01}} {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a review of ''Viridian'', Embo Blake of ''Hybrid Magazine'' noted Carol Young's vocal skill, as she &quot;effortlessly [[diphthong]]s cadence&quot; on the track &quot;Waiting On The Night&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hybrid Magazine 2007&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.hybridmagazine.com/reviews/0507/greencards.shtml | first = Embo | last = Blake | title = The Greencards Viridian | year=2007 | publisher = ''Hybrid Magazine'' | accessdate = 2008-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[ABC News]] in [[Dallas–Fort Worth Metroplex|Dallas/Fort Worth]], the album has a traditional bluegrass core, with a worldly flavor.&lt;ref name=&quot;WFAA Dallas-Fort Worth November 2007&quot; /&gt; Bruce Elder of the ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'' called ''Viridian'' a &quot;[[wikt:Special:Search/tour de force|tour de force]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sydney Morning Herald April 2007&quot; /&gt;

The Greencards announced on their website in August 2008 that they had returned to the studio to record their fourth album with producer Jay Joyce. In September 2008, again via their website, they announced that they signed with Sugar Hill Records for their fourth album, to be released in spring 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cybergrass 2008-09-05&quot;&gt;{{cite news |  last=BMNN | title=The Greencards Sign With Sugar Hill - New Album Due Spring 2009 | date=2008-09-05 | publisher=Cybergrass | url =http://www.cybergrass.com/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=5291 |  accessdate = 2008-09-20}} {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Fascination'' (from 2009) ===
{{main|Fascination (album)}}
On April 21, 2009, The Greencards released their fourth studio album, ''Fascination''. Warner describes the album as &quot;their most focused&quot; work. On their previous albums, the three band members had individually put forward ideas for the music, until enough cohered into the finished work. For ''Fascination'', he says they put aside their individual pride to create a stronger work. The years of touring experience The Greencards have accumulated since their earliest work has helped them, as well. Referring to when they formed the band, he said, &quot;We just played in Austin. We just wrote probably anything, which was the only stuff we knew, which was more of a traditional thing. But since then, we've had five or six years of touring, all of the experiences, all of the people you meet. We've been so fortunate to play at all of these festivals which have a really eclectic form of music styles.&quot;&lt;ref name='CMT 2009-05-11'&gt;{{cite news | first=Whitney | last=Self | title=The Greencards Hope to Charm Listeners With Fascinaion | date=2009-05-11 | publisher=Country Music Television | url =http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1611109/the-greencards-hope-to-charm-listeners-with-fascination.jhtml | accessdate = 2009-06-03  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Young, the music on ''Fascination'' was a progression for the band, and a challenge for them. Comparing their prior work to the new album, she said, &quot;They're probably a bit more bluegrass-influenced than this one here. While we still have the bluegrass and roots music influences, we really wanted to push ourselves harder on this one, something a bit more challenging to play live.&quot; She described their music through their fourth album as having evolved, explaining that it began as traditional roots and bluegrass, but after six years is &quot;our own little sound&quot;.&lt;ref name='VCS 2009-05-21'&gt;{{cite news | first=Bill | last=Locey | title=The Greencards expand their rootsy musical palette | date=2009-05-21 | publisher=Ventura County Star | url =http://www.venturacountystar.com/news/2009/may/21/acoustic-colors/ | accessdate = 2009-06-03 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The track, &quot;The Crystal Merchant&quot;, was nominated for the [[Grammy Award for Best Country Instrumental Performance]].

In 2009, The Greencards continued to tour, performed again at MerleFest, the Strawberry Park Bluegrass Festival in Preston,CT, and were on the bill for [[Lollapalooza]].&lt;ref name='CMT 2009-05-11' /&gt;

=== ''Buy A Brick''  campaign ===
On November 8, 2010 The Greencards announced that they will self-finance the production on their next album, set for May 2011, rather than taking an advance from a record company. The ''Buy A Brick'' campaign is selling a package of an advance copy of the final CD, a digital image of the album artwork, video updates of the recording of the album and the subscriber's name (up to twenty characters) on the album artwork. Subscriptions are either $100 or $200 US with the more expensive package getting the album one week earlier and the subscriber's name on the front of the CD package.&lt;ref name=&quot;BuyABrick &quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.thegreencards.com/#/buy-a-brick | title = Buy A Brick |  accessdate = 2010-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Musical style and influences ==
[[Image:The Greencards 4.jpg|thumb|The Greencards in concert in 2007]]

Considered by critics to be part of the [[progressive bluegrass]] (&quot;newgrass&quot;) musical school, The Greencards draw from a wide variety of musical influences, ranging from Bob Dylan and the Beatles to the Celtic tone of Irish traditional music, gypsy themes, and Latin sounds.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Irish Times July 2007&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Glen Arbor Sun July 2006&quot; /&gt; Despite the wide array of influences that shape their music, The Greencards have always maintained a distinctively Americana sound.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rocky Mountain News June 2006&quot; /&gt; While the various sounds that influence their work are always detectable, none ever dominate the band's music.&lt;ref name=&quot;PLAYBACK:stl March 2007&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.playbackstl.com/content/view/5899/157/ | first = Brad | last = Proctor | title = The Greencards &amp;#124; Viridian (Dualtone) | date = March 21, 2007 | publisher = ''PLAYBACK:stl'' | accessdate = 2008-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jim Abbott, of the ''Tribune News Service'', described The Greencards as polished, &quot;earthy, charming roots music with a sophisticated sheen&quot;, but noted that some bluegrass purists may miss the vocal idiosyncrasies that can be found on other acts such as the [[Del McCoury Band]].&lt;ref name=&quot;The Orlando Sentinel July 2005&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-9433183_ITM | title = The Greencards have a sound as unique as their members | first = Jim | last = Abbott | date = July 7, 2005 | work = [[Orlando Sentinel]] | accessdate = 2008-06-01}} {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their appeal has been attributed to both their &quot;instrumental dexterity&quot; as well as the manner in which they both revere and flaunt bluegrass conventions.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Philadelphia Intelligencer August 2007&quot; /&gt; The progressive nature of The Greencards' bluegrass sound has been compared to [[Nickel Creek]] and [[Alison Krauss|Alison Krauss &amp; Union Station]].&lt;ref name=&quot;WFAA Dallas-Fort Worth November 2007&quot; /&gt;

The Greencards' work on ''Movin' On'' had a looser, jam-based feeling to it, which they later firmed into a more polished sound after relocating to Nashville from Austin for ''Weather and Water''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Washington Post review April 2007&quot; /&gt; John T. Davis in ''No Depression Magazine'' stated The Greencards' best work on ''Weather and Water'' contained a &quot;stillness&quot;, which he felt contrasted with the speed and &quot;frantic&quot; pace of some of the songs on ''Movin' On''.&lt;ref name=&quot;No Depression 2005&quot;&gt;{{cite journal| last = Davis | first = John T.| title = ROOTS Across Oceans — The Greencards find a home between Oz and the US | publisher = No Depression Magazine #59 | date = September–October 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While other critics had mentioned The Greencards in the context of jam bands, Davis went on to say that he felt the band was not one, and that they favored a leaner and &quot;clean&quot; sound driven more by Celtic roots.&lt;ref name=&quot;No Depression 2005&quot; /&gt; 

During their 2005 tour with Dylan and Nelson, Buzz McClain of ''The Washington Post'' believed that The Greencards play traditional American music better than some Americans do, because of their deep respect for bluegrass and the Americana sound.&lt;ref name=&quot;Washington Post June 2005&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/14/AR2005061401467_pf.html | title = The Greencards' Down-Home Customs | first = Buzz | last = McClain | date = June 15, 2005 | work = [[The Washington Post]] | accessdate = 2008-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to David McPherson in ''Bluegrass Unlimited'' magazine, the band's three-part harmonies evoke the soul sounds of [[Gospel music]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bluegrass Unlimited 2005&quot;&gt;{{cite journal| last = McPherson | first = David | title = The Greencards — An Unlikely Combination | publisher = Bluegrass Unlimited, Volume 40, Number 5 | month = November | year = 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kym Warner has said that Robert Earl Keen, [[Kelly Willis]], and Patty Griffin were key influences musically in The Greencards's sound during their time in Austin, with the previously unreleased Griffin song &quot;What You Are&quot; being covered on their album ''Weather and Water''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Glide 2005-07-10&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;No Depression 2005&quot; /&gt; The recordings on ''Viridian'', in particular the songs &quot;River of Sand&quot;, &quot;Waiting on the Night&quot; and &quot;When I Was in Love With You&quot;, were said to evoke the sounds of progressive folk rock that emerged in the 1960s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Washington Post April 2007&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/17/AR2007041701577.html | title = Greencards: Bluegrass With Varied Accents | first = Buzz | last = McClain | date = April 18, 2007 | work = [[The Washington Post]] | accessdate = 2008-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Nashville Scene'', Edd Hurt noted the eclectic tone of the band's overall body of recordings, and believed that their albums belonged to the tradition of [[singer-songwriter]] musicians.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nashville Scene 2007-03-22&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nashvillescene.com/Stories/Arts/Music/2007/03/22/Immigrant_Songs/index.shtml |title=Immigrant Songs |accessdate=2008-10-02 |last=Hurt |first=Edd |date=2007-03-22 |publisher=Nashville Scene |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070328221140/http://www.nashvillescene.com/Stories/Arts/Music/2007/03/22/Immigrant_Songs/index.shtml |archivedate=2007-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their musical appeal to fans has been attributed to both their &quot;instrumental dexterity&quot; as well as the manner in which they both revere and flaunt bluegrass conventions.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Philadelphia Intelligencer August 2007&quot; /&gt; Naila Francis described The Greencards's sound as having a mellow tone, with &quot;tender ballards and yarns&quot; in their songs, but punctuated by bursts of energetic musical restlessness.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Philadelphia Intelligencer August 2007&quot; /&gt; Country Music Television in particular noted their melancholy but melodic sound.&lt;ref name=&quot;Country Music Television December 2005&quot; /&gt; The Greencards have described their sound as &quot;high energy acoustic music&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;News 8 Austin March 2004&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.news8austin.com/content/living/rooftop_music/?ArID=100555&amp;SecID=427 | title = The Greencards on the roof | date = March 11, 2004 | publisher = [[News 8 Austin]] | accessdate = 2008-05-29|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080522151220/http://www.news8austin.com/content/living/rooftop_music/?ArID=100555&amp;SecID=427 |archivedate = May 22, 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;
