'''Motörhead''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|m|oʊ|t|ər|h|ɛ|d}}) are&lt;!-- DO ''not'' CHANGE THIS TO &quot;IS&quot;; &quot;name of a group are&quot; is proper British English and this is a British band. See WP:ENGVAR to view the policy on this--&gt; an English [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in 1975 by [[bassist]], [[singer]] and [[songwriter]] Ian Fraser Kilmister, known mainly by his stage name [[Lemmy]], who has remained the sole constant member. The band is often considered a precursor to or one of the earliest members of the [[New Wave of British Heavy Metal]], which re-energised [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] in the late 1970s and early 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url={{Allmusic|class=explore|id=style/d7760|pure_url=yes}}| title=New Wave of British Heavy Metal| publisher=Allmusic| accessdate=11 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usually a [[power trio]], Motörhead had particular success in the early 1980s with several successful singles in the [[UK Singles Chart|UK Top 40 chart]]. The albums ''[[Overkill (album)|Overkill]]'', ''[[Bomber (album)|Bomber]]'', ''[[Ace of Spades (album)|Ace of Spades]]'', and particularly ''[[No Sleep 'til Hammersmith]]'', cemented Motörhead's reputation as one of Britain's foremost rock bands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.losingtoday.com/reviews.php?review_id=2225&amp;band_alpha=m |title=LosingToday reviews |accessdate=11 February 2007 |publisher=LosingToday Magazine's review of [[BBC Live &amp; In-Session]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Motörhead are typically classified as heavy metal, and their fusion of [[punk rock]] into the genre helped to pioneer [[speed metal]] and [[thrash metal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p4965|pure_url=yes}} |title=Motörhead Biography|accessdate=19 December 2008|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen|authorlink=Stephen Thomas Erlewine|publisher=[[Allmusic]]|quote=Motörhead wasn't punk rock&amp;nbsp;... but they were the first metal band to harness that energy and, in the process, they created speed metal and thrash metal.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Motörhead's approach has remained the same over the band's career, preferring to play what they enjoy and do best; their appreciation of early rock and roll is reflected in some of their occasional cover songs. Motörhead's lyrics typically cover such topics as war, good versus evil, abuse of power, promiscuous sex, substance abuse, and, most famously, gambling. The name &quot;Motörhead&quot; is a reference to users of the drug [[amphetamine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Reynolds | first = Simon | year = 1995 | title = The Sex Revolts: Gender, Rebellion, and Rock 'n' Roll | page = 107 | publisher = Harvard University Press | isbn = 0-674-80272-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band's distinctive fanged-face logo, with its oversized boar's horns, chains, and spikes, was created by artist [[Joe Petagno]] in 1977 for the cover of the ''[[Motörhead (album)|Motörhead]]'' album and has appeared in many variations on covers of ensuing albums.

==History==
===1975–1977&amp;nbsp;– Early years&amp;nbsp;– The ''Motörhead'' album===
{{listen|filename=Motörhead.ogg|title=&quot;Motorhead&quot;|description=Released in 1977 as a single from ''[[Motörhead (album)|Motörhead]]''}}
Lemmy was fired from [[Hawkwind]] in May 1975 for, as he says, &quot;doing the wrong drugs.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Lemmy]], ''[[White Line Fever (book)|White Line Fever]]'', p. 94. (2002). Simon &amp; Schuster. ISBN 0-684-85868-1.&lt;/ref&gt;  He was arrested on suspicion of possessing cocaine at the Canadian border and spent five days in prison, causing the band to cancel some of their North America tour dates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tyler |first=Tony |date=28 June 1975 |title=The Trials Of Lemmy |journal=[[NME]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Now on his own, Lemmy decided to form a new band called Motörhead, inspired by the final song he had written for Hawkwind.&lt;ref&gt;''White Line Fever'', p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lemmy's stated aim was to &quot;concentrate on very basic music: loud, fast, city, raucous, arrogant, paranoid, speedfreak rock n roll&amp;nbsp;... it will be so loud that if we move in next door to you, your lawn will die&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;PFFT&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Frame|first=Pete |title=Rock Family Trees |publisher=Omnibus Press|isbn=978-0-7119-0465-1 |year=1983 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the recommendation of [[Mick Farren]], he recruited [[Larry Wallis]] (ex-[[Pink Fairies]]) on [[electric guitar]] and [[Lucas Fox]] on [[drum kit|drums]]. According to Lemmy, the band's first practice was in a furniture store in [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]], England in 1975. Kilmister has said they used to steal equipment, as the band was short on gear.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theorion.com/2.692/make-em-deaf-forever-1.19715 Make `em deaf forever]{{dead link|date=July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their first engagement was supporting [[Greenslade]] at [[The Roundhouse]], [[London]] on 20 July 1975.&lt;ref name=&quot;ICGM&quot;&gt;[[Alan Burridge (writer)|Burridge, Alan]] ''Illustrated Collector's Guide to Motorhead'' Published: 1995, Collector's Guide Publishing ISBN 0-9695736-2-6. Used for the line up numbers as listed in albums in band members section as well as information on recordings and performances.&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 October, having played 10 engagements, they became the supporting act to [[Blue Öyster Cult]] at the [[Hammersmith Apollo|Hammersmith Odeon]].

The band were contracted to [[United Artists]] by [[Andrew Lauder (music executive)|Andrew Lauder]], the [[Artist and repertoire|A&amp;R]] man for the band Lemmy was previously in, Hawkwind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bell |first=Max |date=19 September 2004 |title=Paradise recalled |journal=[[The Independent]] |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/paradise-recalled-547031.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; They recorded sessions at [[Rockfield Studios]] in [[Monmouth]] with producer [[Dave Edmunds]], during which Fox proved to be unreliable and was replaced by drummer [[Phil &quot;Philthy Animal&quot; Taylor]], a casual acquaintance of Lemmy's. Their [[record label]] was dissatisfied with the material and refused to release it, although it was subsequently issued as ''[[On Parole]]'' in 1979 after the band had established some success.&lt;ref name=&quot;RC1&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Burridge |first=Alan |authorlink=Alan Burridge (writer) |year=1991 |month=April |title=Motörhead |journal=[[Record Collector]] |issue=140 |pages=16–22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1976, deciding that two guitarists were required, the band auditioned [[Eddie Clarke|&quot;Fast&quot; Eddie Clarke]]. Wallis, who was continuing to tour with a reformed Pink Fairies, quit immediately after the auditions and Clarke remained as the sole guitarist. This [[power trio|trio]] of Lemmy&amp;nbsp;– Clarke&amp;nbsp;– Taylor is today regarded as the &quot;classic&quot; Motörhead line-up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Adams, Bret |title=''Ace of Spade'' DVD Review |publisher=Allmusic |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r733123|pure_url=yes}} |accessdate=14 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December, the band recorded the &quot;[[Leaving Here (Motörhead song)|Leaving Here]]&quot; single for [[Stiff Records]], but United Artists intervened to prevent its general release as the band were still under contract to them, despite their refusal to issue their debut album. Initial reactions to the band had been unfavourable; they won a poll for &quot;the best worst band in the world&quot; in the music magazine ''[[NME]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;RSM&quot;&gt;Dansby, Andrew. [http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/motorhead-roll-on-20020823 Motorhead Roll On]. ''[[Rolling Stone]]''. 23 August 2002. Retrieved on 9 October 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

By April 1977, living in squats and with little recognition, Taylor and Clarke wanted to give it up, and after some debate, the band agreed to do a farewell show at the [[Marquee Club]] in London. Lemmy had become acquainted with Ted Carroll from [[Chiswick Records]] and asked him to bring a mobile studio to the show to record it for posterity. Carroll was unable to get the mobile unit to the Marquee Club but showed up backstage after the engagement and offered them two days at Escape Studios with producer [[John Keen|Speedy Keen]] to record a single. The band took the chance, and instead of recording a single they laid down 11 unfinished tracks. Carroll gave them a few more days at [[Olympic Studios]] to finish the vocals and the band completed 13 tracks for release as an album.&lt;ref&gt;''White Line Fever'', pp. 112–113.&lt;/ref&gt; Chiswick issued the single &quot;[[Motorhead (Motörhead single)|Motorhead]]&quot; in June, followed by the album ''[[Motörhead (album)|Motörhead]]'' in August, which spent one week in the [[UK Albums Chart]] at number 43.&lt;ref name=&quot;ICGM&quot;/&gt; The band toured the UK supporting Hawkwind in June, then from late July they commenced the &quot;Beyond the Threshold of Pain&quot; tour with The Count Bishops.&lt;ref name=&quot;ICGM&quot;/&gt;

In August, [[Tony Secunda]] took over the management of the band, and their cohesiveness became so unstable that by March 1978, Clarke and Taylor had formed and were performing as The Muggers with Speedy Keen and [[Billy Rath]].&lt;ref name=&quot;PFFT&quot; /&gt;

===1978–1979&amp;nbsp;– Rise to success: ''Overkill'' and ''Bomber''===
[[File:Lemmy-taylor-clarke.JPG|thumb|The 1976–1982 Motörhead line-up: [[Lemmy|Lemmy Kilmister]], [[Phil &quot;Philthy Animal&quot; Taylor]] and [[Eddie Clarke|&quot;Fast&quot; Eddie Clarke]]]]
In July 1978, the band returned to the management of Douglas Smith, who secured a one-off singles deal with [[Bronze Records]].&lt;ref name=&quot;PFFT&quot; /&gt; The resulting &quot;[[Louie Louie (Motörhead song)|Louie Louie]]&quot; single was issued in September peaking at number 68 on the [[UK Singles Chart]], and the band toured the UK to promote it, recorded a [[BBC Radio 1]] ''[[John Peel#BBC career|John Peel in session]]'' on 18 September (these tracks were later issued on the 2005 ''[[BBC Live &amp; In-Session]]'' album), and appeared for the first time on [[BBC Television]]'s ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' on 25 October.&lt;ref name=&quot;ICGM&quot;/&gt; Chiswick capitalised on this new level of success by re-issuing the debut album ''Motörhead'' on white vinyl through [[EMI Records]].

The single's success led to Bronze extending their contract, and put the band back into the studio to record an album, this time with producer [[Jimmy Miller]] at [[The Roundhouse|Roundhouse Studios]].&lt;ref name=&quot;RC1&quot;/&gt; A hint of what the band had recorded for the album came on 9 March 1979 when the band played &quot;[[Overkill (Motörhead song)|Overkill]]&quot; on ''Top of the Pops'' to support the release of the single ahead of the ''[[Overkill (album)|Overkill]]'' album, which was released on 24 March. It became Motörhead's first album to break into the top 40 of the UK Albums chart, reaching number 24, with the single reaching number 39 on the UK Singles Chart. These releases were followed by the &quot;Overkill&quot; UK tour which began on 23 March.&lt;ref name=&quot;ICGM&quot;/&gt; A subsequent single was released in June, coupling the album track &quot;[[No Class]]&quot; as the [[A-side and B-side|A-side]] with the previously unreleased song &quot;Like a Nightmare&quot; on the B-side. It fared worse than both the album and previous single but reached number 61 on the UK singles chart.

During July and August, except for a break to appear at the [[Reading Festival]], the band were working on their next album, ''[[Bomber (album)|Bomber]]''. Released on 27 October, it reached number 12 on the UK Albums Chart. On 1 December, it was followed by the &quot;[[Bomber (song)|Bomber]]&quot; single, which reached number 34 on the UK Singles Chart. The &quot;Bomber&quot; Europe and UK tour followed, with support from [[Saxon (band)|Saxon]]. The stage show featured a spectacular aircraft [[bomber]]-shaped lighting rig. During the &quot;Bomber&quot; tour, United Artists put together tapes recorded during the Rockfield Studios sessions in 1975–1976 and released them as the album ''On Parole'', which peaked at number 65 on the UK Albums Chart in December.

On 8 May 1980, while the band were on tour in [[Europe]], Bronze released ''[[The Golden Years (EP)|The Golden Years]]'', which sold better than any of their previous releases, reaching number eight on the UK Singles Chart. The band had, however, preferred the title ''Flying Tonight'', in reference to the &quot;Bomber&quot; lighting rig. On 20 August, the band (40 minutes) and [[Girlschool]] (20 minutes) were filmed performing live at the Nottingham Theatre Royal for the ''Rockstage'' programme, broadcast on UK television by the [[Associated TeleVision|ATV]] station on 4 April 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/series/16507 |title=BFI&amp;nbsp;— Film &amp; TV Database&amp;nbsp;— ROCKSTAGE |accessdate=5 July 2009 |publisher=[[British Film Institute]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1980–1982&amp;nbsp;– ''Ace of Spades'' and ''Iron Fist''===
[[File:Ace of Spades tour booklet.jpg|right|thumb|Cover of the &quot;Ace Up Your Sleeve&quot; tour booklet, using one of the shots taken during the photography session in [[Barnet]] for the ''[[Ace of Spades (album)|Ace of Spades]]'' album cover]]
During August and September 1980, the band were at Jackson's Studios in Rickmansworth, recording with producer [[Vic Maile]]. The &quot;[[Ace of Spades (song)|Ace of Spades]]&quot; single was released on 27 October 1980 as a preview of the ''[[Ace of Spades (album)|Ace of Spades]]'' album, which followed on 8 November.&lt;ref name=&quot;RC1&quot;/&gt; The single reached #15 and the album reached #4 on the UK charts. Bronze celebrated its [[Music recording sales certification|gold record]] status by pressing a [[Special edition|limited edition]] of the album in gold vinyl. Motörhead made two appearances on ''Top of the Pops'' in October that year with &quot;Ace of Spades&quot;, and between 22 October and 29 November the band were on their &quot;Ace Up Your Sleeve&quot; UK tour with support from Girlschool and [[Vardis]], and also made an appearance as guests on the [[ITV]] children's show ''[[Tiswas]]'' on 8 November.&lt;ref name=&quot;ICGM&quot;/&gt; The &quot;Arizona desert-style&quot; pictures used on the album sleeve and tour booklet cover were taken during a photo session at a [[quarry|sandpit]] in [[Barnet]].&lt;ref name=&quot;PL&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://playlouder.com/feature/+lemmy/ |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20061205003736/http://www.playlouder.com/feature/+lemmy/ |archivedate=5 December 2006 |title=Dr Rock VS Lemmy interview 19&amp;nbsp;July 2004 |accessdate=27 February 2007 |publisher=[[PlayLouder]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Ace of Spades&quot;, considered to be the definitive Motörhead anthem,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Konow |first=David |title=Bang Your Head |publisher=Three Rivers Press, c2002|isbn=0-609-80732-3 |page=226 has &quot;Motorhead's signature song, Ace of Spades&quot; |year=2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;put a choke on the English music charts and proved to all that a band could succeed without sacrificing its blunt power and speed&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Christe |first=Ian |title=Sound of the Beast |publisher=Allison &amp; Busby |isbn=0-7490-8351-4 |year=2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To coincide with the ''Ace of Spades'' release, [[Big Beat Records (Ace subsidiary)|Big Beat]], who had inherited the Chiswick catalogue, put together four unused tracks from the Escape Studios sessions in 1977 and released them as ''[[Beer Drinkers and Hell Raisers (EP)|Beer Drinkers and Hell Raisers]]'', which reached #43 on the UK Singles Chart in November.&lt;ref name=&quot;RC1&quot;/&gt;

The band had more chart hits in 1981 with the releases ''[[St. Valentine's Day Massacre (EP)|St. Valentine's Day Massacre]]'' EP, their collaboration with Girlschool which reached #5 on the UK Singles Chart in February; the live version of &quot;[[Motorhead (live)|Motorhead]]&quot;, which reached #6 on the UK Singles Chart in July; and the album it was taken from, ''[[No Sleep 'til Hammersmith]]'', which reached #1 on the UK Albums Chart in June. During March 1981, the band had been touring Europe, and in the final week of the month they conducted the &quot;Short Sharp, Pain In The Neck&quot; UK tour from which the recordings for ''No Sleep 'til Hammersmith'' were made.&lt;ref name=&quot;ICGM&quot;/&gt;

From April through to July, the band toured North America for the first time as guests of Blizzard of Ozz, an early incarnation of [[Ozzy Osbourne]]'s band, but were still able to make an appearance on ''Top of the Pops'' on 9 July to promote the live &quot;Motorhead&quot; single. In October the band recorded tracks at BBC's [[Maida Vale]] 4 studio for the [[David Jensen]] show broadcast on 6 October. The band commenced a European tour on 20 November, supported by [[Tank (band)|Tank]], followed by Clarke producing Tank's debut album ''[[Filth Hounds of Hades]]'' at [[Ramport Studios]] in December and January.

Between 26 and 28 January 1982, the band started recording their self-produced new album at Ramport Studios, before moving onto [[Morgan Studios]] to continue the sessions throughout February. On 3 April the single &quot;[[Iron Fist (song)|Iron Fist]]&quot; was released, reaching #29 on the UK Singles Chart, followed by the parent album ''[[Iron Fist (album)|Iron Fist]]'', released on 17 April and peaking at #6 on the UK Albums Chart. They were the last releases to feature the Lemmy, Clarke, Taylor line-up, though the line-up continued to perform in the ''Iron Fist'' UK tour between 17 March and 12 April, and the band's first headling North America tour from 12 May until Clarke's last engagement at the [[Palladium (club)|New York Palladium]] on 14 May.&lt;ref name=&quot;ICGM&quot;/&gt;

===1982–1984&amp;nbsp;– Departures from the band and ''Another Perfect Day''===
Clarke left as a consequence of the band recording ''[[Stand by Your Man (EP)|Stand By Your Man]]'', a [[cover version]] of the [[Tammy Wynette]] classic, in collaboration with [[Wendy O. Williams]] and the [[Plasmatics]]. Clarke felt that the song compromised the band's principles, refused to play on the recording and resigned, later forming his own band, [[Fastway (band)|Fastway]]. Lemmy and Taylor made numerous telephone calls to find a guitarist, including one to [[Brian Robertson]], formerly with [[Thin Lizzy]], who was recording a [[solo album]] in Canada. He agreed to help out and complete the tour with them. Robertson signed a one-album deal resulting in 1983's ''[[Another Perfect Day]]'' and the two singles from it, &quot;[[Shine (Motörhead song)|Shine]]&quot; and &quot;[[I Got Mine (Motörhead song)|I Got Mine]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;RC1&quot;/&gt; In June and July the band played five dates in Japan, and from mid-October until mid-November they toured Europe. From late May until early July, the band conducted the 'Another Perfect Tour', followed by an American tour between July and August, and another European tour in October and November.&lt;ref name=&quot;ICGM&quot;/&gt; Robertson began to cause friction in the band as a result of his on-stage attire, consisting of shorts and ballet shoes, and, furthermore, with his point blank refusal to play the old standards that every Motörhead audience expected to hear. This led to an amicable agreement that Robertson would leave,&lt;ref name=&quot;RC1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imotorhead.com/mhspeaks/99jun20.htm Q &amp; A Session with Lemmy]. ''Motörhead official website''. Retrieved on 11 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt; playing his last engagement with the band at the Berlin Metropol on 11 November.&lt;ref name=&quot;ICGM&quot;/&gt;

After Robertson's departure in 1983, the band were sent tapes from all over the world from potential guitarists. The group returned to the concept of dual lead guitars by hiring unknowns [[Würzel]] and [[Phil Campbell (musician)|Phil Campbell]] (ex-[[Persian Risk]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;RC1&quot;/&gt; In February 1984, the Lemmy, Campbell, Würzel and Taylor line-up recorded &quot;Ace of Spades&quot; for the &quot;[[Bambi (Young Ones episode)|Bambi]]&quot; episode in the [[British television]] series, ''[[The Young Ones (TV series)|The Young Ones]]''. Scenes of the band playing are interspersed with the characters' antics as they rush to the railway station, in a parody of [[The Beatles]]' comedy film ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fortunecity.com/lavendar/hawkslane/231/yo21.html |title=The Young Ones&amp;nbsp;— Bambi |accessdate=10 February 2007 |work=Transcription of the &quot;Young Ones&quot; episode &quot;Bambi&quot; as it aired on American MTV in the mid-'80s}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor quit the band after that recording, causing Lemmy to quip: &quot;Did I leave them or did they leave me?&quot;. Before joining Motörhead, Phil Campbell had met ex-[[Saxon (band)|Saxon]] drummer [[Pete Gill]], and the trio decided to call him to see if he would like to visit London. The try-outs went well and Gill was hired.&lt;ref name=&quot;RC1&quot;/&gt;

===1984–1985&amp;nbsp;– ''No Remorse''===
Bronze Records thought the new line-up would not make the grade and decided to &quot;nail down the lid&quot; on the group with a compilation album. When Lemmy found out, he took over the project, selecting tracks, providing [[Liner notes|sleeve notes]] and insisted that Motörhead record four brand new tracks to go at the end of each side of the album.&lt;ref name=&quot;RC1&quot;/&gt; During the sessions between 19 May and 25 May 1984 at Britannia Row Studios, London, the band recorded six tracks for the single's B-side and the album. The single &quot;[[Killed by Death (single)|Killed by Death]]&quot; was released on 1 September and reached #51 in the UK Singles Chart, the double album ''[[No Remorse (Motörhead album)|No Remorse]]'' was released on 15 September and reached silver disc status, attaining the position of #14 in the UK Album charts.&lt;ref name=&quot;ICGM&quot;/&gt;

The band were involved in a court case with Bronze over the next two years, believing that their releases were not being promoted properly, and the record company banned them from the recording studio.&lt;ref name=&quot;RC1&quot;/&gt; The band looked to more touring for income; [[Australasia|Australia and New Zealand]] in late July to late August, a brief tour of Hungary in September, and the ''No Remorse'' &quot;Death On The Road&quot; tour between 24 October and 7 November. On 26 October the band made a live appearance on the British [[Channel 4]] music programme The Tube, performing &quot;Killed By Death&quot;, &quot;Steal Your Face&quot; (over which the programme's end-credits were played) and the unbroadcast &quot;Overkill&quot;, before going on to their next engagement that evening. From 19 November to 15 December the band toured America with Canadian speed metal band [[Exciter (band)|Exciter]] and Danish Metal band [[Mercyful Fate]] and from 26 December to 30 December performed five shows in Germany.&lt;ref name=&quot;ICGM&quot;/&gt;

On 5 April 1985, ITV broadcast three songs that were recorded after the band went off air on their earlier appearance on ''The Tube'' programme. A week later the band, dressed in tuxedos, played three songs on the live Channel 4 music show ''ECT'' (Extra-Celestial Transmission). To celebrate the band's tenth anniversary, two shows were arranged at [[Hammersmith Odeon]] on 28 June and 29 June, a video of the second show was taken and later released as ''[[The Birthday Party (video)|The Birthday Party]]''. From early June until early August the band were on their 'It Never Gets Dark' tour of Sweden and Norway, an American tour followed in mid-November until late December.&lt;ref name=&quot;ICGM&quot;/&gt;

===1986–1989&amp;nbsp;– ''Orgasmatron'' and ''Rock 'n' Roll''===
From 26 March to 3 April 1986, the band toured Germany, Holland and Denmark on their &quot;Easter Metal Blast&quot; and in June, played two dates in Bologna and Milan in Italy. The court case with Bronze was finally settled in the band's favour. The band's management instigated their own label, [[GWR Records|GWR]].&lt;ref name=&quot;RC1&quot;/&gt; Recording took place in Master Rock Studios, London and the single &quot;[[Deaf Forever]]&quot; was released on 5 July as a taster for the ''[[Orgasmatron (album)|Orgasmatron]]'' album, which was released on 9 August. On the same day as the release of the album, Lemmy and Würzel were interviewed by [[Andy Kershaw]] on the BBC Radio 1 ''Saturday Live'' show and &quot;Orgasmatron&quot; and &quot;Deaf Forever&quot; were played. The single reached #67 and the album reached #21 in the UK charts.

On 16 August, the band played at the [[Monsters of Rock]] at [[Castle Donington]] and was recorded by BBC Radio 1 for a future ''Friday Rock Show'' broadcast. The performance closed with a flyover by a couple of Second World War German aircraft. Also that day Lemmy was filmed giving his views on spoof metal act &quot;Bad News&quot; for inclusion in a [[Peter Richardson (actor)|Peter Richardson]] Comic Strip film entitled &quot;More Bad News&quot; since the band featuring [[Rik Mayall]], Peter Richardson, [[Nigel Planer]] and [[Adrian Edmondson]] were also performing at Donington. In September the band conducted their &quot;Orgasmatron&quot; tour in [[Great Britain]], supported by fledgling act [[Zodiac Mindwarp and the Love Reaction]]. In October they toured America and in December were in Germany.&lt;ref name=&quot;ICGM&quot;/&gt;

In 1987, during the filming of ''[[Eat the Rich (film)|Eat the Rich]]''&amp;nbsp;— in which Lemmy was taking a starring role alongside well-known comedy actors such as [[Robbie Coltrane]], [[Kathy Burke]], the regulars from [[The Comic Strip]] ensemble, and various other musician [[cameo appearance]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092944/ |title= Eat the Rich (1987) |accessdate=2 March 2007 |publisher= [[Internet Movie Database]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;— Gill left the band and Taylor returned to appear in the band's cameo as &quot;In House Club Band&quot; alongside Würzel and Campbell. The band wrote &quot;[[Eat the Rich (Motörhead song)|Eat the Rich]]&quot; especially for the film, its soundtrack featured tracks from ''Orgasmatron'' and Würzel's solo single &quot;Bess&quot;. The band's second album for GWR was ''[[Rock 'n' Roll (Motörhead album)|Rock 'n' Roll]]'', released on 5 September, after a tight work schedule in the studio. While having some popular tracks and using &quot;Eat the Rich&quot; as its second track, the band commented that the album was virtually &quot;nailed together&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;RC1&quot;/&gt;

On 2 July 1988 Motörhead were recorded performing at the Giants of Rock Festival in [[Hämeenlinna]], Finland. The tracks were released as ''[[No Sleep at All]]'' on 15 October. A single from the album was planned with the band wanting &quot;Traitor&quot; as the A-side, but &quot;[[Ace of Spades (live)|Ace of Spades]]&quot; was chosen instead. When the band noticed the change, they refused to allow the single to be distributed to the shops, and it was withdrawn and became available only on the &quot;No Sleep at All&quot; tour and through the ''Motörheadbangers'' fan club. The band again felt unhappy with their career, and a court case with GWR followed, which was not resolved until mid-1990.&lt;ref name=&quot;RC1&quot;/&gt;

===1990–1992&amp;nbsp;– Epic/WTG years: ''1916'' and ''March ör Die''===
With the court case resolved, the band signed to [[Epic Records|Epic/WTG]] and spent the last half of 1990 recording a new album and single in Los Angeles.&lt;ref name=&quot;RC1&quot;/&gt; Just prior to the album sessions the band's former manager, Doug Smith, released the recording of the band's tenth anniversary show, much against the bands wishes, having previously told him that they did not want it released, in 1986. In the studio they recorded four songs with the producer, Ed Stasium, before deciding he had to go. When Lemmy listened to one of the mixes of &quot;Going to Brazil&quot;, he asked for him to turn up four tracks, and on doing so heard [[claves]] and [[tambourine]]s that Stasium had added without their knowledge. Stasium was fired and Pete Solley was hired as producer. The story according to Stasium was that Lemmy's drug and alcohol intake had far exceeded the limitations of Stasium's patience so he quit.&lt;ref&gt;''White Line Fever'', p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt; The single &quot;[[The One to Sing the Blues]]&quot; issued on 5 January 1991, was followed by the album ''[[1916 (album)|1916]]'' in February. The single, which was issued in 7&quot;, cassette, shaped [[Unusual types of gramophone records|picture disc]], 12&quot; and CD single, reached #45 in the UK Singles Chart, the album reached #24 in the UK Album Charts.&lt;ref name=&quot;ICGM&quot;/&gt;

The band conducted their &quot;It Serves You Right&quot; tour of Britain in February, the &quot;Lights Out Over Europe&quot; tour followed, lasting until early April, when the band returned to Britain to play another six venues. In June the band played five dates in Japan and five dates in Australia and New Zealand. Between July and August, they played across the United States with [[Judas Priest]], [[Alice Cooper]] and opener [[Dangerous Toys]] on the 'Operation Rock 'n' Roll' tour. The band finished the year with six dates in Germany during December.&lt;ref name=&quot;MTD&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imotorhead.com/past_tour_dates.cfm |title=Motörhead tour date compendium |accessdate=21 December 2008 |work=[http://www.imotorhead.com/past_tour_dates.cfm?touryear=1991&amp;submit=submit 1991] [http://www.imotorhead.com/past_tour_dates.cfm?touryear=1992&amp;submit=submit 1992] [http://www.imotorhead.com/past_tour_dates.cfm?touryear=1993&amp;submit=submit 1993] [http://www.imotorhead.com/past_tour_dates.cfm?touryear=1994&amp;submit=submit 1994] [http://www.imotorhead.com/past_tour_dates.cfm?touryear=1995&amp;submit=submit 1995] [http://www.imotorhead.com/past_tour_dates.cfm?touryear=1996&amp;submit=submit 1996] [http://www.imotorhead.com/past_tour_dates.cfm?touryear=1997&amp;submit=submit 1997] [http://www.imotorhead.com/past_tour_dates.cfm?touryear=1998&amp;submit=submit 1998] [http://www.imotorhead.com/past_tour_dates.cfm?touryear=1999&amp;submit=submit 1999] [http://www.imotorhead.com/past_tour_dates.cfm?touryear=2000&amp;submit=submit 2000] [http://www.imotorhead.com/past_tour_dates.cfm?touryear=2001&amp;submit=submit 2001] [http://www.imotorhead.com/past_tour_dates.cfm?touryear=2002&amp;submit=submit 2002] [http://www.imotorhead.com/past_tour_dates.cfm?touryear=2003&amp;submit=submit 2003] [http://www.imotorhead.com/past_tour_dates.cfm?touryear=2004&amp;submit=submit 2004] [http://www.imotorhead.com/past_tour_dates.cfm?touryear=2005&amp;submit=submit 2005] [http://www.imotorhead.com/past_tour_dates.cfm?touryear=2006&amp;submit=submit 2006] [http://www.imotorhead.com/past_tour_dates.cfm?touryear=2007&amp;submit=submit 2007] [http://www.imotorhead.com/past_tour_dates.cfm?touryear=2008&amp;submit=submit 2008] Motörhead official site website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 March 1992 the band played what would turn out to be Taylor's last engagement at Irvine Meadows, Irvine, California.&lt;ref name=&quot;MTD&quot;/&gt; The band had been wanting Lemmy to get rid of their manager, Doug Banker, for some time and after an unsolicited visit from Todd Singerman, who insisted he should manage them despite never having managed a band before, the band met with Singerman and decided to take him on board, firing Banker.&lt;ref&gt;''White Line Fever'', p. 247.&lt;/ref&gt; In the midst of this, the band were recording an album at Music Grinder Studios, in the city's east part of Hollywood during the [[1992 Los Angeles riots]]. Three drummers participated in the making of the ''[[March ör Die]]'' album: Phil Taylor, who was fired because he did not learn the drum tracks on the song &quot;I Ain't No Nice Guy&quot;; [[Tommy Aldridge]] who recorded most of the material on the album; and [[Mikkey Dee]], who recorded &quot;[[Hellraiser (song)|Hellraiser]]&quot;, a song originally written by Lemmy for Ozzy Osbourne's ''[[No More Tears]]'' album. The ''March ör Die'' album features guest appearances by Ozzy Osbourne and [[Slash (musician)|Slash]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ICGM&quot;/&gt;

===1993–1994&amp;nbsp;– ''Bastards''===
Lemmy had known Mikkey Dee from the time when [[King Diamond (band)|King Diamond]] had toured with Motörhead. He had asked Dee to become Motörhead's drummer before, but Dee had declined due to his commitment to King Diamond. On this occasion, Dee was available and met the band to try out. Playing the song &quot;Hellraiser&quot; first, Lemmy thought &quot;he was very good immediately. It was obvious that it was going to work.&quot; After recording &quot;Hellraiser&quot; and &quot;Hell on Earth&quot; in the studio,&lt;ref&gt;''White Line Fever'', p. 258.&lt;/ref&gt; Dee's first engagement with Motörhead was on 30 August at the [[Saratoga Performing Arts Center]]. The new line-up then went on tour, playing dates with Ozzy Osbourne, Skew Siskin and [[Exodus (band)|Exodus]]. On 27 September, the band played at the [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum|Los Angeles Coliseum]] with [[Metallica]] and [[Guns N' Roses]]. The band toured Argentina and Brazil during October and conducted the &quot;Bombers and Eagles in '92&quot; tour of Europe with [[Saxon (band)|Saxon]] throughout December.&lt;ref name=&quot;MTD&quot;/&gt;

Motörhead played two dates at the [[Arena Obras Sanitarias]] in [[Buenos Aires]] in April 1993 and toured Europe from early June until early July, returning to the states to play one show at the [[Ritz (rock club)|New York Ritz]] on 14 August.&lt;ref name=&quot;MTD&quot;/&gt; A new producer was sought for the band's next album and eventually [[Howard Benson]], who was to produce the band's next four albums, was chosen. The band recorded at A &amp; M Studios and Prime Time Studios in Hollywood and the resultant album, ''[[Bastards (Motörhead album)|Bastards]]'', was released on 29 November 1993. The single &quot;[[Don't Let Daddy Kiss Me]]&quot; included the song &quot;[[Born to Raise Hell]]&quot; which also appeared on the album and would later be re-recorded with collaborative vocals from both [[Ice T]] and [[Ugly Kid Joe]] frontman, [[Whitfield Crane]] and released as a single in its own right. Although ''Bastards'' received airtime, the record company, ZYX, would not pay for promotional copies, so the band sent out copies themselves.&lt;ref&gt;''White Line Fever'', p. 265.&lt;/ref&gt; A further tour of Europe was made throughout December that year.&lt;ref name=&quot;MTD&quot;/&gt;

In February and March 1994, Motörhead toured the United States with [[Black Sabbath]] and [[Morbid Angel]]. In April the band resumed their tour of the States until early May, playing an engagement with the [[Ramones]] on 14 May at the [[Estadio José Amalfitani|Estadio Velez]] in Buenos Aires,&lt;ref name=&quot;MTD&quot;/&gt; attracting a crowd of 50,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;''White Line Fever'', p. 267.&lt;/ref&gt; The band toured Japan in late May and Europe in June, August and December.&lt;ref name=&quot;MTD&quot;/&gt;

===1994–1995&amp;nbsp;– ''Sacrifice''===
The band's 1995 touring schedule began in Europe in late April. In June, they went on a second tour with Black Sabbath, this time supported by [[Tiamat (band)|Tiamat]], until the band succumbed to influenza and headed back to Los Angeles, to [[Cherokee Studios]] in Hollywood where they were to record an album. During the sessions it became clear that Würzel was not extending himself and left the band after the recording.&lt;ref&gt;''White Line Fever'', pp. 266–269.&lt;/ref&gt; The title track from the album, ''[[Sacrifice (Motörhead album)|Sacrifice]]'', was later used in the movie ''[[Tromeo and Juliet]]'', a film in which Lemmy appears as the narrator. The band decided to continue as a three-man line-up and a tour of Europe was performed throughout October and the first two days of November. A three-day tour of South America followed the week after. Lemmy celebrated his 50th Birthday later that year with the band at the [[Whisky a Go Go|Whiskey A Go Go]] in Los Angeles; [[Metallica]] played at the event under the name &quot;The Lemmy's&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;MTD&quot;/&gt;

In 1996 the band began touring the States in early January and played thirty venues up to 15 February a seven-date tour of Europe in June and July was followed by two engagements in South America during August.

===1996–1997&amp;nbsp;– ''Overnight Sensation''===
A tour of the United States with [[Dio (band)|Dio]] and Speedball began with two shows (Los Angeles &amp; Hollywood) in early October 1996 and concluded in Washington on 4 December.&lt;ref name=&quot;MTD&quot;/&gt; During this time the band had recorded ''[[Overnight Sensation]]'', at Ocean Studio and Track House Recording Studio. The album was released on 15 October, the first official album of the band as a three-piece since ''Another Perfect Day'' and the best distributed album the band had had for years.&lt;ref&gt;''White Line Fever'', pp. 276–277.&lt;/ref&gt; The band concluded the year's touring with thirteen dates in Germany.&lt;ref name=&quot;MTD&quot;/&gt;

During 1997, the band toured extensively, beginning with the first leg of the ''Overnight Sensation'' tour in Europe on 12 January at the [[London Astoria]], where the guest musicians were Todd Campbell, Phil Campbell's son, on &quot;Ace of Spades&quot; and Fast Eddie Clarke for &quot;Overkill&quot;. The European leg lasted until March and was followed by four dates in Japan, from late May to 1 June, and an American tour with [[W.A.S.P. (band)|W.A.S.P.]] throughout the rest of June. In August, three dates in Europe were followed by seven dates in Britain, which ended with a show at the [[Carling Academy Brixton|Brixton Academy]] on 25 October, where the guest musician was Paul Inder, Lemmy's son, for &quot;Ace of Spades&quot;. A further four dates in October in [[Russia]] concluded the year 1997.&lt;ref name=&quot;MTD&quot;/&gt;

===1998–1999&amp;nbsp;– ''Snake Bite Love'' and ''Everything Louder Than Everyone Else''===
Lemmy recalled that the touring was going particularly well, with some countries like Argentina and Japan putting the band in larger venues, and the English promoters discovered that &quot;they could turn a nice profit with Motörhead shows&quot;. In his opinion the three-piece line-up were performing excellently and it was high time they made another live record.&lt;ref&gt;''White Line Fever'', pp. 281–283.&lt;/ref&gt; The band did eventually, but made another studio album first, ''[[Snake Bite Love]]'', recorded in various studios and released on 10 March 1998.

The band joined with Judas Priest at the Los Angeles [[Gibson Amphitheatre|Universal Amphitheatre]] on 3 April, to begin their &quot;Snake Bite Love&quot; tour. On 21 May, Motörhead were recorded at The Docks in Hamburg. The tracks from this performance were later released as ''[[Everything Louder Than Everyone Else]]''. During this tour, [[Jared Allen]] served as a roadie for the band.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/blog/sportscenter/post/_/id/13029/vikings-at-panthers-preview-we-put-you-to-the-test#more |title=blog |publisher=Espn.go.com |date=20 December 2009 |accessdate=15 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band were invited to join the Ozzfest Tour and played dates across the States during early July until early August and were in Europe from early October until late November. The British leg of the tour was dubbed the &quot;No Speak With Forked Tongue&quot; tour and included support bands [[Groop Dogdrill]], Radiator and Psycho Squad, which was fronted by Phil Campbell's son Todd.&lt;ref name=&quot;MTD&quot;/&gt;

===2000–2001&amp;nbsp;– ''We Are Motörhead'' and ''25 &amp; Alive''===
In 1999 Motörhead made a tour of the states between 20 April and 2 June, before going to Karo Studios in [[Brackel]], [[Germany]] to record their next album, ''[[We Are Motörhead]]'', which was released in May the following year. During the time the album sessions took place, the band played at venues around [[Europe]], the first of which was at [[Mediolanum Forum|Fila Forum]] in [[Assago]], near [[Milan]], where Metallica's [[James Hetfield]] joined the band on-stage to play &quot;Overkill&quot;. In October and early November, the band toured the states with [[Nashville Pussy]]. Throughout the rest of November, the band conducted their European &quot;Monsters Of The Millennium&quot; tour with [[Manowar]], Dio and Lion's Share, ending the Millennium with two shows at the London Astoria. The two shows were billed under the ''[[Kerrang!]]'' &quot;X-Fest&quot; banner and at the first show were supported by Backyard Babies and during the second show guest vocals were provided by [[Deborah Dyer|Skin]] from [[Skunk Anansie]] and Nina C. Alice from Skew Siskin for &quot;Born to Raise Hell&quot;, and Ace from Skunk Anansie played &quot;Overkill&quot; with the band.&lt;ref name=&quot;MTD&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Motorhead 25th Anniversary Concert Ticket.jpg|right|thumb|190px|Entrance ticket for the 25th Anniversary concert at the [[Carling Academy Brixton|Brixton Academy]] on 22 October 2000]]
In May 2000, the release of ''We Are Motörhead'' and the single from it, &quot;[[God Save the Queen (Motörhead song)|God Save the Queen]]&quot;, coincided with the start of the band's &quot;We Are Motörhead&quot; tour across South and North America during May and June, with a further nine shows across in Europe in July. Shows in the United States and France were followed by the release of a double-disc compilation album, ''[[The Best Of (Motörhead album)|The Best Of]]'', on 12 September. Four dates in Japan preceded the band's 25th Anniversary concert on 22 October at the Brixton Academy in London, where guest appearances were made by &quot;Fast&quot; Eddie Clarke, [[Brian May]], [[Doro (musician)|Doro Pesch]], [[Whitfield Crane]], Ace, Paul Inder and Todd Campbell. The show also featured the return of the Bomber-lighting rig. The event was filmed and released the following year as the ''[[25 &amp; Alive Boneshaker]]'' DVD, and the CD of the show, ''[[Live at Brixton Academy (Motörhead album)|Live at Brixton Academy]]'', was released two years after that.&lt;ref name=&quot;MTD&quot;/&gt;  Lemmy states the reason for the DVD as wanting &quot;to record it for the posterity or whatever it is. I nodded off through the tenth anniversary, we never did anything on the twentieth, so the twenty-fifth made sense.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;RSM&quot;/&gt;

A tour of West and East Europe followed the anniversary concert, taking the band through October, November and December.&lt;ref name=&quot;MTD&quot;/&gt; The schedule for the Eastern European tour was quite brutal, involving two eighteen-hour drives back-to-back and little time off, at the Warsaw venue the band did not arrive until eleven o'clock and the crew were still loading into the venue at one in the morning, while the fans waited.&lt;ref&gt;''White Line Fever'', pp. 284–285.&lt;/ref&gt;

===2002–2003&amp;nbsp;– ''Hammered''===
After taking a month off, the band began working on a new album at Chuck Reid's house in the [[Hollywood Hills]]. This album, ''[[Hammered (Motörhead album)|Hammered]]'', was released the following year. On 1 April 2001 the band gave a one song performance for [[Triple H]]'s entrance at [[WrestleMania X-Seven]] at the [[Reliant Astrodome]] in Houston. The second leg of the &quot;We Are Motörhead&quot; tour began in May in Ireland, moving across to the United Kingdom. In Manchester, the band were supported by [[Goldblade]], and by [[Pure Rubbish]] at the two London shows. The second London show also included [[Backyard Babies]] and Paul Inder, who was guest musician for &quot;Killed By Death&quot;. Between June and August, Motörhead played at a number of rock festivals in Europe; including as the [[Graspop Metal Meeting]] in [[Belgium]], the [[Quart Festival]] in Norway, and the [[Wacken Open Air]] on 4 August, where four songs were recorded for the ''25 &amp; Alive Boneshaker'' DVD. The band returned to the States for a seven show tour between late September and early October.&lt;ref name=&quot;MTD&quot;/&gt;

In April 2002 a DVD of some of Motörhead's performances from the '70s and '80s along with some stock footage of the band was released as ''[[The Best of Motörhead]]''. Two weeks earlier, the ''Hammered'' album was released and supported by the &quot;Hammered&quot; tour, which kicked off in the States at around the same time. The United States dates continued until late May, and a European leg followed between June and August. In October, the band played five dates in Great Britain with [[Anthrax (band)|Anthrax]], Skew Siskin and Psycho Squad. The final venue was the Wembley Arena in London, where instead of Psycho Squad, the band were supported by Hawkwind, with Lemmy performing &quot;Silver Machine&quot; on stage with them. Throughout the rest of October and better part of November, the band were on a European tour with Anthrax.&lt;ref name=&quot;MTD&quot;/&gt;

In April and May 2003, the band continued to promote the ''Hammered'' album in the States, and on the three dates Phil Campbell had to miss, his mother having died, [[Todd Youth]] stood in for him. Between late May and mid-July the band played seven dates at Summer Festivals in Europe and from late-July until the end of August, they were touring the United States with [[Iron Maiden]] and Dio. On 7 October a comprehensive five-disc collection of the band's recordings covering 1975–2002 was released as ''[[Stone Deaf Forever!]]''. On 1 September 2003, the band returned to Hollywood's Whisky A Go-Go club for the Hollywood Rock Walk Of Fame Induction. During October, the band performed a tour of Great Britain with [[The Wildhearts]] and Young Heart Attack. The band performed seven shows across Belgium, Holland and Spain between 21 October and 28 October and from late-November until early-December they were in Germany and Switzerland, touring with Skew Siskin and [[Mustasch]]. On 9 December, the previously recorded ''Live at Brixton Academy'' album was released.&lt;ref name=&quot;MTD&quot;/&gt;

On 20 August the band played one date at the [[Roseland Ballroom]], New York, as part of &quot;The Volcom Tour 2008&quot;, which continued with bands [[Misfits (band)|The Misfits]], [[Airbourne (band)|Airbourne]], [[Valient Thorr]] and [[Year Long Disaster]] at [[House of Blues]], [[Anaheim, California]] on 2 September, playing a further thirteen dates. The band concluded the tour without the supporting bands, playing one more show at the Roseland Ballroom on 20 September, and the final egagement, at [[The Stone Pony]], [[Asbury Park]], New Jersey on 21 September.

On 30 September, [[Reuters]] reported that Neverdie Studios had signed a deal with Lemmy and Motörhead to develop and market Lemmy's Castle and Motorhead Stadium inside the virtual world of [[Entropia Universe]], an online virtual universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS175107+30-Sep-2008+MW20080930|title=Neverdie Studios Presents The Queen of Sheba; International Siren Cheri London Crosses Virtual World Divide Into|date=30 September 2008|work=[[Reuters]]|publisher=[[Thomson Reuters]]|accessdate=20 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The year's touring ended with a 34-date tour of Europe with a variety of support bands including [[Danko Jones]], [[Saxon (band)|Saxon]], [[Witchcraft (band)|Witchcraft]], and Airbourne.&lt;ref name=&quot;MTD&quot;/&gt; On 6 March 2009, the band played in the Middle East for the first time, at the annual [[Dubai Desert Rock Festival]] in [[Dubai]].

In November 2009, the band are being supported by [[NWOBHM]] veterans [[Sweet Savage]] on the Irish leg of the tour (30 years after first sharing the stage together) and [[punk rock|punk]] and [[goth rock]] legends [[The Damned (band)|The Damned]] on the UK leg of their world tour. On The Damned's official website, [[Captain Sensible]] is quoted as saying:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.officialdamned.com/|title=Tour dates added|publisher=The Damned|accessdate=23 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Ha ha&amp;nbsp;... we're working with Lemmy again are we? Excellent! He's the real deal, the absolute antithesis to all that the likes of Simon Cowell stand for. And for that we should all be grateful. This tour will be a celebration of all things rock 'n' roll&amp;nbsp;... pity the poor roadies is all I can say!&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Gigantour]] has taken place from 26 January to 28 February 2012. Motörhead didn't play the final four shows during this tour, since Lemmy has experienced a combination of a viral upper respiratory infection and a voice strain, resulting in severe [[laryngitis]]. Lemmy types on his Facebook page &quot;''I’m giving my voice a good rest''&quot;, hoping he will recover soon to play at the [[Mayhem Festival]], which will be held from 30 June to 5 August 2012.

He replied, &quot;We have not started writing any songs yet but we will. We put out an album out every two years. I will continue to do that as long as I can afford an amp.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.classicrockrevisited.com/interviewlemmy2012.htm|title=Interview: Lemmy|publisher=Classic Rock Revisited }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Motorhead-01.jpg|thumb|175px|right|[[Lemmy Kilmister|Lemmy]] live in [[Edmonton]], 2005]]

In a biography of the band, senior editor for [[Allmusic]], [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine|Stephen Erlewine]], wrote: &quot;Motörhead's overwhelmingly loud and fast style of heavy metal was one of the most groundbreaking styles the genre had to offer in the late '70s&quot; and though &quot;Motörhead wasn't punk rock&amp;nbsp;... they were the first metal band to harness that energy and, in the process, they created speed metal and thrash metal.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephen Thomas Erlewine|Erlewine, Stephen]] [{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p4965|pure_url=yes}} Biography]. [[Allmusic]]. Retrieved on 11 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Whether they created these genres might be subject to debate, but Motörhead were unquestionably influential.

Lemmy has stated that he generally feels more kinship with punk rockers than with metal bands: Motörhead had engagements with fellow Brits [[The Damned (band)|The Damned]], with whom he played bass on a handful of late 1970s engagements,&lt;ref&gt;see the notes for The Damned's ''Smash It Up&amp;nbsp;— The Anthology 1976–1987''&lt;/ref&gt; as well as having penned the song &quot;[[R.A.M.O.N.E.S.]]&quot; as a tribute to the [[Ramones]]. Motörhead, Lemmy states, have more in common aesthetically with [[The Damned (band)|The Damned]] than [[Black Sabbath]], and nothing whatsoever in common with [[Judas Priest]]. Lemmy says he feels little kinship with the speed metal bands Motörhead have inspired:&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;They've just got the wrong bit. They think that being fast and loud is the whole thing and it isn't. The guitar solos are not really difficult for a guitar player, it's just playing scales. To feel a solo and bend into it &amp; I mean Hendrix is the best guitarist you've ever seen in your life. And he learned from people like [[Buddy Guy]], [[Lightnin' Hopkins]] and people like that inspired Hendrix. To be influenced by something, you're gonna have to play it the same.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earcandymag.com/motorhead.htm|title=''Motorhead Interview with Lemmy 6-20-2000'' Ear Candy interview.|accessdate=6 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''[[NME]]'' stated that their brief solos were just long enough &quot;...&amp;nbsp;to open another bottle of beer&quot;, while a 1977 ''[[Stereo Review]]'' commented that &quot;they know they're like animals, and they don't want to appear any other way. In view of the many ugly frogs in heavy metal who think they are God's gift to womankind these Quasimodos even seem charming in their own way&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;MKM&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mk-magazine.com/interviews/archives/000124.php|work=MK Magazine |title=MK Magazine Interviews: Motorhead|accessdate=26 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Motörhead's approach has not changed drastically over the band's career, though this is a deliberate choice: erstwhile Motörhead drummer [[Phil &quot;Philthy Animal&quot; Taylor]] said that rock icons like [[Chuck Berry]] and [[Little Richard]] never drastically altered their style, and, like them, Motörhead preferred to play what they enjoyed and did best.&lt;ref&gt;see the notes for the 1999 Castle Records reissue of ''Ace of Spades''&lt;/ref&gt; This fondness for the first decade of rock and roll (mid-1950s to mid-1960s) is also reflected in some of Motörhead's occasional cover songs from that era.

===''Motörheadbangers''===
During the 1979 &quot;Bomber&quot; tour of Great Britain, the band met with writer [[Alan Burridge (writer)|Alan Burridge]] who then produced the first 'Motörhead Magazine'. Around the same time, drummer Phil &quot;Philthy Animal&quot; Taylor's sister, Helen Taylor, had started the ''Motörheadbangers'' fan club. Burridge and Taylor worked together to print the latest news for Motörhead fans, the first fanzine was published in January 1980. The ''Motörheadbangers'' fanzine is printed three times a year, and has 3,000 subscribers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imotorhead.com/discography/alan.htm |title=Alan Burridge |accessdate=17 February 2007 |publisher=Motörhead official site website}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Paul Hadwen, who had worked on the &quot;cartoon&quot; style of the early Motörheadbangers fanzines with Chris Harris during Helen Taylor's leadership, and also drew the &quot;comic strip&quot; art included with the &quot;Another Perfect Day&quot; album, died at his home in [[Leeds]] in late July 2007, at age 50.

===WWE===
Motörhead are well known in the professional wrestling community for performing popular wrestler [[Triple H]]'s entrance music, &quot;The Game&quot;, since January 2001 &amp; onward. In addition to the track being heard whenever Triple H appears on ''[[WWE Raw]]'' or ''[[WWE Friday Night SmackDown]]'' and at other pay-per-view wrestling shows, the band have performed the song live at two [[WrestleMania]] events, [[WrestleMania X-Seven]] and [[WrestleMania 21]]. They also provided the entrance music for Triple H's (now defunct) [[Smark|faction]] &quot;[[Evolution (professional wrestling)|Evolution]]&quot; titled &quot;Line in the Sand&quot;. &quot;The Game&quot; was released on both the American version of ''[[Hammered (Motörhead album)|Hammered]]'' album and ''[[WWF The Music, Vol. 5]]'', and the Evolution theme song was released on the ''[[WWE ThemeAddict: The Music, Vol. 6]]'' album. Since then, Motörhead have performed a new track titled &quot;King of Kings&quot;, emphasising Triple H's &quot;King of Kings&quot; character, which made its debut at [[WrestleMania 22]]. Their song &quot;Rock Out&quot; was also used as the theme song of the pay-per-view [[Unforgiven (2008)|Unforgiven]] in 2008.

==Cover art==
The band's name is usually printed in a [[Lower case|lowercase]] form of [[Blackletter#Forms of black letter|blackletter]]. The [[Umlaut (diacritic)|umlaut]] character [[ö]] is possibly derived from the similar &quot;[[heavy metal umlaut]]&quot; in the name of their 1975 acquaintances [[Blue Öyster Cult]]. However, this umlaut does not alter the pronunciation of the band's name. When asked if Germans pronounced the band &quot;Motuuuurhead&quot;, Lemmy answered &quot;No, they don't. I only put it in there to look mean&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thewavemag.com/pagegen.php?pagename=article&amp;articleid=21891 |title=Motorhead Madman |accessdate=12 February 2007 |work=The Wave Magazine |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061216085042/http://www.thewavemag.com/pagegen.php?pagename=article&amp;articleid=21891 |archivedate = 16 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Motorhead.jpg|right|thumb|150px|War-Pig on Motörhead's first album]]
Snaggletooth is the fanged face that serves as the symbol of Motörhead. Artist [[Joe Petagno]] drew it in 1977 for the cover of the band's debut album (with designer [[Phil Smee]] who turned it into a negative and did the [[lettering]] to complete the logo),&lt;ref name=&quot;TheWord&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.wordmagazine.co.uk/content/podcast-with-a-man-whose-records-are-worth-much-your-house-probably|title=Here's a bloke whose record collection may well be worth as much as your house|last=Hepworth|first=David|date=21 January 2010|publisher=[[The Word (magazine)|The Word]] magazine|accessdate=14 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; having met Lemmy while doing some work with Hawkwind.&lt;ref name=&quot;JPI&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imotorhead.com/specialfeatures/petagno.htm |title=Interview with Motörhead Artist Joe Petagno |accessdate=11 February 2007 |work=Motörhead official site website}} Inspiration for War-Pig is also covered in the &quot;About Joe Petagno&quot; interview section on ''[[Inferno (Motörhead album)#30th Anniversary DVD content|Inferno 30th Anniversary edition bonus DVD]]'', SPV69748.&lt;/ref&gt;  Petagno stated; &lt;blockquote&gt;The inspiration came from just being a naturally pissed-off bastard! And Lemmy's the same way! So it was bound to be an alchemal wedding of a more &quot;primordial nature&quot;. I did a lot of research on skull types and found a cross-breed gorilla-wolf-dog combination would work nicely with some oversized boars horns. Lemmy added Helmet, chains, spit, spikes and grit.&lt;ref name=&quot;JPI&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Eddie Clarke was less sure about the imagery to begin with:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I shuddered when I saw it the first time. I thought, &quot;Blimey, this ain't gonna go down that well&quot;, because it was just way over the top, then. But I grew to love it&amp;nbsp;... [At first] it was not scary or horrifying, it would've been, in those days, deemed bad taste.&lt;ref&gt;''About Joe Petagno'', interview section with [[Joe Petagno]], bonus DVD with ''[[Inferno (Motörhead album)#30th Anniversary DVD content|Inferno 30th Anniversary edition]]'' SPV69748.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It has remained a symbol of Motörhead throughout the years, with Petagno creating many variations of War-Pig for the covers of ensuing albums. To date, only two of the original covers for Motörhead's 20 studio albums do not feature any variation of War-Pig on the cover: ''On Parole'' and ''Overnight Sensation'' (of which, ''On Parole'' was never sanctioned by the band, and was in any case reissued with a black War-Pig on a white background. Phil is wearing a War-Pig badge on the cover of ''[[Ace of Spades (album)|Ace of Spades]]''. The cover of &quot;Iron Fist&quot; depicts a metal gauntlet wearing four skull-shaped rings, one of which is War-Pig, while the rear of the album-sleeve shows a fully detailed 3-D metal sculpture of the symbol. Originally the War-Pig design included a swastika on one of the helmet's spikes. This was painted out on later re-releases of the albums on CD.

On 21 September 2007 Petagno announced that &quot;there will be no more &quot;HEADS&quot; from my hand&quot;, citing irreconcilable differences between himself and the band's current management, Singerman Entertainment. Petagno stated:&lt;blockquote&gt;It has been a long, exciting and industrious journey, full of art and intuition, difference in repetition, and creative innovation. I feel I accomplished something unique in Metal history over the last 31 years by breathing life again and again into a figment of my own imagination, an image or better an entity which has taken on a life of its own, which I actually believe goes beyond the music it was created to represent. I'm damn proud of that!&lt;/blockquote&gt; In reply, Lemmy stated:&lt;blockquote&gt;As many of you know, we have been working with Joe Petagno for 31 years. We always treated Joe fairly, and I would like to stress that at no time did my manager demand what Joe thinks he demanded&amp;nbsp;— it is all a colossal misunderstanding. We have always loved his artwork, obviously, and if he now decides to stop working with us, we have no choice but to use someone else. However&amp;nbsp;... if he will not discuss this personally and try to work things out, I think it's a great tragedy. If Joe continues with us, no one would be more delighted than me. If it's goodbye, Joe, I wish you well, but I hope, even at this stage, to be reconciled and continue our association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Motorblog: September 2007 | url=http://alanburridge.blogspot.com/2007/09/motorblog-joe-petagno-lemmys-statement.html | work=Joe Petagno&amp;nbsp;— Lemmy's Statement | publisher=[[Alan Burridge (writer)|Alan Burridge]] blog archive |date = September 2009| accessdate=9 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Filmography==
&lt;!-- Motörhead's film listings can be found at http://imdb.com/name/nm0609611/ and http://www.hollywood.com/celebrity/Motorhead/1142347 --&gt;

* 1988: ''[[Eat the Rich (film)|Eat the Rich]]'': soundtrack includes &quot;Nothing up My Sleeve&quot;, &quot;Built for Speed&quot;, &quot;Orgasmatron&quot;, &quot;Doctor Rock&quot;, &quot;On the Road&quot;, &quot;[[Eat the Rich (Motörhead song)|Eat the Rich]]&quot; and &quot;Bess&quot;&amp;nbsp;– New Line Home Entertainment. Halfway through shooting, the idea of gradually replacing the members of the ballroom band with Motörhead was hit upon. At first there are no Motörhead personnel, then Phil Campbell appears, followed by Würzel and Phil Taylor. The scene involving Lemmy riding a motorcycle is played by a female [[stunt double]] as Lemmy was on tour with Motörhead in America at the time the scene had to be shot.

* 2010: ''[[Lemmy (film)|Lemmy (49% Motherfucker. 51% Son Of A Bitch.)]]'' ([[rockumentary]] film profile of [[Lemmy|Ian &quot;Lemmy&quot; Kilmister]])
