'''Strapping Young Lad''' was a Canadian [[extreme metal]] band formed by [[Devin Townsend]] in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], in 1994. The band started as a one-man studio project; Townsend played most of the instruments on the 1995 debut album, ''[[Heavy as a Really Heavy Thing]]''. By 1997, he had recruited permanent members; this line-up, which consisted of Townsend on vocals and [[Electric guitar|guitar]], [[Jed Simon]] on guitar, [[Byron Stroud]] on [[Bass guitar|bass]], and [[Gene Hoglan]] on drums, lasted until the band's dissolution.

Containing elements of [[death metal]], [[thrash metal]], [[black metal]], [[progressive metal]] and [[industrial metal]], Strapping Young Lad's music was characterized by the use of complex [[time signature]]s, [[polyrhythm]]ic [[riff|guitar riffing]] and drumming, [[blast beat]]s and [[Wall of Sound]] production. The band's musical direction was mainly determined by Townsend, whose battle with [[bipolar disorder]] and dark sense of humour were major influences on his songwriting. Townsend was also noted for his eccentric appearance and on-stage behaviour, which greatly contributed to the band's intense live performances.

The band gained critical success and a growing [[Underground music|underground]] fan base from their 1997 album ''[[City (Strapping Young Lad album)|City]]''. After a hiatus between 1999 and 2002, the band released three more albums, reaching their commercial peak with the 2006 effort, ''[[The New Black]]''. Townsend disbanded Strapping Young Lad in May 2007, announcing his decision to retreat from public view while continuing to record solo albums.

== History ==
=== ''Heavy as a Really Heavy Thing'' and ''City'' (1994–1998) ===
Strapping Young Lad began in 1994 as a solo project of Canadian musician Devin Townsend. Following his work as vocalist on [[Steve Vai]]'s 1993 album ''[[Sex &amp; Religion]]'' and its 1994 tour, Townsend believed he had been a &quot;musical whore&quot;, spending &quot;the first five years of [his] career working at the behest of other people&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Rocca, Jane. &quot;Devin Townsend interview.&quot; ''Loudmouth''. 1997, Iss. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; During a brief stint as touring guitarist for [[The Wildhearts]], Townsend received a phone call from an [[A&amp;R]] representative for [[Roadrunner Records]], expressing an interest in his demos and an intention to sign him. The offer was ultimately rescinded by the head of Roadrunner, who regarded Townsend's recordings as &quot;just noise&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Devin Townsend interviewed by Tony on 3RRR FM, Melbourne&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Devin Townsend interviewed by Tony on 3RRR FM, Melbourne|publisher=The Church of Devin Townsend|url=http://www.axs.com.au/~vk3aaw/devhard1.htm|accessdate=2008-01-31|month=April | year=1997|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071213192716/http://www.axs.com.au/~vk3aaw/devhard1.htm &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt;|archivedate=2007-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; He faced further rejection by [[Relativity Records]], the label behind Vai's ''Sex &amp; Religion'', who saw no commercial appeal in his music.&lt;ref name=&quot;CoC interviews Devin Townsend&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Bracing for Success - CoC interviews Devin Townsend of Strapping Young Lad|publisher=[[Chronicles of Chaos (webzine)|Chronicles of Chaos]]|author=Bromley, Adrian|url=http://www.chroniclesofchaos.com/articles/chats/1-7_strapping_young_lad.aspx|accessdate=2008-01-31|date=1995-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Century Media Records]] subsequently contacted the musician, offering him a contract to &quot;make us some extreme albums&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Devin Townsend interviewed by Tony on 3RRR FM, Melbourne&quot;/&gt; Townsend agreed to a five-album deal with the record label.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Devin Townsend: 'I Don't Have Anything To Say With Strapping Young Lad  Anymore'|publisher=Blabbermouth.net|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=54611|accessdate=2008-01-31|date=2006-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following his tour with The Wildhearts, Townsend began recording and producing his debut album, ''[[Heavy as a Really Heavy Thing]]'', under the moniker Strapping Young Lad. According to Townsend, the recording process took &quot;about a week&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;CoC interviews Devin Townsend&quot;/&gt; Embracing The Wildhearts' [[Anarchism|anarchist]] approach, &quot;while focusing on dissonance and just being as over-the-top as [he] could&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Heavy as a Really Heavy Thing liner notes&quot;&gt;{{cite album-notes|title=Heavy as a Really Heavy Thing (Reissue)|albumlink=Heavy as a Really Heavy Thing|bandname=Strapping Young Lad|year=2006|first=Devin|last=Townsend|format=CD liner|publisher=[[Century Media]]|publisherid=8259|mbid=d7e69864-9aa3-4342-b7b5-6fa57d2e0f07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Townsend sang on the record and performed the majority of its instrumental tracks (with the assistance of a [[drum machine]]).  A few songs, however, featured local [[session musician]]s, including guitarist Jed Simon, Townsend's future band mate.

Released on April 4, 1995, ''Heavy as a Really Heavy Thing'' was not widely recognized in the metal community.

He dismissed the album in the liner notes of the record's 2006 reissue, contending it contained only two great songs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stylus Magazine Review&quot;/&gt; He also deemed its production poor in interviews,&lt;ref name=&quot;MetalEagle Online Magazine Interview&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Strapping Young Lad - Interview with Devin Townsend|author=Vasilakos, Konstantinos|publisher=MetalEagle Online magazine|url=http://www.metaleagle.com/interviews.php?action=show&amp;id=137&amp;PHPSESSID=8993a87adfc69bf4|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080212160039/http://www.metaleagle.com/interviews.php?action=show&amp;id=137&amp;PHPSESSID=8993a87adfc69bf4|archivedate=2008-02-12|accessdate=2008-01-31|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; referring to the album as &quot;basically a collection

Townsend recruited a permanent line-up for the second album: Jed Simon on guitar, [[Byron Stroud]] on bass, and [[Gene Hoglan]] on drums. ''[[City (Strapping Young Lad album)|City]]'' was released on February 11, 1997, and received highly favorable critical reception. ''[[Kerrang!]]'' praised the album for its heaviness, claiming it sounded like &quot;sticking your head into the jet nozzle of a [[Stealth aircraft|Stealth Bomber]]&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Sheils, Liam. &quot;Strapping Young Lad - City&quot;.

The band embarked on a world tour in 1997 to promote the album, which included dates in Europe, the US and Australia. On May 30, 1998, they performed at the [[Dynamo Open Air]] festival in [[Eindhoven]], [[Netherlands]], then continued touring the next month in Europe. In June 1998, the group released ''[[No Sleep 'till Bedtime]]'', a [[live album]] containing songs performed at a 1997 performance at the HiFi Bar and Ballroom in [[Melbourne]], Australia. Century Media was not initially interested in releasing a live record, but impressed with Townsend's production, the label agreed to release it.&lt;ref&gt;Vance, Neil. &quot;The Tape Ran Out.&quot; ''Buzz'' magazine. October 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; The band closed the year playing a few more dates in Japan and Australia.

=== On hiatus (1999–2002) ===
At the end of 1998, Townsend placed Strapping Young Lad on hiatus to concentrate on his solo career and on his work as a record producer. He had already released two solo albums, ''[[Ocean Machine: Biomech]]'' in 1997 and ''[[Infinity (Devin Townsend album)|Infinity]]'' in 1998 and produced several other artists' albums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Strapping Young Lad Official Biography|publisher=[[Century Media]]|url=http://www.centurymedia.com/us/single_artist.php?ID=50|accessdate=2008-01-31|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080101025658/http://www.centurymedia.com/us/single_artist.php?ID=50 |archivedate = January 1, 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Townsend explained numerous conflicts with Century Media, and his struggle with [[bipolar disorder]] (for which he checked himself into a psychiatric hospital in early 1998),&lt;ref name=&quot;Metal Storm interview&quot;/&gt; contributed to the curtailment of Strapping Young Lad's activities:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Reluctant Return of Strapping Young Lad|author=Gramlich, Chris|publisher=''Exclaim!''|url=http://www.exclaim.ca/articles/multiarticlesub.aspx?csid2=4&amp;fid1=1576&amp;csid1=44|accessdate=2008-04-28|month=February | year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;What happened? I signed a shitty deal, but luckily it was non-exclusive. I got tired of doing Strapping so I said, 'I can't do it anymore.' Then I freaked out and went into a hospital. My lawyer said that I was under mental duress when I signed the contract so the contract is void. At that point it was like, 'I just won't do another Strapping record.' Yeah, I went down saying 'CM was the shittiest label ever.' And they went down as saying that I was 'a complete, arrogant psychopath.'&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Townsend remained productive between 1999 and 2002, recording two more solo albums, ''[[Physicist (album)|Physicist]]'' in 2000 and ''[[Terria]]'' in 2001, and producing albums for [[Zimmers Hole]], [[Stuck Mojo]] and [[Soilwork]], among others. Although Strapping Young Lad was officially on hiatus, they gave occasional live performances, including an appearance on the Foot In Mouth Tour in 2001 with [[Fear Factory]]. During this period, Townsend's bandmates were active musically; both Stroud and Hoglan recorded with other bands, and all three were involved in Townsend's solo efforts as studio musicians and as part of his live band as well. Hoglan and Simon also formed a [[side project]] called Tenet with [[Grip Inc.]] bassist Stuart Carruthers and Interzone frontman Rob Urbinati in early 2002.&lt;ref name=&quot;Strapping Young Lad Axeman Rocks Out On Three Fronts&quot;/&gt;

In December 2001 Townsend announced, contrary to his earlier public statements, a new Strapping Young Lad album would be released in 2002. He emphasized he was not &quot;forcing&quot; his product upon fans to generate record sales, arguing his band—and its contract with Century—was never a lucrative endeavor.  Instead, Townsend's motivation was the &quot;creative anger&quot; sparked by the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] and further cultivated during their 2001 tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Strapping Young Lad To Record New Album!|publisher=Blabbermouth.net|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=310|accessdate=2008-01-31|date=2001-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the first time, the album would be a product of collaborative writing; the band wrote &quot;about half&quot; of the material on the 2001 Foot In Mouth Tour, and the rest at home, starting January 2002.&lt;ref name=&quot;Strapping Young Lad Axeman Rocks Out On Three Fronts&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Strapping Young Lad Axeman Rocks Out On Three Fronts|publisher=Blabbermouth.net|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=1003|accessdate=2008-01-31|date=2002-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The World Makes Way - CoC interviews Gene Hoglan of Strapping Young Lad|publisher=Chronicles of Chaos|author=McKay, Aaron|url=http://www.chroniclesofchaos.com/articles/chats/1-595_strapping_young_lad.aspx|accessdate=2008-01-31|date=2003-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; After playing a small number of festivals in 2002, Strapping Young Lad entered the studio in September of that year, to record their third album.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Strapping Young Lad Enter Studio To Record Third CD|publisher=Blabbermouth.net|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=6146|accessdate=2008-01-31|date=2002-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The band embarked on a headlining tour in the United States in April and May 2005, then went on to tour in Europe. Starting at the end of June, they toured North America as part of the [[Sounds of the Underground]] tour, then joined Fear Factory on the Transgression Tour in the U.S. Throughout the tour, Fear Factory bassist Stroud performed with both bands at every concert. Strapping Young Lad concluded the year with a tour in the UK.

=== ''The New Black'', and dissolution (2006–2007) ===
[[Image:Strapping Young Lad 1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Byron Stroud|Stroud]] and [[Devin Townsend|Townsend]] in concert in 2006]]
''[[The New Black]]'', Strapping Young Lad's fifth and final studio album, was released on July 11, 2006. Century Media imposed a strict deadline on the release date of the album; it was to be ready before the 2006 [[Ozzfest]]. Despite this, Townsend stated the recording was not rushed,&lt;ref name=&quot;Blistering.com - Devin Townsend Feature Interview&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Devin Townsend Feature Interview|publisher=[[Blistering]]|author=Donnelly, Justin|url=http://www.blistering.com/fastpage/fpengine.php/link/1/templateid/11975/tempidx/5/menuid/3|accessdate=2008-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The New Black'' became a critical, as well as a commercial, success. It was more melodic than any of the band's previous albums and brought back the debut album's [[tongue-in-cheek]] humor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blistering.com - Devin Townsend Feature Interview&quot;/&gt; Having sold more than 4,000&amp;nbsp;copies during its first week, ''The New Black'' reached #200 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Thom Yorke's No Match For Chamillionaire, Kelly Clarkson In Billboard Race|publisher=MTV|author=Harris, Chris|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1536652/20060719/yorke_thom_radiohead_.jhtml|accessdate=2008-01-31|date=2006-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; #15 on the Top Independent Albums, and #8 on the Top Heatseekers charts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Billboard Artist Chart History&quot;/&gt; [[Stylus Magazine]]'s Cosmo Lee described it as &quot;heavy, catchy, and with no filler&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Stylus Magazine Review&quot;/&gt; and [[About.com]]'s Chad Bowar was also positive, stating that &quot;this is a CD that's dense and heavy, but also has some memorable hooks&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Strapping Young Lad - The New Black Review|publisher=[[About.com]]|author=Bowar, Chad|url=http://heavymetal.about.com/od/cdreviews/gr/strappingyoungl.htm|accessdate=2008-01-31|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A music video was shot in late May to accompany the sole single from the album, &quot;Wrong Side&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Strapping Young Lad To Film 'Wrong Side' Video; Extras Needed|publisher=Blabbermouth.net|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=52756|accessdate=2008-01-31|date=2006-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2006 Strapping Young Lad embarked on a short festival tour of Europe, including performances at the [[Rock am Ring]] and Rock im Park festivals in Germany and the [[Download Festival]] in England, which was followed by a second stage appearance at Ozzfest in July and August, where they played to some of their largest audiences in their career.

In an interview conducted by ''[[Terrorizer (magazine)|Terrorizer]]'' in August 2006, Townsend explained why he decided to put the band on hold:&lt;ref&gt;''[[Terrorizer (magazine)|Terrorizer]]''. August 17, 2006, Vol. 147.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;At the end of the day, man, I'm just tired, and old, and bald, and fat, and grouchy, and bored. You know? So I was just like, I'm going to make this record, and do this stupid Ozzfest thing, and tell a bunch of stupid jokes in front of a lot of people at Download, then I'm just going to fuck off for a while. The bigger this gets, the less I care, to the point where I just need to go spend some time with my family. I don't wanna bastardise Strapping and all these other projects by doing it for the money. Strapping was about the big middle finger, and it still is, but I don't think it needs to go any further than this.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Although Hoglan initially denied the definitive break-up of the band, saying they would go on tour in March 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Strapping Young Lad Drummer Outlines Band's Future Plans|publisher=Blabbermouth.net|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=55588|accessdate=2008-01-31|date=2006-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; he later stated Strapping Young Lad is on &quot;extended hiatus&quot;, and might never reunite again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gene Hoglan: Strapping Young Lad Is On 'Extended Hiatus'|publisher=Blabbermouth.net|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=61410|accessdate=2008-01-31|date=2006-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2007, during a press conference held to promote his new solo album, ''[[Ziltoid the Omniscient]]'', Townsend announced his plans to retreat from public view, including giving interviews and touring, to concentrate on his family, and producing solo albums, as well as other people's music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Devin Townsend Says Strapping Young Lad Is Over For Good|publisher=Blabbermouth.net|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=72298|accessdate=2008-01-31|date=2007-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Strapping Young Lad were effectively disbanded. Townsend discussed his future projects in a May 2007 ''Metal Hammer'' interview, where he stated &quot;there may be some stuff I do in the future that is as brutal and heavy as Strapping, it's just not going to be Strapping&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Why no more Strapping Young Lad?|publisher=''Metal Hammer''|url=http://www.metalhammer.co.uk/news/?id=46602|accessdate=2008-01-31|date=2007-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The remastered 10th anniversary edition of ''City'' was released on June 7, 2007, in similar vein to the 2006 remaster of ''Heavy as a Really Heavy Thing'', with bonus tracks and extended liner notes by Townsend. A career spanning [[Greatest hits|best of album]], entitled ''[[1994–2006 Chaos Years]]'', was released on March 31, 2008, with a bonus DVD of live performances and all of the band's music videos.

=== Influences ===
Strapping Young Lad drew influence from a wide range of music genres, most prominently, but not exclusively, [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]].

=== Lyrical themes ===
{{Listen

|description=&quot;Far Beyond Metal&quot; from ''The New Black'' is a parody of [[traditional heavy metal]]. The song had been in the band's live repertoire since 1997, with lyrics changing practically every performance.}}

Townsend was the band's primary songwriter.  While the first two albums were solely his work, subsequent albums featured a minority of &quot;riffs, lyrical ideas, and song titles&quot; by his band mates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview with Gene Hoglan of Strapping Young Lad|publisher=Metal-Rules.com|author=Hawkins, Chris|url=http://metal-rules.com/interviews/SYL-2003.htm|accessdate=2008-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the brutality of Strapping Young Lad's music, their songs contain hints of [[tongue-in-cheek]] humor and self-parody. Frequently, Townsend's lyrics approached serious personal or political issues with a morbid sense of humor. He has likened the band's sense of silliness to that of [[&quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Chain D.L.K. interview&quot;/&gt; Townsend's lyrical influences covered a wide range of themes, including [[war]]fare,&lt;ref name=&quot;Metal Storm interview&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Strapping Young Lad interview|author=Justin|publisher=Metal Storm|url=http://www.metalstorm.ee/forum/topic.php?topic_id=1807|accessdate=2008-01-31|date=2003-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; mathematical theorems,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Devin Townsend interview|publisher=TheMegalith.com|author=Yakimow, Dan; Mitchell, Jay|url=http://www.themegalith.com/interviews/devintownsend.php|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20051211133326/http://www.themegalith.com/interviews/devintownsend.php|archivedate=2005-12-11|accessdate=2008-01-31|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; and movies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Interview With Gene Hoglan&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview With Gene Hoglan|publisher=Metal-Rules.com|author=Cowie, Sean|url=http://www.metal-rules.com/zine/content/view/167/62/|accessdate=2008-01-31|date=2005-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also used the technique of [[cross-referencing]], repeating lines from his own works, such as older Strapping Young Lad, or solo material.&lt;ref name=&quot;Interview With Gene Hoglan&quot;/&gt;

== Live performances ==
[[Image:Devin Townsend (cropped).jpg|thumb|179px|right|Townsend's unique &quot;[[Mullet (haircut)#Skullet|Skullet]]&quot; hairstyle and aggressive stage persona have made him &quot;one of the more memorable faces&quot; in the metal community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nothing shy about this Strapping Young Lad|publisher=''[[Great Falls Tribune]]''|author=Douglas, Pat|url=http://www.greatfallstribune.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050629/LIFESTYLE/506290305|date=2005-06-29|accessdate=2007-12-25}} {{dead link| date=June 2010 | bot=DASHBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Strapping Young Lad was known for its energetic live performances, mostly owing to the [[Eccentricity (behavior)|eccentric]] appearance and persona of Devin Townsend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Coroner's Report: Black, Death, Thrash, Metalcore, Grindcore|publisher=KNAC|author=Atkinson, Peter|url=http://www.knac.com/article.asp?ArticleID=3629|date=2005-05-02|accessdate=2007-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Strapping Young Lad|publisher=''Decibel'' magazine|author=Stewart-Panko, Kevin|url=http://decibelmagazine.com/features/apr2005/strapping_young_lad.aspx|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20051129012439/http://decibelmagazine.com/features/apr2005/strapping_young_lad.aspx|archivedate=2005-11-29|month=April | year=2005|accessdate=2007-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adrian Begrand of [[PopMatters]] wrote &quot;Nobody in metal today has the same kind of commanding stage presence as the self-professed Bald Bastard, Devin Townsend&quot;, and called Strapping Young Lad &quot;one of the best live bands around&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;PopMatters - The New Black review&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Strapping Young Lad: The New Black review|publisher=PopMatters|author=Begrand, Adrien|url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/review/strapping-young-lad-the-new-black|date=2006-08-28|accessdate=2007-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Townsend was famous for his on-stage antics; he integrated his ironic and tongue-in-cheek humor into live shows and interacted heavily with the audience. He would deliver comical, and often insulting remarks to them,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fear Factory/Strapping Young Lad/Soilwork/Darkane Live In Vancouver: December 5, 2005|publisher=Metal-Rules.com|url=http://www.metal-rules.com/zine/content/view/457/64/|date=2006-01-06|accessdate=2008-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; organize [[circle pit]]s,&lt;ref name=&quot;PopMatters - The New Black review&quot;/&gt; and parody heavy metal clichés as well as the genre itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Three-Finger Dio Salutes for Everybody! - Strapping Young Lad with Malevolence and Camel Clutch, live review|publisher=''Drop-D'' magazine|author=Gawle, Darren|url=http://dropd.com/issue/51/StrappingYoungLad/|date=1997-04-19|accessdate=2008-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The band's humorous approach was also evidenced by a song frequently performed live from 1997, entitled &quot;Far Beyond Metal&quot;, a parody of classic heavy metal. It became a live staple and a fan favorite, with lyrics changing practically every performance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blistering.com - Devin Townsend Feature Interview&quot;/&gt; Although it was recorded live on ''No Sleep 'till Bedtime'', and on the ''For Those Aboot to Rock'' DVD, a studio version was not recorded until 2006 during ''The New Black'' sessions. The band was also sarcastic about their own Canadian heritage, they used &quot;[[Blame Canada]]&quot;, a comedic anti-Canada song from ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer &amp; Uncut]]'' as [[Introduction (music)|intro music]] at many concerts in 2003 and 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Concert Reviews - Strapping Young Lad, Daysend and Tourettes|publisher=[[Blistering]]|author=Truong, Kev|url=http://www.blistering.com/fastpage/fpengine.php/link/1/templateid/5453/tempidx/5009/menuid/5|year=2003|accessdate=2008-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Heart of Steel: Concert Reviews|publisher=Metal-Rules.com|url=http://metal-rules.com/concerts/ThreeStrappingHeavils-Feb2004.htm|year=2004|accessdate=2008-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For a period of time, Strapping Young Lad also played Townsend's solo material live. In 1998, after the release of ''Infinity'', they began performing both Strapping Young Lad and Townsend's solo songs, as two separate sets. It was not until the 2003 release of ''[[Accelerated Evolution]]'' when Townsend formed a separate band, called [[The Devin Townsend Band]], to act as his full-fledged solo band.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Devin Townsend Band Biography|publisher=[[Hevydevy Records]]|url=http://www.hevydevy.com/hdr_biography.html|accessdate=2008-01-31|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080118124925/http://www.hevydevy.com/hdr_biography.html |archivedate = January 18, 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;
