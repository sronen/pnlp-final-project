'''Maynard James Keenan''' (born '''James Herbert Keenan'''; April 17, 1964)&lt;ref name=McAlley-86/&gt; is an American [[rock music|rock]] singer, songwriter, musician, record producer, winemaker, and actor. Originally from [[Ohio]], Keenan spent his high school and college years in [[Michigan]]. After serving in the [[United States Army|Army]] in the early 1980s, he attended [[Kendall College of Art and Design]] in [[Grand Rapids, Michigan|Grand Rapids]]. He moved to [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], [[California]] in 1988 to pursue a career in interior design and set construction. He formed the band [[Tool (band)|Tool]] with [[Adam Jones (musician)|Adam Jones]] shortly thereafter.

Keenan is best known as the lead singer of the [[Music recording sales certification|multi-platinum]] rock bands [[Tool (band)|Tool]] and [[A Perfect Circle]] with whom he has released four&lt;!-- Opiate is not a studio album, it's an EP. --&gt; [[studio album]]s, respectively. In 2003 he created [[Puscifer]] as a side project, financing and releasing its first studio album in October 2007. Since rising to fame, Keenan has been a noted recluse, although he does emerge to support charitable causes.

In addition to his music career, he has performed improvisational stand-up comedy and ventured into acting. He is the current owner of Merkin Vineyards and the associated winery, [[Caduceus Cellars]], and has part ownership of Stronghold Vineyards, all located in [[Arizona]], where he lives. Among other business ventures, he is a partner in the Los Angeles restaurant Cobras &amp; Matadors, and owns a [[Farmers' market|produce market]] and an [[Organic food|organic]] market in [[Cornville, Arizona]], the latter featuring a tasting room for his wines as well as a food court.

==Early life==
[[Image:Mjk-usma.jpg|230px|thumb|left|Keenan's photo in a [[United States Military Academy Preparatory School|US Military Academy Prep School]] yearbook (class of 1984).|alt=A man with his head turned left smiles slightly as his photograph is taken.]]

James Keenan was born in [[Ravenna, Ohio|Ravenna]], Ohio, on April 17, 1964, the only child of Judith Marie and Michael Loren Keenan. He was born into a Baptist family. When his parents divorced in 1968, his father, a high school teacher, moved to [[Michigan]] and Keenan would only see him about once a year for the next 12 years. His mother remarried, bringing Keenan into an &quot;intolerant and unworldly household,&quot; where his intelligence and creative expression would be stifled.&lt;ref name=McAlley-86&gt;McAlley, p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; When Keenan was 11, his mother suffered a paralyzing [[cerebral aneurysm]], which would later serve as the inspiration for many of his creative works.&lt;ref name=McAlley-88&gt;McAlley, p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; A few years later, she persuaded Keenan to live with his father in Michigan. Keenan considers this &quot;the best move [he] ever made.&quot;&lt;ref name=McAlley-86/&gt;

Inspired by [[Bill Murray]]'s performance in the 1981 comedy film ''[[Stripes (film)|Stripes]]'', Keenan joined the [[United States Army]], with the intention of having the [[G.I. Bill]] fund his dream of attending [[art school]].&lt;ref name=McAlley-86/&gt; By this point, he had lived in Ohio, Michigan, [[New Jersey]], [[New York]], [[Oklahoma]], [[Kansas]], and [[Texas]].&lt;ref name=&quot;TSDNbio&quot;&gt;{{cite web

Tool signed to [[Zoo Entertainment (record label)|Zoo Entertainment]] in November 1991 and released the ''[[Opiate (EP)|Opiate]]'' EP the following year. To support this release, the band toured with [[Fishbone]] and [[Rage Against the Machine]]. 

Shortly thereafter, Tool released their 1993 debut album, ''[[Undertow (Tool album)|Undertow]]'', in the United States. It was certified gold after just eight months, and platinum less than a year later.&lt;ref name=GPC&gt;{{cite web

In October 1996, the band released their second studio album, ''[[Ænima]]''. The album was certified gold in ten weeks, achieved double platinum in ten months,&lt;ref name=GPC/&gt; and won the [[Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance]] in 1998.&lt;ref name=Grammy/&gt; After the release of the album, Tool began a prolonged legal battle with their label, [[Volcano Records]] (formerly Zoo Records), over contract violations.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; the members of Tool decided to take some time off. During the hiatus, the band members were outspokenly critical of [[peer-to-peer file sharing]] networks, due to the negative financial impact on artists dependent on success in record sales. During an interview with ''[[NY Rock]]'' in 2000, Keenan stated, &quot;I think there are a lot of other industries out there that might deserve being destroyed.

The [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] they formed, A Perfect Circle, began performing in 1999 and released its first album ''[[Mer de Noms]]'' in 2000. They released a successful follow-up in 2003 titled ''[[Thirteenth Step]]'', a reference to [[twelve-step program]]s (many of the songs were written from the perspective of recovery).&lt;ref name=legend/&gt; Both albums were eventually certified platinum. Their subsequent 2004 album, ''[[Emotive (album)|eMOTIVe]]'', was primarily composed of covers, except for the singles &quot;[[Counting Bodies Like Sheep to the Rhythm of the War Drums]]&quot;—a song inspired by &quot;Pet&quot; that was originally released on ''Thirteenth Step''—and &quot;Passive&quot;. Keenan later characterized the record as a political album with which he &quot;tested the waters&quot; and was subsequently &quot;crucified&quot; for it because of the content.&lt;ref name=AV/&gt; It was certified gold the month after its release. That same year they released the DVD and CD set entitled ''[[aMotion|aMOTION]]'', which was certified platinum within a month of its release.

Despite its success, the future of A Perfect Circle remains uncertain. It is currently on hiatus, partly due to Keenan's commitments to Tool; Howerdel reported in a May 2006 interview with MTV that the supergroup's work was concluded for the time being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

{{quote|The real problem with running Tool and A Perfect Circle at the same time was they both operate the same way.

It's tough for a guy who went from being a guitar tech [for Tool] to being in a band with a pretentious, famous singer and having to live in that shadow. It was important for Billy to go and do his own thing and really explore his own sound and let people hear what he has to say and how he would do it on his own, and then we'll get back and do some A Perfect Circle stuff.|Maynard James Keenan|''[[Revolver (magazine)|Revolver]], December 2007''&lt;ref name=&quot;revolver&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

No.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;McAlley-88&quot;/&gt; A year later, on December 9, 2008, [[blabbermouth.net]] reported that Keenan had announced on The Pulse of Radio that he and Howerdel have been writing new music for A Perfect Circle. Keenan also said that the band has no plans to resume full-scale touring, or even to write and record a new album. Instead, they will focus on &quot;one or two songs at a time&quot;, which will most likely be released via the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

On August 2, 2010, a seemingly official (but not &quot;verified&quot;) [[Twitter]] account for the band was launched with a tweet reading: &quot;It's on.&quot; The tweet also linked to the Twitter accounts of Keenan, Howerdel and Puscifer.

{{Main|Puscifer}}
In 2003, Keenan surfaced under the name &quot;Puscifer&quot; for the song &quot;REV 22:20&quot; on the ''[[Underworld (soundtrack)|Underworld]]'' film soundtrack. Puscifer was once advertised as a side project with [[Danny Lohner]], who had formerly performed live with [[Nine Inch Nails]], but has since been formed as a manifestation of Keenan's &quot;creative subconscious&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 2006, Puscifer contributed the song &quot;The Undertaker (Renholder Mix)&quot; to the [[Underworld: Evolution: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack|soundtrack]] of ''[[Underworld: Evolution]]'', where &quot;Renholder&quot;, a moniker for Danny Lohner created by the members of A Perfect Circle, is the reversal of &quot;Re: D Lohner&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Writing and performance style===
A primary purpose of Keenan's lyrics for Tool involves a desire to connect with the listeners on a personal level; to encourage them to look within themselves for self-identity, understanding and reflection.&lt;ref name=&quot;diCarlo&quot;/&gt; Tool does not include lyrics with any releases as Keenan believes most people &quot;don't get it&quot; and it is not a priority of the band that people do.&lt;ref name=&quot;livewire&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

==Comedy and acting==

Keenan became friends with comedian [[Bill Hicks]] in the early 1990s. Keenan did sketch comedy on [[Improvisational comedy|improv]] nights in comedy clubs in Los Angeles during that time.&lt;ref name=Comedy&gt;{{cite web

  | accessdate = April 14, 2008
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two became acquainted and Hicks later [[opening act|opened]] some Tool concerts. Best known is a [[Comedy routine|routine]] Hicks did while on tour with Tool during the [[Lollapalooza]] tour in 1993, when he asked the audience to look for a [[contact lens]] he had lost. Keenan repeated this joke on a number of occasions.

Keenan is featured in several segments of ''[[Mr. Show]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; most notably in the [[Ronnie Dobbs]] sketch presented in the first season. In one scene, he is seen being arrested with Dobbs. Later in the sketch he is featured wearing a wig as the lead singer of the then-fictitious band &quot;[[Puscifer]]&quot;. When asked about the arrest of Dobbs, Keenan replies &quot;Guilty? Yeah. I'm sure he's guilty but... he ''knows'' it. I mean, you're guilty, and you don't know it. So... who's really in jail?&quot; He also appears in episode 2.6, &quot;The Velveteen Touch of a Dandy Fop&quot;, as one of the viewers of ''Coupon: The Movie'', saying &quot;Now is not the time&quot;, waving the cameras off and slapping the microphone out of his face in disgust after walking out of the theater. Later, Keenan would sing on a track for the ''Mr. Show'' incarnation ''[[Run Ronnie Run]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

When asked in an interview which role was more difficult, Keenan responded, &quot;Oh, Manson. He’s a real person. People know what he looks like, how he talked. With Satan there’s so much gray area.&quot;&lt;ref name=Blender/&gt;

In the mid-90s, responding to requests for Tool to perform in benefit shows, Keenan created &quot;Free [[Frances Bean]]&quot; tee-shirts to represent his own platform. Frances' mother, [[Courtney Love]], had previously referred to Keenan as a &quot;media whore&quot; to which he responded, &quot;Isn't that great? I have the distinction of being called a media whore by Courtney Love.&quot;&lt;ref name=legend/&gt; He said that after watching &quot;the tornado that is her mother&quot;, he thought &quot;Oh my God, how is Frances Bean gonna survive this insanity?&quot;&lt;ref name=legend/&gt; Although it was started as a simple joke, the t-shirts were soon in high demand and Keenan was giving them away.&lt;ref name=legend/&gt;

On April 1, 2005, the official Tool website announced, as an [[April Fools' Day]] prank, that &quot;Maynard has found Jesus&quot; and would be abandoning the recording of the new album temporarily and possibly permanently.&lt;ref name=mtv&gt;{{cite news

Keenan made his major feature film debut in the April 17, 2009, release of ''[[Crank: High Voltage]]''. Sharing a scene with the movie's lead, [[Jason Statham]], Keenan portrays a dog walker &quot;who has an electrifying experience [...] in a public park&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
