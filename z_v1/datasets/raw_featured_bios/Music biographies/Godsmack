'''Godsmack''' is an American [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band from [[Lawrence, Massachusetts]], formed in 1995. The band is composed of founder, frontman and songwriter [[Sully Erna]], guitarist [[Tony Rombola]], bassist [[Robbie Merrill]], and drummer [[Shannon Larkin]]. Since its formation, Godsmack has released five studio albums, one [[Extended play|EP]], four DVDs, and one [[greatest hits]] collection.

The band has had three consecutive number one albums (''[[Faceless]]'', ''[[IV (Godsmack album)|IV]]'', and ''[[The Oracle (Godsmack album)|The Oracle]]'') on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. The band also has parked a ratified 19 top ten rock radio hits, including 15 songs in the Top Five, a record number of top ten singles by a rock artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS159480+14-Sep-2009+BW20090914 |title=Universal Republic Rockers Godsmack Lock Down Another No. 1 Single with 'Whiskey Hangover' | work=Reuters |accessdate=September 14, 2009 |last= |first= |date=September 14, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its inception, Godsmack has toured on [[Ozzfest]] on more than one occasion, and has toured with many other large tours and festivals, including supporting its albums with its own arena tours. Godsmack has sold over 20 million records in just over a decade, yet despite the decline of album sales in recent years, they have proven to be one of the highest-grossing artists in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.prefixmag.com/media/godsmack/cryin-like-a-bitch-live-on-leno-video/40114/|title=Cryin like a bitch live on Leno video|date=May 3, 2010|publisher=Jay Leno show 'official'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
=== Formation and early works (1995–97) ===
In February 1995, [[Sully Erna]] decided to start a new band as the lead singer after playing the drums for more than 23 years, including more than two years in the now-defunct band Strip Mind.&lt;ref name=&quot;Godsmack biography&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.godsmack.com/bio/bio.asp |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070930171134/http://www.godsmack.com/bio/bio.asp |archivedate= September 30, 2007 |title=Godsmack – Bio |accessdate=October 10, 2007 |last= |first=|date=|publisher=Godsmack.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; His new band, The Scam, formed with Erna on vocals, [[Robbie Merrill]] on bass, local guitarist and friend Lee Richards on guitar, and [[Tommy Stewart]] on drums. The Scam quickly changed its name to Godsmack, after recording one demo.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rolling Stone with Sully&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Scaggs, Austin |date=May 6, 2003 |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/godsmack/articles/story/5936304/sully_awakes |title=Sully Awakes |publisher=''Rolling Stone'' |accessdate=December 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The newly formed band started playing small bars in their hometown of [[Boston, Mass.]] Locally popular songs such as &quot;[[Keep Away (song)|Keep Away]]&quot; and &quot;[[Whatever (Godsmack song)|Whatever]]&quot; soon brought them to the top of the hit charts in the Boston/New England area.&lt;ref name=&quot;Godsmack biography&quot;/&gt;

The band's name, according to Merrill in the ''[[Smack This!]]'' DVD, was taken from the [[Alice in Chains]]' song &quot;God Smack&quot;. However, Erna stated in a 1999 interview, &quot;I was making fun of somebody who had a [[cold sore]] on his lip and the next day I had one myself and somebody said, It looks like God smacked your face for making fun. The name stuck and they went by Godsmack from then on. We were aware of the [[Alice in Chains]] song but didn't really think much about it. It's a cool song and the name had meaning for us.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nyrock.com/interviews/1999/godsmack_int.asp |title=Sully Erna of Godsmack on Karma, Christians and the Law of Three (NY Rock) |accessdate=October 10, 2007 |first=Gabriella |date=October 1, 1999 |publisher=Nyrock.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1996, [[Tony Rombola]] and Joe D'Arco joined Godsmack as the guitarist and drummer, after Richards had left upon learning he had a six-year-old child and Stewart had left due to personal differences.&lt;ref name=&quot;Richards leaving stuff&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Seaver, Morley |url=http://www.rocknworld.com/morley/06/Godsmack.shtml |title=MorleyView Interview with Shannon Larkin of Godsmack |publisher=MorleyView |accessdate=December 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, the band entered the studio for the first time, recording its first CD titled ''[[All Wound Up (album)|All Wound Up]]''. The CD was recorded in just three days for $2,600.&lt;ref name=&quot;Godsmack biography&quot;/&gt;

For the next two years, the band played throughout the Boston area. Eventually Godsmack's CD landed in the hands of Rocko, the night-time DJ for Boston radio station [[WAAF (FM)]]. The radio station put &quot;Keep Away&quot; into heavy rotation and the song rose to the number one spot at the station very quickly.&lt;ref name=&quot;Godsmack biography&quot;/&gt; Newbury Comics, a New England record store chain, agreed to sell the CD on consignment. Shortly after the success of &quot;Keep Away&quot;, Godsmack went back into the studio and recorded a single titled &quot;Whatever&quot;, which became the new local favorite on WAAF (FM).&lt;ref name=&quot;Godsmack biography&quot;/&gt;

In an interview [[Sully Erna]] stated, &quot;We had been selling maybe 50 copies a month at the time WAAF picked up the album. All of a sudden we started moving over a thousand records a week. It was insane. Even crazier, I was doing all this from my bedroom. After years of grinding away, things finally started taking off&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.barrystickets.com/concert-tickets/godsmack-tickets.php |title=Godsmack biography – Barrystickets |accessdate=January 2, 2008 |publisher=barrystickets.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Godsmack'' (1998–99) ===
In mid-1998, [[Universal Records|Universal]]/[[Republic Records]] signed the band to their label. Joe D'Arco was dismissed from the band. He was replaced by former drummer [[Tommy Stewart]], who returned after expressing a desire to be in the band again.&lt;ref name=&quot;Drummer switch&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?Mode=Archive&amp;Date=8/13/2002 |title=Godsmack's Sully Erna Speaks out on drummer switch |publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]] |date=August 13, 2002 |accessdate=December 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band's first studio recording ''All Wound Up'' was re-mastered, and the finished self-titled debut CD album ''[[Godsmack (album)|Godsmack]]'' was released to the public six weeks later. This led to the band's first headlining tour, &quot;The Godsmack Tour&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Godsmack biography&quot;/&gt;
After the album's release the band went on the road playing club shows as well as playing at [[Ozzfest]] and [[Woodstock 1999|Woodstock '99]]. This was followed by a tour in [[Europe]] supporting [[Black Sabbath]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Godsmack biography&quot;/&gt;  Roxanne Blanford from Allmusic gave the album three out of five stars, stating,  &quot;Godsmack confidently brought metal into the technological age&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r373845|pure_url=yes}}|title=Godsmack – self-titled review |accessdate=November 9, 2007 |last=Blanford |first=Roxanne |date= |publisher=Allmusic }}&lt;/ref&gt; The album entered the ''[[Billboard 200]]'' at number twenty-two,&lt;ref name=&quot;Billboard&quot;&gt;{{cite web

The album sold well despite being initially pulled from the shelves in some stores due to concerns over some of its [[Lyrics|lyrical]] content.&lt;ref name=&quot;Godsmack lyrics cause controversy&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title=Godsmack Lyrics and Biography |url=http://www.musicianguide.com/biographies/1608002718/Godsmack.html| accessdate=November 10, 2007| last=Schwalboski |first=Ann M|publisher=Musician guide }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The band and its [[record label]] later added a [[Parental Advisory]] sticker to the album, and some stores ordered amended copies of the album. Erna commented in ''Rolling Stone'' magazine stating, &quot;Our record has been in the marketplace for more than a year now without a parental advisory sticker and this is the one and only complaint&amp;nbsp;... Stickers and lyrics are by nature subjective&amp;nbsp;... We have decided to put a sticker on the record&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Godsmack lyrics cause controversy&quot;/&gt; This controversy did not appear to adversely affect album sales but, according to Erna, helped, &quot;It's almost taunting kids to go out and get the record to see what we're saying on it&quot;.

=== ''Awake '' (2000–02) ===

|format=[[Ogg]]}}

In 2000, Godsmack returned to the studio after the multi-platinum success of ''[[Godsmack (album)|Godsmack]]'' to start recording ''[[Awake (Godsmack album)|Awake]]''. The album was released on {{Nowrap|October 31}}, 2000. The album debuted at number five on the ''Billboard 200'', and has been certified 2x platinum by the RIAA.&lt;ref name=&quot;Billboard&quot;/&gt; &quot;[[Vampires (song)|Vampires]]&quot;, a song on the album, also earned the band a [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance|Best Rock Instrumental Performance]] in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rockonthenet.com/archive/2002/grammys.htm |title=Rock On The Net: 44th Annual Grammy Awards – 2002 |publisher=Rock on the Net |accessdate=October 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
With the release of ''Awake'', Godsmack toured Europe supporting [[Limp Bizkit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://godsmack.com/tour/tour.asp?catID=12414 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070816090445/http://godsmack.com/tour/tour.asp?catID=12414 |archivedate=August 16, 2007 |title=Godsmack – Tour 2001 |publisher=Godsmack.com |accessdate=November 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Erna said at the time, &quot;we've been touring nonstop since August 1998, So most of ''Awake'' was written on tour while we were ping-ponging between America and Europe, building up the band. &quot;[[Ozzfest]]&quot; was actually the only big tour where we rode under someone else's wings; we did a lot of work on our own&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.msopr.com/?q=node/450 |title=Godsmack |accessdate=May 7, 2008 |last= |first= |date= |publisher=Mitch Schneider Organization }}&lt;/ref&gt; The band played Ozzfest in 2000 again as they had in 1999.&lt;ref name=&quot;allmusic&quot;/&gt;

Two of the songs on the album were used in United States Navy commercials (&quot;[[Sick of Life]]&quot; and &quot;[[Awake (Godsmack song)|Awake]]&quot;) as background music. Erna stated, &quot;Someone in the military is a fan, and they asked if they could use the music, and we accepted&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=51830 |title=Godsmack Frontman Gets Defensive Over Band's Alleged 'Pro-Military' Stance |accessdate=November 10, 2007 |first=Arthur |date=May 4, 2006 |publisher=Arthur Magazine }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Erna insists that Godsmack does not support any war stating; &quot;By no means has this band ever supported any war for any country or that we support government decisions or why we're sticking our nose in other people's business at times. What we support is our troops. And the women and men that go over there—or anywhere—to fight for our country and our lives and protect our freedom and I feel that.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ArthurMag&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arthurmag.com/magpie/?p=1244 |title=Talking to Godsmack (Whose Album is No. 1 on the charts) about what they use their music for.|accessdate= |last= |first= |date=May 6, 2006 |publisher=ArthurMag.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Sully has said in an interview that the girl on the cover of ''Godsmack'', their first album, is the girl in the ''Greed'' music video.

In 2002, Erna was asked to write and perform a song for the soundtrack to ''[[The Scorpion King]]''. The motion picture was the third in the ''[[The Mummy (franchise)|Mummy]]'' saga, and was a spin-off prequel of the ''Mummy'' series. The song Godsmack wrote and performed was titled &quot;[[I Stand Alone (song)|I Stand Alone]]&quot; and became the number 1 single at Rock Radio and the most played Active Rock song in 2002 for 14 weeks straight. It was also used in the game [[Prince of Persia: Warrior Within]].

''[[Faceless]]'' debuted at number one on the ''[[Billboard 200]]'', selling 269,000 copies in its first week,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=11391 |title=Godsmack: 'Faceless' Debut At #1 |Blabbermouth.Net |accessdate=December 10, 2008 |last= |first= |date=April 16, 2003 |publisher=Blabbermouth.Net}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the album would go on to sell over one million copies in the United States. ''Faceless'' managed to beat West Coast [[nu metal]] rival [[Linkin Park]], with the release of their second studio album ''[[Meteora]]'', which dropped to number two on the ''Billboard 200''. ''Faceless'' also debuted at number nine on the Top Canadian Albums and at number one on the Top Internet Albums and remained at that position for two weeks. A massive Tour of America and Europe supporting Metallica followed.

The lead single &quot;[[Straight Out of Line]]&quot; received a [[Grammy Award]] nomination for &quot;Best Hard Rock Performance&quot;. The award went to [[Evanescence]]'s single &quot;[[Bring Me to Life]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.grammy.com/GRAMMY_Awards/Winners/Results.aspx?title=&amp;winner=godsmack&amp;year=0&amp;genreID=0&amp;hp=1 |title=Grammy Award Winners |accessdate=November 10, 2007 |publisher=Grammy.com |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071202144238/http://www.grammy.com/GRAMMY_Awards/Winners/Results.aspx?title=&amp;amp;winner=godsmack&amp;amp;year=0&amp;amp;genreID=0&amp;amp;hp=1 &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt; |archivedate=December 2, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The album got its name after a swimming-pool incident, retold by Larkin; &quot;Sully and I were standing up for one more jump, we're both there buck-naked, and I look over to the left and there's some woman who had just opened the blinds standing there with her mouth wide open&quot;. Erna added, &quot;She was just waking up, we go, 'Sorry', and then boom, right into the pool. The next thing we know the cops are banging on the door, and that's sort of the point of calling the record ''Faceless''&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/bands/g/godsmack/news_feature_030418/index2.jhtml |title=Godsmack: Unpolished, Uncompromised

On March 16, 2004 ''[[The Other Side (Godsmack album)|The Other Side]]'', an [[acoustic guitar|acoustic]] [[Extended play|EP]], was released. The album debuted at number five on the ''Billboard 200''; this is a relatively high position for an acoustic EP.&lt;ref name=&quot;Billboard&quot;/&gt; It included several previously released songs re-recorded as acoustic versions, as well as three new acoustic tracks.

On April 25, 2006, Godsmack released its fourth studio album simply titled ''[[IV (Godsmack album)|IV]]'', followed by a tour that would continue until August 2007, titled &quot;The IV tour&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Godsmack tour '07 |publisher=Godsmack – 2007 Tour archive|url=http://www.godsmack.com/tour/tour.asp?catID=29109|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071011030539/http://www.godsmack.com/tour/tour.asp?catID=29109|archivedate=October 11, 2007|accessdate=November 8, 2007|publisher=Godsmack.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The album was produced by Erna and engineered by the well known producer and engineer [[Andy Johns]], known for engineering [[Led Zeppelin]]'s ''[[Led Zeppelin&amp;nbsp;IV]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Interview with Larkin&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://entertainment-news-network-archive.blogspot.com/2006/06/interview-shannon-larkin-of-godsmack.html  |title=Interview: Shannon Larkin of Godsmack |accessdate=November 10, 2007 |last=Fuoco |first=Christina |date=June 23, 2006 |publisher=Entertainment News }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first single from the album, &quot;[[Speak (Godsmack song)|Speak]]&quot; was released on {{Nowrap|February 14}}, 2006. The album debuted at number one on the ''Billboard 200'', selling 211,000 copies in its first week.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bands on demand – Godsmack&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ugo.com/channels/music/features/bandsondemand/artist.aspx?artist=godsmack&amp;cat=alternative&amp;full=Godsmack |title=Ugo – Bands on demand – Godsmack |accessdate=November 10, 2007 |publisher=Ugo }}&lt;/ref&gt;
''IV'' has since been certified gold. The band had written over forty songs for the album, but the final track listing had eleven tracks, Larkin commented, &quot;it's Sully's band and his vision. He sifted through all the music and picked the songs that he wanted on the album. We all said 'all right'. He's always had the vision of everything Godsmack from the artwork to the production to the engineer to the studio to what TV shows we play. Everything. When it comes time to pick the songs it's all Sully&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Larkin interview&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://heavymetal.about.com/od/interviews/a/godsmackintie.htm |title=A Conversation with Drummer Shannon Larkin |accessdate=November 10, 2007 |last=Bowar |first=Chad |publisher=Heavy metal about }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The album's minimalist name &quot;IV&quot; derives not only from its being the band's fourth studio album, but also from a running piece of backstage humor, as related by Larkin and Erna:

The album was originally intended to be a boxed set, but the band scrapped the plans so they could release a best of album. Godsmack will follow the release of the album with an acoustic tour.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greatest hits was originally intended to be a boxed set.&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=82111 |title=Blabbermouth.net – Godsmack Looking Back at 'Good Times, Bad Times' In November |accessdate=October 10, 2007 |date=October 4, 2007 |publisher=Blabbermouth.net }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite rumors of the band going on hiatus as a result of releasing a greatest hits album, Erna was quoted as saying, &quot;we're not going away, we are just gonna take a break and enjoy our 10th year anniversary and kind of recharge our batteries. And then Godsmack will be back, and we will come back bigger and badder than ever.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Greatest hits was originally intended to be a boxed set.&quot;/&gt;

=== ''The Oracle'' (2008-present) ===

Erna had this to say about the early sound album, &quot;It's gonna be really heavy. I mean, it's very aggressive. I'm not really sure; it's very premature right now. Right now we just finished one track for the Crüe Fest this Summer. But as far as the whole record goes, I think it's going to be a lot more in your face. I don't think there's going to be any 'Voodoo's or 'Serenity's on this one. We decided to go balls out!&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/Blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=120646|title=Godsmack Working On 'Really Heavy' New Album |accessdate= |last= |first= |date=May 27, 2009 |publisher=Blabbermouth.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- DO NOT ADD A SECTION ABOUT ALICE IN CHAINS TO GODSMACK COMPARISONS! --&gt;
The band's primary influences include [[Aerosmith]], particularly, as well as others such as [[Alice in Chains]], [[Black Sabbath]], [[Led Zeppelin]], [[Pantera]], [[Metallica]] and [[Rush (band)|Rush]] according to Erna, Larkin, and Rombola.&lt;ref name=&quot;Interview with Larkin&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Interview with Rombola&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gibson.com/Whatsnew/pressrelease/2000/nov30a.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070930180834/http://www.gibson.com/Whatsnew/pressrelease/2000/nov30a.html |archivedate=September 30, 2007 |title=Exclusive: Tony Rombola of Godsmack|accessdate=November 10, 2007 |last=Sharken |first=Lisa |date=November 20, 2000 |publisher=Gibson.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newhampshire.com/nh-people/sully-erna-biography.aspx |title=New Hampshire People – Sully Erna/Godsmack |accessdate=November 9, 2007 |last= |first= |date= |publisher=New Hampshire People.com |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071005100622/http://www.newhampshire.com/nh-people/sully-erna-biography.aspx &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt; |archivedate=October 5, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Erna has cited Staley as his primary influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1453568/20020423/alice_in_chains.jhtml |title=MTV.com – &quot;'He Got Me To Start Singing': Artists Remember Layne Staley&quot; |accessdate=November 8, 2007 |last=D'Angelo; Vineyard; Wiederhorn |first=Joe; Jennifer; Jon |date=April 22, 2002 |publisher=MTV.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; The overall sound of the band's first two albums sound similar to the sound of the Alice in Chains album [[Dirt (Alice in Chains album)|''Dirt'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.subvulture.com/archive/082.html |title=Subvulture.com – Godsmack|accessdate=November 8, 2007 |publisher=Subvulture.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, Godsmack has attempted to distance themselves from the Alice in Chains comparison with Erna stating in an interview with Matt Ashare, &quot;I've just never really heard that in our music&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Ashare, Matt |url=http://www.portlandphoenix.com/music/other_stories/documents/03666221.asp |title=Soft cell The other side of Godsmack |publisher=Portlandphoenix.com |accessdate=January 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; On their more industrial songs Godsmack seems to have taken a influence from [[White Zombie (band)|White Zombie]], also covering their song &quot;[[Thunder Kiss '65]]&quot;.

''Rolling Stone Magazine'' describes the band as &quot;hard as nails and cranked to eleven&quot;, while Alternative Press praised the band for its &quot;churning, riff-driven hybrid of all that is heavy, past and present&quot;.

The band's music is often compared to [[Alice in Chains]] which the band cites as an influence.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pop matters review&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Godsmack – The Other Side |author=Begrand, Adrien |publisher=Popmatters.com |date=March 16, 2006 |url=http://www.popmatters.com/music/reviews/g/godsmack-otherside.shtml |accessdate=November 17, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Faceless – Amazon&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Editorial Reviews |author=Turman, Katherine |publisher=[[Amazon.com]] |date= |url=http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00008J2DQ |accessdate=November 17, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adrien Begrand of ''Popmatters'' states, &quot;Erna perfectly mimics the late Layne Staley's low, guttural, sinister singing and snarly, metal-inspired growls&quot; -Erna's vocals also seem to be reminiscent of [[Metallica]]'s [[James Hetfield]]- and, &quot;The band's music is a faithful retread of [[Jerry Cantrell]]'s churning, tuned-down hard rock&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pop matters review&quot;/&gt; Katherine Turman of [[Amazon.com]] states the band has &quot;dark, swirling, commanding music&quot;. She also commented on the band's third album ''Faceless'', which &quot;mixes arena rock in the vein of an Alice in Chains&quot;, &quot;riff-heavy, layered tunes and sharp, confident bridge-burning lyrics&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Faceless – Amazon&quot;/&gt;
