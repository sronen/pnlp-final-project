'''Pearl Jam''' is an American [[Rock music|rock]] band that formed in [[Seattle]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], in 1990. Since its inception, the band's line-up has included [[Eddie Vedder]] (vocals), [[Stone Gossard]] (guitar), [[Jeff Ament]] (bass), and [[Mike McCready]] (guitar). The band's current drummer is [[Matt Cameron]], also of [[Soundgarden]], who has been with the band since 1998.

Formed after the demise of Gossard and Ament's previous band, [[Mother Love Bone]], Pearl Jam broke into the mainstream with its debut album, ''[[Ten (Pearl Jam album)|Ten]]''. One of the key bands of the [[grunge]] movement in the early 1990s, Pearl Jam was criticized early on as being a corporate cash-in on the [[alternative rock]] explosion; however, Gossard and Ament had been members of seminal grunge band [[Green River (band)|Green River]]. Over the course of the band's career, its members became noted for their refusal to adhere to traditional music industry practices, including refusing to make music videos and engaging in a much-publicised boycott of [[Ticketmaster]]. In 2006, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' described the band as having &quot;spent much of the past decade deliberately tearing apart their own fame.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;secondcoming&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last = Hiatt | first = Brian | url = http://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/pearl_jam_the_second_coming | title = The Second Coming of Pearl Jam | work = Rolling Stone | date = June 16, 2006 | accessdate = June 22, 2007|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070528041642/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/pearl_jam_the_second_coming |archivedate = May 28, 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Formation: 1984–1990===
Stone Gossard and Jeff Ament were members of pioneering grunge band [[Green River (band)|Green River]] during the mid-1980s. Green River toured and recorded to moderate success but disbanded in 1987 due to a stylistic division between the pair and bandmates [[Mark Arm]] and [[Steve Turner (guitarist)|Steve Turner]].&lt;ref&gt;Azerrad, Michael. ''[[Our Band Could Be Your Life]]''. Little Brown and Company, 2001. ISBN 0-316-78753-1, pg. 422&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1987, Gossard and Ament began playing with [[Malfunkshun]] vocalist [[Andrew Wood (singer)|Andrew Wood]], eventually organizing the band [[Mother Love Bone]]. In 1988 and 1989, the band recorded and toured to increasing interest and found the support of the [[PolyGram]] record label, which signed the band in early 1989. Mother Love Bone's debut album, ''[[Apple (album)|Apple]]'', was released in July 1990, four months after Wood died of a [[heroin]] [[Drug overdose|overdose]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Friend | first = Lonn M. | url = http://web.stargate.net/soundgarden/articles/rip_7-92.shtml | title = Heroes... and Heroin | work = [[RIP (magazine)|RIP]] | year = 1992 | month = July | accessdate = June 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ament and Gossard were devastated by the death of Wood and the resulting demise of Mother Love Bone. Gossard spent his time afterwards writing material that was harder-edged than what he had been doing previously.&lt;ref name=&quot;crowe&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last = Crowe | first = Cameron | url = http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/10560431/five_against_the_world | title = Five Against the World | work = Rolling Stone | date = October 28, 1993 | accessdate = June 23, 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070619084803/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/10560431/five_against_the_world |archivedate = June 19, 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a few months, Gossard started practicing with fellow Seattle guitarist Mike McCready, whose band, Shadow, had broken up; McCready in turn encouraged Gossard to reconnect with Ament.&lt;ref name=&quot;secondcoming&quot; /&gt; After practicing for a while, the trio sent out a five-song demo tape in order to find a singer and a drummer. They gave former [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] drummer [[Jack Irons]] the demo to see if he would be interested in joining the band and to distribute the demo to anyone he felt might fit the lead vocal position.&lt;ref name=&quot;crowe&quot; /&gt;

Irons passed on the invitation, but sent the demo to a friend from [[San Diego]] named [[Eddie Vedder]]. Vedder was the lead vocalist for a local band called [[Bad Radio]] and worked at a gas station during the day. He listened to the tape shortly before going surfing, where lyrics came to him. He then recorded the vocals to three of the songs (&quot;[[Alive (Pearl Jam song)|Alive]]&quot;, &quot;[[Once (Pearl Jam song)|Once]]&quot;, and &quot;Footsteps&quot;) in what he later described as a &quot;mini-opera&quot; entitled ''Momma-Son''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Pearl Jam Twenty |last=Pearl Jam |year= 2011 |isbn= 978-1848874930 |page= 39 |accessdate= 9 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vedder sent the tape with his vocals back to the three Seattle musicians, who were impressed enough to fly Vedder out to Seattle for an audition. Within a week, Vedder had joined the band.&lt;ref name=&quot;crowe&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wall, Mick. &quot;Alive&quot;. ''Nirvana and the Story of Grunge''. ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'' p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Clay | first = Jennifer | url = http://www.fivehorizons.com/archive/articles/rip1291.shtml | month = December | year = 1991 | title = Life After Love Bone | work = RIP | accessdate = June 23, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid 1990 [[Chris Cornell]] approached Wood's former bandmates, Stone Gossard and Jeff Ament with two songs that he had written in tribute to Andrew Wood with the intention of releasing the songs as a single. Ament described the collaboration as &quot;a really good thing at the time&quot; for him and Gossard that put them into a &quot;band situation where we could play and make music.&quot; The band's lineup was completed by the addition of Soundgarden (and later Pearl Jam) drummer Matt Cameron and future Pearl Jam lead guitarist Mike McCready and [[Eddie Vedder]] providing backing vocals on several songs as well as a duet with Chris Cornell on &quot;[[Hunger Strike (song)|Hunger Strike]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fivehorizons.com/archive/articles/radio041491.shtml |title=Archive, Articles |publisher=Five Horizons |date= |accessdate=2011-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; They named themselves Temple of the Dog, a reference to a line in the lyrics of the Mother Love Bone song, &quot;Man of Golden Words&quot;. The two songs would eventually be crafted into their self titled and only album ''[[Temple of the Dog (album)|Temple of the Dog]]'' released April 16, 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/#/artist/temple-of-the-dog/bio/22528 |title=Temple of the Dog Bio |publisher=Billboard.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the addition of [[Dave Krusen]] on drums, the band took the name [[Mookie Blaylock]], in reference to the then-active All-Star basketball player. The band played its first official show at the Off Ramp Café in Seattle on October 22, 1990,&lt;ref name=&quot;timeline&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pearljam.com/timeline/ | title=Pearl Jam: Timeline | accessdate=June 27, 2007 | publisher=Pearljam.com |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080109033804/http://www.pearljam.com/timeline/ |archivedate = January 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and soon signed to [[Epic Records]]. However, concerns about trademark issues necessitated a name change; the band's name became &quot;Pearl Jam&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Erlewine&quot; /&gt; In an early promotional interview, Vedder said that the name &quot;Pearl Jam&quot; was a reference to his great-grandmother Pearl, who was married to a Native American and had a special recipe for [[peyote]]-laced jam.&lt;ref name=&quot;rhrn&quot;&gt;Neely, Kim. &quot;Right Here, Right Now&quot;. ''Rolling Stone''. October 31, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2006 ''Rolling Stone'' cover story however, Vedder admitted that this story was &quot;total bullshit&quot;, even though he indeed had a great-grandma named Pearl. Ament and McCready explained that Ament came up with &quot;pearl&quot;, and that the band later settled on &quot;Pearl Jam&quot; after attending a concert by [[Neil Young]], in which he extended his songs as improvisations of 15–20 minutes in length, a practice known as [[Jam session|jamming]].&lt;ref name=&quot;secondcoming&quot; /&gt;

=== ''Ten'' and the grunge explosion: 1991–1992 ===
Pearl Jam entered Seattle's [[London Bridge Studio]]s in March 1991 to record its debut album, ''[[Ten (Pearl Jam album)|Ten]]''&lt;ref name=&quot;blackdays&quot;&gt;. Pearlman, Nina. &quot;Black Days&quot;. ''[[Guitar World]]''. December 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; McCready said that &quot;''Ten'' was mostly Stone and Jeff; me and Eddie were along for the ride at that time.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;tenpast&quot;&gt;Weisbard, Eric, et al. &quot;Ten Past Ten&quot;. [[Spin (magazine)|''Spin'']]. August 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Krusen left the band in May 1991 after checking himself into rehabilitation;&lt;ref&gt;Greene, Jo-Ann. &quot;Pearl Jam and the Secret History of Seattle Part 2.&quot; ''[[Goldmine (magazine)|Goldmine]]''. August 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; he was replaced by [[Matt Chamberlain]], who had previously played with [[Edie Brickell &amp; New Bohemians]]. After playing only a handful of shows, one of which was filmed for the &quot;Alive&quot; video, Chamberlain left to join the ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' band.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://pearljamhistory.no.sapo.pt/PJArticles_Interviews_12-xx-93_-_modern_drummer.htm | title=Dave Abbruzzese of Pearl Jam | accessdate=July 1, 2007 | author=Peiken, Matt | work=[[Modern Drummer]] | date=1993-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chamberlain suggested [[Dave Abbruzzese]] as his replacement. Abbruzzese joined the group and played the rest of Pearl Jam's live shows supporting ''Ten''.

Released on August 27, 1991, ''Ten'' (named after Mookie Blaylock's jersey number)&lt;ref name=&quot;rhrn&quot; /&gt; contained eleven tracks dealing with dark subjects like depression, suicide, loneliness, and murder. ''Ten''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s musical style, influenced by classic rock, combined an &quot;expansive harmonic vocabulary&quot; with an anthemic sound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r14978|pure_url=yes}} | title=Ten &gt; Review | accessdate=July 3, 2007 | author=Huey, Steve | publisher=Allmusic}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album was slow to sell, but by the second half of 1992 it became a breakthrough success, being certified gold and reaching number two on the ''Billboard'' charts.&lt;ref name=&quot;blackdays&quot; /&gt; ''Ten'' produced the hit singles &quot;[[Alive (Pearl Jam song)|Alive]]&quot;, &quot;[[Even Flow]]&quot;, and &quot;[[Jeremy (song)|Jeremy]]&quot;. Originally interpreted as an anthem by many,&lt;ref name=&quot;crowe&quot; /&gt; Vedder later revealed that &quot;Alive&quot; tells the semi-biographical tale of a son discovering that his father is actually his stepfather, while his mother’s grief turns her to sexually embrace her son, who strongly resembles the biological father.&lt;ref name=&quot;crowe&quot; /&gt; The song &quot;Jeremy&quot; ({{Audio|Jeremy.ogg|sample}}) and its accompanying video were inspired by a true story in which a high school student shot himself in front of his classmates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sshep.com/jeremynew.htm | title=Richardson Teen-ager Kills Himself in Front of Classmates | accessdate=June 27, 2007 | author=Miller, Bobbi | work=[[The Dallas Morning News]] | date=January 8, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ten'' stayed on the ''Billboard'' charts for more than two years, and has gone on to become one of the highest-selling rock records ever, going [[RIAA certification|13x platinum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

With the success of ''Ten'', Pearl Jam became a key member of the Seattle grunge explosion, along with [[Alice in Chains]], [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], and [[Soundgarden]]. The band was criticized in the music press; British music magazine ''[[NME]]'' said that Pearl Jam was &quot;trying to steal money from young alternative kids' pockets.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, Jeff. &quot;New Power Generation&quot;. ''Guitar World: Nirvana and the Seattle Sound''. 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; Nirvana's [[Kurt Cobain]] angrily attacked Pearl Jam, claiming the band were commercial [[selling out|sellouts]],&lt;ref name=&quot;combain sellouts&quot;&gt;Al &amp; Cake. &quot;An interview with...Kurt Cobain&quot;. ''[[Flipside (fanzine)|Flipside]]''. May/June 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; and argued ''Ten'' was not a true alternative album because it had so many prominent guitar leads.&lt;ref name=&quot;blackdays&quot; /&gt; Cobain later reconciled with Vedder, and they reportedly were on amicable terms before Cobain's death in 1994.&lt;ref name=&quot;secondcoming&quot;/&gt;

Pearl Jam [[Ten Tour|toured]] relentlessly in support of ''Ten''. Ament stated that &quot;essentially ''Ten'' was just an excuse to tour,&quot; adding, &quot;We told the record company, 'We know we can be a great band, so let's just get the opportunity to get out and play.'&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Coryat, Karl. &quot;Godfather of the 'G' Word&quot;. ''Bass Player'' magazine. April 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; The band's manager, Kelly Curtis, stated, &quot;Once people came and saw them live, this lightbulb would go on. Doing their first tour, you kind of knew it was happening and there was no stopping it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;tenpast&quot;/&gt; Early on in Pearl Jam's career, the band became known for its intense live performances. Looking back at this time, Vedder said that &quot;playing music and then getting a shot at making a record and at having an audience and stuff, it's just like an untamed force...But it didn't come from jock mentality. It came from just being let out of the gates.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Hiatt | first = Brian | url = http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/10611546/eddie_vedders_embarrassing_tale_naked_in_public/2 | title = Eddie Vedder's Embarrassing Tale: Naked in Public | work = Rolling Stone | date = June 20, 2006 | accessdate = March 3, 2009 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080620071621/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/10611546/eddie_vedders_embarrassing_tale_naked_in_public/2 |archivedate = June 20, 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, Pearl Jam made television appearances on ''Saturday Night Live'' and ''[[MTV Unplugged]]'' and took a slot on that summer's [[Lollapalooza]] tour with the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]], [[Soundgarden]], and [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]], among others. The band contributed two songs to the [[Singles (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] of the 1992 [[Cameron Crowe]] film ''[[Singles (1992 film)|Singles]]'': &quot;[[State of Love and Trust]]&quot; and &quot;[[Breath (Pearl Jam song)|Breath]]&quot;. Ament, Gossard and Vedder appeared in ''Singles'' under the name &quot;Citizen Dick&quot;; their parts were filmed when Pearl Jam was known as Mookie Blaylock.

=== Dealing with success: 1993–1995 ===
The band members grew uncomfortable with their success, with much of the burden of Pearl Jam's popularity falling on frontman Vedder.&lt;ref name=&quot;crowe&quot; /&gt; While Pearl Jam received four awards at the 1993 [[MTV Video Music Awards]] for its video for &quot;Jeremy&quot;, including [[MTV Video Music Award for Video of the Year|Video of the Year]] and [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Group Video|Best Group Video]], the band refused to make a video for &quot;[[Black (Pearl Jam song)|Black]]&quot; in spite of pressure by the label. This action began a trend of the band refusing to make videos for its songs, despite it being common knowledge that music videos were one of the most vital sales tools any band had in its arsenal. However, Vedder felt that the concept of music videos robbed the listener from creating their own interpretation of the song stating that &quot;Before music videos first came out, you’d listen to a song with headphones on, sitting in a beanbag chair with your eyes closed, and you’d come up with your own visions, these things that came from within. Then all of a sudden, sometimes even the very first time you heard a song, it was with these visual images attached, and it robbed you of any form of self-expression.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Neely, Kim. Five Against One: The Pearl Jam Story. &quot;The Lost 'Jeremy' Video. pp. 109-113. New York, NY. Penguin Books.&lt;/ref&gt;
&quot;Ten years from now,&quot; Ament said, &quot;I don't want people to remember our songs as videos.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;crowe&quot; /&gt;

Pearl Jam headed into the studio in early 1993 facing the challenge of following up the commercial success of its debut. McCready said, &quot;The band was blown up pretty big and everything was pretty crazy.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;totalguitar&quot;&gt;&quot;Interview with Stone Gossard and Mike McCready&quot;.

[[CMJ]]. July 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; The members declined to produce any more music videos after the massive success of &quot;Jeremy&quot; and opted for fewer interviews and television appearances. Industry insiders compared Pearl Jam's tour that year to the touring habits of [[Led Zeppelin]], in that the band &quot;ignored the press and took its music directly to the fans.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;DeRogatis, Jim. ''Milk It!: Collected Musings on the Alternative Music Explosion of the 90s''. Cambridge: Da Capo, 2003. ISBN 0-306-81271-1, pg. 58&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Vs.

By 1994, Pearl Jam was &quot;fighting on all fronts&quot;, as its manager described the band at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;DeRogatis1&quot;&gt;DeRogatis, pg. 60&lt;/ref&gt; Pearl Jam was outraged when, after it played a pair of shows in Chicago, [[Illinois]], it discovered that ticket vendor [[Ticketmaster]] had added a service charge to the tickets. The [[United States Department of Justice]] was investigating the company's practices at the time and asked the band to create a memorandum of its experiences with the company.

Pearl Jam wrote and recorded while touring behind ''Vs.'' and the majority of the tracks for its next album, ''Vitalogy'', were recorded during breaks on the tour. Tensions within the band had dramatically increased by this time. Producer [[Brendan O'Brien (music producer)|Brendan O'Brien]] said, &quot;''Vitalogy'' was a little strained. I'm being polite—there was some imploding going on.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;tenpast&quot;/&gt; After Pearl Jam finished the recording of ''Vitalogy'', drummer Dave Abbruzzese was fired. The band cited political differences between Abbruzzese and the other members; for example, Abbruzzese disagreed with the Ticketmaster boycott.&lt;ref name=&quot;tenpast&quot;/&gt; He was replaced by Jack Irons, a close friend of Vedder and the former and original drummer of the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]]. Irons made his debut with the band at Neil Young's 1994 [[Bridge School Benefit]], but he was not officially announced as the band's new drummer until its 1995 ''Self-Pollution'' satellite radio broadcast, a four-and-a-half hour long pirate broadcast out of Seattle which was available to any radio stations that wanted to carry it.&lt;ref&gt;Gaar, Gillian G. &quot;Radio Free Vedder&quot;. ''Rolling Stone''. February 23, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Vitalogy'' was released first on November 22, 1994 on vinyl and then two weeks later on December 6, 1994 on CD and cassette. The CD became the second-fastest-selling in history, with more than 877,000 units sold in its first week.&lt;ref name=&quot;timeline&quot;/&gt; [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] of Allmusic said that &quot;thanks to its stripped-down, lean production, ''Vitalogy'' stands as Pearl Jam's most original and uncompromising album.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Erlewine | first = Stephen Thomas | url = {{Allmusic|class=album|id=r207150|pure_url=yes}} | title = ''Vitalogy'' &gt; Review | work = Allmusic | accessdate = April 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the songs on the album appear to be based around the pressures of fame.&lt;ref&gt;Weisel, Al. &quot;Pearl Jam: Vitalogy&quot;. ''Rolling Stone''. December 15, 1994. p. 91–92.&lt;/ref&gt; The song &quot;[[Spin the Black Circle]]&quot;, an homage to vinyl records, won a [[Grammy Award]] in 1996 for [[Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance|Best Hard Rock Performance]]. ''Vitalogy'' also included the songs &quot;[[Not for You]]&quot;, &quot;[[Corduroy (song)|Corduroy]]&quot;, &quot;[[Better Man]]&quot;, and &quot;[[Immortality (Pearl Jam song)|Immortality]]&quot;. &quot;Better Man&quot; ({{Audio-nohelp|Better Man.ogg|sample}}), a song originally written and performed by Vedder while in Bad Radio, reached number one on the ''Billboard'' Mainstream Rock chart, spending a total of eight weeks there. Considered a &quot;blatantly great pop song&quot; by producer Brendan O'Brien, Pearl Jam was reluctant to record it and had initially rejected it from ''Vs.'' due to its accessibility.&lt;ref name=&quot;tenpast&quot; /&gt;

The band continued its boycott against Ticketmaster during its [[Vitalogy Tour|1995 tour]] for ''Vitalogy'', but was surprised that virtually no other bands joined in.&lt;ref&gt;DeRogatis, pg. 64&lt;/ref&gt; Pearl Jam's initiative to play only at non-Ticketmaster venues effectively, with a few exceptions, prevented it from playing shows in the United States for the next three years.&lt;ref&gt;DeRogatis, pg. 65&lt;/ref&gt; Ament later said, &quot;We were so hardheaded about the 1995 tour. Had to prove we could tour on our own, and it pretty much killed us, killed our career.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;tenpast&quot; /&gt; In the same year Pearl Jam backed [[Neil Young]], whom the band had noted as an influence, on his album ''[[Mirror Ball (Neil Young album)|Mirror Ball]]''. Contractual obligations prevented the use of the band's name anywhere on the album, but the members were all credited individually in the album's liner notes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Erlewine&quot;/&gt; Two songs from the sessions were left off ''Mirror Ball'': &quot;[[I Got Id]]&quot; and &quot;Long Road&quot;. These two tracks were released separately by Pearl Jam in the form of the 1995 EP, ''[[Merkin Ball]]''.

=== ''No Code'' and ''Yield'': 1996–1999 ===
Following the round of touring for ''Vitalogy'', the band went into the studio to record its follow-up, ''[[No Code]]''. Vedder said, &quot;Making ''No Code'' was all about gaining perspective.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;spin&quot;&gt;Marks, Craig. &quot;The Road Less Traveled&quot;. ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]''. February 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Released on August 27, 1996, exactly five years after their debut album, ''No Code'' was seen as a deliberate break from the band's sound since ''Ten'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9806E4DB1430F936A1575BC0A960958260 | title=Pearl Jam Is Tired of the Pearl Jam Sound | accessdate=June 27, 2007 | author=Pareles, Jon | work=The New York Times | date=August 25, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; favoring [[Experimental rock|experimental]] ballads and noisy [[garage rock]]ers. David Browne of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' stated that &quot;''No Code'' displays a wider range of moods and instrumentation than on any previous Pearl Jam album.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,293849,00.html | title=Northwest Passage | accessdate=May 28, 2008 | author=Browne, David | work=Entertainment Weekly | date=August 23, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lyrical themes on the album deal with issues of self-examination,&lt;ref name=&quot;wayout&quot;&gt;Hilburn, Robert. &quot;Working Their Way Out of a Jam&quot;. ''Los Angeles Times''. December 22, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; with Ament stating, &quot;In some ways, it's like the band's story. It's about growing up.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;wayout&quot;/&gt; Although the album debuted at number one on the ''Billboard'' charts, it quickly fell down the charts. ''No Code'' included the singles &quot;[[Who You Are (Pearl Jam song)|Who You Are]]&quot; ({{Audio|Who You Are.ogg|sample}}), &quot;[[Hail, Hail]]&quot;, and &quot;[[Off He Goes]]&quot;. As with ''Vitalogy'', very little touring was done to promote ''No Code'' because of the band's refusal to play in Ticketmaster's venue areas. A [[No Code Tour|European tour]] took place in the fall of 1996. Gossard stated that there was &quot;a lot of stress associated with trying to tour at that time&quot; and that &quot;it was growing more and more difficult to be excited about being part of the band.&quot;&lt;ref name=tenpast /&gt;

[[File:MikeMcCready1998.jpg|thumb|right|Lead guitarist Mike McCready in [[Columbia, Maryland]] on September 18, 1998.]]
Following the short tour for ''No Code'', the band went into the studio in 1997 to record its follow-up. The sessions for the band's fifth album represented more of a team effort between all members of the group, with Ament stating that &quot;everybody really got a little bit of their say on the record...because of that, everybody feels like they're an integral part of the band.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1433095/19980204/story.jhtml &quot;Pearl Jam Talks About New Approach To ''Yield''&quot;]. [[MTV|MTV.com]]. February 4, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; On February 3, 1998, Pearl Jam released its fifth album, ''[[Yield (album)|Yield]]''. The album was cited as a return to the band's early, straightforward rock sound.&lt;ref name=&quot;allmusicyield&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r333026|pure_url=yes}} | title=''Yield'' &gt; Review | accessdate=July 1, 2007 | author=Erlewine, Stephen Thomas | publisher=Allmusic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tom Sinclair of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' stated that the band has &quot;turned in an intermittently affecting album that veers between fiery garage rock and rootsy, [[Acoustic music|acoustic]]-based ruminations. Perhaps mindful of their position as the last alt-rock ambassadors with any degree of clout, they've come up with their most cohesive album since their 1991 debut, ''Ten''.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,281804,00.html | title=Last Band Standing | accessdate=May 28, 2008 | author=Sinclair, Tom | work=Entertainment Weekly | date=February 6, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lyrically, ''Yield'' continued with the more contemplative type of writing found on ''No Code'',&lt;ref name=&quot;Mulvey&quot;&gt;Mulvey, John. &quot;Interview with Pearl Jam&quot;.

In April 1998, Pearl Jam once again changed drummers. Jack Irons left the band due to dissatisfaction with touring and was replaced with former Soundgarden drummer [[Matt Cameron]] on an initially temporary basis,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/pearljam/articles/story/5928493/off_he_goes | title=Off He Goes | accessdate=June 28, 2007 | author=Fischer, Blair R | work=Rolling Stone | date=April 17, 1998|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071002115935/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/pearljam/articles/story/5928493/off_he_goes |archivedate = October 2, 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he soon became a permanent replacement for Irons. Pearl Jam's 1998 [[Yield Tour]] in North America marked the band’s return to full-scale touring. The band's [[Competition law|anti-trust]] lawsuit against Ticketmaster had proven to be unsuccessful and hindered live tours. Many fans had complained about the difficulty in obtaining tickets and the use of non-Ticketmaster venues, which were judged to be out-of-the-way and impersonal. For this tour and future tours, Pearl Jam once again began using Ticketmaster in order to &quot;better accommodate concertgoers.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://uk.eonline.com/uberblog/b35954_pearl_jam_yields_ticketmaster.html | title=Pearl Jam Yields to Ticketmaster | accessdate=June 27, 2007 | author=Symonds, Jeff | publisher=[[E!|E!

August 10, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; and after it was completed the band released ''[[Live on Two Legs]]'', a live album which featured select performances from the tour.

In 1998, Pearl Jam recorded &quot;[[Last Kiss]]&quot;, a cover of a 1960s ballad made famous by [[J. Frank Wilson and the Cavaliers]]. It was recorded during a soundcheck and released on the band's 1998 [[fan club]] Christmas single. The following year, the cover was put into heavy rotation across the country. By popular demand, the cover was released to the public as a single in 1999, with all of the proceeds going to the aid of refugees of the [[Kosovo War]].&lt;ref name=&quot;timeline&quot;/&gt; The band also decided to include the song on the 1999 charity compilation album, ''[[No Boundaries: A Benefit for the Kosovar Refugees]]''. &quot;Last Kiss&quot; peaked at number two on the ''Billboard'' charts and became the band's highest-charting single.

=== ''Binaural'' and the Roskilde tragedy: 2000–2001 ===
[[Image:PearlJam-DC2000.jpg|thumb|right|Pearl Jam in [[Columbia, Maryland]] on September 4, 2000.]]
Following its full-scale tour in support of ''Yield'', the band took a short break, but then reconvened toward the end of 1999 and commenced work on a new album. On May 16, 2000, Pearl Jam released its sixth studio album, ''[[Binaural (album)|Binaural]]''. It was drummer Matt Cameron's studio recording debut with the band. The title is a reference to the [[binaural recording]] techniques that were utilized on several tracks by producer [[Tchad Blake]], known for his use of the technique.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pearljam.netmark.pl/newsy/spi.txt | title=Pearl Jam's 'Binaural' ear-marked by unusual sound mixing | accessdate=June 28, 2007 | author=Stout, Gene | work=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]] | date=May 16, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Binaural'' was the first album since the band's debut not produced by Brendan O'Brien, although O'Brien was called in later to remix several tracks. Gossard stated that the band members &quot;were ready for a change.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;totalguitar&quot;/&gt; [[Jon Pareles]] of ''Rolling Stone'' said, &quot;Apparently as tired of grunge as everyone except [[Creed (band)|Creed]] fans, Pearl Jam delve elsewhere.&quot; He added, &quot;The album reflects both Pearl Jam's longstanding curse of self-importance and a renewed willingness to be experimental or just plain odd.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/pearljam/albums/album/94578/review/5941143/binaural | title=Pearl Jam: ''Binaural'' | accessdate=May 28, 2008 | author=Pareles, Jon | work=Rolling Stone | date=June 8, 2000|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071014061107/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/pearljam/albums/album/94578/review/5941143/binaural |archivedate = October 14, 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album is lyrically darker than the band's previous album ''Yield'', with Gossard describing the lyrics as &quot;pretty sombre.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mulvey&quot;/&gt; ''Binaural'' included the singles &quot;[[Nothing as It Seems]]&quot; ({{Audio|Nothing As It Seems.ogg|sample}}), one of the songs featuring binaural recording, and &quot;[[Light Years (Pearl Jam song)|Light Years]]&quot;. The album sold just over 700,000 copies and became the first Pearl Jam studio album to fail to reach platinum status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Gundersen | first = Edna | url = http://www.usatoday.com/life/music/news/2002-12-05-pearl-jam_x.htm | title = ''Riot Act'' finds Pearl Jam in a quiet place | work = [[USA Today]] | accessdate = March 16, 2008 | date=December 5, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pearl Jam decided to record every show on its 2000 [[Binaural Tour]] professionally, after noting the desire of fans to own a copy of the shows they attended and the popularity of [[bootleg recording]]s. The band had been open in the past about allowing fans to make amateur recordings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sonymusic.com/artists/PearlJam/tour/taping.html | title=Taping/Camera Policy Guidelines | accessdate=June 28, 2007 | publisher=Sonymusic.com | date=May 27, 2006 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070603093430/http://www.sonymusic.com/artists/PearlJam/tour/taping.html |archivedate = June 3, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and these [[Pearl Jam Official Bootlegs|&quot;official bootlegs&quot;]] were an attempt to provide a more affordable and better quality product for fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/music/music255.htm | title=Pearl Jam's Bootlegs Give Others the Boot | accessdate=June 28, 2007 | author=Gundersen, Edna | work=[[USA Today]] | date=August 31, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pearl Jam originally intended to release them to only fan club members, but the band's record contract prevented it from doing so. Pearl Jam released all of the albums in record stores as well as through its fan club. The band released 72 live albums in 2000 and 2001, and set a record for most albums to debut in the ''Billboard'' 200 at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ca.launch.yahoo.com/read/news/12055527 | title=Pearl Jam Breaks Its Own Chart Record | accessdate=June 28, 2007 | author=Davis, Darren | publisher=[[Yahoo!|Yahoo!

Pearl Jam's 2000 European tour ended in tragedy on June 30, with an accident at the [[Roskilde Festival]] in Denmark. Nine fans were crushed underfoot and suffocated to death in the crowd. After numerous requests from Festival officials to stop playing, the band finally stopped and tried to have the crowd step back but it was already too late. The two remaining dates of the tour were canceled and members of the band contemplated retiring after this event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-64953416.html | title=Pearl Jam's darkest hour: Seattle band thought about quitting after concert deaths | accessdate=June 28, 2007 | author=Stout, Gene | work=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]] | date=September 1, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pearl Jam was initially blamed for the accident, but was later cleared of responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nyrock.com/worldbeat/08_2000/080300.asp | title=Pearl Jam Releases Full Text of Letter Written By Roskilde Police Department Commissioner Kornerup | accessdate=July 25, 2010 | author=nyrock | publisher=nyrock.com | date=August 3, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A month after the European tour concluded, the band embarked on its two-leg 2000 North American tour. On performing after the Roskilde tragedy, Vedder said that &quot;playing, facing crowds, being together—it enabled us to start processing it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;tenpast&quot; /&gt; On October 22, 2000, the band played the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, celebrating the tenth anniversary of its first live performance as a band. Vedder took the opportunity to thank the many people who had helped the band come together and make it to ten years. He noted that &quot;I would never do this accepting a Grammy or something.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fivehorizons.com/tour/cc/t2000p3.shtml | title=Pearl Jam: 2000 Concert Chronology Part 3 | accessdate=July 1, 2007 | publisher=Fivehorizons.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song &quot;Alive&quot; was purposely omitted from all shows on this tour until the [[11/6/00 - Seattle, Washington|final night]] in Seattle. The band performed that night for over three hours, playing most of its hits along with covers such as &quot;[[The Kids Are Alright (song)|The Kids Are Alright]]&quot; and &quot;[[Baba O'Riley]]&quot; by The Who. After concluding the Binaural Tour, the band released ''[[Touring Band 2000]]'' the following year. The DVD featured select performances from the North American legs of the tour.

Following the events of the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks]], Vedder and McCready were joined by [[Neil Young]] to perform the song &quot;Long Road&quot; from the ''Merkin Ball'' EP at the ''[[America: A Tribute to Heroes]]'' benefit concert. The concert, which aired on September 21, 2001, raised money for the victims and their families.

=== ''Riot Act'': 2002–2005 ===
Pearl Jam commenced work on a new album following a year-long break after its full-scale tour in support of ''Binaural''. McCready described the recording environment as &quot;a pretty positive one&quot; and &quot;very intense and spiritual.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Stout, Gene.

It included the singles &quot;[[I Am Mine]]&quot; and &quot;[[Save You]]&quot;. The album featured a much more [[folk music|folk]]-based and experimental sound, evident in the presence of [[Hammond organ|B3]] organist [[Boom Gaspar]] on songs such as &quot;[[Love Boat Captain]]&quot;. [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] of Allmusic said &quot;''Riot Act'' is the album that Pearl Jam has been wanting to make since ''Vitalogy''—a muscular [[art rock]] record, one that still hits hard but that is filled with ragged edges and odd detours.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r611292|pure_url=yes}} | title=''Riot Act'' &gt; Review | author= Erlewine, Stephen Thomas | publisher=Allmusic | accessdate=April 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The track entitled &quot;Arc&quot; was recorded as a vocal tribute to the nine people who died at the Roskilde Festival in June 2000. Vedder only performed this song nine times on the 2003 tour, and the band left the track off all released bootlegs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fivehorizons.com/tour/cc/t2003p3.shtml | title=Pearl Jam: 2003 Concert Chronology Part 3 | accessdate=July 1, 2007 | publisher=Fivehorizons.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, the band embarked on its [[Riot Act Tour]], which included tours in Australia and North America. The band continued its official bootleg program, making every concert from the tour available in CD form through its official website. A total of six bootlegs were made available in record stores: [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], Tokyo, [[State College, Pennsylvania]], two shows from [[Madison Square Garden]], and [[Mansfield, Massachusetts|Mansfield]], [[Massachusetts]]. At many shows during the 2003 North American tour, Vedder performed ''Riot Act'''s &quot;Bu$hleaguer&quot;, a commentary on President [[George W. Bush]], with a rubber mask of Bush, wearing it at the beginning of the song and then hanging it on a mic stand to allow him to sing. The band made news when it was reported that several fans left after Vedder had &quot;impaled&quot; the Bush mask on his mic stand at the band's [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]], [[Colorado]] show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/2916155.stm | title=Pearl Jam Bush Stunt Angers Fans | accessdate=July 1, 2007 | publisher=[[BBC|BBC News]] | date=April 4, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2003, Pearl Jam announced it was officially leaving Epic Records following the end of its contract with the label. The band stated it had &quot;no interest&quot; in signing with another label.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://msl1.mit.edu/furdlog/docs/2003-06-06_msnbc_pearl_jam.pdf | title=The music biz in a Pearl Jam | accessdate=July 2, 2007 | author=Olsen, Eric | publisher=[[MSNBC|MSNBC.com]] | date=June 5, 2003|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band's first release without a label was the single for &quot;[[Man of the Hour]]&quot;, in partnership with [[Amazon.com]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=176060&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=478580&amp;highlight= | title=Pearl Jam Joins Amazon.com's Advantage Program to Sell Music Directly to Fans | accessdate=July 2, 2007 | publisher=[[Amazon.com]] | date=December 17, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Director [[Tim Burton]] approached Pearl Jam to request an original song for the soundtrack of his new film, ''[[Big Fish]]''.

The work for Pearl Jam's follow-up to ''Riot Act'' began after its appearance on the 2004 [[Vote for Change]] tour. The time period between the two albums was the longest gap between Pearl Jam's studio albums to date and the new album was its first release for a new label. [[Clive Davis]] announced in February 2006 that Pearl Jam had signed with his label, [[J Records]], which like Epic, is part of [[Sony Music Entertainment]] (then known as [[Sony BMG]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0602/09/sbt.01.html | title=Showbiz Tonight | accessdate=September 3, 2007 | publisher=CNN |date=February 9, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band's eighth studio album, ''[[Pearl Jam (album)|Pearl Jam]]'', was released on May 2, 2006.

''Pearl Jam'' also included the singles &quot;[[Life Wasted]]&quot; and &quot;[[Gone (Pearl Jam song)|Gone]]&quot;.

To support ''Pearl Jam'', the band embarked on its [[Pearl Jam 2006 World Tour|2006 world tour]].

Compared with the other [[grunge]] bands of the early 1990s, Pearl Jam’s style is noticeably less heavy and harkens back to the [[classic rock]] music of the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Unterberger | first = Andrew | url=http://www.stylusmagazine.com/reviews/pearl-jam/rearviewmirror.htm | title = Pearl Jam: Rearviewmirror | work = Stylus | November 18, 2004 | accessdate = July 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pearl Jam has cited many [[punk rock]] and classic rock bands as influences, including The Who, [[Neil Young]], and the [[Ramones]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.theskinny.co.uk/article/35283-pearl-jam-explore-and-not-explode | title=Explore and not Explode | accessdate=September 3, 2007 | author=Kerr, Dave. | publisher=''[[The Skinny (magazine)|The Skinny]]'' | year=2006 | month=May}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pearl Jam’s success has been attributed to its sound, which fuses &quot;the riff-heavy stadium rock of the '70s with the grit and anger of '80s post-punk, without ever neglecting hooks and choruses.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Erlewine&quot; /&gt; Gossard's rhythm guitar style is known for its sense of beat and groove,&lt;ref&gt;Garbarini, Vic. &quot;Mother of Pearl&quot;.

January 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; has been described as &quot;feel-oriented&quot; and &quot;rootsy.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = {{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p103683|pure_url=yes}} | title = Mike McCready &gt; Biography | accessdate=April 20, 2009 | last = Prato | first = Greg | work =Allmusic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pearl Jam has broadened its musical range with subsequent releases. As he had more influence on the band's sound, Vedder sought to make the band's musical output less [[Hook (music)|catchy]]. He said, &quot;I felt that with more popularity, we were going to be crushed, our heads were going to pop like grapes.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;secondcoming&quot;/&gt; By 1994’s ''[[Vitalogy]]'', the band began to incorporate more punk influences into its music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9900E0DC1030F937A35751C1A962958260 | title=RECORDINGS VIEW; Pearl Jam Gives Voice To Sisyphus | accessdate=December 13, 2007 | author=Jon Pareles | work=The New York Times | date=December 4, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band’s 1996 album, ''[[No Code]]'', was a deliberate break from the musical style of ''[[Ten (Pearl Jam album)|Ten]]''. The songs on the album featured elements of [[garage rock]], [[worldbeat]], and [[Experimental music|experimentalism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Erlewine&quot;/&gt; After 1998’s ''[[Yield (album)|Yield]]'', which was somewhat of a return to the straightforward rock approach of the band's early work,&lt;ref name=&quot;allmusicyield&quot;/&gt; the band dabbled with experimental [[art rock]] on 2000’s ''[[Binaural (album)|Binaural]]'' and [[folk rock]] elements on 2002’s ''[[Riot Act (album)|Riot Act]]''. The band’s 2006 album, ''[[Pearl Jam (album)|Pearl Jam]]'', was cited as a return to the band’s early sound.&lt;ref name=&quot;PearlJamreview&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Easley&quot;/&gt; The band's 2009 album, ''[[Backspacer]]'', contains elements of pop and [[New Wave music|New Wave]].&lt;ref name=&quot;classicrock&quot;/&gt;

Critic Jim DeRogatis describes Vedder's vocals as a &quot;[[Jim Morrison]]-like vocal growl.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;DeRogatis, pg. 57&lt;/ref&gt; Greg Prato of Allmusic said, &quot;With his hard-hitting and often confessional lyrical style and Jim Morrison-esque baritone, Vedder also became one of the most copied lead singers in all of rock.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = {{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p134417|pure_url=yes}} | title = Eddie Vedder &gt; Biography | accessdate=April 20, 2009 | last = Prato | first = Greg | work =Allmusic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vedder's lyrical topics range from personal (&quot;Alive&quot;, &quot;Better Man&quot;) to social and political concerns (&quot;Even Flow&quot;, &quot;World Wide Suicide&quot;). His lyrics have often invoked the use of [[storytelling]] and have included themes of [[Freedom (philosophy)|freedom]], [[individualism]], and sympathy for troubled individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Tannenbaum, Rob. &quot;Rebels Without a Pause&quot;. ''[[George (magazine)|George]]''. July 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; When the band started, Gossard and McCready were clearly designated as rhythm and lead guitarists, respectively. The dynamic began to change when Vedder started to play more rhythm guitar during the ''Vitalogy'' era. McCready said in 2006, &quot;Even though there are three guitars, I think there's maybe more room now. Stone will pull back and play a two-note line and Ed will do a [[power chord]] thing, and I fit into all that.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Cross, Charles R. &quot;Better Man&quot;.

== Legacy ==
While Nirvana had brought grunge to the [[mainstream]] in the early 1990s, Pearl Jam quickly outsold them,&lt;ref&gt;Snow, Mat. &quot;You, My Son, Are Weird&quot;. ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]''. November 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; and became &quot;the most popular American rock &amp; roll band of the '90s&quot; according to Allmusic.&lt;ref name=&quot;Erlewine&quot; /&gt; Pearl Jam has been described as &quot;[[modern rock]] radio's most influential stylists&amp;nbsp;– the workmanlike midtempo chug of songs like &quot;Alive&quot; and &quot;Even Flow&quot; just melodic enough to get [[mosh]]ers singing along.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Sinagra, Laura. &quot;Grunge&quot;. ''Spin: 20 Years of Alternative Music.'' Three Rivers Press, 2005. ISBN 0-307-23662-5, pg. 150&lt;/ref&gt; The band inspired and influenced a number of bands, ranging from [[Silverchair]] to [[Puddle of Mudd]] and [[The Strokes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.enquirer.com/editions/2003/06/19/tem_ae19pearljam.html | title=Pearl Jam's tour even surprised bassist Ament | accessdate=July 1, 2007 | author=Jenkins, Mandy | work=[[The Cincinnati Enquirer]] | date=June 19, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002651028 | title='Mercy': Strokes Cover Gaye With Vedder, Homme | accessdate=July 10, 2007 | author=Cohen, Jonathan | work=Billboard | date=June 9, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pearl Jam has outlasted many of its contemporaries in the grunge scene such as [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], [[Alice in Chains]], and [[Soundgarden]].&lt;ref name=&quot;secondcoming&quot; /&gt;

Pearl Jam has been praised for its rejection of rock star excess and its insistence on backing causes it believes in. Music critic [[Jim DeRogatis]] said in the aftermath of the band's battle with Ticketmaster that it &quot;proved that a rock band which isn't {{sic|hide=y|comprised |of}} greed heads can play stadiums and not milk the audience for every last dime... it indicated that idealism in rock 'n' roll is not the sole province of those '60s bands enshrined in the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;DeRogatis, pg. 66&lt;/ref&gt; Eric Weisbard of ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' said in 2001, &quot;The group that was once accused of being synthetic grunge now seem as organic and principled a rock band as exists.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;tenpast&quot; /&gt; In a 2005 ''[[USA Today]]'' reader's poll, Pearl Jam was voted the greatest American rock band of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/columnist/popcandy/2005-07-05-pop-candy_x.htm | title=And the Greatest American rock band ever is... | accessdate=May 7, 2007 | author=Matheson, Whitney | work=USA Today | date=July 5, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2006, Pearl Jam was awarded the prize for &quot;Best Live Act&quot; in ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'''s Esky Music Awards.

When asked about Pearl Jam's legacy in a 2000 interview, Vedder said, &quot;I think at some point along the way we began feeling we wanted to give people something to believe in because we all had bands that gave that to us when we needed something to believe in. That was the big challenge for us after the first record and the response to it. The goal immediately became how do we continue to be musicians and grow and survive in view of all this... The answers weren’t always easy, but I think we found a way.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://articles.latimes.com/2000/oct/19/entertainment/ca-38639 | title=Pearl Jam Does the Evolution | accessdate=January 28, 2009 | author=Hilburn, Robert | work=Los Angeles Times | date=October 19, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band have also been credited for inspiring the indie rock scene of 90s-era urban Pakistan, that has since evolved into a rich rock music culture in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/189422/the-vedderisation-of-pakistani-rock-its-still-alive/ | title=The ‘Vedderisation’ of Pakistani rock: It’s still alive | accessdate=June 16, 2011 | author=Khan, Laaleen | work=The Express Tribune | date=June 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Campaigning and activism ==
Throughout its career, Pearl Jam has promoted wider social and political issues, from [[pro-choice]] sentiments to opposition to [[Presidency of George W. Bush|George W. Bush's presidency]]. Vedder acts as the band's spokesman on these issues. The band has promoted an array of causes, including awareness of [[Crohn's disease]], which lead guitarist [[List of people diagnosed with Crohn's disease|Mike McCready suffers from]], [[Ticketmaster]] venue monopolization and the environment and wildlife protection, among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/action/article/3149/review/concert/pearl_jamsleaterkinney | title= Pearl Jam/Sleater-Kinney, Arlene Schnitzer Concert Hall, Portland, OR 7/20/2006 | accessdate=July 10, 2007 | author=duBrowa, Cory | work=[[Paste Magazine]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;causes&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sonymusic.com/artists/PearlJam/activism/alist.html | title=Pearl Jam Synergy | accessdate=June 26, 2007 | publisher=Sonymusic.com |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070618075914/http://www.sonymusic.com/artists/PearlJam/activism/alist.html |archivedate = June 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guitarist Stone Gossard has been active in environmental pursuits, and has been an advocate of Pearl Jam's [[carbon neutral]] policy, offsetting the band's environmental impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.grist.org/news/maindish/2006/07/21/vanschagen/ | title=&quot;Jam Session&quot; - Interview with Stone Gossard | accessdate=November 1, 2008 | author=Van Schagen, Sarah | publisher=www.grist.org | date=July 21, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 the band announced they would mitigate carbon emissions from their 2009 [[Backspacer Tour]] by donating $210,000 towards planting trees in the area of [[Puget Sound]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pearljam.com/news/pearl-jam-mitigates-co2 | title=Pearl Jam mitigates CO2 | accessdate=April 9, 2010 | author=Pearl Jam | publisher=www.pearljam.com | date=March 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vedder has advocated for the release of the [[West Memphis 3]] for years and [[Damien Echols]], a member of the three, shares a writing credit for the song &quot;Army Reserve&quot; (from ''[[Pearl Jam (album)|Pearl Jam]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wm3.org/live/newsevents/newsitem.php?news_Id=116 | title= Echols contributes to new Pearl Jam album | accessdate=July 22, 2007 | publisher=wm3.org|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070928003356/http://www.wm3.org/live/newsevents/newsitem.php?news_Id=116 |archivedate = September 28, 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band publicizes such causes via its official website and includes links to alternative news sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pearljam.com/activism/ | title=Pearl Jam: Activism and Information | accessdate=June 27, 2007 | publisher=PearlJam.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The band, and especially frontman Eddie Vedder, have been vocal supporters of the pro-choice movement. In 1992, ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' printed an article by Vedder, entitled &quot;Reclamation&quot;, which detailed his views on abortion.&lt;ref&gt;Vedder, Eddie. &quot;Reclamation&quot;. ''Spin''. November 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; In an ''[[MTV Unplugged]]'' concert the same year, Vedder stood on a stool and wrote &quot;PRO-CHOICE!&quot; on his arm in protest when the band performed the song &quot;Porch&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;tenpast&quot; /&gt; The band are members of a number of pro-choice organizations, including [[Choice USA]] and Voters for Choice.&lt;ref name=&quot;causes&quot; /&gt;

As members of [[Rock the Vote]] and [[Vote for Change]], the band has encouraged voter registration and participation in [[Elections in the United States|United States elections]]. Vedder was outspoken in support of [[Green Party (United States)|Green Party]] presidential candidate [[Ralph Nader]] in 2000,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://archive.salon.com/ent/log/2000/09/26/vedder/index.html | title=Vedder on Nader: The better man | accessdate=September 3, 2007 | author=Talvi, Silja J.

In a ''Rolling Stone'' feature showcasing the Vote for Change tour's performers, Vedder told the magazine, &quot;I supported Ralph Nader in 2000, but it's a time of crisis. We have to get a new administration in.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/6487639/voices_for_change | title=Voices for Change | accessdate=September 3, 2007 | work=Rolling Stone | date=October 14, 2004|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070807100755/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/6487639/voices_for_change |archivedate = August 7, 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vedder sometimes comments on politics between songs, often to criticize U.S. foreign policy, and a number of his songs, including &quot;Bu$hleaguer&quot; and &quot;[[World Wide Suicide]]&quot;, are openly critical of the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]]. At Lollapalooza 2007, Vedder spoke out against [[BP|BP Amoco]] [[BP#Lake Michigan Plant expansion|dumping effluent in Lake Michigan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nme.com/news/pearl-jam/30173 | title=Pearl Jam Close Out Last Night at Lollapalooza | accessdate=April 25, 2009 | work=[[NME]] | date=August 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at the end of &quot;Daughter&quot;, he sang the lyrics &quot;George Bush leave this world alone/George Bush find yourself another home&quot;. In the beginning of the second encore Vedder invited Iraq war veteran Tomas Young, the subject of the documentary ''[[Body of War]]'', onto the stage to urge an end to the war. Young in turn introduced [[Ben Harper]], who contributed vocals to &quot;No More&quot; and &quot;Rockin' in the Free World&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hybridmagazine.com/music/0807/lollapalooza.shtml | title= Lollapalooza 2007 | accessdate=August 6, 2007 | author=Warren, Dan| publisher=Hybrid Magazine | date=August 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band has since discovered that some of the Bush-related lyrics were excised from the [[AT&amp;T]] webcast of the event, and are questioning whether that constitutes censorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://pearljam.com/news/?what=News#195 | title= LOLLAPALOOZA WEBCAST : SPONSORED/CENSORED BY AT&amp;T? | accessdate=August 8, 2007 | publisher=Pearljam.com | date=August 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; AT&amp;T later apologized and blamed the censorship on contractor [[Davie Brown Entertainment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,135767-c,techindustrytrends/article.html | title=AT&amp;T Says It Didn't Censor Pearl Jam | accessdate=August 9, 2007 | author=Gross, Grant | publisher=[[IDG|IDG News Service]] | date=August 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pearl Jam has performed numerous benefit concerts in aid of charities. For example, the band headlined a Seattle concert in 2001 to support the United Nations' efforts to combat world hunger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1446419/20010807/pearl_jam.jhtml | title=Pearl Jam To Play For Charity | accessdate=July 31, 2007 | author=Schumacher-Rasmussen, Eric | publisher=MTV | date=August 7, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band added a date at the Chicago House of Blues to its 2005 tour to help the victims of [[Hurricane Katrina]]; the concert proceeds were donated to [[Habitat for Humanity International|Habitat for Humanity]], the [[American Red Cross]] and the Jazz Foundation of America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1001137028 | title=Pearl Jam, The Roots Plan Katrina Benefits | accessdate=July 31, 2007 | author=Cohen, Jonathan | work=Billboard | date=September 14, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
