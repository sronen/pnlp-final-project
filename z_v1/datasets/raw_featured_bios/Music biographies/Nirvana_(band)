'''Nirvana''' was an American [[rock music|rock]] band that was formed by singer/guitarist [[Kurt Cobain]] and bassist [[Krist Novoselic]] in [[Aberdeen, Washington]] in 1987. Nirvana went through a succession of drummers, the longest-lasting being [[Dave Grohl]], who joined the band in 1990.

In the late 1980s Nirvana established itself as part of the [[Seattle]] [[grunge]] scene, releasing its first album  ''[[Bleach (album)|Bleach]]'' for the [[independent record label]] [[Sub Pop]] in 1989. The band eventually came to develop a sound that relied on dynamic contrasts, often between quiet verses and loud, heavy choruses. After signing to major label [[DGC Records]], Nirvana found unexpected success with &quot;[[Smells Like Teen Spirit]]&quot;, the first single from the band's second album ''[[Nevermind]]'' (1991). Nirvana's sudden success widely popularized [[alternative rock]] as a whole, and as the band's frontman Cobain found himself referred to in the media as the &quot;spokesman of a generation&quot;, with Nirvana being considered the &quot;flagship band&quot; of [[Generation X]].&lt;ref&gt;Azerrad, Michael.

The album didn't match the sales figures of ''Nevermind'', but was still a commercial success.

Nirvana's brief run ended following the [[death of Kurt Cobain]] in 1994, but various posthumous releases have been issued since, overseen by Novoselic, Grohl, and Cobain's widow [[Courtney Love]]. Since its debut, the band has sold over 25 million records in the United States alone, and over 75 million records worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/arts/music/story/2009/03/21/nirvana-vinyl-releases.html &quot;Nirvana catalogue to be released on vinyl&quot;].

==History==
===Formation and early years===
{{Main|Fecal Matter (band)}}
Cobain and Novoselic met while attending Aberdeen High, although they never connected, according to Cobain.&lt;ref&gt;Azerrad, 1994. p. 209&lt;/ref&gt; The pair eventually became friends while frequenting the practice space of the [[Melvins]].&lt;ref&gt;Azerrad, 1994. p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; Cobain wanted to form a band with Novoselic, but Novoselic did not respond to his overtures, which included handing him a demo tape of his project [[Fecal Matter (band)|Fecal Matter]]. Three years after the two first met, Novoselic notified Cobain that he had finally listened to the Fecal Matter demo Cobain had given him, and suggested they start a group. The pair recruited Bob McFadden on drums, but after a month the project fell apart.&lt;ref&gt;Azerrad, 1994. p. 44–5&lt;/ref&gt; In winter of 1987, Cobain and Novoselic recruited drummer [[Aaron Burckhard]].&lt;ref&gt;Azerrad, 1994. p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; The trio practiced material from Cobain's Fecal Matter tape, but started writing new material soon after forming.&lt;ref&gt;Azerrad, 1994. p. 58&lt;/ref&gt;

During its initial months, the band went through a series of names, starting with Skid Row and including Pen Cap Chew, Bliss, and Ted Ed Fred. The group finally settled on Nirvana, which Cobain said was chosen because &quot;I wanted a name that was kind of beautiful or nice and pretty instead of a mean, raunchy [[punk rock]] name like the [[Angry Samoans]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Azerrad, 1994. p. 61–2&lt;/ref&gt; With Novoselic and Cobain having moved to [[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]] and [[Olympia, Washington]], respectively, the two temporarily lost contact with Burckhard. The pair instead practiced with [[Dale Crover]] of the Melvins, and Nirvana recorded its first demos in January 1988.&lt;ref&gt;Azerrad, 1994. p. 67–8&lt;/ref&gt; In early 1988, Crover moved to [[San Francisco]] but recommended [[Dave Foster]] to the band as his replacement on drums.&lt;ref&gt;Azerrad, 1994. p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; Foster's tenure with Nirvana lasted only a few months; during a stint in jail, he was replaced by a returning Burckhard, who himself didn't stay with the band after telling Cobain he was too hung over to practice one day.&lt;ref&gt;Azerrad, 1994. p. 76–7&lt;/ref&gt; Cobain and Novoselic put an ad in Seattle music publication ''[[The Rocket (newspaper)|The Rocket]]'' seeking a replacement drummer which only yielded unsatisfactory responses. Meanwhile, a mutual friend introduced the pair to [[Chad Channing]], and the three musicians agreed to jam together. Channing continued to jam with Cobain and Novoselic, although the drummer noted, &quot;They never actually said 'Ok, you're in.'&quot;, and Channing played his first show with the group that May.&lt;ref&gt;Azerrad, 1994. p. 79&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early releases===
Nirvana released its first single, &quot;[[Love Buzz]]&quot;, in November 1988 on the Seattle [[independent record label]] [[Sub Pop]].&lt;ref&gt;Azerrad, 1994. p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; The following month, the band began recording its debut album, ''[[Bleach (album)|Bleach]]'', with local producer [[Jack Endino]].&lt;ref&gt;Azerrad, 1994. p. 90–1&lt;/ref&gt; ''Bleach'' was highly influenced by the heavy dirge-rock of the Melvins and [[Mudhoney]], 1980s punk rock, and the 1970s [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] of [[Black Sabbath]]. Novoselic noted in a 2001 interview with ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' that the band had played a tape in their van while on tour that had an album by [[The Smithereens]] on one side and an album by the [[black metal]] band [[Celtic Frost]] on the other, and noted that the combination probably played an influence as well.&lt;ref&gt;Fricke, David. &quot;Krist Novoselic&quot;. ''Rolling Stone''. September 13, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; The money for the recording sessions for ''Bleach'', listed as $606.17 on the album sleeve, was supplied by [[Jason Everman]], who was subsequently brought into the band as the second guitarist. Though Everman did not actually play on the album, he received a credit on ''Bleach'' because, according to Novoselic, they &quot;wanted to make him feel more at home in the band&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Azerrad, 1994. p. 91–2&lt;/ref&gt; Just prior to the album's release, Nirvana insisted on signing an extended contract with Sub Pop, making the band the first to do so with the label.&lt;ref&gt;Azerrad, 1994. p. 110–11&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the release of ''Bleach'' in June 1989, Nirvana embarked on its first national tour,&lt;ref&gt;Azerrad, 1994. p. 111&lt;/ref&gt; and the album became a favorite of [[college radio]] stations.&lt;ref name=&quot;rolling stone review&quot;&gt;Young, Charles; O'Donnell, Kevin.

Retrieved February 21, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to increasing dissatisfaction with Everman over the course of the tour, Nirvana canceled the last few dates and drove back to Washington. No one told Everman he was fired at the time, while Everman later claimed that he actually quit the group.&lt;ref&gt;Azerrad, 1994. p. 115–20&lt;/ref&gt; Although Sub Pop did not promote ''Bleach'' as much as other releases, it was a steady seller,&lt;ref name=&quot;Azerrad134&quot;&gt;Azerrad, 1994. p. 134&lt;/ref&gt; and had initial sales of 40,000 copies.&lt;ref&gt;Price, David J.

''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''. August 4, 2009. Retrieved January 28, 2011. According to the source, ''Bleach'' has now sold 1.7 million copies in the United States.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Cobain was upset by the label's lack of promotion and distribution for the album.&lt;ref name=&quot;Azerrad134&quot; /&gt; In late 1989, the band recorded the ''[[Blew (EP)|Blew]]'' EP with producer [[Steve Fisk]].&lt;ref&gt;Azerrad, 1994. p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;

In a late 1989 interview, Cobain noted that the band's music was changing. He said, &quot;The early songs were really angry ... But as time goes on the songs are getting poppier and poppier as I get happier and happier. The songs are now about conflicts in relationships, emotional things with other human beings&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Robb, John. &quot;White Heat&quot;. ''[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]''. October 21, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1990, the band began working with producer [[Butch Vig]] at Smart Studios in [[Madison, Wisconsin]] on recordings for the follow-up to ''Bleach''.&lt;ref&gt;Azerrad, 1994. p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; During the sessions, Cobain and Novoselic became disenchanted with Channing's drumming, and Channing expressed frustration at not being actively involved in songwriting. As bootlegs of Nirvana's demos with Vig began to circulate in the music industry and draw attention from major labels, Channing left the band.&lt;ref&gt;Azerrad, 1994. p. 138–39&lt;/ref&gt; That July, the band recorded the single &quot;[[Sliver (song)|Sliver]]&quot; with Mudhoney drummer [[Dan Peters]].&lt;ref&gt;Azerrad, 1994. p. 142&lt;/ref&gt; Nirvana asked Dale Crover to fill in on drums for a seven-date American West Coast tour with [[Sonic Youth]] that August.&lt;ref&gt;Azerrad, 1994. p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1990, [[Buzz Osborne]] of the Melvins introduced the band to [[Dave Grohl]], who was looking for a new band following the sudden break-up of Washington, D.C. [[hardcore punk]]s [[Scream (band)|Scream]].&lt;ref&gt;Azerrad, 1994. p. 151&lt;/ref&gt; A few days after arriving in Seattle, Novoselic and Cobain auditioned Grohl, with Novoselic later stating, &quot;We knew in two minutes that he was the right drummer&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Azerrad, 1994. p. 154&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mainstream success===
[[File:Dave Grohl 1991.jpg|left|alt=|thumb|Nirvana's series of short-lived drummers ended with the 1990 addition of [[Dave Grohl]] (pictured here in late 1990)]]
Disenchanted with Sub Pop and with the Smart Studios sessions generating interest, Nirvana decided to look for a deal with a major record label since no indie label could buy the group out of its contract.&lt;ref&gt;Azerrad, 1994. p. 136–37&lt;/ref&gt; Following repeated recommendations by Sonic Youth's [[Kim Gordon]], Nirvana signed to [[DGC Records]] in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;Azerrad, 1994. p. 162&lt;/ref&gt; The band subsequently began recording its first major label album, ''Nevermind''. The group was offered a number of producers to choose from, but ultimately held out for Butch Vig.&lt;ref&gt;Azerrad, 1994. p. 164–65&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than recording at Vig's Madison studio as they had in 1990, production shifted to Sound City Studios in [[Van Nuys, Los Angeles]], California. For two months, the band worked through a variety of songs in its catalog. Some of the songs, such as &quot;[[In Bloom]]&quot; and &quot;Breed&quot;, had been in Nirvana's repertoire for years, while others, including &quot;[[On a Plain]]&quot; and &quot;Stay Away,&quot; lacked finished lyrics until mid-way through the recording process.&lt;ref&gt;Azerrad, 1994. p. 176–77&lt;/ref&gt; After the recording sessions were completed, Vig and the band set out to mix the album. However, the recording sessions had run behind schedule and the resulting mixes were deemed unsatisfactory. [[Slayer]] mixer [[Andy Wallace (producer)|Andy Wallace]] was brought in to create the final mix. After the album's release, members of Nirvana expressed dissatisfaction with the polished sound the mixer had given ''Nevermind''.&lt;ref&gt;Azerrad, 1994. p. 179–80&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, DGC Records was hoping to sell 250,000 copies of ''Nevermind'', which was the same level they had achieved with Sonic Youth's ''[[Goo (album)|Goo]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Wice, Nathaniel. &quot;How Nirvana Made It&quot;. ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]''. April 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the album's first single &quot;[[Smells Like Teen Spirit]]&quot; quickly gained momentum, thanks in part to significant airplay of the song's music video on [[MTV]]. As it toured Europe during late 1991, the band found that its shows were dangerously oversold, that television crews were becoming a constant presence onstage, and that &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; was almost omnipresent on radio and music television.&lt;ref&gt;Azerrad, 1994. p. 203&lt;/ref&gt;  By Christmas 1991, ''Nevermind'' was selling 400,000 copies a week in the US.&lt;ref&gt;Lyons, James. ''Selling Seattle: Representing Contemporary Urban America''. Wallflower, 2004. ISBN 1-903364-96-5, p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1992, the album displaced [[Michael Jackson]]'s ''[[Dangerous (Michael Jackson album)|Dangerous]]'' at number one on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' album charts, and also topped the charts in numerous other countries.&lt;ref&gt;Azerrad, 1994. p. 239&lt;/ref&gt; The month ''Nevermind'' reached number one, ''Billboard'' proclaimed, &quot;Nirvana is that rare band that has everything: critical acclaim, industry respect, pop radio appeal, and a rock-solid college/alternative base.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Nirvana Achieves Chart Perfection!&quot; ''Billboard''. January 25, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; The album would eventually sell over seven million copies in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;SoundScan sales&quot;&gt;Basham, David.

Retrieved August 20, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Citing exhaustion, Nirvana decided not to undertake another American tour in support of ''Nevermind'', instead opting to make only a handful of performances later that year.&lt;ref&gt;Azerrad, 1994. p. 256&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1992, Cobain sought to reorganize the group's songwriting royalties (which to this point had been split equally) so that they were more representative of the fact that he wrote the majority of the music. Grohl and Novoselic did not object to Cobain's request, but when the frontman asked for the agreement to be retroactive to the release of ''Nevermind'', the disagreements between the two sides came close to breaking up the band. After a week of tension, Cobain ended up receiving a retroactive share of 75 percent of the royalties, and bad feelings about the situation remained within the group afterward.&lt;ref&gt;Azerrad, 1994. p. 257–58&lt;/ref&gt; Amid rumors that the band was disbanding due to Cobain's health, Nirvana headlined the closing night of England's 1992 [[Reading Festival]], where Cobain personally programmed the performance lineup.&lt;ref&gt;Azerrad, 1994. p. 271&lt;/ref&gt; Nirvana's performance at Reading is often regarded by the press as one of the most memorable of the group's career.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nme.com/news/nirvana/44151 &quot;Nirvana's Reading Festival gig to be released on DVD&quot;].

At the ceremony, the band received awards for the [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Alternative Video|Best Alternative Video]] and [[MTV Video Music Award for Best New Artist|Best New Artist]] categories.&lt;ref&gt;Azerrad, 1994. p. 276–78&lt;/ref&gt;

DGC had hoped to have a new Nirvana album by the band ready for a late 1992 holiday season release; since work on it proceeded slowly, the label released the compilation album ''[[Incesticide]]'' in December 1992.&lt;ref name=&quot;goldmine&quot;&gt;Gaar, Gillian G. &quot;Verse Chorus Verse: The Recording History of Nirvana&quot;. ''Goldmine''. February 14, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; A joint venture between DGC and Sub Pop, ''Incesticide'' collected various rare Nirvana recordings and was intended to provide the material for a better price and at better quality than was available via bootleg copies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Azerrad, 1994. p. 294&quot;/&gt; As ''Nevermind'' had been out for 15 months and had yielded a fourth single, &quot;[[In Bloom]]&quot;, by that point, Geffen/DGC opted not to heavily promote ''Incesticide'', which was certified gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] the following February.&lt;ref&gt;Azerrad, 1994. p. 296&lt;/ref&gt;

===''In Utero'', final months, and Cobain's death===
In February 1993, Nirvana released [[Puss/Oh, the Guilt|&quot;Puss&quot;/&quot;Oh, the Guilt&quot;]], a split single with [[The Jesus Lizard]], on the independent label [[Touch and Go Records|Touch &amp; Go]].&lt;ref name=&quot;goldmine&quot; /&gt; Meanwhile, the group chose [[Steve Albini]], who had a reputation as a principled and opinionated individual in the American [[independent music]] scene, to record its third album. While there was speculation that the band chose Albini to record the album due to his underground credentials,&lt;ref&gt;DeRogatis, 2003. p. 5–6&lt;/ref&gt; Cobain insisted that Albini's sound was simply the one he had always wanted Nirvana to have: a &quot;natural&quot; recording without layers of studio trickery.&lt;ref&gt;Azerrad, 1994. p. 317&lt;/ref&gt; Nirvana traveled to [[Pachyderm Studio]] in [[Cannon Falls, Minnesota]] in that February to record the album.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gaar40&quot;&gt;Gaar, 2006. p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; The sessions with Albini were productive and notably quick, and the album was recorded and mixed in two weeks for a cost of $25,000.&lt;ref&gt;DeRogatis, 2003. p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

Several weeks after the completion of the recording sessions, stories ran in the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' and ''[[Newsweek]]'' that quoted sources claiming DGC considered the album &quot;unreleasable&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;DeRogatis, 2003. p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, fans began to believe that the band's creative vision might be compromised by their label.&lt;ref&gt;Azerrad, 1994. p. 332&lt;/ref&gt; While the stories about DGC shelving the album were untrue, the band actually was unhappy with certain aspects of Albini's mixes. Specifically, they thought the bass levels were too low,&lt;ref name=&quot;FrickeRS1994&quot;&gt;Fricke, David. &quot;Kurt Cobain: The Rolling Stone Interview&quot;. ''Rolling Stone''. January 27, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; and Cobain felt that &quot;[[Heart-Shaped Box]]&quot; and &quot;[[All Apologies]]&quot; did not sound &quot;perfect&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Azerrad, 1994. p. 336–37&lt;/ref&gt; Longtime [[R.E.M.]] producer [[Scott Litt]] was called in to help remix those two songs, with Cobain adding additional instrumentation and backing vocals.&lt;ref&gt;Azerrad, 1994. p. 338&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[In Utero (album)|In Utero]]'' debuted at number one on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] album chart in September 1993.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,308282,00.html &quot;In Numero Uno&quot;].

June 6, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; However, shortly before the release date, Love filed a suit to dissolve Nirvana LLC, and an injunction was issued preventing the release of any new Nirvana material until the case was resolved.&lt;ref&gt;DeRogatis, 2003. p. 33–4&lt;/ref&gt; Love contended that Cobain was the band, that Grohl and Novoselic were sidemen, and that she signed the partnership agreement originally under bad advice. Grohl and Novoselic countersued, asking the court to remove Love from the partnership and to replace her with another representative of Cobain's estate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Heath&quot; /&gt;

The day before the case was set to go to trial in October 2002, Love, Novoselic, and Grohl announced that they had reached a settlement. The settlement paved the way for the release of the compilation album ''[[Nirvana (Nirvana album)|Nirvana]]'', which featured the previously unreleased track &quot;[[You Know You're Right]]&quot;, the last song Nirvana recorded before Cobain's death.&lt;ref&gt;Stout, Gene.

''[[Sliver: The Best of the Box]]'', which culled 19 tracks from the box set in addition to featuring three previously unreleased tracks, was released in late 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.billboard.com/#/news/track-list-set-for-nirvana-compilation-1001179812.story &quot;Track List Set For Nirvana Compilation&quot;].

In April 2006, Love announced that she had arranged to sell 25 percent of her stake in the Nirvana song catalog in a deal estimated at $50 million. The share of Nirvana's publishing was purchased by Primary Wave Music, which was founded by Larry Mestel, a former CEO of [[Virgin Records]]. In an accompanying statement, Love sought to assure Nirvana's fanbase that the music would not simply be licensed to the highest bidder, noting, &quot;We are going to remain very tasteful and true to the spirit of Nirvana while taking the music to places it has never been before.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Vineyard, Jennifer.

==Musical style==
{{Listen|filename=NirvanaSmellsLikeTeenSpirit.ogg|title=&quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot;|description=Sample of &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot;, the first single from the band's breakthrough release ''[[Nevermind]]'' (1991). Nirvana utilized dynamic contrasts in its music, present in this song in the form of a  sparse two-note guitar verse guitar melody and choruses of strummed [[power chord]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chappel&quot;&gt;Chappell, Jon. &quot;Nirvana's music&quot;. ''Guitar''. June 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Cobain described the sound of Nirvana when it first started as &quot;a [[Gang of Four (band)|Gang of Four]] and [[Scratch Acid]] ripoff&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Azerrad, 1994. p. 294&quot;&gt;Azerrad, 1994. p. 294&lt;/ref&gt; Later when Nirvana recorded ''Bleach'', Cobain felt he had to fit the expectations of the Sub Pop grunge sound to build a fanbase, and hence suppressed his arty and pop songwriting traits while crafting the record in favor of a more rocking sound.&lt;ref name=&quot;Az 102&quot;&gt;Azerrad, 1994. p. 102&lt;/ref&gt; Nirvana biographer [[Michael Azerrad]] argued, &quot;Ironically, it was the restrictions of the Sub Pop sound helped the band find its musical identity&quot;. Azerrad stated that by acknowledging that its members had grown up listening to [[Black Sabbath]] and [[Aerosmith]], the band was able to move on from its derivative early sound.&lt;ref&gt;Azerrad, 1994. p. 103&lt;/ref&gt;

Nirvana utilized dynamic shifts that went from quiet to loud.&lt;ref name=&quot;FrickeRS1994&quot; /&gt; Cobain had sought to mix heavy and pop musical sounds; he commented, &quot;I wanted to be totally [[Led Zeppelin]] in a way and then be totally extreme punk rock and then do real wimpy pop songs&quot;. When Cobain heard the [[Pixies]]' 1988 album ''[[Surfer Rosa]]'' after recording ''Bleach'', he felt it had the sound he wanted to achieve but until then was too intimidated to try. The Pixies' subsequent popularity encouraged Cobain to follow his instincts as a songwriter.&lt;ref&gt;Azerrad, 1994. p. 103–4&lt;/ref&gt; Like the Pixies, Nirvana moved between &quot;spare bass-and-drum grooves and shrill bursts of screaming guitar and vocals&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Kanter, L.A. &quot;Kurt Cobain's Well-Tempered Tantrums&quot;. ''Guitar Player''. February 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; Near the end of his life, Cobain noted the band had become bored by the formula, finding it limited, but he expressed doubts that the band was skilled enough to try other dynamics.&lt;ref name=&quot;FrickeRS1994&quot; /&gt;

Cobain's rhythm guitar style, which relied on power chords, low-note riffs, and a loose right-hand technique, featured the key components to the band’s songs. Cobain would often initially play a song's verse riff in a clean tone, then double it with distorted guitars when he repeated the part. In some songs the guitar would be absent from the verses entirely to allow the drums and bass guitar to support the vocals, or it would only play sparse melodies like the two-note pattern used in &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot;. Cobain rarely played standard guitar solos, opting to play slight variations of the song's melody as single note lines. Cobain's solos were mostly blues-based and out of tune, which music writer Jon Chappell described as &quot;almost an iconoclastic parody of the traditional instrumental break&quot;, a quality typified by the note-for-note replication of the lead melody in &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; and the atonal solo for &quot;Breed&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chappel&quot; /&gt;

Grohl's drumming &quot;took Nirvana's sound to a new level of intensity&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;di Perna, Alan. &quot;Nevermore&quot;. ''Guitar World''. March 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Azerrad stated that Grohl's &quot;powerful drumming propelled the band to a whole new plane, visually as well as musically&quot;, noting, &quot;Although Dave is a merciless basher, his parts are also distinctly musical—it wouldn't be difficult to figure out what song he was playing even without the rest of the music.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Azerrad, 1994. p. 231–32&lt;/ref&gt;

During live performances, Cobain and Novoselic would always tune their guitars to E flat.&lt;ref name=requiem&gt;Cross, Charles R. &quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot;. ''Guitar World''. October 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Cobain noted, &quot;We play so hard we can't tune our guitars fast enough.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;cheaptricks&quot;&gt;Gilbert, Jeff. &quot;Cheap Tricks&quot;. ''Guitar World''. February 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; The band made a habit of destroying its equipment after shows. Novoselic said he and Cobain created the &quot;shtick&quot; in order to get off of the stage sooner.&lt;ref name=classicalbums&gt;''Classic Albums—Nirvana: Nevermind'' [DVD]. Isis Productions, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Cobain stated it began as an expression of his frustration with Chad Channing making mistakes and dropping out entirely during performances.&lt;ref&gt;Azerrad, 1994. p. 140&lt;/ref&gt;

===Songwriting and lyrics===
[[Everett True]] said in 1989, &quot;Nirvana songs treat the banal and pedestrian with a unique slant.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;True, Everett. &quot;Seattle: Rock City.&quot; ''[[Melody Maker]]''. March 18, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; Cobain came up with the basic components of each song (usually writing them on an acoustic guitar), as well as the singing style and the lyrics. He emphasized that Novoselic and Grohl &quot;have a big part in deciding on how long a song should be and how many parts it should have. So I don't like to be considered the sole songwriter.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;making Nevermind&quot;&gt;di Perna, Alan. &quot;The Making of ''Nevermind''&quot;. ''Guitar World''. Fall 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;  When asked which part of the songs he would write first, Cobain responded, &quot;I don’t know. I really don’t know. I guess I start with the verse and then go into the chorus.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;FrickeRS1994&quot; /&gt;

Cobain usually wrote lyrics for songs minutes before recording them.&lt;ref name=&quot;making Nevermind&quot; /&gt; Cobain said, &quot;When I write a song the lyrics are the least important subject. I can go through two or three different subjects in a song and the title can mean absolutely nothing at all.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Robb, John. &quot;White Heat&quot;. ''Sounds''. October 21, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; Cobain told ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' in 1993 that he &quot;didn't give a flying fuck&quot; what the lyrics on ''Bleach'' were about, figuring &quot;Let's just scream some negative lyrics and as long as they're not sexist and don't get too embarrassing it'll be okay&quot;, while the lyrics to ''Nevermind'' were taken from two years of poetry he had accumulated, which he cut up and chose lines he preferred from. In comparison, Cobain stated that the lyrics to ''In Utero'' were &quot;more focused, they're almost built on themes&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;smashing&quot;&gt;Steinke, Darcey. &quot;Smashing Their Heads on That Punk Rock&quot;. ''Spin''. October 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; Cobain didn't write necessarily in a linear fashion, instead relying on juxtapositions of contradictory images to convey emotions and ideas. Often in his lyrics, Cobain would present an idea then reject it; the songwriter explained, &quot;I'm such a nihilistic jerk half the time and other times I'm so vulnerable and sincere [. . . The songs are] like a mixture of both of them. That's how most people my age are.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Azerrad, 1994. p. 210–11&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
[[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] wrote that prior to Nirvana, &quot;alternative music was consigned to specialty sections of record stores, and major labels considered it to be, at the very most, a tax write-off&quot;. Following the release of ''Nevermind'', &quot;nothing was ever quite the same, for better and for worse&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nirvana bio&quot;&gt;Erlewine, Stephen Thomas.

Retrieved October 19, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; While other alternative bands had had hits before, Nirvana &quot;broke down the doors forever&quot;, according to Erlewine. Erlewine further stated that Nirvana's breakthrough &quot;didn't eliminate the underground&quot;, but rather &quot;just gave it more exposure&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;American altrock&quot;&gt;Erlewine, Stephen Thomas.

Retrieved January 18, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, [[Jon Pareles]] of ''The New York Times'' reported that Nirvana's breakthrough had made others in the alternative scene impatient for achieving similar success, noting, &quot;Suddenly, all bets are off. No one has the inside track on which of dozens, perhaps hundreds, of ornery, obstreperous, unkempt bands might next appeal to the mall-walking millions&quot;. Record company executives offered large advances and record deals to bands, and previous strategies of building audiences for alternative rock groups had been replaced by the opportunity to achieve mainstream popularity quickly.&lt;ref&gt;Pareles, Jon.

Retrieved January 17, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Erlewine stated that Nirvana's breakthrough &quot;popularized so-called '[[Generation X]]' and 'slacker' culture&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;American altrock&quot;/&gt; Immediately following Cobain's death, numerous headlines referred to Nirvana's frontman as &quot;the voice of a generation&quot;, although he had rejected such labeling during his lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;Rich, Frank.

Retrieved January 17, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Reflecting on Cobain's death over ten years later, [[MSNBC]]'s Eric Olsen wrote, &quot;In the intervening decade, Cobain, a small, frail but handsome man in life, has become an abstract Generation X icon, viewed by many as the 'last real rock star' [. . .] a messiah and martyr whose every utterance has been plundered and parsed&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;10 years later&quot; /&gt;
