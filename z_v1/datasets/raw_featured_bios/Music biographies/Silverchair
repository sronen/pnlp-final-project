'''Silverchair''' &lt;!-- DO NOT change this to &quot;was&quot;: &quot;were&quot; is correct in Australian English for a band, which are treated as plurals. Past tense is also correct as the 'indefinite hibernation' is the band's euphemism for 'its over'.--&gt;were an Australian [[Rock music|rock]] band, which formed in 1992 as Innocent Criminals in [[Merewether, New South Wales|Merewether]], [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]] with the line-up of [[Ben Gillies]] on drums, [[Chris Joannou]] on bass guitar and [[Daniel Johns]] on vocals and guitars. The group got their big break in mid-1994 when they won a national demo competition conducted by [[SBS One|SBS TV]] show ''Nomad'' and ABC radio station, [[Triple J]]. The band were signed by [[Murmur (record label)|Murmur]], and were successful on the Australian and international rock stages.

As from 2011, Silverchair have won a record number of 21 [[ARIA Music Awards]] from 49 nominations. The band have also received six [[APRA Awards]] with Johns winning three songwriting awards at the [[APRA Awards of 2008|2008 ceremony]]. All five of their studio albums have peaked at number-one on the [[ARIA Charts|ARIA Albums Chart]]: ''[[Frogstomp]]'' (1995), ''[[Freak Show (album)|Freak Show]]'' (1997), ''[[Neon Ballroom]]'' (1999), ''[[Diorama (album)|Diorama]]'' (2002) and ''[[Young Modern]]'' (2007). Three of the group's singles have reached number-one on the related ARIA Singles Chart: &quot;[[Tomorrow (Silverchair song)|Tomorrow]]&quot; (1994), &quot;[[Freak (Silverchair song)|Freak]]&quot; (1997) and &quot;[[Straight Lines (song)|Straight Lines]]&quot; (2007).

Silverchair's alternate rock sound has evolved throughout their career, differing styles on specific albums steadily growing more ambitious over the years, from grunge on their debut to more recent work displaying orchestral and art rock influences. The songwriting and singing of Johns has improved steadily while the band has developed an increased element of complexity. In 2003, following the release of ''Diorama'', the band announced a [[wikt:hiatus|hiatus]], during which time members recorded with side projects [[The Dissociatives]], [[The Mess Hall]], and [[Tambalane]]. Silverchair were reunited at the 2005 [[Wave Aid]] concerts, and, in 2007, they played the [[Across the Great Divide tour]] with contemporaries [[Powderfinger]]. In May 2011, Silverchair announced an indefinite hiatus. As from that month, the group have sold in excess of six million albums.

Johns had written about 50 songs during the hiatus for a possible solo album or other project but decided to use them for Silverchair.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacNeil&quot;/&gt; In 2006, after five weeks practice the group demoed tracks in the [[Hunter Valley]], and then recorded at Los Angeles' Seedy Underbelly Studios with Launay as producer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spencer&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ErlewineLeahey&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.billboard.com/artist/silverchair/121521#/artist/silverchair/bio/121521 | title = Silverchair | last1 = Erlewine | first1 = Stephen Thomas | last2 = Leahey | first2 = Andrew | work = [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] | publisher = [[Prometheus Global Media]] | accessdate =17 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Parks again arranged orchestral tracks for the band – they travelled to [[Prague]] to record with the [[Czech Philharmonic Orchestra]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Nimmervoll&quot;/&gt; The group also used Mac, [[Luke Steele (singer)|Luke Steele]] ([[The Sleepy Jackson]]) and [[Julian Hamilton]] ([[The Presets]], The Dissociatives) – Hamilton also co-wrote songs with Johns.&lt;ref name=&quot;NLAYoung&quot;&gt;{{cite web | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/62V4IId4t | url = http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/4298151 | title = Young modern &lt;nowiki&gt;[music]&lt;/nowiki&gt; / Silverchair ; &lt;nowiki&gt;[words by Daniel Johns ; music by Daniel Johns and Julian Hamilton]&lt;/nowiki&gt; | work = catalogue | publisher = National Library of Australia | archivedate = 17 October 2011 | accessdate =17 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Silverchair self-funded the album's production to ease the pressures faced previously when working with a record label.&lt;ref name=&quot;AMGBio&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ErlewineLeahey&quot;/&gt;

According to Silverchair's website, as of June 2009, the group had begun work on the follow-up to ''Young Modern'', they had spent three weeks recording in Australia with future sessions earmarked for later that year. No release date was set, but the band uploaded in-studio videos of them working on several tracks to their official website. In December, Johns called in to Triple J's breakfast show, ''Robbie, Marieke and The Doctor'', and discussed the band's new album which they were working on in Newcastle. He told them &quot;the main difference is there's a lot of experimentation with instruments and synths... I think there's only guitar on four songs out of fifty so far,&quot; but added the new material is &quot;surprisingly rocky given there’s no guitar.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;TripleJRobbie&quot;&gt;{{cite video | people = [[Daniel Johns]] (interviewee), [[Robbie Buck]], [[Marieke Hardy]], [[Lindsay McDougall|Lindsay &quot;The Doctor&quot; McDougall]] (interviewers)| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/62VikKnnu | url = http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/media/s2760836.htm | publisher = Triple J.

''Sydney Morning Herald''{{'}}s music writer, Bernard Zuel, said the band's use of &quot;indefinite hibernation&quot; was a way to soften the blow of the group's break-up for fans, he expected future reunions and performances for worthy causes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zuel02&quot;&gt;{{cite news | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/62W4Ei2Vd | url = http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2011/05/26/3227508.htm?site=newcastle | title = Silverchair lose their spark, but deny split | publisher = [[1233 ABC Newcastle]] (Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC)) | date = 26 May 2011 | archivedate = 17 October 2011 | accessdate =18 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By June, Gillies was in the final stages of about 12&amp;nbsp;months of working on his solo album and he said that it was not a continuation of his earlier work with Tambalane.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lau&quot;&gt;{{cite news | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/62WVF28H9 | url = http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/music/silverchair-drummer-works-on-solo-album-20110611-1fy1b.html | title = Silverchair drummer works on solo album | last1 = Lau | first1 = Kristie | work = Sydney Morning Herald | publisher = Fairfax Media | date = 12 June 2011 | archivedate = 18 October 2011 | accessdate =18 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In October, Johns was working on the soundtrack for ''My Mind's Own Melody'' – a short film.&lt;ref name=&quot;Halliwell&quot;&gt;{{cite news | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/62WhjL4HX | url = http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/new-spice-to-life-for-daniel-johns/story-fn6b3v4f-1226155211926 | title = New Spice to Life for Daniel Johns | last1 = Halliwell | first1 = Elle | work = [[The Daily Telegraph (Australia)|The Sunday Telegraph]] | publisher = News Limited (News Corporation) | date = 1 October 2011 | archivedate = 18 October 2011 | accessdate =18 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Silverchair are generally classified as an [[alternative rock]] and [[post-grunge]] band, although their loyalty to specific genres has changed as they have matured.&lt;ref name=&quot;McF&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Nimmervoll&quot;/&gt; Much of the band's early grunge and post-grunge work has been compared to Nirvana, [[Pearl Jam]] and [[Soundgarden]] and Black Sabbath.&lt;ref name=&quot;McF&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/silverchair/articles/story/5925227/qa_daniel_johns |title=Quick Silverchair Messenger|work=Rolling Stone |date=27 December 1996|accessdate=18 March 2008|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080608010454/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/silverchair/articles/story/5925227/qa_daniel_johns |archivedate = 8 June 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Australian rock music historian, [[Ian McFarlane]], &quot;''Frogstomp'' captured the tempo of the times with its mix of Soundgarden/Pearl Jam/Bush post-grunge noise and teenage lyrical angst.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;McF&quot;/&gt;

In their early years the perceived stylistic similarities led to Silverchair being derisively dubbed as 'silverhighchair', 'not Soundgarden but {{sic|hide=y|Kinder|garden}}' or 'Nirvana in Pyjamas' by the Australian media.&lt;ref name=&quot;McF&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Nimmervoll&quot;&gt;{{cite web | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/62OUYFdii | url = http://www.howlspace.com.au/en2/silverchair/silverchair.htm | title = Silverchair | work = HowlSpace – The Living History of Our Music| last = Nimmervoll | first = Ed | authorlink = Ed Nimmervoll | publisher = White Room Electronic Publishing Pty Ltd | archivedate = 13 October 2011 | accessdate =13 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Howitt&quot;&gt;{{cite thesis | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/62OVvcTap | url = http://www.hsc.csu.edu.au/society_culture/popular_culture/focus_studies/focus_grunge/pcgrunge.html | work = NSW HSC Online | title = Focus Study: Grunge | last1 = Howitt | first1 = Bernie | publisher = [[Charles Sturt University]] | archivedate = 13 October 2011 | accessdate =13 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter is a sarcastic conflated reference to the band's youth and the popular Australian children's TV series ''[[Bananas in Pyjamas]]''. McFarlane stated &quot;''Freak Show'' and tracks like 'Freak' were firmly in Nirvana territory with a hint of Led Zeppelin's Eastern mysticism.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;McF&quot;/&gt; Gillies noted that the band were inspired by the [[Seattle Sound]], as well as [[The Beatles]] and [[The Doors]], and were highly impressionable in their youth.&lt;ref name=&quot;Seattle&quot;&gt;{{Cite news | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/62XE9Kaeu | url = http://seattlest.com/2007/07/18/seattlest_inter_4.php | title  =Seattlest Interview: Silverchair Drummer Ben Gillies | work = Seattlest | first1 = Clint | last1 = Brownlee | publisher = [[Gothamist|Gothamist LLC]] | date = 18 July 2007 | archivedate = 18 October 2011 | accessdate =19 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Johns admitted that &quot;We were always influenced a lot by Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin it just so happened that we weren't very good at playing that style of music.

Australian rock music journalist, [[Ed Nimmervoll]], felt that Johns &quot;had never intended to use his problems for inspiration, but in the end the music was the best way to unburden himself. 'Neon Ballroom' took six months to record. The album's passion and musical sophistication proved to the world that silverchair were a force to be reckoned with&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nimmervoll&quot;/&gt; According to ''[[100 Best Australian Albums]]'', by three fellow journalists, [[John O'Donnell (music journalist)|John O'Donnell]], [[Toby Creswell]] and [[Craig Mathieson]], ''Neon Ballroom''{{'}}s lead-in track, &quot;Emotion Sickness&quot;, described Johns' life in the 1990s and &quot;addressed [his] desire to move beyond the imitative sounds of Silverchair's first two albums ... and create something new and original&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODonnell&quot;/&gt; &quot;Ana's Song (Open Fire)&quot; directly focussed on his eating disorder, &quot;[it] became a hit all over the world and opened up for discussion the fact that males could also be affected by anorexia.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ODonnell&quot;/&gt;

Allmusic's [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] felt ''Diorama'', &quot;was a shockingly creative and impressive step forward that showed the band shedding its grunge past and adding horns, strings, and mature lyrics to its arsenal.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;AMGBio&quot; /&gt; Fellow Allmusic reviewer, Bradley Torreano noted that &quot;they somehow kept going and kept improving ... Silverchair has grown up and put together a fine mix of orchestral pop and rock on Diorama.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;AMGDiorama&quot;&gt;{{cite web | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/62XL92t4Q | url = {{Allmusic|class=album|id=r596205/review|pure_url=yes}} | title = ''Diorama'' – Silverchair | last1 = Torreano | first1 = Bradley | publisher = Allmusic.

In writing ''Young Modern'', Johns tried to make the music sound very simple, in spite of a complex musical structure. The lyrics were written after the music was created, sometimes as late as the day of recording. As Johns dreads writing lyrics, he suggested that the band could produce an instrumental album at some stage in the future.&lt;ref name=&quot;Broadley&quot;&gt;{{cite web | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20100927223054/http://suicidegirls.com/interviews/Daniel+Johns+of+Silverchair/ | url = http://suicidegirls.com/interviews/Daniel%20Johns%20of%20Silverchair/ | title = Interviews &gt; Daniel Johns of Silverchair | publisher = SuicideGirls | first1 = Erin | last1 = Broadley | date = 16 August 2007 | archivedate = 27 September 2010 | accessdate =19 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Johns is the band's primary songwriter, and notes that while Joannou and Gillies do not have significant influence on what he writes, they are key to the band's overall sound.&lt;ref name=&quot;Follos&quot;&gt;{{cite news | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/62XMWZ6be | url = http://www.expressnightout.com/content/2007/07/young_moderns_silverchair.php | title = Young Moderns: Silverchair | work = [[Express (newspaper)|Express]] | publisher = [[The Washington Post Company]] | first1 = Tim | last1 = Follos | date = 24 July 2007 | archivedate = 18 October 2011 | accessdate =19 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For that album, Hamilton co-wrote four songs with Johns including the APRA Award winning &quot;Straight Lines&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;2008APRAAwards&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AMGYM&quot;/&gt; Joannou believed that ''Young Modern'' was simpler than ''Diorama'' but &quot;still as complex underneath with simple pop song elements&quot;. He said that much of the band's success resulted from trying to push themselves harder in recording and writing. Self-producing has allowed the band to do so without the pressures of a record label.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bolling&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.reaxmusic.com/articles/view/silverchair_interview_with_chris_joannou-426 | title = Silverchair: Interview with Chris Joannou | first1 = Stephanie | last1 = Bolling | work = reax | accessdate =16 February 2008 | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20081010232317/http://www.reaxmusic.com/articles/view/silverchair_interview_with_chris_joannou-426 | archivedate = 10 October 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gillies notes that Silverchair will often &quot;run the risk of losing fans&quot; with their work, and this was evident in the changes in musical direction in ''Diorama'' and ''Young Modern''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Seattle&quot; /&gt; However, he described this as a good thing, describing the fact &quot;that we haven’t been pigeonholed, and people really don’t know what to expect&quot; as one of the attractive elements of the band.

Rovi Corporation | first1 = Stephen Thomas | last1 = Erlewine | archivedate = 14 October 2011 | accessdate =14 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' however, claimed that the band had risen above their peers, applauding Johns' &quot;ragged vocals&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;RSFrog&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/silverchair/albums/album/129990/review/5941363/frogstomp |title=Silverchair: Frogstomp|work=Rolling Stone | publisher = Jann Wenner |date=2 February 1998|accessdate=13 February 2008|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070706201752/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/silverchair/albums/album/129990/review/5941363/frogstomp |archivedate = 6 July 2007 | deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Herald Sun]]'' journalist, Nue Te Koha praised ''Frogstomp'' for &quot;breaking the drought of Australian music making an impact overseas&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jenkins&quot;/&gt; However he felt &quot;It is highly debatable whether the three teens have gone to the world with a new sound or something identifiably Australian ... Silverchair's image and sound are blatantly ... Nirvana meets Pearl Jam&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jenkins&quot;/&gt; Nimmervoll disputed Te Koha's view, &quot;It's not original, it's not Australian. Bah, humbug ... It's just as well Britain didn't say the same thing when The Beatles reinvented American R&amp;B&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jenkins&quot;/&gt;

''Freak Show'' saw the band show more of their own musical style, rather than copying others,&lt;ref name=&quot;AMGFreak&quot;&gt;{{cite web | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/62XN4GuQn | url = {{Allmusic|class=album|id=r246793|pure_url=yes}} | title = ''Freak Show'' &gt; Overview | publisher = Allmusic.

[[Yahoo! Music]]'s Sandy Masuo described the lyrics as &quot;moving&quot; and &quot;emotional&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Masuo&quot;&gt;{{cite web | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20081204094105/http://music.yahoo.com/read/review/12062572 | url = http://music.yahoo.com/read/review/12062572 | title = ''Freak Show'' | publisher = [[Yahoo!

In ''100 Best Australian Albums'' (2010) their third album, ''Neon Ballroom'', was placed at No.&amp;nbsp;25 according to its authors.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODonnell&quot;/&gt; ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' approved of the further advancement in ''Neon Ballroom'', commenting on &quot;plush strings on these adult arrangements&quot;.&lt;ref name=EW /&gt; There were once again significant advancements in songwriting; Johns was described as &quot;furious, motivated, and all grown up&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;EW&quot;&gt;{{cite web | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/62XqEixuV | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,274828,00.html | title = ''Neon Ballroom'' {{!}} Music Review | work = [[Entertainment Weekly]] | publisher = [[Time Warner]] | first1 = Tom | last1 = Lanham | date = 19 March 1999 | archivedate = 19 October 2011 | accessdate =19 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, ''Rolling Stone'' said the album seemed confused, commenting that Silverchair &quot;can't decide what they want to do&quot; with their music.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chonin&quot;/&gt; Meanwhile, ''Diorama'' was seen as an extension of the band's originality, with its &quot;[h]eavy orchestration, unpredictable melodic shifts and a whimsical pop sensibility&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kemp&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/silverchair/albums/album/201588/review/5944466/diorama | title = Silverchair: ''Diorama'' | work = Rolling Stone | publisher = Jann Wenner | authorlink1 = Mark Kemp | last1 = Kemp | first1 = Mark | date = 8 August 2002 | accessdate =13 February 2008 | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070710191618/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/silverchair/albums/album/201588/review/5944466/diorama | archivedate = 10 July 2007 | deadurl = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[PopMatters]]' Nikki Tranter, the album stood out in an otherwise dull Australian music market.&lt;ref name=&quot;DioPopM&quot;/&gt;

Allmusic's Clayton Bolger described ''Young Modern'' as an improvement by the band, praising &quot;catchy melodic hooks, inspired lyrical themes, and stunning string arrangements&quot;. He claimed the album was the pinnacle of the band's development.&lt;ref name=&quot;AMGYM&quot;&gt;{{cite web | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/62WiEl0uu | url = {{Allmusic|class=album|id=r1041337/review|pure_url=yes}} | title =Young Modern &gt; Review | publisher = Allmusic.
