'''Michael Peter Balzary''' (born October 16, 1962), better known by his stage name '''Flea''', is an Australian-born American musician and occasional actor. He is best known as the [[electric bass|bassist]], co-founding member, and one of the [[composer]]s of the [[rock music|rock]] band [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]]. Flea is also the co-founder of [[Silverlake Conservatory of Music]], a non-profit music education organization founded in 2001. 

Originally a [[jazz]] [[trumpet]] prodigy, Flea learned to play bass in high school from close friend and future Red Hot Chili Peppers guitarist [[Hillel Slovak]], who required a bassist for his band [[What Is This?|Anthym]], and soon developed his own style. Flea joined the group, but quit several months later in order to play for the punk rock outfit [[Fear (band)|Fear]]. He then rejoined Slovak to form an intended one-off band Tony Flow and the Majestic Masters of Mayhem along with fellow high school alumni [[Anthony Kiedis]] and [[Jack Irons]]; the impromptu collaboration would ultimately give birth to the Red Hot Chili Peppers.

Highly regarded as one of the best rock bass players of all time, his work as a bassist incorporates several musical styles, ranging from aggressive [[Slapping|slap bass]] to more subdued and melodic techniques. Drawing influences from [[funk]] music and [[punk rock]], Flea centers his playing on simplicity and minimalism while viewing complexity as a device that should be used in moderation.  Aside from the Red Hot Chili Peppers, he has collaborated with many artists, including [[Jane's Addiction]], [[Atoms for Peace (band)|Atoms for Peace]], [[The Mars Volta]], [[Alanis Morissette]], [[Johnny Cash]], [[Young MC]], [[P (band)|P]] and as more recently, [[Rocketjuice and The Moon]]. Flea is ranked #2 on ''[[Rolling Stone]]''{{'}}s &quot;Readers Pick the Top Ten Bassists of All Time&quot;.

Flea has made numerous forays into acting, appearing in films that span many genres such as ''[[Suburbia (film)|Suburbia]]'' (1984), ''[[Back to the Future Part II]]'' (1989) and ''[[Back to the Future Part III|Part III]]'' (1990), ''[[My Own Private Idaho]]'' (1991), ''[[Motorama]]'' (1991) ''[[The Chase (1994 film)|The Chase]]'' (1994), ''[[Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (film)|Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas]]'' (1998) and ''[[The Big Lebowski]]'' (1998). He is also known for voicing the character, Donnie in the hit cartoon series, [[The Wild Thornberrys]].

Along with his Red Hot Chili Peppers bandmates, past and present, Flea was inducted in the 2012 [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] on April 14, 2012.

==Early life==
Flea was born in [[Mount Waverley, Victoria|Mt Waverley]], [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]], of [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] and [[Irish people|Irish]] descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nndb.com/people/982/000033883 |title=Flea |publisher=Nndb.com |date= |accessdate=2011-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father, Mick Balzary, an avid fisherman, often took him fishing.&lt;ref name=fcinterview&gt;{{cite web|url=http://youtube.com/watch?v=DYzpn6vLBgo|title=Red Hot Chili Peppers Fan Club Interview, 1989|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=2007-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Flea was five, his family moved to [[Larchmont, New York]] for his father's career.&lt;ref name=apterp19&gt;Apter, 2004. p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; In 1971, his parents divorced and his father returned to Australia. Flea and his siblings stayed with their mother Patricia, who soon remarried to a jazz musician.&lt;ref name=apterp19/&gt; Flea's stepfather, Walter Abdul Urban (1941–2011), frequently invited musicians to his house, where  [[jam session]]s would often take place. The family moved again to [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], where Flea became fascinated with the [[trumpet]].&lt;ref name=apterpg20&gt;Apter, 2004. p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AMGbio&gt;{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p76467|pure_url=yes}}|title=Biography of Flea|author=Prato, Greg|accessdate=2007-12-15|publisher=[[Allmusic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had no interest in [[rock music]] at the time; he idolized jazz musicians like [[Miles Davis]], [[Louis Armstrong]] and [[Dizzy Gillespie]].&lt;ref name=apterpg20/&gt; 

His stepfather was an &quot;aggressive alcoholic&quot; who eventually became involved in shoot-outs with police. &quot;I was raised in a very violent, alcoholic household,&quot; Flea later said, &quot;I grew up being terrified of my parents, particularly my father figures. It caused [me] a lot of trouble later in life.&quot;&lt;ref name=apterpg21&gt;Apter, 2004. p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; To cope, Flea began smoking [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] at 13, and became a daily user.&lt;ref name=apterpgs20&gt;Apter, 2004. pp. 22–23&lt;/ref&gt;

Flea attended [[Fairfax High School (Los Angeles)|Fairfax High School]], and was somewhat of an outcast due to his taste in music.&lt;ref name=apterpgs20/&gt; However, he soon met [[Anthony Kiedis]], and after a brief confrontation, the two became best friends.&lt;ref name=apterpg34&gt;Apter, 2004. p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; Kiedis recalled: &quot;We were drawn to each other by the forces of mischief and love and we became virtually inseparable. We were both social outcasts. We found each other and it turned out to be the longest-lasting friendship of my life.&quot;&lt;ref name=apterpg35&gt;Apter, 2004. p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; Flea was turned on to [[rock music]], particularly [[punk rock]] by a friend in high school named [[Hillel Slovak]]. Slovak asked him to be a bassist in a punk band he was starting. He met Anthony Kiedis; they became roommates and after a time, they were offered a gig and played under a preliminary name. However, every show after that, they were referred to as the Red Hot Chili Peppers.&lt;ref name=&quot;bassbook&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Croyay|first=Karl|title=The Bass Player Book Equipment, Technique &amp; Artists|year=1999|publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation|isbn=0879305738|pages=194–199}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===1984–1990: First four albums===
The band's concert repertoire grew to nine songs as a result of months of playing at local nightclubs and bars.&lt;ref name=apterpg62&gt;Apter, 2004. p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; The Red Hot Chili Peppers entered Bijou Studios to record a demo tape produced by the then-drummer of [[Fear (band)|Fear]] and subsequently secured a record deal with [[EMI]].&lt;ref name=VH1behindthemusic&gt;{{cite episode | title = [http://www.vh1.com/shows/dyn/behind_the_music/51363/episode_about.jhtml Red Hot Chili Peppers] | series = [[Behind the Music]] | network = [[VH1]] | airdate = 1999-05-30 | accessdate=2007-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Irons and Slovak however, decided to leave the Red Hot Chili Peppers in order to pursue a &quot;more serious&quot; future with rock band [[What Is This?]].&lt;ref name=apterpgs70&gt;Apter, 2004. pp. 70–74&lt;/ref&gt; Flea ultimately respected the decision, but felt the band would be lost without them. He and Kiedis hired drummer [[Cliff Martinez]] and guitarist [[Jack Sherman (guitarist)|Jack Sherman]] to fill Iron's and Slovak's places, respectively.&lt;ref name=apterpgs70/&gt; [[Andy Gill]], formerly of [[Gang of Four (band)|Gang of Four]], agreed to produce their first album. Gill and Sherman clashed with Flea and Kiedis; they continuously argued over music style, sound, and the album's production.&lt;ref name=apterpgs78&gt;Apter, 2004. pp. 78–88&lt;/ref&gt; Flea himself felt that the album was stiff and &quot;a big mistake&quot;, but also admitted &quot;we [he and Kiedis] were just disrespectful and obnoxious&quot;.&lt;ref name=MOJO&gt;Page, Scarlet (July, 2004). &quot;Red Hot Chili Peppers: The LA Punks Who Defied Death, Grunge And A Burning Crack Den&quot;. ''Mojo''.&lt;/ref&gt; The band's eponymous debut album, ''[[The Red Hot Chili Peppers (album)|The Red Hot Chili Peppers]]'', was released on August 10, 1984 to largely poor critical and commercial review.&lt;ref&gt;Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. pp. 234–235&lt;/ref&gt; After a relatively unfruitful tour, Sherman was fired in early 1985. Slovak, who had been contemplating a return to the Chili Peppers, rejoined the group after being encouraged by Flea.&lt;ref name=RHCPbio&gt;{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p5241|pure_url=yes}}|title=Red Hot Chili Peppers Biography|author=Prato, Greg|accessdate=2007-12-15|publisher=Allmusic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Funk musician [[George Clinton (funk musician)|George Clinton]] was hired to produce the band's second album, ''[[Freaky Styley]]''. The strong chemistry between Clinton and the Chili Peppers was felt instantly. Flea later referred to Clinton as &quot;the warmest, kindest man in the world&quot;.&lt;ref name=apterpg110&gt;Apter, 2004. p. 110&lt;/ref&gt; ''Freaky Styley'' was released in August 1985. It received only a bit more attention than ''The Red Hot Chili Peppers'' with roughly 75,000 copies sold by year's end.&lt;ref name=MOJO/&gt; Flea was somewhat indifferent to the poor album sales as he had recently proposed to girlfriend Loesha Zeviar, who was pregnant with their child.&lt;ref name=apterpg127&gt;Apter, 2004. p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; The band hired [[Michael Beinhorn]], their last resort among potential producers, to work on their next album.&lt;ref name=aptr133&gt;Apter, 2004. pp 130–141&lt;/ref&gt; What Is This? had finally disbanded, and Irons returned to the Chili Peppers in mid 1986 after Martinez was fired. Flea, Slovak and Kiedis especially were involved in heavy drug use and their relationships became strained. Flea recalled that &quot;it began to seem ugly to me and not fun; our communication was not healthy&quot;.&lt;ref name=aptr133/&gt; Kiedis became dependent on heroin, leaving Flea and Slovak to work on much of the album's material by themselves. Flea and Zeviar married, and she gave birth to their daughter, Clara.

Kiedis was briefly kicked out of the band, and given a month to rehabilitate. Kiedis completed the rehab and rejoined the Red Hot Chili Peppers in Los Angeles to record their third album ''[[The Uplift Mofo Party Plan]]''.&lt;ref name=aptr133/&gt; Flea has referred to the album as &quot;the 'rockingest' record&quot; the band has ever made.&lt;ref name=aptr133/&gt; ''The Uplift Mofo Party Plan'' proved to be far more successful, commercially and critically, than the Chili Peppers' preceding albums; registering at number 148 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].&lt;ref name=billboardrhcp&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/red-hot-chili-peppers/chart-history/5507#/artist/red-hot-chili-peppers/chart-history/5507|title=Red Hot Chili Peppers Chart History|accessdate=2007-09-12|publisher=''Billboard''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the ''Uplift'' tour, Slovak's drug use dramatically increased. Flea's relationship with Slovak faded, and Slovak became isolated and depressed.&lt;ref name=MOJO/&gt; On June 28, 1988, Slovak was found dead of a heroin overdose. Flea reflected: &quot;I didn't really know how to deal with that sadness, and I don't think [Kiedis] knew how to deal with it either.&quot;&lt;ref name=MOJO/&gt; Irons, who was taking Slovak's death particularly hard, left the group.&lt;ref name=VH1behindthemusic/&gt;

Flea and Kiedis took some time to collect themselves, but decided to keep the band together. Guitarist [[DeWayne &quot;Blackbyrd&quot; McKnight]] and drummer [[D.H. Peligro]] were added, and the band entered the studio to record a new album. McKnight soon began to create tension within the group, as his style did not mesh with the rest of the band.&lt;ref name=Kiedis234-239&gt;Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 234&lt;/ref&gt; Peligro, the former drummer of the punk rock band [[Dead Kennedys]], was a friend of [[John Frusciante]], an eighteen year old guitarist and avid Red Hot Chili Peppers fan.&lt;ref name=&quot;rs-fricke&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/chilipeppers_tattooed_love_boys/page/1|author=Fricke, David|date=June 15, 2006|title=Tattooed Love Boys: After twenty-three years, nine albums, death, love, and addiction, the Red Hot Chili Peppers are at Number One for the very first time|accessdate=2007-10-02|publisher=''Rolling Stone''}}{{dead link|date=May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peligro introduced Frusciante to Flea, and the three jammed together on several occasions.&lt;ref name=apterpg178&gt;Apter, 2004. pp. 178–190&lt;/ref&gt; Flea was impressed with Frusciante's skill, and astonished by his knowledge of the Chili Peppers' repertoire. Flea realized that Frusciante could provide the spark McKnight was lacking.&lt;ref name=MMliner&gt;''Mother's Milk'' 2003 reissue liner notes&lt;/ref&gt; McKnight was fired, and Frusciante accepted an invitation to join the band.&lt;ref name=Kiedis234-239/&gt; Peligro was fired shortly thereafter; the Chili Peppers brought in drummer [[Chad Smith]] as his replacement.&lt;ref&gt;Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 242&lt;/ref&gt; Flea and Zeviar started to grow apart, and he began trying to recreate the memories of his adolescence by smoking marijuana on a daily basis.&lt;ref name=apterpg178/&gt; The Chili Peppers entered the studio, and completed recording of their fourth album, ''[[Mother's Milk]]'', in early 1989. Upon release, the album was met with mixed reactions from critics, but received far more commercial attention, peaking at number fifty-two on the ''Billboard''&amp;nbsp;200.&lt;ref name=billboardrhcp/&gt; After this, Flea made appearances playing the trumpet on Jane's Addiction's 1988 album ''[[Nothing's Shocking]]'',&lt;ref name=jans&gt;''Nothing's Shocking'' liner notes&lt;/ref&gt; and bass on the critically acclaimed 1989 [[Young MC]] album ''[[Stone Cold Rhymin']]''. He would also appear in the video for &quot;[[Bust a Move (Young MC song)|Bust a Move]]&quot;, the hit single from the same album.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Stone Cold Rhymin' credits | publisher = Allmusic | url = {{Allmusic|class=album|id=r28418|pure_url=yes}} | accessdate = 2008-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1990–1998: Mainstream success and side projects===
The ensuing ''Mother's Milk'' tour put a strain on Flea's marriage. In order to make money, he needed to tour, and therefore spend time away from his family.&lt;ref name=apterpg205&gt;Apter, 2004. pp. 205–212&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, he and Smith were arrested on charges of battery and sexual harassment after a performance on [[MTV]]'s coverage of spring break;&lt;ref name=MOJO/&gt; charges were eventually dropped.&lt;ref name=apterpg205/&gt; The band was, however, attracting over three thousand people per show; ''Mother's Milk'' had been [[RIAA certification|certified]] as a [[Music recording sales certification|gold]] record in early 1990.&lt;ref name=RIAA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH|title=RIAA Searchable Database|publisher=[[RIAA]]|accessdate=2007-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Billboard singles&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.billboard.com/#/artist/red-hot-chili-peppers/chart-history/5507|title=Red Hot Chili Peppers Artist Chart History: Singles| publisher=''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''| accessdate=2011-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the time Red Hot Chili Peppers returned to Los Angeles, Flea and Zeviar agreed to a separation.&lt;ref name=apterpg205/&gt; He tried to put the separation out of his mind by smoking marijuana and having sex with random [[groupie]]s when the band was on tour for ''Mothers Milk''.&lt;ref name=apterpg205/&gt;

When the tour was over, the Red Hot Chili Peppers severed ties with EMI and signed with [[Warner Bros. Records]].&lt;ref name=sctisswarner&gt;Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. pp. 261–262&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rick Rubin]], who had rejected an opportunity to produce ''The Uplift Mofo Party Plan'', agreed to produce their next album.&lt;ref name=apterpg220&gt;Apter, 2004. pp. 220–236&lt;/ref&gt; Flea had largely used the principal slap bass technique on the band's preceding four albums, and decided to downplay this style in favor of more conventional, melodic bass lines.&lt;ref name=Funkymonks&gt;''Funky Monks'', 1991. Warner Bros. Entertainment, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; To record the album, Rubin suggested a mansion that once belonged to magician [[Harry Houdini]]. Flea felt it was &quot;a creatively fertile situation&quot;, and decided to bring his daughter Clara with him.&lt;ref name=apterpg220/&gt; He and the rest of the band, excluding Smith, remained inside the house for the entire recording process. When not writing or recording the album, Flea spent a large portion of his time with Frusciante smoking large quantities of marijuana.&lt;ref name=apterpg220/&gt; The emotions Flea felt during the album's recording were like nothing he had ever experienced:&lt;ref name=MOJO/&gt;
{{cquote|When we [the band] made ''Blood Sugar Sex Magik'' we spent a lot of time jamming—every day, for hours and hours. I remember during that time Anthony went off and made a movie, and for a long time it was just me, John and Chad, and we'd just go in there and play. Me and John were hitting the bong and we just rocked and grooved forever. It was the first time we went in to make a record where there wasn't this feeling of being sort of intimidated by what was going to happen.}}
When ''[[Blood Sugar Sex Magik]]'' was released on September 24, 1991, it received an overwhelmingly positive critical response. The album peaked at number three on the Billboard Hot 200, and went on to sell over seven million copies in the U.S. alone.&lt;ref name=RHCPbio/&gt;&lt;ref name=billboardrhcp/&gt; The album's ensuing tour was critically acclaimed—the Chili Peppers commonly performed shows with over twenty thousand in attendance.&lt;ref name=p282&gt;Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 282&lt;/ref&gt; [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]]-based [[grunge]] band [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] also toured with them during the West Coast leg of their United States tour.&lt;ref name=p282/&gt; The massive attention the Chili Peppers started receiving, however, caused Frusciante to feel extremely uncomfortable, and he abruptly quit the band during the Japanese leg of the album's tour.&lt;ref name=rollingstonearticle&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/redhotchilipeppers/articles/story/5938432/the_naked_truth|title=The Naked Truth|author=David Fricke|accessdate=2007-08-10|publisher=''Rolling Stone''}}{{dead link|date=May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band hired guitarist [[Arik Marshall]] to complete the remaining tour dates.

Marshall was fired at the end of the tour, and the band added former [[Jane's Addiction]] guitarist [[Dave Navarro]] to record a new album. Kiedis was in the middle of a heroin relapse, which forced Flea to assume the role of lyricist, something he had not yet done. He wrote most of the song &quot;Transcending&quot;, and the intro to &quot;Deep Kick&quot;. Flea also wrote the lyrics to an entire song; &quot;Pea&quot;, in which he both played bass and sang.&lt;ref name=p341&gt;Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. pp. 341–344&lt;/ref&gt; These three songs appeared on the Chili Peppers' sixth record ''[[One Hot Minute]]'', which was released on September 12, 1995. The album received mixed reviews and was significantly less commercially successful than ''Blood Sugar Sex Magik''.&lt;ref name=RHCPbio/&gt; The ''One Hot Minute'' tour was ultimately cut short due to various injuries Kiedis and Smith received, and the Red Hot Chili Peppers decided to go on hiatus.&lt;ref name=apterpg290&gt;Apter, 2004. pp. 290–302&lt;/ref&gt; Flea began to practice [[yoga]], and slowly decreased his marijuana consumption.&lt;ref name=apterpg290/&gt; Due to the Chili Peppers' inactivity, Flea joined Navarro in a Jane's Addiction reunion tour in 1997, filling in for ex-Jane's Addiction bassist [[Eric Avery]]. Rumors spread that the band was breaking up, until Navarro stated otherwise: &quot;I want to clarify that the Chili Peppers are not breaking up&amp;nbsp;... Flea and I are more than happy to do both projects, time permitting.&quot;&lt;ref name=apterpg290/&gt;

Flea also had plans to record a solo album. He asked Chili Peppers manager Lindy Goetz to help him promote the record and his future solo career.&lt;ref name=apterpg290/&gt; Flea eventually abandoned the idea in favor of offering his bass services to other artists. He performed on over forty records from 1995 to 1998, ranging from [[Alanis Morissette]]'s ''[[Jagged Little Pill]]'' to former [[Minutemen (band)|Minutemen]] bassist [[Mike Watt]]'s debut solo album ''[[Ball-Hog or Tugboat?]]''. He also worked with [[Tori Amos]] and [[Michael Stipe]] on a track for the soundtrack to the 1995 [[Johnny Depp]] film ''[[Don Juan DeMarco]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Apter, 2004. p. 281&lt;/ref&gt; Navarro was fired from the Chili Peppers in 1998, and Flea questioned whether or not the Red Hot Chili Peppers would stay together: &quot;...&amp;nbsp;the only way I could imagine carrying on is if we got John [Frusciante] back in the band.&quot;&lt;ref name=pp2&gt;Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. pp. 390–395&lt;/ref&gt; Frusciante had completed drug rehabilitation in 1997 after a severe addiction to [[heroin]] and [[crack cocaine]] left him on the brink of death.&lt;ref name=&quot;pnt&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last = Wilonsky | first = Robert | url = http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/1996-12-12/music/blood-on-the-tracks/| title = Blood on the Tracks | publisher = ''Phoenix New Times Music'' | date = December 12, 1996 | accessdate = 2007-06-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Flea visited Frusciante in early 1998, inviting him back to the Chili Peppers; an emotional Frusciante readily accepted.&lt;ref&gt;Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 408&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993 Flea was diagnosed with [[chronic fatigue syndrome]] and was ordered to rest for a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Fitzpatrick | first = R | year = 2004 | publisher = [[Da Capo Press]] | title = Red Hot Chili Peppers: Give It Away: The Stories Behind Every Song | isbn = 156025579X | pages = [http://books.google.ca/books?id=pOnaN4uPapMC&amp;pg=PA140#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 140] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1998–2007: ''Californication'', ''By the Way'' and ''Stadium Arcadium''===
The band, with Frusciante back on guitar, began writing new songs during the summer of 1998 in Flea's garage.&lt;ref name=MOJO/&gt; He and Kiedis were less confident in writing the album, after the disappointing results of ''One Hot Minute''.&lt;ref name=MOJO/&gt; Flea had also recently broken up with his girlfriend of two years, Marissa Pouw, causing him to enter a state of depression,&lt;ref name=apterpg300&gt;Apter, 2004. pp. 304–311&lt;/ref&gt; which was only lifted when his daughter, Clara, comforted him after several weeks of crying.&lt;ref name=MOJO/&gt;

Flea was heavily influenced by [[electronica]] during the writing and recording of ''[[Californication (album)|Californication]]'' and he attempted to emulate this when writing bass lines for the album.&lt;ref name=apterpg300/&gt; ''Californication'' took less than two weeks to record; by contrast, ''One Hot Minute'' took over a year. When ''Californication'' was released on June 8, 1999 it received overwhelmingly positive critical reviews and sold fifteen million copies worldwide—more than ''Blood Sugar Sex Magik''.&lt;ref name=MOJO/&gt; The Chili Peppers played [[Woodstock 1999]], with Flea playing completely naked—something he would do again at the [[Reading and Leeds Festivals]] the same year as well as several other ''Californication'' tour concerts.&lt;ref name=apterpg300/&gt;

Flea felt like the public school system was seriously lacking in exposing children to music by drastically reducing, and sometimes eliminating, art related programs.&lt;ref name=laist&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laist.com/2007/05/02/fleas_circus_silverlake_music_conservatory_throws_hullabaloo_fundraiser.php|month=March | year=2007|title=Flea’s Circus: Silverlake Music Conservatory Throws Hullabaloo Fundraiser|publisher=LAist|accessdate=2008-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; He founded the [[Silverlake Conservatory of Music]], a school dedicated to help youth progress in music, because of this.&lt;ref name=laist/&gt;&lt;ref name=apterpg320&gt;Apter, 2004. pp. 327–338&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;I just wanted to fill the void that public education has cut from their curriculum. They've dropped the ball by cutting out music programs,&quot; Flea laments, &quot;I grew up in LA public schools and was in the music department. It was really an important thing for my life, it gave me something to hold onto, and it was an important access for me. Without music I would've gotten into a lot of trouble and there are a lot of kids like me out there. I just wanted to try to provide something like what I got.&quot;&lt;ref name=laist/&gt;

[[File:FleaOxygen06.jpg|thumb|left|Flea performing with Red Hot Chili Peppers at the 2006 [[Oxegen|Oxegen Festival]].]]
Red Hot Chili Peppers spent most of 2001 writing their eighth studio album, ''[[By the Way]]''. The entire band began listening to more melodic, textured music that would reflect heavily on the album.&lt;ref name=MOJO/&gt; Frusciante became the driving force behind ''By the Way'', causing initial strife between him and Flea.&lt;ref name=apterpg300/&gt; If the bassist introduced a funk rhythm into his bass lines, the guitarist would consequently disapprove.&lt;ref name=apterpg300/&gt; ''By the Way'' was released on July 9, 2002 to positive critical reviews. Although not as successful as ''Californication'' or ''Blood Sugar Sex Magik'', ''By the Way'' would go on to sell over nine million copies worldwide.&lt;ref name=btwsales&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/news/online_downloads/red_hot_chili_peppers_first_single_preview_posted_online.html|title=Red Hot Chili Peppers: First Single Preview|publisher=Total Guitar|accessdate=2007-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ensuing tour, however, was extremely profitable; the Chili Peppers performed three concerts in [[London]]'s [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] to over 250,000 attendees and a total gross accumulation of [[United States dollar|$]]17.1&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name=yahoonews&gt;{{cite web|url=http://new.music.yahoo.com/john-frusciante/news/chili-peppers-hot-in-londons-hyde-park--12178349|title=Chili Peppers Hot in London's Hyde Park|author=Waddell, Ray|month=June | year=2007|publisher=Yahoo!

===2008–present: Chili Peppers hiatus, return to school and ''I'm with You''===
After the band announced a long hiatus due to exhaustion, Flea enrolled in music classes at the [[University of Southern California]]. Beginning in the fall of 2008, the bassist is studying [[music theory]], composition and jazz trumpet. Flea attributes his interest in attending such courses to a newfound desire to widen his appreciation and understanding of music: &quot;it’s so much fun to learn this stuff because I never knew anything. I played trumpet in the school bands. I learned things I liked to play on my trumpet but I didn’t learn why this note goes with this note and why it produces that sound. Or how to create tension in the composition [...] Knowing the structure is really fun.&quot;&lt;ref name=latimes08&gt;{{cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/soundboard/2008/09/flea-usc-freshm.html|title=Flea, USC freshman, talks about his upcoming solo record|author=Wells, Annie|date=September 23, 2008|publisher=''Los Angeles Times''|accessdate=2008-09-29|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080927043430/http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/soundboard/2008/09/flea-usc-freshm.html &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt;|archivedate=2008-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flea also revealed plans to release a mainly instrumental solo record that was being recorded in his home; guest musicians include [[Patti Smith]] and a choir from the Silverlake Conservatory.&lt;ref name=latimes08/&gt;

Flea is also a part of [[Radiohead]] lead singer [[Thom Yorke]]'s live band with [[Joey Waronker]], Mauro Refosco and [[Nigel Godrich]]. The band performed two shows in Los Angeles in early October 2009, including the entirety of Yorke's 2006 solo album, ''[[The Eraser]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/#/news/radiohead-s-thom-yorke-enlists-flea-godrich-1004016673.story|title=Radiohead's Thom Yorke Enlists Flea, Godrich For Solo Live Gigs|last=Prince|first=David J.|date=September 29, 2009|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=[[Nielsen Business Media]]|accessdate=2009-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2009/10/live-review-thom-yorke-at-the-orpheum-theatre.html|title=Live review: Thom Yorke at the Orpheum Theatre|last=Powers|first=Ann|date=October 5, 2009|publisher=''Los Angeles Times''|accessdate=2009-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ensemble adopted the name [[Atoms for Peace (band)|Atoms for Peace]] and said they would perform dates leading up to an appearance at the 2010 [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival]].&lt;ref name=Spin&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spin.com/articles/thom-yorkes-supergroup-touring-april|title=Thom Yorke's Supergroup Touring in April|author=Vallejos, Tamara|date=February 25, 2010|publisher=''Spin''|accessdate=2010-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chili Peppers ended their hiatus in October 2009 though were without guitarist John Frusciante, who quit the band in order to pursue other musical interests. Frusciante was replaced by [[Josh Klinghoffer]]. The band began rehearsing and writing for their tenth studio album.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Montgomery|first=James|title=Red Hot Chili Peppers Say Josh Klinghoffer Was 'The Only Choice'|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1670041/red-hot-chili-peppers-josh-klinghoffer.jhtml|work=[[MTV.com]]|accessdate=20 November 2011|date=31 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;allmusic I'm with You review&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|title=I'm with You&amp;nbsp;– Red Hot Chili Peppers|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/im-with-you-r2254734/review|work=[[Allmusic]]|accessdate=20 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 20, 2011, Flea ran the [[LA Marathon]] to raise money for the Silverlake Conservatory of Music through [[Crowdrise]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crowdrise.com/flea |title=Flea 's Charitable Life on Crowdrise |publisher=Crowdrise.com |date=2010-08-04 |accessdate=2011-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flea was also featured in ''[[Runner's World]]'' magazine discussing his preparation for the race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Savin|first=Monique|title=Flea Rocks LA Marathon|url=http://www.runnersworld.com/article/1,7120,s6-243-544--13896-0,00.html|accessdate=20 November 2011|newspaper=[[Runner's World]]|date=15 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2011, Flea finished second in an online poll conducted by Contact Music to name the best bass guitarist in rock music. Flea lost to the late [[John Entwistle]] of [[The Who]]. Rounding out the top five were [[Paul McCartney]], [[Geddy Lee]] and [[Les Claypool]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/news.nsf/story/john-entwistle-named-best-bassist_1210683 |title=The Who &amp;#124; John Entwistle Named Best Bassist |publisher=Contactmusic |date=2011-04-01 |accessdate=2011-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 21, 2011, Flea appeared on the radio show of [[The Rolling Stones]] guitarist [[Ron Wood]], giving a interview and jamming with him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ronniewoodradio.com/2011/04/ronnie-flea/ |title=Ronnie &amp; Flea |publisher=Ronnie Wood Radio |date= |accessdate=2011-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flea commented about the Chili Peppers new album on April 30, 2011 through his Twitter page, saying the new album is a beautiful thing, a new thing, a warm thing full of love and violence and deep funky grooves for humans.&lt;ref&gt;http://twitter.com/#!/flea333&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 9, 2011, Flea announced that he is giving away a personally customized bass guitar covered with graffiti and a one-on-one bass lesson as a prize in a [[eBay]] auction. The auction will benefit ''[[Style Wars]]'', a 1983 documentary on early [[hip hop]]. The auction will raise money for restoring the film’s negatives. [[Brad Pitt]], [[James Franco]] and [[Spike Jonze]] also took part in the auction which ended on June 11, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/251365/Flea-donates-bass-guitar-to-charity-auctionFlea-donates-bass-guitar-to-charity-auction#ixzz1Oi6gtFKU|title=Flea donates bass guitar to charity auction|publisher=Express.co.uk|date=2011-06-09 |accessdate=2011-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2011, Flea was voted the second-best bass guitarist of all time by the readers of ''Rolling Stone'' magazine, being surpassed only by [[John Entwistle]] of The Who.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/photos/rolling-stone-readers-pick-the-top-ten-bassists-of-all-time-20110331/2-flea-0428412 |title=Rolling Stone Readers Pick the Top Ten Bassists of All Time|publisher=Rolling Stone |accessdate=2011-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a June 23, 2011 interview, Flea discussed the band's return and how he almost quit the Chili Peppers during their hiatus. Flea said that he just felt like he wanted to take two years away just to really look and see if the band was &quot;something we should still be doing.&quot; &quot;Things had gotten dysfunctional and not fun, even though I thought we were making great records, doing great shows and were a really powerful, mighty thing as a band. I was proud of what we did.&quot; &quot;For me, the biggest thing during the time off, and what really made me want to continue doing the band, specifically after decided he didn't want to continue in the band anymore, [was] I just realized, Anthony, man, he's my brother, I love him so much, and we started this band when we were kids. I wanted to keep that going, I never want to let that go. Playing with him is something, even though I can do other things that are exciting and beautiful and I always will do those things and I'll always want to grow and do music outside of the band, the thing that we have is special to us and something that is blood.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.spinner.com/2011/06/23/red-hot-chili-peppers-im-with-you/|title=Red Hot Chili Peppers' Flea Admits Band Nearly Split During 'Dysfunctional' Period|work=Spinner}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Red Hot Chili Peppers released their tenth studio album, [[I'm with You (album)|I'm with You]] on August 29, 2011. 

Flea played bass on 2 songs on [[Tom Waits]]'s 2011 album [[Bad as Me]], released on October 21.&lt;ref&gt;http://popblerd.com/2011/10/26/spin-cycle-tom-waits-bad-as-me/&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 27, 2011 it was announced that Flea's side-project with [[Damon Albarn]] and afrobeat legend, [[Tony Allen (musician)|Tony Allen]] would be called [[Rocketjuice and The Moon]]. According to Albarn on where the band's name came from, someone in [[Lagos]] did the sleeve design and that’s the name he gave it which he said he is fine with because trying to find a name for another band is always tricky. The band will make their live debut on October 29, 2011 in [[London]] and their debut album will be released in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.digitalspy.com/music/news/a347880/damon-albarn-flea-to-release-album-as-rocketjuice-and-the-moon.html&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 7, 2011, the Red Hot Chili Peppers were announced as 2012 inductees into the [[Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame]]. Flea commented on the induction by saying &quot;It’s always been easy for me to pooh-pooh these awards — the [Rock] Hall of Fame too. But I inducted [[Metallica]] a couple of years ago, and it was really a beautiful thing to see as all these people were being inducted. It made me love it. I love halls of fame anyway — the [[Basketball Hall of Fame]], the [[Baseball Hall of Fame]]. So I feel grateful for the recognition of what we have done and for the hope and potential of what we’ll continue to do.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;

==Personal life==
From 1985 to 1990 Flea was married to Loesha Zeviar (Loesha's name still remains tattooed on Flea's chest). Together they had one daughter, Clara Balzary, who was born in 1988. Clara has been featured in many Chili Peppers books and documentaries including the band's Funky Monks documentary. She also has appeared at many shows and as a child even provided artwork for the band's t-shirts and promotional material.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2497806/bio Clara Balzary - Biography&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; As an adult, Clara was most recently in the short-lived band, The Tints&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.purevolume.com/thetintsca |title=The Tints (Ca) on |publisher=Purevolume.com |date= |accessdate=2011-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is also an aspiring artist and photographer, taking the promotional photographs for the new Red Hot Chili Peppers record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clara-balzary.com/ |title=Clara Balzary |publisher=Clara Balzary |date= |accessdate=2011-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.urbanoutfitters.com/features/about_a_girl_clara_balzary |title=Urban Outfitters&amp;nbsp;– Features&amp;nbsp;– Clara Balzary |publisher=Blog.urbanoutfitters.com |date= |accessdate=2011-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Loesha currently works as a Resident Technician  at the Pasadena Recovery Center and was featured on the reality series, [[Celebrity Rehab]].

==Musical style==
{{quote box|quote=&quot;Any instrument is just a vehicle to express who you are and your relationship to the world. No matter what level you’re doing it on, playing music is an opportunity to give something to the world.&quot;|source=—Flea, ''Bass Player'', June 2006&lt;ref name=hadenandflea/&gt;|width=310px}}
Flea has displayed a wide variety of techniques throughout the years, ranging from his initial use of slapping and popping to the more traditional methods he has employed since ''Blood Sugar Sex Magik''. Greg Prato of [[Allmusic]] has noted that &quot;by combining funk-style bass with psychedelic, punk, and hard rock, Flea created an original playing style that has been copied numerous times&quot;. Flea stated in an interview that he was influenced greatly by [[Louis Armstrong]].&lt;ref name=AMGbio/&gt; Flea has been considered one of the greatest bassists of all time, with Greg Tate of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' saying &quot;if there were a Most Valuable Bass Player award given out in rock, Flea could have laid claim to that bitch ten years running&quot;.&lt;ref name=californicationreview&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/red-hot-chili-peppers/albumguide|title=''Californication'' review|accessdate=2008-01-16|publisher=''Rolling Stone'' magazine|author=Tate, Greg|month=June | year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Smashing Pumpkins]] front man [[Billy Corgan]] recalls that when he first saw the Chili Peppers in 1984, &quot;Flea was playing so aggressively that he had worn a hole in his thumb and he was literally screaming in pain in-between songs because it hurt so bad. Someone kept coming out and pouring crazy glue into the hole.&quot;&lt;ref name=VH1behindthemusic/&gt; Flea's sound is also determined by what type of instrument he plays. Before ''Californication'', he did not believe the actual bass held much significance: &quot;what mattered was how you hit them [basses] and your emotional intent, and I still think that's the bottom line.&quot;&lt;ref name=hadenandflea&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bassplayer.com/article/flea-haden/jun-06/20636|title=A Rock Star &amp; A Jazz Legend Find Common Ground In Music's Beauty and Depth|author=Leigh, Bill|month=June | year=2006|publisher=''Bass Player''|accessdate=2008-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flea owns a 1961 [[Fender Jazz Bass]], treasuring it for its &quot;old wood sound&quot;.&lt;ref name=hadenandflea/&gt; He has contributed to the Red Hot Chili Peppers' sound not only with the bass but by playing trumpet, as well; it can be heard on several songs, such as &quot;Subway to Venus&quot; and &quot;Taste The Pain&quot; from their fourth album ''Mother's Milk'' or &quot;Torture Me&quot; and &quot;Hump De Bump&quot; from their ninth album ''Stadium Arcadium''.

===Technique===
Flea's bass playing has changed considerably throughout the years. When he joined Fear his technique centered largely around traditional [[punk rock]] bass lines,&lt;ref name=intbass&gt;{{cite web|url=http://youtube.com/watch?v=JzkeyWNkhpY|title=Interview with Flea in 1988|accessdate=2008-01-16|publisher=[[VPRO]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; however he was to change this style when the Red Hot Chili Peppers formed. He began to incorporate a &quot;slap&quot; bass style that drew influence largely from [[Bootsy Collins]].&lt;ref name=apterpgs70/&gt; However, this technique caused Flea to receive attention from the music world and was often copied, and he therefore felt it necessary to completely remove slap-bass styles from his repertoire following ''Mother's Milk''.&lt;ref name=AMGbio/&gt; Consequently, ''Blood Sugar Sex Magik'' saw a notable shift in style as it featured none of his signature technique but rather styles that focused more on traditional and melodic roots.&lt;ref name=bassplayermag&gt;Malandrone, Scott (October, 1995). &quot;Flea Interview&quot;. ''Bass Player''.&lt;/ref&gt; His intellectual beliefs on how to play the instrument were also altered: &quot;I was trying to play simply on ''Blood Sugar Sex Magik'' because I had been playing too much prior to that, so I thought, 'I've really got to chill out and play half as many notes'. When you play less, it's more exciting—there's more room for everything. If I do play something busy, it stands out, instead of the bass being a constant onslaught of notes. Space is good.&quot;&lt;ref name=bassplayermag/&gt; During the writing and recording of ''One Hot Minute'', Flea integrated some use of slap-bass progressions, but continued to center his technique around the philosophy of &quot;less is more&quot; rather than complexity: &quot;I can't even think of anything I played that was complex [on the record]; even the slapping stuff is simple. It's original-sounding, and I'm proud of that—but what I played was more a matter of aesthetic choice.&quot;&lt;ref name=bassplayermag/&gt; This led Flea to alter the way he wrote music by playing alone, instead of the [[jam session]]s that would dictate how the band conceived songs: &quot;[''One Hot Minute''] is the least jam-oriented record we've made. I mean, we definitely jammed on the ideas, but there's only one groove on the whole album that came from a jam, 'Deep Kick'. The rest of it came from my sitting down with a guitar or bass.&quot;&lt;ref name=bassplayermag/&gt;

Flea became interested in [[electronica]] during the ''Californication'' era and he attempted to emulate the same atmosphere given off by [[synthesizer]]s into his bass playing: &quot;I feel the most exciting music happening is electronica, without a doubt.&quot;&lt;ref name=apterpg300/&gt; He ultimately decided against this, acknowledging that, aside from Frusciante, the band was not moving in the same direction.&lt;ref name=apterpg300/&gt; ''Californication'' also saw him incorporate more funk-driven bass lines than he had on ''One Hot Minute''. In ''By the Way'', much of the bass-lines were entirely stripped of funk. Flea felt the chords Frusciante had written were not supportive of his typical technique; furthermore, he does not feel the musical direction of the record was specifically melodic, but instead &quot;...&amp;nbsp;a result of each one of us being who we are. The way we [the band] compose music is a very communal thing.&quot;&lt;ref name=2002interview&gt;{{cite web|url=http://youtube.com/watch?v=R6jCs07_01U|title=2002 Interview with Flea|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=2008-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Influences===
Flea's stepfather was in a [[bebop]] band that frequently jammed in his presence; he, therefore, became fascinated with the trumpet soon after.&lt;ref name=AMGbio/&gt;&lt;ref name=VH1behindthemusic/&gt;&lt;ref name=MOJO/&gt; Flea credits his continued interest in music to jazz performers like [[Jaco Pastorius]], [[Miles Davis]], [[Duke Ellington]], [[Charlie Parker]], [[Louis Armstrong]], [[John Coltrane]] and [[Dizzy Gillespie]].&lt;ref name=apterpg20/&gt; After Kiedis introduced him to [[punk rock|punk]] and [[Rock music|rock]], Flea became infatuated with artists such as [[Black Flag]], [[Styx (band)|Styx]], [[David Bowie]] and [[Defunkt]].&lt;ref name=apterpg35/&gt;&lt;ref name=MOJO/&gt; Flea's early influences before ''Blood Sugar Sex Magik'' were mainly funk artists. They would become a notable aspect of the Red Hot Chili Peppers' sound up to ''Mother's Milk''. Originally, Flea was given the impression by punk bands that one should play as hard and fast as they possibly could, but ultimately rejected this philosophy during ''Blood Sugar Sex Magik'': &quot;I was so into being raw [...] it was all bullshit.&quot;&lt;ref name=hadenandflea/&gt; On ''Californication'' and ''By the Way'', Flea drew influence from electronica, [[gothic rock]] bands like [[The Cure]], [[Joy Division]] and [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]] and [[New Wave music]] rather than funk.&lt;ref name=apterpg320/&gt;

==Film and television appearances==
Flea has pursued a minor acting career since the mid 1980s. His first role was as young punk Razzle in the [[Penelope Spheeris]] film ''[[Suburbia (film)|Suburbia]]'' (1984). Shortly thereafter he starred alongside the Chili Peppers, who played themselves, in the skate drama ''[[Thrashin']]'' (1986). He played the ill-fated punker Milo in another Penelope Spheeris film, ''[[Dudes (film)|Dudes]]'' (1987). He also made an appearance in the [[Bruce Weber (photographer)|Bruce Weber]] documentary film about the life and career of jazz trumpeter [[Chet Baker]] entitled ''[[Let's Get Lost (film)]]'' (1988). He portrayed the character Needles in ''[[Back to the Future Part II]]'' (1989) and ''[[Back to the Future Part III]]'' (1990), though in an interview he referred to ''Part II'' as &quot;a multi-million dollar piece of trash&quot;.&lt;ref name=nozemsagogo&gt;{{cite web|url=http://youtube.com/watch?v=Gw2SW1fIWg0|title=Red Hot Chili Peppers; Nozems-A-GoGo|publisher=VPRO|accessdate=2008-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; He played a minor role in the 1991 [[independent film]] ''[[My Own Private Idaho]]'' as the character Budd. He played a number of minor roles in films throughout the 1990s, including ''[[Son in Law]]'' (1993) as a tattoo artist, ''[[The Chase (1994 film)|The Chase]]'' (1994) as a monster truck driver, ''[[Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (film)|Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas]]'' (1997) as a [[hippie]], in ''[[The Big Lebowski]]'' (1998) as a German [[Nihilism|nihilist]] and also the 1998 remake of ''[[Psycho (1998 film)|Psycho]]''. He has also lent his voice to the animated series ''[[The Wild Thornberrys]]'' as the character Donnie.

In 1991 the Red Hot Chili Peppers released a black and white film documenting the recording of ''Blood Sugar Sex Magik'' titled ''[[Funky Monks]]''. They have released two video concerts, ''[[Off the Map (video)|Off the Map]]'' in 2001 and ''[[Live at Slane Castle (Red Hot Chili Peppers video)|Live at Slane Castle]]'' in 2003—the latter of which had over eighty thousand attendees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.play.com/DVD/DVD/4-/140015/Red-Hot-Chili-Peppers-Live-At-Slane-Castle/Product.html|title=Live At Slane Castle|accessdate=2007-07-21|publisher=Play.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flea has also appeared in television broadcasts with Red Hot Chili Peppers on several occasions. Several months before Frusciante's departure in 1992, the band performed two songs on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''—Kiedis felt the show was an embarrassment due to the guitarist; he believed that Frusciante purposely played the song out of tune and incorrectly.&lt;ref name=apterpg290 /&gt;&lt;ref name=scartiss300&gt;Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. pp. 300–301&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, the band appeared in the popular animated comedy ''[[The Simpsons]]'' on the episode &quot;[[Krusty Gets Kancelled]]&quot;. At [[Woodstock 1994]], Kiedis proposed the band perform the first few songs in metallic suits with giant light bulbs placed on their heads.&lt;ref&gt;Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 315–323&lt;/ref&gt; Flea was initially reluctant but eventually agreed: &quot;...&amp;nbsp;when we got to play, the energy of the whole thing took over.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Apter, 2004. p. 276&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Flea appeared in the documentary, [[Bob and the Monster]]. The film details the life of musician and drug counselor [[Bob Forrest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://screencrave.com/2011-02-18/trailer-for-sxsws-bob-and-the-monster/ |title=Trailer for SXSW’s Bob and the Monster |publisher=Screencrave.com |date=2011-02-18 |accessdate=2011-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flea will appear in the upcoming documentary title ''[[The Other F Word]]'', which will air on [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] and will be released through [[Oscilloscope Laboratories]] (a company founded by [[Adam Yauch]]). The documentary, which was directed by [[Andrea Blaugrund Nevins]], will focus on a generation of punk rockers and how they have handled fatherhood and how they went from public rebel to domestic authority figure. [[Mark Hoppus]], [[Jim Lindberg]], [[Art Alexakis]] and [[Mark Mothersbaugh]] will also be featured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/risky-business/oscilloscope-showtime-acquire-rights-f-188506 |title=Oscilloscope, Showtime Acquire Rights to 'The Other F Word' Documentary |publisher=Hollywood Reporter |date=2011-05-15 |accessdate=2011-05-28 |first=Jay A. |last=Fernandez}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flea is also mentioned (alongside Slash and Ozzy) in the popular Super Nintendo game Crono Trigger. He is encountered throughout the game as a henchman to the games antagonist.
