'''Olivier Messiaen''' ({{IPA-fr|ɔlivje mɛsjɑ̃}}; December 10, 1908 – April 27, 1992) was a French composer, [[organist]] and [[ornithology|ornithologist]], one of the major composers of the 20th century. His music is rhythmically complex (he was interested in rhythms from [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] and from [[Hinduism|Hindu]] sources); harmonically and [[melody|melodically]] it is based on ''[[modes of limited transposition]]'', which he abstracted from his early compositions and improvisations. Many of his compositions depict what he termed &quot;the marvellous aspects of the faith&quot;, and drew on his deeply held Roman Catholicism.

He travelled widely and wrote works inspired by diverse influences such as Japanese music, the landscape of [[Bryce Canyon National Park|Bryce Canyon]] in Utah and the life of [[St. Francis of Assisi]]. He said he perceived colours when he heard certain [[Chord (music)|musical chords]], particularly those built from his [[Musical mode|modes]] (a phenomenon known as [[synesthesia|synaesthesia]]); combinations of these colours, he said, were important in his compositional process. For a short period Messiaen experimented with the [[Parameter|parametrisation]] associated with &quot;total [[serialism]]&quot;, in which field he is often cited as an innovator. His style absorbed many exotic musical influences such as Indonesian [[gamelan]] (tuned percussion often features prominently in his orchestral works). He was one of the first composers to use an electronic keyboard—in this case, the [[ondes Martenot]]—in an orchestral work.

Messiaen entered the [[Conservatoire de Paris|Paris Conservatoire]] at the age of 11 and was taught by [[Paul Dukas]], [[Maurice Emmanuel]], [[Charles-Marie Widor]] and [[Marcel Dupré]], among others. He was appointed organist at the [[Église de la Sainte-Trinité, Paris|Église de la Sainte-Trinité]] in Paris in 1931, a post held until his death. He taught at the [[Schola Cantorum de Paris]] during the 1930s. On the [[Battle of France|fall of France]] in 1940, Messiaen was made a prisoner of war, during which time he composed his {{lang|fr|''[[Quatuor pour la fin du temps]]''}} (&quot;Quartet for the end of time&quot;) for the four available instruments—piano, violin, cello and clarinet. The piece was first performed by Messiaen and fellow prisoners for an audience of inmates and prison guards. He was appointed professor of [[harmony]] soon after his release in 1941, and professor of [[Musical composition|composition]] in 1966 at the Paris Conservatoire, positions he held until his retirement in 1978. His [[List of students of Olivier Messiaen|many distinguished pupils]] included [[Pierre Boulez]] and [[Yvonne Loriod]], who became his second wife.

He found [[bird song|birdsong]] fascinating, believed birds to be the greatest musicians, and considered himself as much an ornithologist as a composer. He notated bird songs worldwide and incorporated birdsong [[Transcription (music)|transcriptions]] into most of his music. His innovative use of colour, his conception of the relationship between time and music, his use of birdsong and his desire to express religious ideas are among features that make Messiaen's music distinctive.

==Life and career==
===Youth and studies===
[[File:Messiaen1910.jpg|thumb|alt=A studio portrait. A young man stands with his arms folded; he has dark hair, and is wearing a dark Edwardian suit, a white shirt with rounded collars, and a dark tie, To his right, a young woman sits on a wooden bench; she has dark, medium length hair, and is wearing a white blouse and a long white skirt. She holds a young fair-haired boy, who is wearing a light tunic with flared skirt and embroidery at the neck, dark boots and short socks. He holds a walking stick in his right hand.

Olivier Eugène Prosper Charles Messiaen was born in [[Avignon]], France, into a literary family. He was the elder of two sons of Cécile Sauvage, a poet, and Pierre Messiaen, a teacher of English who translated the plays of [[William Shakespeare]] into French. Messiaen's mother published a sequence of poems, {{lang|fr|''L'âme en bourgeon''}} (&quot;The Budding Soul&quot;), the last chapter of {{lang|fr|''Tandis que la terre tourne''}} (&quot;As the Earth Turns&quot;), which address her unborn son. Messiaen later said this sequence of poems influenced him deeply and he cited it as prophetic of his future artistic career.&lt;ref&gt;Messiaen &amp; Samuel (1994), p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

At the outbreak of World War I, Pierre Messiaen enlisted and Cécile took their two boys to live with her brother in [[Grenoble]]. There Messiaen became fascinated with drama, reciting Shakespeare to his brother with the help of a home-made toy theatre with translucent backdrops made from old [[cellophane]] wrappers.&lt;ref&gt;Messiaen &amp; Samuel (1994), p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; At this time he also adopted the Roman Catholic faith. Later, Messiaen felt most at home in the Alps of the [[Dauphiné]], where he had a house built south of Grenoble where he composed most of his music.&lt;ref&gt;Hill (1995), pp. 300–1&lt;/ref&gt;

He took piano lessons having already taught himself to play. His interest included the recent music of French composers [[Claude Debussy]] and [[Maurice Ravel]], and he asked for opera vocal [[Sheet music|scores]] for Christmas presents.&lt;ref&gt;Messiaen &amp; Samuel (1994), p. 109&lt;/ref&gt; Around this time he began to compose. In 1918 his father returned from the war and the family moved to [[Nantes]]. He continued music lessons; one of his teachers, Jehan de Gibon, gave him a score of Debussy's opera {{lang|fr|''[[Pelléas et Mélisande (opera)|Pelléas et Mélisande]]''}}, which Messiaen described as &quot;a thunderbolt&quot; and &quot;probably the most decisive influence on me&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Messiaen &amp; Samuel (1994), p. 110&lt;/ref&gt; The following year Pierre Messiaen gained a teaching post in Paris. Messiaen entered the Paris Conservatoire in 1919, aged 11.

[[File:Classe-dukas.jpg|thumb|350px|left|alt=A group of ten young men and three young women, in early 20th-century dress, surround an elderly man with greying hair and beard. On the right some of the group lean over a table with open musical scores.|[[Paul Dukas]]'s composition class at the [[Paris Conservatoire]], 1929. Messiaen sits at the far right; Dukas stands at the centre]]

At the Conservatoire, Messiaen made excellent academic progress. In 1924, aged 15, he was awarded second prize in harmony, having been taught in that subject by professor [[Jean Gallon]]. In 1926, he gained first prize in [[counterpoint]] and [[fugue]], and in 1927 he won first prize in piano [[accompaniment]]. After studying with [[Maurice Emmanuel]], he was awarded first prize for the history of music in 1928. Emmanuel's example engendered an interest in ancient Greek rhythms and exotic modes. After showing [[improvisation]] skills on the piano Messiaen studied [[Organ (music)|organ]] with [[Marcel Dupré]] and inherited the tradition of great French organists (Dupré had studied with Charles-Marie Widor and [[Louis Vierne]], Vierne in turn was a pupil of [[César Franck]]). Messiaen gained first prize in organ playing and improvisation in 1929. After a year studying composition with [[Charles-Marie Widor]],&lt;ref&gt;Hill &amp; Simeone (2005), p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; in the autumn of 1927 he entered the class of the newly appointed [[Paul Dukas]], who instilled in Messiaen a mastery of [[orchestration]]. In 1930 Messiaen won first prize in composition.

While a student he composed his first published works—his eight ''Préludes'' for piano (the earlier ''Le banquet céleste'' was published subsequently). These exhibit Messiaen's use of his [[modes of limited transposition]] and [[palindrome|palindromic]] rhythms (Messiaen called these ''[[Retrograde (music)#Non-retrogradable rhythm|non-retrogradable rhythm]]s''). His public début came in 1931 with his orchestral suite ''Les offrandes oubliées''. That year he first heard a [[gamelan]] group, sparking his interest in the use of tuned percussion.&lt;ref&gt;For further discussion of Messiaen's youth, see, generally, Hill &amp; Simeone (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

===La Trinité, ''La jeune France'', and Messiaen's war===
[[File:Église de la Sainte-Trinité de Paris Face.JPG|thumb|alt=A 19th-century church in the French style, in light coloured stone, with a central tower with rounded top and smaller towers set back to left and right.|[[Église de la Sainte-Trinité, Paris|Église de la Sainte-Trinité]], Paris, where Messiaen was titular organist for 61 years]]

In the autumn of 1927, Messiaen joined [[Marcel Dupré|Dupré's]] organ course. Dupré later wrote that Messiaen, having never seen an organ console, sat quietly for an hour while Dupré explained and demonstrated the instrument, and then came back a week later to play [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]'s ''[[Fantasia and Fugue in C minor, BWV 562|Fantasia in C minor]]'' to an impressive standard.&lt;ref&gt;Hill &amp; Simeone (2005), p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; From 1929, Messiaen regularly deputised at the [[Église de la Sainte-Trinité, Paris]], for the organist [[Charles Quef]], who was ill at the time. The post became vacant in 1931 when Quef died, and Dupré, [[Charles Tournemire]] and Widor among others supported Messiaen's candidacy. His formal application included a letter of recommendation from Widor. The appointment was confirmed in 1931,&lt;ref&gt;Hill &amp; Simeone (2005), pp. 34ff&lt;/ref&gt; and he remained the organist at la Sainte-Trinité for more than sixty years.

He married the violinist and composer [[Claire Delbos]] in 1932. Their marriage inspired him to both compose works for her to play (''Thème et variations'' for violin and piano in the year they were married) and to write pieces to celebrate their domestic happiness, including the [[song cycle]] ''Poèmes pour Mi'' in 1936, which he orchestrated in 1937. ''Mi'' was Messiaen's affectionate nickname for his wife. In 1937 their son Pascal was born. The marriage turned to tragedy when Delbos lost her memory after an operation and spent the rest of her life in mental institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Yvonne Loriod, in Hill (1995), p. 294&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1936, along with [[André Jolivet]], [[Daniel-Lesur]] and Yves Baudrier, Messiaen formed the group ''[[La jeune France]]'' (&quot;Young France&quot;). Their manifesto implicitly attacked the frivolity predominant in contemporary Parisian music and rejected [[Jean Cocteau]]'s 1918 ''Le coq et l'arlequin'' manifesto in favour of a &quot;living music, having the impetus of sincerity, generosity and artistic conscientiousness&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;from the programme for the opening concert of ''La jeune France'', quoted in Griffiths (1985), p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; Messiaen's career soon departed from this polemical phase.

In response to a commission for a piece to accompany light-and water-shows on [[the Seine]] during the ''[[Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne (1937)|Paris Exposition]]'', in 1937 Messiaen demonstrated his interest in using the [[ondes Martenot]], an electronic instrument, by composing ''Fêtes des belles eaux'' for an ensemble of six.&lt;ref&gt;Hill &amp; Simeone (2005), p. 73f&lt;/ref&gt; He included a part for the instrument in several of his subsequent compositions. During this period he composed several multi-movement organ works. He arranged his orchestral suite ''[[L'ascension]]'' (&quot;The Ascension&quot;) for organ, replacing the orchestral version's third movement with an entirely new movement, ''Transports de joie d'une âme devant la gloire du Christ qui est la sienne'' (&quot;Ecstasies of a soul before the glory of Christ, which is its own glory&quot;). ({{Audio|Messiaen-ascension-3-latry.ogg|listen}}) This movement became one of Messiaen's most popular pieces. He also wrote the extensive cycles ''[[La Nativité du Seigneur]]'' (&quot;The Nativity of the Lord&quot;) and ''Les corps glorieux'' (&quot;The glorious bodies&quot;). The final [[toccata]] of ''La Nativité'', ''Dieu parmi nous'' (&quot;God among us&quot;), has become another favourite recital piece.

At the outbreak of World War II, Messiaen was drafted into the French army. Due to poor eyesight, he was enlisted as a medical auxiliary rather than an active combatant.&lt;ref name=&quot;Griffiths (1985), p. 139&quot;&gt;Griffiths (1985), p. 139&lt;/ref&gt; He was captured at Verdun and taken to [[Görlitz]] in May 1940, and was imprisoned at [[Stalag VIII-A]]. He met a violinist, a cellist and a clarinettist among his fellow prisoners. He wrote a trio for them, which he gradually incorporated into his ''[[Quatuor pour la fin du temps]]'' (&quot;Quartet for the End of Time&quot;). The quartet was first performed in January 1941 to an audience of prisoners and prison guards, with the composer playing a poorly maintained upright piano in freezing conditions. Thus the enforced introspection and reflection of camp life bore fruit in one of 20th-century European classical music's acknowledged masterpieces. The title's &quot;end of time&quot; alludes to the [[Apocalypse]], and also to the way in which Messiaen, through rhythm and harmony, used time in a manner completely different from his predecessors and contemporaries.&lt;ref&gt;See extended discussion in Griffiths (1985), Chapter 6: ''A Technique for the End of Time'', particularly pp. 104–06&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tristan and serialism===
{{See also|List of students of Olivier Messiaen}}
Shortly after his release from [[Görlitz]] in May 1941, Messiaen was appointed a professor of harmony at the [[Conservatoire de Paris|Paris Conservatoire]], where he taught until his retirement in 1978. He compiled his ''Technique de mon langage musical'' (&quot;Technique of my musical language&quot;) published in 1944, in which he quotes many examples from his music, particularly the Quartet. Although only in his mid-thirties, his students described him as an outstanding teacher,&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Boulez in Hill (1995), pp. 266ff&lt;/ref&gt; who, rather than imposing his own ideas, encouraged his pupils to find their own voice. Among his early students were the composers [[Pierre Boulez]] and [[Karel Goeyvaerts]] and the pianist [[Yvonne Loriod]]. Other pupils included [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]] in 1952, [[Alexander Goehr]] in 1956–57, [[György Kurtág]] in 1957, [[Tristan Murail]] in 1967–72 and [[George Benjamin (composer)|George Benjamin]] during the late 1970s. The Greek composer [[Iannis Xenakis]] was referred to him in 1951; Messiaen urged Xenakis to take advantage of his background in mathematics and architecture in his music.&lt;ref&gt;Matossian 1986, 48&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1943, Messiaen wrote ''Visions de l'Amen'' (&quot;Visions of the Amen&quot;) for two pianos for Loriod and himself to perform. Shortly thereafter he composed the enormous solo piano cycle ''[[Vingt regards sur l'enfant-Jésus]]'' (&quot;Twenty gazes on the child Jesus&quot;) for her. Again for Loriod, he wrote ''[[Trois petites liturgies de la présence divine]]'' (&quot;Three small liturgies of the Divine Presence&quot;) for female chorus and orchestra which includes a difficult solo piano part. In this way, Messiaen continued to bring liturgical subjects to the piano recital and concert hall.

Two years after ''Visions de l'Amen'', Messiaen composed the song cycle [[Harawi (Tristan Trilogy)|Harawi]], the first of three works inspired by the legend of [[Tristan]] and [[Isolde]]. The second of these works about human (as opposed to divine) love was the result of a commission from [[Serge Koussevitsky]]. Messiaen stated that the commission did not specify the length of the work or the size of the orchestra. This was the ten-movement ''[[Turangalîla-Symphonie]]''. It is not a conventional [[symphony]], but rather an extended meditation on the joy of human union and love. It does not contain the sexual guilt inherent in [[Richard Wagner]]'s ''[[Tristan und Isolde]]'' because Messiaen believed that sexual love is a divine gift.&lt;ref name=&quot;Griffiths (1985), p. 139&quot;/&gt;  The third piece inspired by the ''Tristan'' myth was ''Cinq rechants'' for twelve unaccompanied singers, described by Messiaen as influenced by the [[Alba (poetry)|alba]] of the [[troubadour]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths (1985), p. 142&lt;/ref&gt;  Messiaen visited the United States in 1947, where his music was conducted by Koussevitsky and [[Leopold Stokowski]]. His ''Turangalîla-Symphonie'' was first performed in America in 1949, conducted by [[Leonard Bernstein]].

Messiaen taught an [[Musical analysis|analysis]] class at the Paris Conservatoire, and in 1947 he taught in [[Budapest]] and in 1949 at [[Tanglewood]]. During the summers of 1949 and 1950 he taught in the [[Darmstadt New Music Summer School|new music summer school]] classes at [[Darmstadt]]. While he did not employ the [[twelve-tone technique]], after three years teaching analysis of twelve-tone scores, including works by [[Arnold Schoenberg]], he experimented with ways of making scales of other elements (including duration, articulation and dynamics) analogous to the chromatic pitch scale. The results of these innovations was the &quot;Mode de valeurs et d'intensités&quot; for piano (from the ''Quatre études de rhythme'') which has been misleadingly described as the first work of [[Serialism|total serialism]]. It had a large influence on the earliest European serial composers including [[Pierre Boulez]], [[Karel Goeyvaerts]], and [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]]. During this period he also experimented with [[musique concrète]], music for recorded sounds.

===Birdsong and the 1960s===
When in 1952 Messiaen was asked to provide a test piece for [[flautist]]s wishing to enter the Paris Conservatoire, he composed the piece ''Le merle noir'' for flute and piano. While he had long been fascinated by birdsong, and birds had made appearances in several of his earlier works (for example ''La Nativité'', ''Quatuor'' and ''Vingt regards''), the flute piece was based entirely on the song of the [[Common Blackbird|blackbird]].&lt;ref&gt;For a general discussion of Messiaen's fusion of birdsong and music, see Hill &amp; Simeone (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

He took this development to a new level with his 1953 orchestral work ''Réveil des oiseaux''—its material consists almost entirely of the birdsong one might hear between midnight and noon in the [[Jura mountains|Jura]]. From this period onwards, Messiaen incorporated birdsong into all of his compositions and composed several works for which birds provide both the title and subject matter (for example the collection of thirteen pieces for piano ''Catalogue d'oiseaux'' completed in 1958, and ''La fauvette des jardins'' of 1971). Far from being simple transcriptions of birdsong, these works are sophisticated tone poems evoking both place and atmosphere. [[Paul Griffiths (writer)|Paul Griffiths]] observed that Messiaen was a more conscientious ornithologist than any previous composer, and a more musical observer of birdsong than any previous ornithologist.&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths (1985), p. 168; see also Kraft (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sylvia borin.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|left|alt=A small bird sitting on a tree branch with a few leaves. The underneath of the bird is light coloured, the back and wings dark brown. The beak is dark brown.|The [[Garden Warbler]] provided the title and much of the material for Messiaen's ''La fauvette des jardins''.]]

Messiaen's first wife died in 1959 after a long illness, and in 1961 he married pianist [[Yvonne Loriod]]. He began to travel widely, to attend musical events and to seek out and transcribe the songs of more exotic birds in the wild. Loriod frequently assisted her husband's detailed studies of birdsong while walking with him, by making [[Sound recording|tape recordings]] for later reference. In 1962 he visited Japan, where [[Gagaku]] music and [[Noh]] theatre inspired the orchestral &quot;Japanese sketches&quot;, ''Sept haïkaï'', which contain stylised imitations of traditional Japanese instruments.&lt;ref&gt;Messiaen's visit to Japan is documented in Hill &amp; Simeone (2005), pp. 245–51, and there is a more technical discussion in Griffiths (1985) pp. 197–200. Malcolm Troup, writing in Hill (1995), additionally notes the direct influence of Noh theatre on aspects of Messiaen's opera ''St François d'Assise''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Messiaen's music was by this time championed by, among others, Pierre Boulez, who programmed first performances at his [[Domaine musical]] concerts and the [[Donaueschingen]] festival. Works performed included ''Réveil des oiseaux'', ''[[Chronochromie]]'' (commissioned for the 1960 festival) and ''Couleurs de la cité céleste''. The latter piece was the result of a commission for a composition for three [[trombone]]s and three [[xylophone]]s; Messiaen added to this more brass, wind, percussion and piano, and specified a xylophone, [[xylorimba]] and [[marimba]] rather than three xylophones. Another work of this period, ''Et exspecto resurrectionem mortuorem'', was commissioned as a commemoration of the dead of the two World Wars and was performed first semi-privately in the [[Sainte-Chapelle]], then publicly in [[Cathedral of Chartres|Chartres Cathedral]] with [[Charles de Gaulle]] in the audience.

His reputation as a composer continued to grow and in 1959, he was nominated as an ''Officier'' of the ''[[Légion d'honneur]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Hill &amp; Simeone (2005), p. 245&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966 he was officially appointed professor of composition at the Paris Conservatoire, although he had in effect been teaching composition for years. Further honours included election to the [[Institut de France]] in 1967, the [[Erasmus Prize]] in 1971, the award of the [[Royal Philharmonic Society]] Gold Medal and the [[Ernst von Siemens Music Prize]] in 1975, the [[Sonning Award]] (Denmark's highest musical honour) in 1977, and the presentation of the ''Croix de Commander'' of the [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[Order of the Crown (Belgium)|Order of the Crown]] in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;Hill &amp; Simeone (2005), p. 333&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transfiguration, Canyons, St. Francis, and the Beyond===
Messiaen's next work was the enormous ''[[La Transfiguration de Notre Seigneur Jésus-Christ]]''. The composition occupied him from 1965 to 1969 and the musicians employed include a 100-voice ten-part choir, seven solo instruments and large orchestra. Its fourteen movements are a meditation on the story of Christ's [[Transfiguration of Jesus|Transfiguration]]. Shortly after its completion, Messiaen received a commission from [[Alice Tully]] for a work to celebrate the [[United States Bicentennial|U.S. bicentennial]]. He arranged a visit to the USA in spring 1972, and was inspired by [[Bryce Canyon National Park|Bryce Canyon]] in [[Utah]], where he observed the canyon's distinctive colours and birdsong.&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths (1985), p. 225&lt;/ref&gt; The twelve-movement orchestral piece ''[[Des canyons aux étoiles…]]'' was the result, which was first performed in 1974 in New York.

In 1971, he was asked to compose a piece for the [[Palais Garnier|Paris Opéra]]. While reluctant to undertake such a major project, he was persuaded in 1975 to accept the commission and began work on his ''[[Saint-François d'Assise]]''. The composition was intensive (he also wrote his own [[libretto]]) and occupied him from 1975 to 1979; the orchestration was carried out from 1979 until 1983.&lt;ref&gt;programme for Opéra de la Bastille production of ''St. François d'Assise'', p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; Messiaen preferred to describe the final work as a &quot;spectacle&quot; rather than an opera. It was first performed in 1983. Some commentators at the time thought that the opera would be his valediction (at times Messiaen himself believed so),&lt;ref&gt;The composer in conversation with Jean-Cristophe Marti in 1992, see p. 29 of booklet accompanying the recording of ''Saint-François d'Assise'' conducted by [[Kent Nagano]] on Deutsche Grammophon/PolyGram 445 176; see also Hill &amp; Simeone (2005), pp. 340 and 342&lt;/ref&gt; but he continued to compose. In 1984 he published a major collection of organ pieces, ''Livre du Saint Sacrement''; other works include birdsong pieces for solo piano, and works for piano with orchestra.

In the summer of 1978, Messiaen retired from teaching at the Conservatoire. He was promoted to the highest rank of the ''Légion d'honneur'', the ''Grand-Croix'', in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;Hill &amp; Simeone (2005), p. 357&lt;/ref&gt; An operation prevented his participation in the celebration of his 70th birthday in 1978, but in 1988 tributes for Messiaen's 80th included a complete performance in London's [[Royal Festival Hall]] of ''St. François'', which the composer attended, and Erato's publication of a seventeen-CD collection of Messiaen's music including recordings by Loriod and a disc of the composer in conversation with [[Claude Samuel]].

Although in considerable pain near the end of his life (requiring repeated surgery on his back)&lt;ref&gt;Yvonne Loriod, in Hill (1995), p. 302&lt;/ref&gt; he was able to fulfil a commission from the New York Philharmonic Orchestra, ''[[Éclairs sur l'au-delà…]]'', which was premièred six months after his death. He died in [[Clichy-la-Garenne]].

On going through his papers, Messiaen's widow discovered that he had been composing a [[Concert à quatre|concerto]] for four musicians he felt particularly grateful to, namely Loriod, the cellist [[Mstislav Rostropovich]], the [[oboe|oboist]] [[Heinz Holliger]] and the flautist [[Catherine Cantin]] (hence the title [[Concert à quatre]]). Four of the five intended movements were substantially complete; Yvonne Loriod undertook the orchestration of the second half of the first movement and of the whole of the fourth with advice from [[George Benjamin]]. It was premiered by the dedicatees in September 1994.

==Music==
Messiaen's music has been described as outside the western musical tradition, although growing out of that tradition and being influenced by it.&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths (1985) p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; Much of his output denies the western conventions of forward motion, [[Musical development|development]] and [[Diatonic scale|diatonic]] harmonic resolution. This is partly due to the symmetries of his technique—for instance the modes of limited transposition do not admit the conventional [[Cadence (music)|cadences]] found in western classical music.

[[File:Messiaen Oiseaux exotiques excerpt.jpg|thumb|left|320px|alt=A page from a printed musical score. The tempo marking is &quot;Presque vif&quot;, and the orchestration is for wind, strings and percussion instruments.|''Example 1''. A page from ''Oiseaux exotiques''. It illustrates Messiaen's use of ancient and exotic rhythms (in the percussion near the bottom of the score &quot;[[Asclepiad (poetry)|Asclepiad]]&quot; and &quot;[[Sapphic stanza|Sapphic]]&quot; are ancient Greek rhythms, and Nibçankalîla is a decî-tâla from Śārṅgadeva). It also illustrates Messiaen's precision in notating birdsong: the birds identified here are the [[White-crested Laughingthrush|white-crested laughing thrush]] (''garralaxe à huppe blanche'') in the [[brass instrument|brass]] and [[woodwind|wind]] instruments, and the [[orchard oriole]] (''troupiale des vergers'') played on the xylophone.]]
His youthful love for the fairy-tale element in Shakespeare prefigured his later expressions of what he called &quot;the marvellous aspects of the Roman Catholic Faith&quot;—among which may be numbered Christ's [[Nativity of Jesus|Nativity]], [[Crucifixion]], [[Death and Resurrection of Jesus|Resurrection]], [[Ascension of Jesus Christ|Ascension]], [[Transfiguration of Jesus|Transfiguration]], the [[Apocalypse]] and the [[afterlife|hereafter]]. Messiaen was not interested in depicting aspects of theology such as [[sin]];&lt;ref&gt;Messiaen &amp; Samuel (1994), p. 213&lt;/ref&gt; rather he concentrated on the theology of joy, [[Agapē|divine love]] and [[Salvation|redemption]].

Messiaen continually evolved new composition techniques, always integrating them into his existing musical style; his final work still retains the use of modes of limited transposition. For many commentators this continual development made every ''major'' work from the ''Quatuor'' onwards a conscious summation of all that Messiaen had composed up to that time. However, very few of these major works lack new technical ideas—simple examples being the introduction of communicable language in ''Meditations'', the invention of a new percussion instrument (the [[Geophone (percussion instrument)|geophone]]) for ''Des canyons aux etoiles...'', and the freedom from any synchronisation with the main pulse of individual parts in certain birdsong episodes of ''St. François d'Assise''.&lt;ref&gt;See for instance Griffiths (1985), p. 233, &quot;[''Des canyons aux étoiles…''] is therefore not so much a synthesis, as has sometimes been suggested, but more a step into the future that also joins the circle with the composer's past.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as discovering new techniques, Messiaen found and absorbed exotic music, including Ancient Greek rhythms, [[Hindu]] rhythms (he encountered Śārṅgadeva's list of 120 rhythmic units, the deçî-tâlas),&lt;ref&gt;Messiaen &amp; Samuel (1994), p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; Balinese and Javanese [[Gamelan]], birdsong and Japanese music (see ''Example 1'' for an instance of his use of ancient Greek and Hindu rhythms).

While he was instrumental in the academic exploration of his techniques (he compiled two [[treatise]]s: the later one in five volumes was substantially complete when he died and was published posthumously), and was himself a master of music analysis, he considered the development and study of techniques to be a means to intellectual, [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]] and emotional ends. Thus Messiaen maintained that a musical composition must be measured against three separate criteria: it must be interesting, beautiful to listen to, and it must touch the listener.&lt;ref name=&quot;Messiaen &amp; Samuel (1994), p. 47&quot;&gt;Messiaen &amp; Samuel (1994), p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;

Messiaen wrote a large body of music for the piano. Although a considerable pianist himself, he was undoubtedly assisted by Yvonne Loriod's formidable piano technique and ability to convey complex rhythms and rhythmic combinations; in his piano writing from ''Visions de l'Amen'' onwards he had her in mind. Messiaen said, &quot;I am able to allow myself the greatest eccentricities because to her anything is possible.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Messiaen &amp; Samuel (1994), p. 114&quot;&gt;Messiaen &amp; Samuel (1994), p. 114&lt;/ref&gt;

===Western artistic influences===
Developments in modern French music were a major influence on Messiaen, particularly the music of [[Claude Debussy]] and his use of the [[whole-tone scale]] (which Messiaen called ''Mode 1'' in his modes of limited transposition). Messiaen very rarely used the whole-tone scale in his compositions because, he said, after Debussy and Dukas there was &quot;nothing to add&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Technique de mon langage musical&quot;&gt;Messiaen, ''Technique de mon langage musical''&lt;/ref&gt; but the modes he did use are all similarly symmetrical.

Messiaen had a great admiration for the music of [[Igor Stravinsky]], particularly the use of rhythm in earlier works such as ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'', and his use of colour. He was further influenced by the orchestral brilliance of [[Heitor Villa-Lobos]], who lived in Paris in the 1920s and gave acclaimed concerts there. Among composers for the keyboard, Messiaen singled out [[Jean-Philippe Rameau]], [[Domenico Scarlatti]], [[Frédéric Chopin]], Debussy and [[Isaac Albéniz]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Messiaen &amp; Samuel (1994), p. 114&quot;/&gt; He loved the music of [[Modest Mussorgsky]] and incorporated varied modifications of what he called the &quot;M-shaped&quot; melodic motif from Mussorgsky's ''[[Boris Godunov (opera)|Boris Godunov]]'',&lt;ref name=&quot;Technique de mon langage musical&quot;/&gt; although he characteristically modified the final interval in this motif from a [[perfect fourth]] to a [[tritone]] (''Example 3'').

Messiaen was further influenced by [[Surrealism]], as may be seen from the titles of some of the piano ''Préludes'' (''Un reflet dans le vent…'', &quot;A reflection in the wind&quot;) and in some of the imagery of his poetry (he published poems as prefaces to certain works, for example ''Les offrandes oubliées'').

===Colour===
Colour lies at the heart of Messiaen's music. He believed that terms such as &quot;[[Tonality|tonal]]&quot;, &quot;[[Musical mode|modal]]&quot; and &quot;[[Serialism|serial]]&quot; are misleading analytical conveniences.&lt;ref&gt;Messiaen &amp; Samuel (1994), pp. 49–50&lt;/ref&gt;  For him there were no modal, tonal or serial compositions, only music with or without colour.&lt;ref&gt;Messiaen &amp; Samuel (1994), p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; He said that [[Claudio Monteverdi]], [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], [[Frédéric Chopin|Chopin]], [[Richard Wagner]], [[Modest Mussorgsky|Mussorgsky]] and [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]] all wrote strongly coloured music.&lt;ref&gt;Messiaen &amp; Samuel (1994), p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;

In certain of Messiaen's scores, he notated the colours in the music (notably in ''Couleurs de la cité céleste'' and ''Des canyons aux étoiles...'')— the purpose being to aid the conductor in interpretation rather than to specify which colours the listener should experience. The importance of colour is linked to Messiaen's [[synaesthesia]], which he said caused him to experience colours when he heard or imagined music (he said that he did not perceive the colours visually). In his multi-volume music theory treatise ''Traité de rythme, de couleur, et d'ornithologie'' (&quot;Treatise of Rhythm, Colour and Birdsong&quot;), Messiaen wrote descriptions of the colours of certain chords. His descriptions range from the simple (&quot;gold and brown&quot;) to the highly detailed (&quot;blue-violet rocks, speckled with little grey cubes, cobalt blue, deep Prussian blue, highlighted by a bit of violet-purple, gold, red, ruby, and stars of mauve, black and white. Blue-violet is dominant&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;See Messiaen, Olivier ''Traité de rythme, de couleur, et d'ornithologie.''. See also Bernard (1986).&lt;/ref&gt;

When asked what Messiaen's main influence had been on composers, George Benjamin said, &quot;I think the sheer [...] colour has been so influential, [...] rather than being a decorative element, [Messiaen showed that colour] could be a structural, a fundamental element, [...] the fundamental material of the music itself.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;George Benjamin, speaking in interview with Tommy Pearson, broadcast on BBC4 in the interval of [[The Proms|Prom concert]] in 2004 at which Benjamin conducted a performance of ''Des canyons aux étoiles...'' Asked what made Messiaen so influential he said, &quot;I think the sheer—the word he loved—colour has been so influential. People, composers, have found that colour, rather than being a decorative element, could be a structural, a fundamental element. And not colour just in a surface way, not just in the way you orchestrate it—no—the fundamental material of the music itself. More than that I can't say except that for my own small world he was incredibly important, and an exceptionally special and indeed wonderful person. I met him when I was very young (I was 16) and stayed closely in touch with him until he died in 1992, and was immensely fond of him...&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Symmetry===
Many of Messiaen's composition techniques made use of symmetries of time and [[Pitch (music)|pitch]].

====Time====
[[File:Messiaen Instants défunts bar 1.jpg|thumb|300px|alt=A fragment of printed piano music in 3/4 time, the upper stave is marked &quot;ppp&quot; and &quot;expressif&quot;, the lower is marked &quot;mf&quot;.|''Example 2''. The first bar of the piano ''Prélude'', ''Instants défunts''. An early example of Messiaen's use of palindromic rhythms (which he called ''non-retrogradable rhythms'').]]
From his earliest works, Messiaen used non-retrogradable ([[palindrome|palindromic]]) rhythms (''Example 2''). He sometimes combined rhythms with harmonic sequences in such a way that if the process were allowed to proceed indefinitely the music would eventually run through all the possible permutations and return to its starting point. For Messiaen, this represented the &quot;charm of impossibilities&quot; of these processes. He only ever presented a portion of any such process, as if allowing the informed listener a glimpse of something eternal. In the first movement of ''Quatuor pour la fin du temps'' the piano and cello together provide an early example.&lt;ref&gt;For discussion, see for example Iain G. Matheson's article &quot;The End of Time&quot; in Hill (1995), particularly pp. 237–243&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pitch====
Messiaen used modes which he called ''[[modes of limited transposition]]''. They are distinguished as groups of notes which can only be [[Transposition (music)|transposed]] by a semitone a limited number of times. For example the whole-tone scale (Messiaen's Mode 1) only exists in two transpositions: namely C–D–E–F♯–G♯–A♯ and D♭–E♭–F–G–A–B. Messiaen abstracted these modes from the harmony of his improvisations and early works.&lt;ref&gt;Hill (1995), p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; Music written using the modes avoids conventional diatonic harmonic progressions, since for example Messiaen's Mode 2 (identical to the ''[[octatonic scale]]'' used also by other composers) permits precisely the [[Seventh chord|dominant seventh]] chords whose tonic the mode does not contain.&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths (1985) p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; For Messiaen the modes possessed colours.

===Time and rhythm===
[[File:Messiaen Quatuor Danse de fureur excerpt.jpg|thumb|450px|alt=A fragment of printed music, with one stave and no notations.|''Example 3''. An excerpt from ''Danse de la fureur, pour les sept trompettes'' from the ''Quatuor pour la fin du temps''. It illustrates Messiaen's use of ''additive'' rhythms – in this example the addition of unpaired semiquavers ([[sixteenth note]]s) to an underlying quaver ([[eighth note]]) pulse and the lengthening of the final quaver by addition of a [[dotted note|dot]]. It illustrates the use of what Messiaen called the ''Boris'' M-shaped motif (the last five notes of the excerpt).]]
Messiaen considered his rhythmic contribution to music to be his distinguishing mark among modern composers. As well as making use of non-retrogradable rhythms, and the Hindu decî-tâlas, Messiaen also made use of &quot;additive&quot; rhythms. This involves lengthening individual notes slightly or interpolating a short note into an otherwise regular rhythm (see ''Example 3''), or shortening or lengthening every note of a rhythm by the same duration (adding a semiquaver to every note in a rhythm on its repeat, for example). This led Messiaen to use [[rhythmic cell]]s that irregularly alternate between two and three units, a process which also occurs in [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky's]] ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'', which Messiaen admired.

A factor that contributes to Messiaen's suspension of the conventional perception of time in his music is the extremely slow tempos he often specifies (the fifth movement ''Louange à l'eternité de Jésus'' of ''Quatuor'' is actually given the tempo marking ''infiniment lent''); and even in his quick music he often uses repeated phrases and harmonies to make the speed seem static.

Messiaen also used the concept of &quot;chromatic durations&quot;, for example in his ''Soixante-quatre durées'' from ''Livre d'orgue'' ({{Audio|Messiaen-livre-7-soixante.ogg|listen}}), which is built from, in Messiaen's words, &quot;64 chromatic durations from 1 to 64 demisemiquavers [thirty-second notes] – invested in groups of 4, from the ends to the centre, forwards and backwards alternately – treated as a retrograde canon. The whole peopled with birdsong.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by [[Gillian Weir]], who discusses the work in Hill (1995) pp. 364–6&lt;/ref&gt;

===Harmony===
[[File:Messiaen Song of the Golden Oriole.jpg|thumb|300px|alt=A fragment of printed piano music, labelled with the French word &quot;Loriot&quot;. The music is marked &quot;Bien modéré&quot; with a tempo of 100 quaver (quarter-note) beats per minute, &quot;san sourd&quot; on the upper stave and &quot;coulé, doré&quot; on the lower.|''Example 4''. The song of the [[golden oriole]] from ''Le loriot'', part of ''Catalogue d'oiseaux''. The birdsong played by the pianist's left hand (notated on the lower staff) provides the fundamental notes, and the quieter harmonies played by the right hand (on the upper staff) alter their timbre.]] In addition to making harmonic use of the modes of limited transposition, he cited the [[Harmonic series (music)|harmonic series]] as a physical phenomenon which provides chords with a context which he felt to be missing in purely serial music.&lt;ref&gt;Messiaen &amp; Samuel (1994), pp. 241–2&lt;/ref&gt; An example of Messiaen's harmonic use of this phenomenon, which he called &quot;resonance&quot;, is the last two bars of his first piano ''Prélude'', ''La colombe'' (&quot;The dove&quot;): the chord is built from harmonics of the fundamental base note E.&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths (1985) p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

Related to this use of resonance, Messiaen also composed music in which the lowest, or fundamental, note is combined with higher notes or chords played much more quietly. These higher notes, far from being perceived as conventional harmony, function as harmonics that alter the timbre of the fundamental note like [[Mixture (music)|mixture stops]] on a [[pipe organ]]. An example is the song of the [[golden oriole]] in ''Le loriot'' of the ''Catalogue d'oiseaux'' for solo piano (''Example 4'').

In his use of conventional diatonic chords, Messiaen often transcended their historically banal connotations (for example, his frequent use of the [[Added tone chord|added sixth chord]] as a [[Resolution (music)|resolution]]).

===Birdsong===
Birdsong fascinated Messiaen from an early age, and in this he found encouragement from his teacher Dukas, who reportedly urged his pupils to &quot;listen to the birds&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;For this and what follows in Messiaen's work, see Kraft (2000).&lt;/ref&gt;  Messiaen included stylised birdsong in some of his early compositions (including ''L'abîme d'oiseaux'' from the ''Quatuor pour la fin du temps''), integrating it into his sound-world by techniques like the modes of limited transposition and chord colouration. His evocations of birdsong became increasingly sophisticated, and with ''Le réveil des oiseaux'' this process reached maturity, the whole piece being built from birdsong: in effect it is a [[Dawn chorus (birds)|dawn chorus]] for orchestra. The same can be said for &quot;Epode&quot;, the five-minute sixth movement of &quot;Chronochromie&quot;, which is scored for eighteen violins, each one playing a different birdsong. Messiaen notated the bird species with the music in the score (''Examples 1 and 4''). The pieces are not simple transcriptions; even the works with purely bird-inspired titles, such as ''Catalogue d'oiseaux'' and ''Fauvette des jardins'', are tone poems evoking the landscape, its colours and atmosphere.

===Serialism===
For some compositions, Messiaen created scales for duration, attack and timbre analogous to the chromatic pitch scale. He expressed annoyance at the historical importance given to one of these works, ''Mode de valeurs et d'intensités'', by musicologists intent on crediting him with the invention of &quot;total serialism&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Messiaen &amp; Samuel (1994), p. 47&quot;/&gt;

Messiaen later introduced what he called a &quot;communicable language&quot;, a &quot;musical alphabet&quot; to encode sentences. He first used this technique in his ''Méditations sur le mystère de la Sainte Trinité'' for organ; where the &quot;alphabet&quot; includes motifs for the concepts ''to have'', ''to be'' and ''God'', while the sentences encoded feature sections from the writings of [[Thomas Aquinas|St. Thomas Aquinas]].&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Richard Steinitz in Hill (1995), pp. 466–469&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
===Compositions===
