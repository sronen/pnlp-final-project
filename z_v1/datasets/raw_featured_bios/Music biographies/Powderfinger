'''Powderfinger''' was an Australian rock band that formed in [[Brisbane]] in 1989. From 1992 until their breakup the band lineup consisted of vocalist [[Bernard Fanning]], guitarists [[Darren Middleton]] and [[Ian Haug]], bassist [[John Collins (Australian musician)|John Collins]], and drummer [[Jon Coghill]].&lt;ref name=&quot;band-members&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://210.1.195.196/music/ozmusic-central/www.ozmusic-central.com.au/powderfinger/faqfile.htm#1p1|title=Who is in Powderfinger?|work=The Powderfinger FAQ|date=23 September 2002|accessdate=25 October 2007|author=Rice, Stephen; et al.|publisher=Powderfinger Central}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Powderfinger became a commercial success with their third studio album ''[[Internationalist (album)|Internationalist]]'' in 1998. They followed up that success with several hit singles and award-winning works, earning a total of eighteen [[ARIA Music Awards|ARIA Awards]] and making them the most awarded band behind [[Silverchair]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ARIA-history&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ariaawards.com.au/history-by-artist.php?letter=P&amp;artist=Powderfinger|title=Powderfinger ARIA awards history|accessdate=8 August 2007|publisher=[[Australian Recording Industry Association]]}} {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous Powderfinger albums have reached multiple-[[Music recording sales certification|platinum]] status, as well as top 5 rankings in the weekly [[ARIA Charts|Australian music charts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.australian-charts.com/search.asp?search=powderfinger&amp;cat=a|title=Powderfinger albums chart rankings|accessdate=20 October 2007|publisher=australian-charts.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Odyssey Number Five]]'', Powderfinger's most successful album earned over eight platinum certifications and ARIA Awards in five different categories.&lt;ref name=&quot;aria-accred-2004albums&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aria.com.au/pages/aria-charts-accreditations-albums-2004.htm|title=2004 Album Accreditations|publisher=Australian Recording Industry Association|accessdate=3 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

After the release of their first DVD ''[[These Days: Live in Concert]]'' and a &quot;[[best of]]&quot; release, Powderfinger announced a hiatus in 2005. The announcement of a two-month-long nationwide tour with [[Silverchair]] titled [[Across the Great Divide tour|''Across the Great Divide'']] followed the release of their sixth studio album, ''[[Dream Days at the Hotel Existence]]'' in June 2007.

Powderfinger was actively involved in philanthropic causes. In 2005, they performed at a [[WaveAid]] concert in Sydney, to help raise funds for areas affected by the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]]. Another performance at the [[Sydney Opera House]] in October 2007 raised funds for [[breast cancer]] victims and their families. The aim of their recent [[Across the Great Divide tour]] was to promote the efforts of [[Reconciliation Australia]], and to promote awareness of the gap in life expectancy between [[Indigenous Australia|Indigenous]] and non-Indigenous children.&lt;ref name=&quot;thedwarf&quot; /&gt;

On the morning of Friday 9 April 2010 Powderfinger announced at a press conference that they would be breaking up after their &quot;Sunsets&quot; tour, saying it would be their last ever as the band had musically said everything they wanted to say.&lt;ref name=&quot;breakup&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.novafm.com.au/article/powderfinger-will-break-after-big-tour|title=Powderfinger will break up after big tour|accessdate=9 April 2010|date=9 April 2010|publisher=Nova}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 November 2010, Powderfinger played their last concert as a band, signifying their departure and the splitting of Powderfinger.

== History ==
=== Formation and early releases (1989–1993) ===
Powderfinger was formed in 1989 by vocalist and guitarist Ian Haug, bassist John Collins and drummer [[Steven Bishop]],&lt;ref name=&quot;h2g2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A695531|title=Powderfinger - The Band|accessdate=25 October 2007|date=13 February 2002|publisher=BBC h2g2}}&lt;/ref&gt; who took their band's name from the [[Neil Young]] song &quot;[[Powderfinger (song)|Powderfinger]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;rockd&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Internationalists|publisher=JUICE Magazine|date=November 2001|author=Munro, Kelsey|accessdate=25 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the band's formation, the members had all played in other Brisbane-based outfits.&lt;ref name=&quot;pch&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://210.1.195.196/music/ozmusic-central/www.ozmusic-central.com.au/powderfinger/history.htm|title=Band history|accessdate=25 October 2007|publisher=Powderfinger Central|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band later sought an extra guitarist, Bernard Fanning, who Haug had met in a university class.&lt;ref name=&quot;hindley-bios&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindleysite.com/bios/bios.htm#Bernard%20Fanning|title=Bernard Fanning biography|publisher=Hindley Site|accessdate=24 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fanning took over the role of [[lead singer|lead vocals]] from Haug, and at the same time Jon Coghill joined the band, replacing Bishop after a &quot;mutual leaving.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Powder Pick Up To Cure All Your Allergies.|publisher=Concrete Press|date=14 May 1996|author=Budden, Matt|accessdate=21 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Powderfinger's final lineup change came with the addition of guitarist Darren Middleton into the band.&lt;ref name=&quot;rockd&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rockdetector.com/artist,6959.sm;jsessionid=EAFDD28E94BFB39BE30184BC24855E3D.rd1|title=Powderfinger biography|accessdate=24 October 2007|date=25 September 2006|publisher=Rockdetector|author=Sharpe-Young, Gary|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071013090227/http://www.rockdetector.com/artist,6959.sm;jsessionid=EAFDD28E94BFB39BE30184BC24855E3D.rd1 |archivedate = 13 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group consisting of Fanning, Collins, Haug, Middleton and Coghill remained as such since 1992.&lt;ref name=&quot;amg-bio&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p199806|pure_url=yes}}|title=Powderfinger profile|publisher=[[Allmusic]]|accessdate=24 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Powderfinger initially performed [[cover version]]s of other artists' songs, but gradually developed into writing and performing their own material.&lt;ref name=&quot;rockd&quot; /&gt; Playing a [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] show in [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]] in 1990, Powderfinger was booed off the stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=My Happiness review|author=Watson, Chad|publisher=''[[The Newcastle Herald]]''|date=10 August 2000|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, the group self-funded a recording of their early works and released them as a [[Powderfinger (EP)|self-titled]] [[extended play]], more commonly known as the ''Blue EP''.&lt;ref name=&quot;h2g2&quot; /&gt; The EP became successful and the group was signed by [[Polydor Records]].&lt;ref name=&quot;amg-bio&quot; /&gt; Upon its release in 1993, ''[[Transfusion (EP)|Transfusion]]'' reached the #1 spot on the [[alternative rock|Alternative]] [[ARIA Charts]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Powderfinger|publisher=''[[Rolling Stone]]''|author=McPherson, Matthew|date=January 1994|accessdate=25 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; replacing [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]'s &quot;[[Heart-Shaped Box]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;hindleysite&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindleysite.com/history/history.htm|title=Powderfinger band history|publisher=Hindley Site|accessdate=12 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group recorded their first music video for the EP's lead track &quot;Reap What You Sow&quot;. It was directed by David Barker, who went on to direct the next seven videos for the group.&lt;ref name=&quot;db&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://210.1.195.196/music/ozmusic-central/www.ozmusic-central.com.au/powderfinger/faqfile.htm#2p1|title=Have powderfinger made any video clips for their singles?|work=The Powderfinger FAQ|author=Rice, Stephen; et al.|accessdate=18 October 2007|date=23 September 2003|publisher=Powderfinger Central}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early albums (1994–98) ===
Powderfinger released their debut studio album ''[[Parables for Wooden Ears]]'' under Polydor on 18 July 1994. The album, which Fanning describes as the band's &quot;dark days,&quot; received limited radio coverage.&lt;ref name=&quot;hindleysite&quot; /&gt; Following the release, the band toured heavily appearing at the [[Livid]] and [[Homebake]] music festivals,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Make mine a double|author=Lawrence, Angie|accessdate=25 October 2007|year=1996|publisher=''[[Rave (magazine)|Rave]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; including an appearance at one of Australia's largest [[List of Australian music festivals|music festivals]], [[Big Day Out]], in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bigdayout.com/history/pastlineups.php#1994|title=Big Day Out lineups history|publisher=[[Big Day Out]]|accessdate=23 November 2007|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071030035145/http://www.bigdayout.com/history/pastlineups.php#1994 |archivedate = 30 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three singles were released from the album – &quot;[[Tail (song)|Tail]]&quot;, &quot;[[Grave Concern]]&quot;, and &quot;[[Save Your Skin]]&quot;. Following the album's release, and lukewarm reception, the group recorded and released another EP entitled ''Mr Kneebone'' in 1995.

The band released the highly successful ''[[Double Allergic]]'' on 2 September 1996. This, their second album, reached double platinum status in Australia.&lt;ref name=&quot;aria-accred-2007albums&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aria.com.au/pages/httpwww.aria.com.aupagesARIACharts-Accreditations-2007Albums.htm|title=2007  Album Accreditations|publisher=Australian Recording Industry Association|accessdate=31 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four singles were released from the album – &quot;[[Pick You Up]]&quot;, &quot;[[D.A.F.

''Double Allergic'' debuted at #7 on the Australian charts and remained in the top 20 for seven weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=I is not met|accessdate=25 October 2007|author=Blythe, Peter|date=29 October 1996|publisher=Drum Media}}&lt;/ref&gt; A reviewer for FasterLouder, a music review web site, commented that &quot;when Double Allergic was released in 1996, it showed the band were here for the long haul to become arguably one of the best of the decade.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fasterlouder.com.au/reviews/music/2598/|title=Double Allergic|publisher=FasterLouder|accessdate=1 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Critical acclaim and chart success (1998–2003) ===
In September 1998, Powderfinger released ''[[Internationalist (album)|Internationalist]]'', their third studio album. It propelled Powderfinger to a prominent position on the Australian music scene, reaching #1 and later spending 100 weeks on the [[ARIA Albums Chart]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.take40.com/artist/facts/Powderfinger|title=Powderfinger - Audio, Video, News, Biography, Quick and Juicy facts|work=Powderfinger - Top 5 Facts|publisher=Take 40|accessdate=18 November 2007|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070919072816/http://www.take40.com/artist/facts/Powderfinger &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt;|archivedate=19 September 2007}} &lt;/ref&gt; The album, which sold over 280,000 copies and went over five times platinum domestically,&lt;ref name=&quot;FAQsales&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://210.1.195.196/music/ozmusic-central/www.ozmusic-central.com.au/powderfinger/faqfile.htm#3p9|date=23 September 2002|title=How many copies of the albums have been sold?|work=The Powderfinger FAQ|author=Rice, Stephen; et al.|publisher=Powderfinger Central|accessdate=8 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; reached European audiences for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Day Dream Believers|author=Six, Nicola|accessdate=26 October 2007|date=19 November 1998|publisher=''[[The Courier Mail]]''|work=Pulse}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Internationalist'' was the first Powderfinger album to win the [[ARIA Music Awards]]. In 1999, it won &quot;Album of the Year&quot;, &quot;Best Rock Album&quot; and &quot;Best Cover Art&quot;, and &quot;[[The Day You Come]]&quot; won &quot;Single of the Year&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alldownunder.com/oz-p/aria/1999-aria.htm|title=Australia 1999 ARIA Awards|publisher=ALLdownunder.com|accessdate=31 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;[[Passenger (Powderfinger song)|Passenger]]&quot;, which was among the singles released from ''Internationalist'', was also nominated for three other ARIA Awards in 2000.&lt;ref name=ARIAawardlist&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ariaawards.com.au/history-by-artist.php?letter=P&amp;artist=Powderfinger|title=Winners by artist: Powderfinger|publisher=Australian Record Industry Association|work=History|accessdate=18 November 2007|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070926235606/http://ariaawards.com.au/history-by-artist.php?letter=P&amp;amp;artist=Powderfinger &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt;|archivedate=26 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The band received much praise and criticism for their political views on several tracks on ''Internationalist''. In an interview with Benedict Watts, guitarist Ian Haug said that the political messages in &quot;[[The Day You Come]]&quot; were not something they were just preaching about, but rather were something they saw as a responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Beckoning Finger|date=November 1998|publisher=JUICE Magazine|accessdate=25 October 2007|author=Watts, Benedict}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Powderfinger's fourth studio album, ''[[Odyssey Number Five]]'', was released in September 2000, shortly after they were asked to write songs for the soundtracks of two films; ''[[Two Hands (1999 film)|Two Hands]]'' and ''[[Mission: Impossible II]]''. The song &quot;[[These Days (Powderfinger song)|These Days]]&quot; was written for ''Two Hands''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soundtrackcollector.com/catalog/soundtrackdetail.php?movieid=10528|title=''Two Hands'' soundtrack|publisher=Soundtrack Collector|accessdate=26 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;[[My Kind of Scene]]&quot; was written for ''Mission: Impossible II''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindleysite.com/songs/mykindascene.htm|title=My Kind of Scene|publisher=Hindley Site|accessdate=19 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Odyssey Number Five'' was Powderfinger's most successful album to date, selling 560,000 copies.&lt;ref name=&quot;aria-accred-2004albums&quot; /&gt; &quot;My Kind of Scene&quot; was also released as a single from the album, as were &quot;[[My Happiness (Powderfinger song)|My Happiness]]&quot;, &quot;[[Like a Dog (song)|Like a Dog]]&quot;, &quot;[[The Metre/Waiting for the Sun|The Metre]]&quot;, and &quot;[[The Metre/Waiting for the Sun|Waiting for the Sun]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The Metre/Waiting for the Sun|The Metre]]&quot; and &quot;[[The Metre/Waiting for the Sun|Waiting for the Sun]]&quot; were released as a double [[A-side]].&lt;/ref&gt; ''Odyssey Number Five'' won &quot;Album of the Year&quot;, &quot;Highest Selling Album&quot;, &quot;Best Rock Album&quot;, &quot;Best Cover Art&quot;, and &quot;Best Group&quot; at the ARIA Awards in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alldownunder.com/oz-p/aria/2001-aria.htm|title=2001 ARIA Award Winners|publisher=ALLdownunder.com|accessdate=27 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;My Happiness&quot; was also awarded &quot;Single of the Year&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ariaawards.com.au/history-by-year.php?year=2001|title=ARIA Awards 2001|work=History|publisher=Australian Recording Industry Association|accessdate=12 November 2007|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070926235727/http://www.ariaawards.com.au/history-by-year.php?year=2001 &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt;|archivedate=26 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other songs were nominated for ARIA Awards in various other categories.&lt;ref name=&quot;AllARIA&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alldownunder.com/oz-p/aria/total-aria.htm|title=Australia ARIA Award Winners|publisher=ALLdownunder.com|accessdate=6 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many songs from this era of Powderfinger were ranked on [[Triple J]]'s [[Triple J Hottest 100|Hottest 100]] list. &quot;These Days&quot;, &quot;Already Gone&quot;, &quot;[[Don't Wanna Be Left Out/Good-Day Ray|Good-Day Ray]]&quot;, and &quot;[[Passenger (Powderfinger song)|Passenger]]&quot; were ranked in [[Triple J Hottest 100, 1999|1999]],&lt;ref name=&quot;triplej-1999&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/hottest100/history/1999.htm|title=Hottest 100 History 1999|publisher=[[Triple J]]|accessdate=3 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;My Happiness&quot; and &quot;My Kind of Scene&quot; in [[Triple J Hottest 100, 2000|2000]].&lt;ref name=&quot;triplej-2000&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/hottest100/history/2000.htm|title=Hottest 100 History 2000|publisher=Triple J|accessdate=18 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:John Collins.JPG|thumb|left|upright=1.2|[[John Collins (Australian musician)|John Collins]], shown above in January 2005, is one of the original founding members of Powderfinger.]]

''[[Vulture Street]]'' was released on 4 July 2003. The album, recorded in January and February 2003, was named after a street in [[West End, Queensland]], which was the location of the band's first recording room. The album was described by critics as &quot;a rawer, louder, but by no means unrefined, album&quot;, and that it featured guitarists Middleton and Haug dominating in a way they had not since their 1994 debut.&lt;ref name=&quot;SMGVulture&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/07/10/1057783275797.html|title=Powderfinger, Vulture Street|author=Zuel, Bernard|publisher=Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=7 August 2007 | date=11 July 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simon Evans of musicOMH.com described the band as having &quot;opted for a visceral live feel, adding a real punch to songs&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musicomh.com/albums/powderfinger.htm|title=Vulture Street album review|publisher=musicOMH.com|accessdate=28 November 2007|author=Evans, Simon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;[[(Baby I've Got You) On My Mind]]&quot;, &quot;[[Since You've Been Gone (Powderfinger song)|Since You've Been Gone]]&quot;, &quot;[[Love Your Way]]&quot;, and &quot;[[Sunsets]]&quot; from ''Vulture Street'' were released as singles.  Like earlier Powderfinger albums, ''Vulture Street'' won several ARIA Awards. It won &quot;Album of the Year&quot;, &quot;Best Group&quot;, &quot;Best Rock Album&quot; and &quot;Best Cover Art&quot; in 2003.&lt;ref name=&quot;AllARIA&quot; /&gt; Several songs on the album were also nominated for awards in 2003 and 2004.

''[[These Days: Live in Concert]]'' was the first live release by Powderfinger. Both the [[CD]] and [[DVD]] versions were released in late-2004. One single,&quot;[[Stumblin']]&quot; a song which originally appeared on ''Vulture Street'' as a normal track, was also released from the album. Powderfinger released a &quot;[[best of]]&quot; album entitled ''[[Fingerprints: The Best of Powderfinger, 1994–2000|Fingerprints: The Best of Powderfinger, 1994-2000]]'' a few weeks later. It included many of the band's singles to-date as well as non-singles &quot;[[Powderfinger's Oi Song Trilogy#Thrilloilogy|Thrilloilogy]]&quot; and &quot;Belter&quot; and a re-release of &quot;[[These Days (Powderfinger song)|These Days]]&quot;. &quot;These Days&quot;, although never officially released as a single, was ranked at #1 on the Triple J Hottest 100 poll of 1999.&lt;ref name=&quot;triplej-1999&quot; /&gt; The album also included two new songs; &quot;[[Bless My Soul]]&quot; and &quot;Process This&quot;, although only &quot;Bless My Soul&quot; was released as a single. 

Following the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, Powderfinger appeared at the WaveAid fund raising concert in Sydney, to raise funds for aid organisations working in the disaster affected areas.&lt;ref name=&quot;waveaid-review&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fasterlouder.com.au/reviews/events/1673/|title=WaveAid @ Sydney Cricket Ground|publisher=FasterLouder|accessdate=8 August 2007|date=30 January 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fanning sang for [[The Wrights]] when they performed &quot;[[Evie (song)|Evie]]&quot; at the concert and released a studio version of the song as a single, with the proceeds from the sale also going to tsunami relief efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amo.org.au/artist.asp?id=3923|title=The Wrights|publisher=Australian Music Online|author=[[EMI]]|accessdate=3 December 2007|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070906105411/http://www.amo.org.au/artist.asp?id=3923 |archivedate = 6 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Era of side projects (2005–07) ===
Powderfinger had a period of hiatus after the release of ''Fingerprints: The Best of Powderfinger'' in 2005. During that time, several band members pursued other musical projects.

On 12 June 2007, Powderfinger and Australian rock group [[Silverchair]] announced a nine-week tour titled [[Across the Great Divide tour]], an effort to promote reconciliation with [[Indigenous Australians]].

Their song &quot;Drifting Further Away&quot; features on the fifth season [[Grey's Anatomy]] episode 'Stairway to Heaven', which aired on 21 January 2009.

=== Golden Rule &amp; The End (2010) ===

On 4 December 2008, the band announced on their official website that they were currently writing material for their 7th studio album.

On 16 June 2009, the following announcement was made on MySpace: &quot;Saddle up 'Finger fans, it's the news you've been waiting for! This coming Monday 22 June Powderfinger are returning to the studio! Taking the helms for this album will again be Nick DiDia, responsible for Internationalist, Odyssey Number 5 and Vulture St! After recording their last album Dream Days at the Hotel Existence in LA, the band are looking forward to recording the new album in Australia. While we don't have a release date as yet, you can expect to see the new album out at the end of 2009&quot;. On Thursday 10 September they announced that new album was to be called Golden Rule and was set to be released on 13 November 2009.

In July 2009, Bernard Fanning spoke to Triple J radio to confirm the band as the 2009 Homebake Festival headline act, which sees the band return to the festival after a 10 year absence. He also suggested that the new album may include cameo performances from other Australian musicians. The album was recorded in Byron Bay on the New South Wales north coast. The band announced in early September that the title of their upcoming seventh album was ''[[Golden Rule (album)|Golden Rule]]'' and it was subsequently released on 13 November 2009.

The album's first single was released to radio on 25 September 2009, and was titled &quot;[[All of the Dreamers]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/story/0,23663,26057648-10388,00.html|title=See old footage of Powderfinger and hear snippet of new single All Of The Dreamers|publisher=News Limited|accessdate=2009-09-12 | first=Kathy | last=McCabe | date=11 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;heraldsun.com.au&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/entertainment/music/powderfinger-present-their-new-album-golden-rule/story-e6frf9hf-1225771607169 |title=Powderfinger present their new album Golden Rule |publisher=Herald Sun |date=2009-09-10 |accessdate=2011-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burn Your Name, the second single from the album, was released on 18 December 2009, just before they began touring at the 2010 Big Day Out. The third single from the album, Sail The Widest Stretch, was released on 30 April 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.powderfinger.com/news/detail/index_html?content_id=36485 |title='Sail The Wildest Stretch' single release |publisher=Powderfinger.com |date=2010-04-16 |accessdate=2011-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Golden Rule'' debuted at number 1 on the ARIA albums chart.

On 9 April 2010, Powderfinger announced before media,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/music/powderfinger-calls-it-quits-20100409-rw6a.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=Powderfinger call it quits | first=Daile | last=Pepper | date=9 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on their website&lt;ref name=&quot;powderfinger.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.powderfinger.com/sunsetstour ]{{dead link|date=September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; that after 21 years, the group will disband as a touring and recording band following their [[Sunsets Farewell Tour]] in September and October 2010. In a statement read by Bernard Fanning, the band said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''&quot;With the completion of our last album, Golden Rule, we feel that we have said all that we want to say as a musical group. We firmly believe that it is our most complete and satisfying album and can't think of a better way to farewell our fans than with music that we all believe in and also with, hopefully, our best tour to date.&quot;''&lt;ref name=&quot;powderfinger.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In April 2010, radio station Nova106.9 revealed Brisbane's favourite Powderfinger song to the band in an interview about the farewell tour. The result was These Days and surprised Bernard Fanning who thought it was going to be My Happiness (that was second).

During an interview with 'Australian Times' band drummer Jon Coghill said that the final tour &quot;is going to be great fun, but it’s also going to be sad.&quot; He confirmed that there are not any plans for starting up a new band, or embarking on a solo project. Instead he will be going back to study to finish his degree. &quot;Once I’m done with that, I might put the feelers out and see what’s happening. I don’t think I’d be doing anything solo, but I might look to join other bands, just to have a chance to keep playing. I’m just not keen to be off touring the world anymore.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Powderfinger call it a day, 12 October, Australian Times. http://www.australiantimes.co.uk/entertainment/Powderfinger-call-it-a-day&lt;/ref&gt;

Powderfinger played their final show at the River Stage in Brisbane on 13 November 2010 in front of 10,000 fans.  The last song they played was 'These Days'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.powderfinger.com/set-lists |title=Set Lists |publisher=Powderfinger.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 January 2011, the band released a previously unreleased song as a fund raiser for the Premier's Flood Appeal as a result of the major flooding in the band's home state of Queensland.  The song, &quot;I'm on your side&quot; was released through the band's website with all proceeds going towards the cause.

On 8 November 2011, the band will release ''[[Footprints: The Best of Powderfinger, 2001-2011]]'', a follow-up to their first greatest hits compilation, containing two new tracks. There will also be a 2-disc release titled ''Fingerprints &amp; Footprints - The Ultimate Collection'', bringing together the individual discs of ''Fingerprints'' and ''Footprints'' in one set.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.powderfinger.com/news/detail/index_html?content_id=128418 Footprints - Book &amp; CD out November!]&quot;, Powderfinger, 07 Oct 2011, retrieved 18 Oct 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

== Musical style ==
In an interview with Paul Cashmere after the release of ''Vulture Street'', guitarist Darren Middleton stated that a couple of songs they had written &quot;were just too ''Odyssey Number Five'' based,&quot; and that the first track, &quot;Rockin' Rocks&quot;, was &quot;probably the start of where we were heading&quot; with the album.&lt;ref name=&quot;cashmere-interview&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undercover.com.au/idol/powderfinger.html|title=Powderfinger, Interview|author=Cashmere, Paul|accessdate=7 November 2007|archivedate=12 December 2007|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5U1bvrQZw}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cashmere stated in the interview that the album was &quot;the toughest [he has] heard Powderfinger sound&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;cashmere-interview&quot; /&gt;

Bernard Zuel of ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' reviewed both of Powderfinger's more recent albums. Describing ''Vulture Street'' as &quot;a rawer, louder&quot; album in comparison to ''Odyssey Number Five'', Zuel highlighted Fanning's &quot;talent as a lyricist&quot; and stated that it featured guitarists Haug and Middleton &quot;dominating in a way they haven't since their 1994 debut.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;SMGVulture&quot; /&gt; Zuel stated that there is a &quot;real energy here that has some connections to early Powderfinger,&quot; and described &quot;On My Mind&quot; as having &quot;[[AC/DC]] meatiness&quot;, and &quot;Love Your Way&quot; as &quot;acoustic tumbling into weaving [[Led Zeppelin|Zeppelin]] lines.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;SMGVulture&quot; /&gt;

In his review of ''Dream Days at the Hotel Existence'', Zuel described it as &quot;[having] high-gloss and muscular framework,&quot; and stated that that was what &quot;American radio considers serious rock.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;SMH-Dream Days&quot; /&gt; 

{{cquote2|1=Compared with the relatively lean, agile sound they've perfected up to now, this is Powderfinger as the footballer who in the off-season spends his time in the gym and emerges buff and beefy.

Clayton Bolger of [[Allmusic]] stated in his review of ''Dream Days at the Hotel Existence'' that Powderfinger &quot;largely revisit the sound of their ''Internationalist'' album, leaving behind much of the glam and swagger of 2003's ''Vulture Street''.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;dreamdays-amg&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r1080843|pure_url=yes}}|title=''Dream Days at the Hotel Existence'' review|publisher=Allmusic|author=Bolger, Clayton|accessdate=11 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He commented on Fanning's &quot;commanding and distinctive vocals,&quot; the &quot;twin-guitar attack&quot; of Middleton and Haug, Collins' &quot;innovative basslines,&quot; and the &quot;powerhouse drum work&quot; of Coghill.&lt;ref name=&quot;dreamdays-amg&quot; /&gt;

== Philanthropy ==
[[Image:Powderfinger performing September 2007 (e).jpg|thumb|left|The [[Across the Great Divide Tour]] was an attempt to promote [[Reconciliation Australia]]'s efforts in the [[Indigenous Australia|Indigenous]] community.]]
In their time as a band, Powderfinger have been active in supporting causes or opposing actions taken in charitable, philanthropic, disaster, and political circumstances.

In 1996, [[Crowded House]] decided to break up, and organised a farewell concert as a charity event for the [[Sydney Children's Hospital]], to be held on 24 November 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r846622|pure_url=yes}}|title=Farewell to the World review|publisher=Allmusic|accessdate=12 November 2007|author=Erlewine, Stephen Thomas}}&lt;/ref&gt; They approached Powderfinger and Australian acts [[Custard (band)|Custard]] and [[You Am I]] to contribute by appearing in the concert to be held on the steps of the [[Sydney Opera House]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maxtv.com.au/Max/Artist.aspx?ID=66|publisher=[[Channel V|Channel [V]]]|title=Crowded House Biography|work=[[MAX (Channel)|MAX]]|accessdate=7 November 2007}}{{dead link|date=September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concert, which was recorded and later released as a live album titled ''[[Farewell to the World]]'', was believed to be the largest Australian live concert, with estimates of between 100,000 and 250,000 people in attendance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Hepworth|first=David|title=''Farewell to the World'' CD liner notes|publisher=[[Parlophone]]|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;sss&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Bourke|first=Chris|title=Something So Strong|publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan Australia]]|year=1997|isbn=0-7329-0886-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the wake of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, also known as the ''[[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake|Boxing Day Tsunami]]'', Powderfinger performed at the [[WaveAid]] fund-raising concert in Sydney in January 2005.&lt;ref name=&quot;waveaid-review&quot; /&gt; The disaster killed more than 225,000 people from 11 countries in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redcross.org.uk/standard.asp?id=46361|title=Boxing Day tsunami, 2004|publisher=Red Cross|accessdate=6 November 2007|date=31 May 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The total profit from the funds raised from ticket sales and donations was A$2,300,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.waveaid.com.au/waveaid_profit_and_loss_statement.pdf|title=Projected profit &amp; loss statement|publisher=WaveAid|accessdate=6 November 2007|date=15 February 2005|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Powderfinger consisted of five members: vocalist, guitarist, keyboardist and harmonicist Bernard Fanning, bass guitarist John Collins, guitarist and backing vocalist Ian Haug, guitarist, keyboardist and backing vocalist Darren Middleton, and drummer and percussionist Jon Coghill. This has remained the lineup of the band since 1992. Steven Bishop had been the group's drummer before this, but had left wanting to focus on his studies.&lt;ref name=&quot;band-members&quot; /&gt; The band often refers to one another with partial pseudonyms. Most notably John Collins and Jon Coghill, presumably to avoid confusion, are referred to as JC and Cogsy respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;cashmere-interview&quot; /&gt;

Powderfinger have collaborated with few artists, but have had pianist [[Benmont Tench]] play on ''Dream Days at the Hotel Existence''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/musicnews/s1898994.htm|title=New Powderfinger album details|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|author=Triple J|accessdate=26 October 2007|date=17 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; For their second album, ''Double Allergic'', the group enlisted producer [[Tim Whitten]]. Powderfinger approached American expatriate [[Nick DiDia]] as their producer for ''Internationalist'', and recorded with him at Sing Sing Studios in Melbourne.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://210.1.195.196/music/ozmusic-central/www.ozmusic-central.com.au/powderfinger/discog/inter.htm|title=''Internationalist''|work=Powderfinger discography|publisher=Powderfinger Central|accessdate=25 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; DiDia also produced the following two albums. In 2007 [[Rob Schnapf]], producer for [[Beck]], was asked to produce their sixth studio album in [[Los Angeles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/review/album/s1932552.htm|title=''Dream Days at the Hotel Existence|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=25 October 2007|date=25 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
