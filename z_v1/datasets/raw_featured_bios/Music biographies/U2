'''U2''' are &lt;!-- (&quot;They are&quot;) Please note that British English uses the plural &quot;are&quot; instead of the Americanised singular &quot;is&quot; --&gt; an [[Republic of Ireland|Irish]] [[rock music|rock]] band from [[Dublin]].&lt;!-- Please do not remove without discussing on the talk page first --&gt; Formed in 1976, the group consists of [[Bono]] (vocals and guitar), [[The Edge]] (guitar, keyboards and vocals), [[Adam Clayton]] (bass guitar), and [[Larry Mullen, Jr.]] (drums and percussion). U2's early sound was rooted in [[post-punk]] but eventually grew to incorporate influences from many genres of [[popular music]]. Throughout the group's musical pursuits, they have maintained a sound built on melodic instrumentals, highlighted by The Edge's [[timbre (music)|timbrally varied]] guitar sounds and Bono's expressive vocals. Their lyrics, often embellished with spiritual imagery, focus on personal themes and sociopolitical concerns.

U2 formed at [[Mount Temple Comprehensive School]] when the members were teenagers with limited musical proficiency. Within four years, they signed with [[Island Records]] and released their debut album ''[[Boy (album)|Boy]]''. By the mid-1980s, they became a top international act. They were more successful as live performers than they were at selling records, until their breakthrough 1987 album ''[[The Joshua Tree]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | people =[[Paul McGuinness]] | title =Classic Albums: The Joshua Tree | medium =Television documentary | publisher=Rajon Vision |date=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; which, according to ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', elevated the band's stature &quot;from heroes to superstars&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;RS_xx&quot;&gt;Rolling Stone (1994), p. xx&lt;/ref&gt; Reacting to musical stagnation and late-1980s criticism of their earnest image and musical direction, the group reinvented themselves with their 1991 hit album ''[[Achtung Baby]]'' and the accompanying [[Zoo TV Tour]]. U2 integrated [[Electronic dance music|dance]], [[industrial music|industrial]], and [[alternative rock]] influences into their sound and performances, and embraced a more ironic and self-deprecating image. Similar experimentation continued for the remainder of the 1990s with mixed levels of success. U2 regained critical and commercial favour after their 2000 record ''[[All That You Can't Leave Behind]]''. On it and the group's subsequent releases, they adopted a more conventional sound while maintaining influences from their earlier musical explorations.

U2 have released 12 studio albums and are among the all-time [[List of best-selling music artists|best-selling music artists]], having sold more than 150&amp;nbsp;million records worldwide. They have won 22 [[Grammy Award]]s, more than any other band, and in 2005, they were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in their first year of eligibility. ''Rolling Stone'' ranked U2 at number 22 in its list of the &quot;100 Greatest Artists of All Time&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;RS100artists&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-artists-of-all-time-19691231/u2-19691231 | first = Chris | last = Martin | title = The Immortals: The Fifty Greatest Artists of All Time: U2 | magazine = [[Rolling Stone]] | date = 15 April 2004 | issue=946}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout their career, as a band and as individuals, they have campaigned for human rights and [[philanthropy|philanthropic]] causes, including [[Amnesty International]], the [[ONE Campaign|ONE]]/[[DATA]] campaigns, [[Product Red]], and The Edge's [[Music Rising]].

=== Formation and early years (1976–79) ===
[[File:U2-teenagers.jpg|thumb|U2 in 1980. Shown from left to right: Clayton, Mullen, Bono, The Edge.]]
The band formed in Dublin on 25 September 1976.&lt;ref&gt;McCormick (2006), p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--as an Irish topic, under Wikipedia rules this article uses international dating, i.e., dd/mm/yyyy not American dating mm/dd/yyyy.--&gt; [[Larry Mullen, Jr.]], then a 14-year-old student at [[Mount Temple Comprehensive School]], posted a note on the school's notice board in search of musicians for a new band—six people responded. Setting up in his kitchen, Mullen was on drums, with [[Bono|Paul Hewson (Bono)]] on lead vocals; [[The Edge|David Evans (The Edge)]] and his older brother [[Dik Evans]] on guitar; [[Adam Clayton]], a friend of the Evans brothers on bass guitar; and initially Ivan McCormick and Peter Martin, two other friends of Mullen.&lt;ref&gt;Chatterton (2001), p. 130&lt;/ref&gt; Mullen later described it as &quot;'The Larry Mullen Band' for about ten minutes, then Bono walked in and blew any chance I had of being in charge.&quot; Soon after, the group settled on the name &quot;Feedback&quot; because it was one of the few technical terms they knew.&lt;ref&gt;McCormick (2006), p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; Martin did not return after the first practice, and McCormick left the group within a few weeks. Most of the group's initial material consisted of [[cover version|cover songs]], which the band admitted was not their forté.&lt;ref&gt;McCormick (2006), pp. 35, 40&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the earliest influences on the band were emerging [[punk rock]] acts, such as [[The Jam]], [[The Clash]], [[The Buzzcocks]], and [[The Sex Pistols]]. The popularity of punk rock convinced the group that musical proficiency was not a prerequisite to being successful.&lt;ref&gt;McCormick (2008), p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1977, the band changed their name to The Hype.&lt;ref&gt;de la Parra (2003), p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Dik Evans, who was older and by this time at college, was becoming the odd man out. The rest of the band was leaning towards the idea of a four-piece ensemble and he was &quot;phased out&quot; in March 1978. During a farewell concert in the Presbyterian Church Hall in [[Howth]], which featured The Hype playing covers, Dik ceremonially walked offstage. The remaining four band members completed the concert playing original material as &quot;U2&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;U2_by_U2_46-48&quot;&gt;McCormick (2006), pp. 46–48&lt;/ref&gt; Steve Averill, a punk rock musician and family friend of Clayton's, had suggested six potential names from which the band chose &quot;U2&quot; for its ambiguity and open-ended interpretations, and because it was the name that they disliked the least.&lt;ref&gt;McCormick (2006), p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;

On [[Saint Patrick's Day]] in 1978, U2 won a talent show in [[Limerick|Limerick, Ireland]]. The prize consisted of £500 and studio time to record a demo which would be heard by CBS Ireland, a record label. This win was an important milestone and affirmation for the fledgling band.&lt;ref name=&quot;U2_by_U2_46-48&quot;/&gt; U2 recorded their first demo tape at Keystone Studios in Dublin in May 1978.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bono&quot;&gt;Wall (2005), p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Hot Press]]'' magazine was influential in shaping the band's future; in May, [[Paul McGuinness]], who had earlier been introduced to the band by the publication's journalist Bill Graham, agreed to be U2's [[band manager|manager]].&lt;ref&gt;McCormick (2006), pp. 53–56&lt;/ref&gt; The group's first release, an Ireland-only EP entitled ''[[Three (EP)|Three]]'', was released in September 1979 and was their first Irish chart success.&lt;ref&gt;de la Parra (2003), p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1979, U2 performed in London for their first shows outside Ireland, although they were unable to gain much attention from audiences or critics.&lt;ref&gt;de la Parra (2003), p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1980, their second single &quot;[[Another Day (U2 song)|Another Day]]&quot; was released on the CBS label, but again only for the Irish market.&lt;ref&gt;Stokes (1996), p. 142; McCormick (2006), p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Boy'', ''October'', and ''War'' (1980–83) ===
[[Island Records]] signed U2 in March 1980, and in May the band released &quot;[[11 O'Clock Tick Tock]]&quot; as their first international single.&lt;ref&gt;Stokes (1996), p. 142&lt;/ref&gt; The band's debut album, ''[[Boy (album)|Boy]]'', followed in October. Produced by [[Steve Lillywhite]], it received generally positive reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://hotpress.com/archive/492357.html|title=Boy|journal=[[Hot Press]]|first=Declan|last=Lynch|date=11 October 1980|accessdate=13 October 2011}};  {{cite journal|title=Boy's Own Weepies|journal=[[NME]]|first=Paul|last=Marley|date=25 October 1980}};  {{cite news|title=U2: Aiming for Number 1|newspaper=[[Washington Post]]|first=Boo|last=Browning|date=27 February 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Bono's unfocused lyrics seemed improvised, they expressed a common theme: the dreams and frustrations of adolescence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=U2: Here Comes the &quot;Next Big Thing&quot;|journal=Rolling Stone|first=James|last=Henke|date=19 February 1981|issue=337}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album included the band's first United States hit single, &quot;[[I Will Follow]]&quot;. ''Boy'''s release was followed by the [[Boy Tour]], U2's first tour of continental Europe and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;de la Parra (2003), pp. 16–17&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being unpolished, these early live performances demonstrated U2's potential, as critics noted that Bono was a &quot;charismatic&quot; and &quot;passionate&quot; showman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4540228.stm|title=Voice of Influential U2 Frontman|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=BBC|date=23 December 2006|accessdate=6 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The band's second album, ''[[October (album)|October]],'' was released in 1981 and contained overtly spiritual themes. During the album's recording sessions, Bono and The Edge considered quitting the band due to perceived spiritual conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite album-notes |title=October |albumlink=October (album) |bandname=U2 |year=2008 |last=McCormick |first=Neil |format=Remastered deluxe edition CD booklet |publisher=[[Island Records]] |publisherid=B0010948-02}}; McGee (2008), p.&lt;/ref&gt; Bono, The Edge, and Mullen had joined a Christian group in Dublin called the &quot;Shalom Fellowship&quot;, which led them to question the relationship between the Christian faith and the rock and roll lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;Flanagan (1995), pp. 46–48&lt;/ref&gt; Bono and The Edge took time off between tours and decided to leave Shalom in favour of continuing with the band. Recording was further complicated with the theft of a briefcase containing lyrics for several working songs from backstage during the band's performance at a nightclub in [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], Oregon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3945519.stm |title=U2 lyrics returned after 23 years|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC|date=22 October 2004|accessdate=7 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album received mixed reviews and limited radio play. Low sales outside the UK put pressure on their contract with Island and focused the band on improvement.&lt;ref&gt;McCormick (2006), p. 120&lt;/ref&gt;

Resolving their doubts of the ''October'' period, U2 released ''[[War (U2 album)|War]]'' in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;Stokes (1996), p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; A record where the band &quot;turned pacifism itself into a crusade&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds (2006), p. 367&lt;/ref&gt; ''War''{{'}}s sincerity and &quot;rugged&quot; guitar was intentionally at odds with the &quot;cooler&quot; [[synthpop]] of the time.&lt;ref&gt;Graham (2004), p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; The album included the politically charged &quot;[[Sunday Bloody Sunday]]&quot;, where Bono had lyrically tried to contrast the events of [[Bloody Sunday (1972)|Bloody Sunday]] with [[Easter|Easter Sunday]].&lt;ref&gt;McCormick (2006), p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; ''Rolling Stone'' magazine wrote that the song showed the band was capable of deep and meaningful songwriting. ''War'' was U2's first album to feature the photography of [[Anton Corbijn]], who remains U2's principal photographer and has had a major influence on their vision and public image.&lt;ref&gt;McCormick (2006), p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; U2's first commercial success, ''War'' debuted at number one in the UK, and its first single, &quot;[[New Year's Day (song)|New Year's Day]]&quot;, was the band's first hit outside Ireland or the UK.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;New Year's Day&quot; reached number ten on the UK charts and received extensive radio coverage in the US, almost breaking that country's Top 50.

On the subsequent [[War Tour]], the band performed sold-out concerts in mainland Europe and the US. The sight of Bono waving a white flag during performances of &quot;Sunday Bloody Sunday&quot; became the tour's iconic image.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://motherjones.com/media/1989/05/bono-bites-back|title=Bono Bites Back|journal=[[Mother Jones (magazine)|MotherJones]]|first=Adam|last=Block|date=1 May 1989|accessdate=18 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; U2 recorded the ''[[Under a Blood Red Sky]]'' live album on this tour, as well as the ''[[Live at Red Rocks: Under a Blood Red Sky|Live at Red Rocks]]'' concert film, both of which received extensive play on the radio and MTV, expanding the band's audience and showcasing their prowess as a live act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cave|first=Damien, et al.|date=24 June 2004|title=U2's Gamble at Red Rocks|journal=[[Rolling Stone]]|page=146|issue=951}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their record deal with Island Records was coming to an end, and in 1984 the band signed a more lucrative extension. They negotiated the return of their copyrights (so that they owned the rights to their own songs), an increase in their royalty rate, and a general improvement in terms, at the expense of a larger initial payment.&lt;ref name=&quot;band80s&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Connelly|first=Christopher|title=Keeping the Faith|journal=Rolling Stone|date=14 March 1985|issue=443}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''The Unforgettable Fire'' and Live Aid (1984–85) ===

''[[The Unforgettable Fire]]'' was released in 1984. [[Ambient music|Ambient]] and abstract, it was at the time the band's most marked change in direction.&lt;ref name=&quot;PARRA_52-56&quot;&gt;de la Parra (2003), pp. 52–55&lt;/ref&gt; The band feared that following the overt rock of the ''War'' album and tour, they were in danger of becoming another &quot;shrill&quot;, &quot;sloganeering arena-rock band&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;RS_JT&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/the-joshua-tree-19870409|title=Review: The Joshua Tree|journal=Rolling Stone|first=Steve|last=Pond|date=9 April 1987|accessdate=28 December 2010|issue=497}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, experimentation was sought,&lt;ref name=&quot;COMPLETE_21&quot;&gt;Graham (2004), p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; as Adam Clayton recalls, &quot;We were looking for something that was a bit more serious, more arty.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;U2byU2_147&quot; /&gt; The Edge admired the ambient and &quot;weird works&quot; of [[Brian Eno]], who, along with his [[audio engineering|engineer]] [[Daniel Lanois]], eventually agreed to produce the record.&lt;ref&gt;Island Records boss [[Chris Blackwell]] initially tried to discourage them from their choice of producers, believing that just when the band were about to achieve the highest levels of success, Eno would &quot;bury them under a layer of avant-garde nonsense&quot;. (McCormick (2006), p. 151)&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Unforgettable Fire'' has a rich and orchestrated sound. Under Lanois' direction, Mullen's drumming became looser, funkier, and more subtle and Clayton's bass became more subliminal; the rhythm section no longer intruded, but flowed in support of the songs.&lt;ref name=&quot;STOKES_50-51&quot;&gt;Stokes (1996), pp. 50–51&lt;/ref&gt; Complementing the sonic atmospherics, the album's lyrics are open to many interpretations, providing what the band called a &quot;very visual feel&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;PARRA_52-56&quot;/&gt; Due to a tight recording schedule, however, Bono felt songs like &quot;[[Bad (U2 song)|Bad]]&quot; and &quot;[[Pride (In the Name of Love)]]&quot; were incomplete &quot;sketches&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;U2byU2_151&quot;&gt;McCormick (2006), p. 151&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Pride (In the Name of Love)&quot;, about [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], was the album's first single and became the band's biggest hit to that point, including being their first to enter the US top 40.&lt;ref&gt;Graham, (2004), pp. 23–24&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of [[The Unforgettable Fire Tour]] moved into indoor arenas as U2 began to win their long battle to build their audience.&lt;ref&gt;de la Parra (2003), pp. 62–63&lt;/ref&gt; The complex textures of the new studio-recorded tracks, such as &quot;[[The Unforgettable Fire (song)|The Unforgettable Fire]]&quot; and &quot;Bad&quot;, were problematic to translate to live performances.&lt;ref name=&quot;PARRA_52-56&quot;/&gt; One solution was programmed [[Music sequencer|sequencers]], which the band had previously been reluctant to use, but are now used in the majority of the band's performances.&lt;ref name=&quot;PARRA_52-56&quot;/&gt; Songs on the album had been criticised as being &quot;unfinished&quot;, &quot;fuzzy&quot;, and &quot;unfocused&quot;, but were better received by critics when played on stage.&lt;ref&gt;''Rolling Stone'', which was critical of the album version of &quot;Bad&quot;, described its live performance as a 'show stopper'. {{cite journal|last=Henke|first=James|title=Review: Wide Awake in America|journal=Rolling Stone|date=18 July 1985|issue=452–453}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Realising that &quot;U2 had no tradition&quot; and that their knowledge of music from before their childhood was limited, the group delved into [[American roots music|American]] and [[Folk music of Ireland|Irish]] roots music.&lt;ref&gt;McCormick (2006), pp. 169, 177&lt;/ref&gt; Friendships with [[Bob Dylan]], [[Van Morrison]], and [[Keith Richards]] motivated the band to explore [[blues]], [[folk music|folk]], and [[gospel music]] and focused Bono on his skills as a songwriter and lyricist.&lt;ref&gt;McCormick (2006), p. 179&lt;/ref&gt; For their fifth album, ''[[The Joshua Tree]]'',&lt;ref&gt;so named as a &quot;tribute&quot; to, rather than a &quot;metaphor&quot; for, America (McCormick (2006), p. 186)&lt;/ref&gt; the band wanted to build on ''The Unforgettable Fire''{{'}}s textures, but instead of out-of-focus experimentation, they sought a harder-hitting sound that used the limitation of strict song structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=DeCurtis|first =Anthony|title=U2 Releases The Joshua Tree|magazine=Rolling Stone|date=26 March 1987|issue=496}}&lt;/ref&gt; U2 interrupted their 1986 album sessions to serve as a headline act on [[Amnesty International|Amnesty International's]] [[A Conspiracy of Hope]] tour.

Stung by the criticism of ''Rattle and Hum'', the band sought to transform themselves musically.&lt;ref&gt;Flanagan (1995), pp. 4–6&lt;/ref&gt; Seeking inspiration on the eve of [[German reunification]], they began work on ''[[Achtung Baby]]'' at [[Hansa Studios]] in Berlin in October 1990 with producers Daniel Lanois and Brian Eno.&lt;ref&gt;Flanagan (1995), p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; The sessions were fraught with conflict, as the band argued over their musical direction and the quality of their material. While Clayton and Mullen preferred a sound similar to U2's previous work, Bono and The Edge were inspired by European [[industrial music]] and [[electronic dance music]] and advocated a change. Weeks of tension and slow progress nearly took their toll, as the group considered breaking up, but they made a breakthrough with the improvised writing of the song &quot;[[One (U2 song)|One]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Flanagan (1995), pp. 6–11&lt;/ref&gt; They returned to Dublin in 1991, where morale improved and the majority of the album was completed.

In November 1991, U2 released ''Achtung Baby''. The album represented a calculated change in musical and thematic direction for the group; the shift was one of their most dramatic since ''The Unforgettable Fire''.&lt;ref&gt;Flanagan (1995), pp. 4–6; Graham (2004), p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; Sonically, the record incorporated influences from [[alternative rock]], dance, and industrial music of the time, and the band referred to its musical departure as &quot;four men chopping down the Joshua Tree&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ach-stations&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|title=Achtung Stations|journal=[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]]|first=Stephen|last=Dalton|date=November 2004|issue=90|page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thematically, it was a more introspective and personal record; it was darker, yet at times more flippant than the band's previous work. Commercially and critically, it has been one of the band's most successful albums. It produced five hit singles, including &quot;[[The Fly (song)|The Fly]]&quot;, &quot;[[Mysterious Ways (song)|Mysterious Ways]]&quot;, and &quot;One&quot;, and it was a crucial part of the band's early 1990s reinvention.&lt;ref&gt;Graham (2004), p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; Like ''The Joshua Tree'', many publications have cited the record as one of rock's greatest.&lt;ref name=&quot;500Greatest&quot;/&gt;

Like ''Achtung Baby'', the 1992–1993 [[Zoo TV Tour]] was an unequivocal break with the band's past. In contrast to the austere stage setups of previous U2 tours, Zoo TV was an elaborate multimedia event. It satirised the pervasive nature of television and its blurring of news, entertainment, and home shopping by attempting to instill &quot;sensory overload&quot; in its audience.&lt;ref name=&quot;ach-stations&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;closer-to-edge&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://hotpress.com/archive/2627068.html|title=Closer to the Edge|first=Olaf|last=Tyaransen|authorlink=Olaf Tyaransen|journal=[[Hot Press]]|date=4 December 2002|accessdate=26 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;de la Parra (2003), pp. 139–141; Flanagan (1995), pp. 12, 13, 58–61; Stokes (1996), pp. 110–111&lt;/ref&gt; The stage featured large video screens that showed visual effects, random video clips from [[pop culture]], and flashing text phrases.&lt;ref&gt;McGee (2008), p. 143&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas U2 were known for their earnest performances in the 1980s, the group's Zoo TV performances were intentionally ironic and self-deprecating;&lt;ref name=&quot;ach-stations&quot; /&gt; on stage, Bono performed as several over-the-top characters, including &quot;The Fly&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Behind the Fly|first=Alan|last=Light|authorlink=Alan Light |journal=[[Rolling Stone]]|publisher=Wenner Media LLC|date=4 March 1993|issue=651|pages=42+}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Mirror Ball Man&quot;, and &quot;MacPhisto&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=I Had Too Much to Dream Last Night|journal=[[Q (magazine)|Q]]|first=Adrian|last=Deevoy|date=1993-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prank phone calls were made to [[George H.

Live satellite link-ups to [[Siege of Sarajevo|war-torn Sarajevo]] caused controversy.&lt;ref&gt;de la Parra (2003), pp. 153, 166&lt;/ref&gt;

Quickly recorded during a break in the Zoo TV Tour in mid-1993, the ''[[Zooropa]]'' album continued many of the themes from ''Achtung Baby'' and the Zoo TV Tour. Initially intended as an [[Extended play|EP]], the band expanded ''Zooropa'' into a full-length [[LP album]]. It was an even greater departure from the style of their earlier recordings, incorporating further dance influences and other electronic effects.&lt;ref&gt;Graham (2004), p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; [[Johnny Cash]] sang the lead vocals on &quot;[[The Wanderer (U2 song)|The Wanderer]]&quot;. Most of the songs were played at least once during the 1993 legs of the tour, which visited Europe, Australia, New Zealand and Japan; half the album's tracks became permanent fixtures in the setlist.&lt;ref&gt;de la Parra (2003), pp. 166–172&lt;/ref&gt; Although the commercially successful &quot;Zooropa&quot; won the [[Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album]], the band regards the album with mixed feelings, because they felt it was more of &quot;an interlude.&quot;

=== Passengers, ''Pop'', and PopMart (1994–99) ===
In 1995, U2 released an [[experimental music|experimental]] album called ''[[Original Soundtracks 1]]''. Brian Eno, producer of three previous U2 albums, contributed as a full partner, including writing and performing. For this reason and due to the record's highly experimental nature, the band chose to release it under the moniker &quot;Passengers&quot; to distinguish it from U2's conventional albums. Mullen said of the album, &quot;There's a thin line between interesting music and self-indulgence. We crossed it on the Passengers record.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Eno, U2 Make An 'Original'|newspaper=[[Boston Globe]]|first=Jim|last=Sullivan|date=7 November 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was commercially unnoticed by U2 standards and it received generally poor reviews. However, the single &quot;[[Miss Sarajevo]]&quot; featuring [[Luciano Pavarotti]], which Bono cites as one of his favourite U2 songs,&lt;ref&gt;McCormick (2006), pp. 261–262&lt;/ref&gt; was successful.

The band's next studio album, ''[[How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb]]'', was released in November 2004. The band were looking for a harder-hitting rock sound than ''All That You Can't Leave Behind''.

Recording for U2's twelfth album, ''[[No Line on the Horizon]]'', began with producer [[Rick Rubin]] in 2006, but the sessions were short-lived and the material was shelved. In June 2007, the band began new sessions with Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois, who contributed not only as producers, but for the first time with U2, as songwriters as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/theticket/articles/2009/0227/1224241878162.html |title=The background: making No Line on the Horizon |first=Brian |last=Boyd |work=The Irish Times  |date=27 February 2009 |accessdate=28 February 2009 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5kjAFbEWQ |archivedate=23 October 2009}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recording continued through December 2008 in the US, the UK, Ireland, and [[Fez, Morocco]], where the band explored North African music.

The group commenced the [[U2 360° Tour]] in 2009.

== Musical style ==
=== Instrumentation ===
[[File:U2 Gelsenkirchen August 3rd 2009.png|thumb|250px|alt=U2 performing on a concert stage.|U2 performing in 2009. The Edge has described U2 as a fundamentally live band.]]
Since their inception, U2 have developed and maintained a distinctly recognisable sound, with emphasis on melodic instrumentals and expressive, larger-than-life vocals.&lt;ref name=&quot;ABOUT_TOP10&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://80music.about.com/od/artistsqu/tp/topu2songs.htm|first=Steve|last=Peake|title=Top 10 U2 Songs of the '80s|work=[[About.com]]|accessdate=17 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach is rooted partly in the early influence of record producer [[Steve Lillywhite]] at a time when the band was not known for musical proficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=U2 Drops Bomb|magazine=Rolling Stone|first=David|last=Fricke|authorlink=David Fricke|date=30 December 2004|issue=964}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Edge has consistently used a rhythmic echo and a signature [[delay (audio effect)|delay]]&lt;ref&gt;Gulla (2009), p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; to craft his guitar work, coupled with an Irish-influenced [[drone (music)|drone]] played against his syncopated melodies&lt;ref name=&quot;MU_MAG&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.amnesta.net/edge_delay/musician_magazine_1986.html|first=John|last=Hutchinson|date=September 1986|title=U2's Leading Edge|magazine=[[Musician (magazine)|Musician]]|issue=95|page=33|accessdate=17 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; that ultimately yields a well-defined ambient, chiming sound. Bono has nurtured his [[falsetto]] operatic voice&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atu2.com/news/column-off-the-record-vol-6-201.html|first=Marylinn|last=Maione|date=12 February 2006|title=Column: off the record..., vol. 6–201|publisher=atu2.com|accessdate=17 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has exhibited a notable lyrical bent towards social, political, and personal subject matter while maintaining a grandiose scale in his songwriting. In addition, The Edge has described U2 as a fundamentally live band.&lt;ref name=&quot;MU_MAG&quot;/&gt;

Despite these broad consistencies, U2 have introduced brand new elements into their musical repertoire with each new album. U2's early sound was influenced by bands such as [[Television (band)|Television]] and [[Joy Division]], and has been described as containing a &quot;sense of exhilaration&quot; that resulted from The Edge's &quot;radiant chords&quot; and Bono's &quot;ardent vocals&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds (2006), p. 368&lt;/ref&gt; U2's sound began with [[post-punk]] roots and minimalistic and uncomplicated instrumentals heard on ''Boy'' and ''October'', but evolved through ''War'' to include aspects of rock anthem, [[funk]], and dance rhythms to become more versatile and aggressive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Review: War|magazine=Rolling Stone|first=J.D.|last=Considine|date=20 January 1983| issue=387}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Boy'' and ''War'' were labelled &quot;muscular and assertive&quot; by ''Rolling Stone'',&lt;ref name=&quot;RS_JT&quot;/&gt; influenced in large part by Lillywhite's producing. ''The Unforgettable Fire'', which began with The Edge playing more keyboards than guitars, as well as follow-up ''The Joshua Tree'', had [[Brian Eno]] and [[Daniel Lanois]] at the production helm. With their influence, both albums achieved a &quot;diverse texture&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;RS_JT&quot;/&gt; The songs from ''The Joshua Tree'' and ''Rattle and Hum'' placed more emphasis on Lanois-inspired rhythm as they mixed distinct and varied styles of gospel and blues music, which stemmed from the band's burgeoning fascination with America's culture, people and places. In the 1990s, U2 reinvented themselves as they began using synthesisers, [[distortion (guitar)|distortion]], and [[electronica|electronic]] beats derived from [[alternative rock]], [[industrial music]], [[electronic dance music|dance]], and [[Hip hop|hip-hop]] on ''Achtung Baby'',&lt;ref name=&quot;rs&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/achtung-baby-19920109|title=Review: Achtung Baby|journal=[[Rolling Stone]]|first=Elysa|last=Gardner|date=9 January 1992|issue=621|accessdate=26 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Zooropa'', and ''Pop''.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT_POP&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1997/04/28/arts/under-a-golden-arch-sincerely-u2.html|title=Under A Golden Arch, Sincerely U2|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|first=Jon|last=Pareles|authorlink=Jon Pareles|date=28 April 1997|accessdate=18 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2000s had U2 returning to a stripped-down sound, with a more traditional rhythm and less obvious use of synthesisers and effects.&lt;ref&gt;McCormick (2006), p. 289&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lyrics and themes ===
Social and political commentary, often embellished with Christian and spiritual imagery,&lt;ref name=&quot;lyrics&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/14/arts/music/14pare.html?scp=1&amp;sq=U2:%20The%20Catharsis%20in%20the%20Cathedral|title=U2: The Catharsis in the Cathedral|first=Jon|last=Pareles|authorlink=Jon Pareles|date=14 November 2004|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=17 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; are a major aspect of U2's lyrical content. Songs such as &quot;[[Sunday Bloody Sunday]]&quot;, &quot;Silver and Gold&quot;, and &quot;[[Mothers of the Disappeared]]&quot; were motivated by current events of the time. The former was written about [[The Troubles|the troubles]] in [[Northern Ireland]],&lt;ref&gt;McCormick (2006), pp. 135, 139&lt;/ref&gt; while the latter concerns the struggle of a group of women whose children were killed or &quot;disappeared&quot; by the government during the [[Salvadoran Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;McGee (2008), p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; The song &quot;[[Running to Stand Still]]&quot; from ''The Joshua Tree'' was inspired by the heroin addiction that was sweeping through Dublin—the lyric &quot;I see seven towers, but I only see one way out&quot; references the [[Ballymun Flats|Ballymun Towers]] of Northern Dublin and the imagery throughout the song personifies the struggles of addiction.&lt;ref&gt;Stokes (1995), pp. 62–77&lt;/ref&gt;

Bono's personal conflicts and turmoil inspired songs like &quot;[[Mofo (song)|Mofo]]&quot;, &quot;[[Tomorrow (U2 song)|Tomorrow]]&quot; and &quot;[[Kite (song)|Kite]]&quot;. An emotional yearning or pleading frequently appears as a lyrical theme,&lt;ref name=&quot;ABOUT_TOP10&quot;/&gt; in tracks such as &quot;[[Yahweh (song)|Yahweh]]&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uncut.co.uk/music/u2/reviews/400|title=U2&amp;nbsp;– How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb Review|work=[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]]|accessdate=18 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;[[Peace on Earth (U2 song)|Peace on Earth]]&quot;, and &quot;[[Please (U2 song)|Please]]&quot;. Much of U2's songwriting and music is also motivated by contemplations of loss and anguish, coupled with hopefulness and resiliency, themes that are central to ''The Joshua Tree''.&lt;ref name=&quot;RS_JT&quot;/&gt;  Some of these lyrical ideas have been amplified by Bono and the band's personal experiences during their youth in Ireland, as well as Bono's campaigning and activism later in his life. U2 have used tours such as [[Zoo TV Tour|Zoo TV]] and [[PopMart Tour|PopMart]] to caricature social trends, such as media overload and consumerism, respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT_POP&quot;/&gt;

While the band and its fans often affirm the political nature of their music, U2's lyrics and music have been criticised as apolitical because of their vagueness and &quot;fuzzy imagery&quot;, and a lack of any specific references to actual people or characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The soaring nothingness of U2|author=Plotz, David|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2061087/|date=25 January 2002|work=Slate|accessdate=19 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the early 1980s, the members of U2—as a band and individually—have collaborated with other musicians, artists, celebrities, and politicians to address issues concerning poverty, disease, and social injustice.

In 1984, Bono and Adam Clayton participated in [[Band Aid (band)|Band Aid]] to raise money for the [[1984–1985 famine in Ethiopia]]. This initiative produced the hit charity single &quot;[[Do They Know It's Christmas?]]&quot;, which would be the first among several collaborations between U2 and [[Bob Geldof]]. In July 1985, U2 played [[Live Aid]], a follow-up to Band Aid's efforts. Bono and his wife Ali, invited by [[World Vision]], later visited Ethiopia where they witnessed the famine first hand. Bono would later say this laid the groundwork for his Africa campaigning and some of his songwriting.&lt;ref&gt;Tyrangiel, Josh (4 March 2002).

In 1986, U2 participated in the [[A Conspiracy of Hope]] tour in support of [[Amnesty International]] and in [[Self Aid]] for unemployment in Ireland. The same year, Bono and Ali Hewson also visited [[Nicaragua]] and [[El Salvador]] at the invitation of the [[Sanctuary movement]], and saw the effects of the [[Salvadoran Civil War|El Salvador Civil War]]. These 1986 events greatly influenced ''The Joshua Tree'' album, which was being recorded at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;McCormick 2006, p. 174&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dalton, Stephen (2003-09-08). &quot;How the West Was Won&quot;.

Since 2000, Bono's campaigning has included [[Jubilee 2000]] with Bob Geldof, [[Muhammad Ali]], and others to promote the cancellation of third world debt during the [[Great Jubilee]]. In January 2002, Bono co-founded the multinational NGO, DATA, with the aim of improving the social, political, and financial state of Africa. He continued his campaigns for debt and HIV/AIDS relief into June 2002 by making high-profile visits to Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2002/US/05/24/bono.africa.cnna/index.html|title=CNN Access: Bono backs 'effective aid' for Africa |publisher=[[Turner Broadcasting System]], Inc.|first=Aaron|last=Brown|date=24 May 2002|accessdate=18 June 2010}}; [http://archives.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/africa/05/30/Bono.oneill.kagan.otsc/index.html Bono and O'Neill in Africa: Summing up the trip]{{dead link|date=June 2011}} CNN.com.

U2 and Bono's social activism have not been without its critics, however. Several authors and activists who publish in politically left journals such as [[CounterPunch]] have decried Bono's support of political figures such as [[Paul Wolfowitz]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.counterpunch.org/okeefe03232005.html | author=O'Keefe, Derrick | title = The Empire Moves and Co-opts in Mysterious Ways | work=CounterPunch|date = 23 March 2005| accessdate = 19 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as his &quot;essential paternalism&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.counterpunch.org/browne05162006.html | author=Browne, Harry | title = RED Light District: Bono's Independent | work=CounterPunch|date = 16 May 2006| accessdate = 19 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other news sources have more generally questioned the efficacy of Bono's campaign to [[debt relief|relieve debt]] and provide assistance to Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.abcnews.go.com/2020/Story?id=1955664&amp;page=4 | title = Will More Foreign Aid End Global Poverty? | author=Stossel, John and Patrick McMenamin | date = 12 May 2006|accessdate = 19 January 2008}}; and {{cite news | url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/article783901.ece | title = Bono aid is making Africa sick | accessdate = 19 January 2008|work=The Sunday Times|date=1 January 2006 | first1=Roland | last1=Watson | first2=Miles | last2=Costello | first3=Sam | last3=Fleming}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tax and development campaigners have also criticised the band's move from Ireland to the Netherlands to reduce its tax bill.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Murphy, &quot;Bono's Choice&quot;, http://www.taxresearch.org.uk/Blog/2006/08/20/100/&lt;/ref&gt;

The members of U2 have undertaken a number of side projects, sometimes in collaboration with some of their bandmates. In 1985, Bono recorded the song &quot;[[In a Lifetime]]&quot; with the Irish band [[Clannad (musical group)|Clannad]]. The Edge recorded a solo soundtrack album for the film ''[[Captive (soundtrack)|Captive]]'' in 1986,&lt;ref&gt;McCormick (2006), p. 169&lt;/ref&gt; which included a vocal performance by [[Sinéad O'Connor]] that predates her own debut album by a year. Bono and The Edge wrote the song &quot;[[She's a Mystery to Me]]&quot; for [[Roy Orbison]], which was featured on his 1989 album ''[[Mystery Girl]]''.&lt;ref&gt;McCormick (2006), p. 211&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, Bono and The Edge provided the soundtrack to Royal Shakespeare Company London stage version of ''[[A Clockwork Orange]]'' (only one track was ever released, on the b-side to &quot;[[The Fly (song)|The Fly]]&quot; single). That same year, Mullen co-wrote and produced a song for the Irish International soccer team in [[World Cup 1990|Italia '90]], called &quot;[[Put 'Em Under Pressure]]&quot;, which topped the Irish charts. Together with The Edge, Bono wrote the song &quot;[[GoldenEye (song)|GoldenEye]]&quot; for the 1995 [[James Bond]] film ''[[GoldenEye]]'', which was performed by [[Tina Turner]].&lt;ref&gt;de la Parra (2003), p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; Clayton and Mullen reworked the title track of the movie ''[[Mission: Impossible (film)|Mission: Impossible]]'' in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;de la Parra (2003), p. 132&lt;/ref&gt; Bono loaned his voice to &quot;Joy&quot; on [[Mick Jagger]]'s 2001 album ''[[Goddess in the Doorway]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last =Wenner | first =Jann S. | title =Review: Goddess In The Doorway | work=Rolling Stone | date =6 December 2001|issue=883–884}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bono also recorded a spare, nearly spoken-word version of [[Leonard Cohen]]'s &quot;[[Hallelujah (Leonard Cohen song)|Hallelujah]]&quot; for the ''[[Tower of Song]]'' compilation in 1995. Additionally, in 1998, Bono collaborated with [[Kirk Franklin]] and [[Crystal Lewis]] (along with controversial mainstream artists [[R. Kelly]] and [[Mary J. Blige]]) for a successful gospel song called &quot;Lean on Me&quot;.&lt;!-- Not to be confused with the Bill Withers song of the same name.--&gt;

Aside from musical collaborations, U2 have worked with several authors. American author [[William S.
