'''Bob Dylan''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|d|ɪ|l|ən}}), born '''Robert Allen Zimmerman''' on May 24, 1941, is an American singer-songwriter, musician and artist. He has been an influential figure in popular music and culture for five decades.&lt;ref name = &quot;Newsweek97&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Time100Dylan&quot;/&gt; Much of his most celebrated work dates from the [[1960s in music|1960s]] when he was an informal chronicler and a seemingly reluctant figurehead of social unrest. A number of Dylan's early songs, such as &quot;[[Blowin' in the Wind]]&quot; and &quot;[[The Times They Are a-Changin' (song)|The Times They Are a-Changin']]&quot;, became anthems for the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955–1968)|US civil rights]]&lt;ref&gt;Dylan sang &quot;[[Blowin' in the Wind]]&quot; at the Washington D.C. concert, January 20, 1986, which marked the inauguration of [[Martin Luther King Day]]. Gray, 2006, ''The Bob Dylan Encyclopedia'', pp. 63–64.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Opposition to the Vietnam War|anti-war]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3618291.stm | title = Dylan 'reveals origin of anthem' | accessdate =February 6, 2009|publisher=BBC News | date = April 11, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; movements. Leaving his initial base in the [[American folk music revival|culture of folk music]] behind, Dylan's six-minute single &quot;[[Like a Rolling Stone]]&quot; has been described as radically altering the parameters of popular music in 1965.&lt;ref name=&quot;Marcus6&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Marcus|2005|pp=6–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, his recordings employing [[electric instrument]]s attracted [[Electric Dylan controversy|denunciation and criticism]] from others in the folk movement.

Dylan's lyrics incorporated a variety of political, social, philosophical, and literary influences. They defied existing pop music conventions and appealed hugely to the then burgeoning [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]]. Initially inspired by the songs of [[Woody Guthrie]],&lt;ref name = &quot;chronicles243&quot;/&gt; [[Robert Johnson]],&lt;ref name = &quot;chronicles281&quot;/&gt; and [[Hank Williams]], as well as the music and performance styles of [[Buddy Holly]] and [[Little Richard]],&lt;ref name = &quot;Shelton-38&quot;&gt;Shelton, ''No Direction Home'', pp. 38–39.&lt;/ref&gt; Dylan has both amplified and personalized musical [[Music genre|genres]]. His recording career, spanning fifty years, has explored numerous distinct traditions in American song—from [[folk music|folk]], [[blues]] and [[Country music|country]] to [[gospel music|gospel]], [[rock and roll]], and [[rockabilly]] to [[Folk music of England|English]], [[Music of Scotland#Folk_music|Scottish]], and [[Folk music of Ireland|Irish folk music]], embracing even [[jazz]] and [[Swing music|swing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Browne|first=David|authorlink=David Browne| url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,173933~4~~lovetheft,00.html | title = ''Love and Theft'' review| accessdate=September 7, 2008|work=Entertainment Weekly | date = September 10, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dylan performs with guitar, keyboards, and harmonica. Backed by a changing line-up of musicians, he has toured steadily since the late 1980s on what has been dubbed the ''[[Never Ending Tour]]''. His accomplishments as a recording artist and performer have been central to his career, but his greatest contribution is generally considered to be his songwriting.&lt;ref name = &quot;Newsweek97&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.newsweek.com/1997/10/05/dylan-revisited.html| title = Dylan Revisited| author=Gates, David| date = October 6, 1997| accessdate =June 8, 2010| work=Newsweek}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
===Origins and musical beginnings===
Bob Dylan was born &quot;Robert Allen Zimmerman&quot; ([[Hebrew]] name שבתאי זיסאל בן אברהם [Shabtai Zisel ben Avraham])&lt;ref&gt;Sounes, ''Down The Highway: The Life Of Bob Dylan'', p. 14, gives his Hebrew name as Shabtai Zisel ben Avraham&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A [[Chabad]] news service gives the variant Zushe ben Avraham, which may be a [[Yiddish]] variant {{cite web | url = http://www.chabad.org/news/article_cdo/aid/573406/jewish/SingerSongwriter-Bob-Dylan-Joins-Yom-Kippur-Services-in-Atlanta.htm | title = Singer/Songwriter Bob Dylan Joins Yom Kippur Services in Atlanta | date = September 24, 2007 | accessdate =September 11, 2008 | publisher=Chabad.org News }}&lt;/ref&gt; in St. Mary's Hospital on May 24, 1941, in [[Duluth, Minnesota|Duluth]], Minnesota,&lt;ref&gt;Sounes, ''Down The Highway: The Life Of Bob Dylan'', p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mnbirth&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/sse.dll?ti=0&amp;indiv=try&amp;db=mnbirth&amp;h=9920599|title=Robert Allen Zimmerman|work=Minnesota Birth Index, 1935-2002|publisher=Ancestry.com|quote=Name: Robert Allen Zimmerman; Birth Date: 24 May 1941; Birth County: Saint Louis; Father: Abram H. Zimmerman; Mother: Beatrice Stone|accessdate=September 6, 2011}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; and raised in [[Hibbing]], Minnesota, on the [[Mesabi Iron Range]] west of [[Lake Superior]]. His paternal grandparents, Zigman and Anna Zimmerman, emigrated from [[Odessa]] in the [[Russian Empire]] (now [[Ukraine]]) to the United States following the anti-Semitic [[pogrom]]s of 1905.&lt;ref name = &quot;Sounes-p12&quot;&gt;Sounes, ''Down the Highway: The Life Of Bob Dylan'', pp. 12–13.&lt;/ref&gt; His maternal grandparents, Benjamin and Lybba Edelstein, were [[Lithuanian Jews]] who arrived in the United States in 1902.&lt;ref name = &quot;Sounes-p12&quot;/&gt; In his autobiography ''[[Chronicles: Volume One]]'', Dylan writes that his paternal grandmother's maiden name was Kyrgyz and her family originated from [[Kars Province|Kars]], Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;Dylan, ''Chronicles, Volume One'', pp. 92–93.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dylan's parents, Abram Zimmerman and Beatrice &quot;Beatty&quot; Stone, were part of the area's small but close-knit Jewish community. Robert Zimmerman lived in Duluth until age six, when his father was stricken with polio and the family returned to his mother's home town, Hibbing, where Zimmerman spent the rest of his childhood. Robert Zimmerman spent much of his youth listening to the radio—first to [[blues]] and [[American country music|country]] stations broadcasting from [[Shreveport, Louisiana|Shreveport]], Louisiana and, later, to early [[rock and roll]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Shelton-38&quot;/&gt; He formed several bands while he attended [[Hibbing High School]]. The Shadow Blasters was short-lived, but his next, The Golden Chords, lasted longer and played [[Cover version|covers]] of Little Richard rock and roll&lt;ref name = &quot;GrayJapan&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/fl20110522x1.html|title=One of a kind: Bob Dylan at 70|first=Michael|last=Gray|date=May 22, 2011|work=[[The Japan Times]]|accessdate=December 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other popular songs.&lt;ref&gt;Heylin, 1996, ''Bob Dylan: A Life In Stolen Moments'', pp. 4–5.&lt;/ref&gt; Their performance of [[Danny and the Juniors]]' &quot;Rock and Roll Is Here to Stay&quot; at their high school talent show was so loud that the principal cut the microphone off.&lt;ref&gt;Sounes, ''Down The Highway: The Life Of Bob Dylan'', pp. 29–37.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1959, his high school yearbook carried, beneath his photo, the caption: &quot;Robert Zimmerman: to join 'Little Richard'.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;GrayJapan&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;LIFE Books, ''Bob Dylan, Forever Young, 50 Years of Song'', Time Home Entertainment, 2012, Vol. 2.

Zimmerman moved to [[Minneapolis]] in September 1959 and enrolled at the [[University of Minnesota]], where his early focus on rock and roll gave way to an interest in American folk music. In 1985, Dylan explained the attraction that folk music had exerted on him:

{{quotation|The thing about rock'n'roll is that for me anyway it wasn't enough&amp;nbsp;... There were great catch-phrases and driving pulse rhythms&amp;nbsp;... but the songs weren't serious or didn't reflect life in a realistic way. I knew that when I got into folk music, it was more of a serious type of thing. The songs are filled with more despair, more sadness, more triumph, more faith in the supernatural, much deeper feelings.&lt;ref name = &quot;Crowe-1985&quot;&gt;[[Biograph (album)|''Biograph'']], 1985, Liner notes &amp; text by [[Cameron Crowe]].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He soon began to perform at the 10&amp;nbsp;O'clock Scholar, a coffee house a few blocks from campus, and became actively involved in the local [[Dinkytown, USA|Dinkytown]] [[folk music]] circuit.&lt;ref&gt;Shelton, ''No Direction Home'', pp. 65–82.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;No Direction Home&quot;&gt;This is related in the documentary film ''[[No Direction Home]]'', Director: [[Martin Scorsese]]. Broadcast: September 26, 2005, [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] &amp; [[BBC Two]]&lt;/ref&gt;

During his Dinkytown days, Zimmerman began introducing himself as &quot;Bob Dylan&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Heylin, 1996, ''Bob Dylan: A Life In Stolen Moments'', p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; In his autobiography, Dylan acknowledged that he had been influenced by the poetry of [[Dylan Thomas]].&lt;ref&gt;Dylan, ''Chronicles, Volume One'', pp. 78–79.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=a&gt;According to Dylan biographer [[Robert Shelton (critic)|Robert Shelton]], the singer first confided his change of name to his high school girlfriend Echo Helstrom in 1958, informing her he had found a &quot;great name, Bob Dillon&quot;. Shelton surmises the name Dillon had two sources: [[Marshal Matt Dillon]] was the hero of the popular TV western ''[[Gunsmoke]]''; Dillon was also the name of one of Hibbing’s principal families. When writing his biography in the mid 1960s, Dylan told Shelton: &quot;Straighten out in your book that I did not take my name from Dylan Thomas. Dylan Thomas’s poetry is for people that aren’t really satisfied in their bed, for people who dig masculine romance.&quot;  At the University of Minnesota, the singer told a few friends that Dillon was his mother’s maiden name, which was untrue. The singer later told reporters that he had an uncle named Dillon. Shelton adds that only when he reached New York in 1961 did the singer begin to spell his name ‘Dylan’, by which time he was acquainted with the life and work of Dylan Thomas. Shelton, ''No Direction Home'', 2011, pp. 44–45.&lt;/ref&gt; Explaining his change of name in a 2004 interview, Dylan remarked: &quot;You're born, you know, the wrong names, wrong parents. I mean, that happens. You call yourself what you want to call yourself. This is the land of the free.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;60minutes2005&quot;/&gt;

===1960s===
====Relocation to New York and record deal====
Dylan dropped out of college at the end of his freshman year. In January 1961, he traveled to New York City, hoping to perform there and visit his musical idol [[Woody Guthrie]],&lt;ref&gt;Sounes, ''Down The Highway: The Life Of Bob Dylan'', p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; who was seriously ill with [[Huntington's Disease]] in [[Greystone Park Psychiatric Hospital]].&lt;ref&gt;Dylan, ''Chronicles, Volume One'', p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; Guthrie had been a revelation to Dylan and was the biggest influence on his early performances. Describing Guthrie's impact on him, Dylan later wrote: &quot;The songs themselves had the infinite sweep of humanity in them ... [He] was the true voice of the American spirit. I said to myself I was going to be Guthrie's greatest disciple.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Dylan, ''Chronicles, Volume One'', pp. 244–246.&lt;/ref&gt; As well as visiting Guthrie in the hospital, Dylan befriended Guthrie's acolyte [[Ramblin' Jack Elliott]]. Much of Guthrie's repertoire was actually channeled through Elliott, and Dylan paid tribute to Elliott in ''[[Chronicles, Vol. 1|Chronicles]]'' (2004).&lt;ref&gt;Dylan, ''Chronicles, Volume One'', pp. 250–252.&lt;/ref&gt;

From February 1961, Dylan played at various clubs around [[Greenwich Village]]. He befriended and picked up material from many folk singers in the Village scene, including [[Dave Van Ronk]], [[Fred Neil]], [[Odetta]], the [[New Lost City Ramblers]], and Irish musicians [[The Clancy Brothers|Tommy Makem and the Clancy Brothers]].&lt;ref&gt;Shelton, ''No Direction Home'', 2011, pp. 74–78.&lt;/ref&gt; Dylan later described [[Liam Clancy]] as &quot;the best ballad singer I ever heard.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Shelton, ''No Direction Home'', 2011, p. 333.&lt;/ref&gt; In September, Dylan gained some public recognition when [[Robert Shelton (critic)|Robert Shelton]] wrote a positive review in ''[[The New York Times]]'' of a show at [[Gerde's Folk City]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Shelton, ''The New York Times'', September 21, 1961, &quot;Bob Dylan: A Distinctive Stylist&quot; reproduced online: {{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hammond signed Dylan to [[Columbia Records]] in October. The performances on his first Columbia album, ''[[Bob Dylan (album)|Bob Dylan]]'' (1962), consisted of familiar folk, blues and [[gospel music|gospel]] material combined with two original compositions. The album made little impact, selling only 5,000 copies in its first year, just enough to break even.&lt;ref name = &quot;Scaduto110&quot;&gt;Scaduto, ''Bob Dylan'', p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt; Within Columbia Records, some referred to the singer as &quot;Hammond's Folly&quot; and suggested dropping his contract. Hammond defended Dylan vigorously. In March 1962, Dylan contributed harmonica and back-up vocals to the album ''Three Kings and the Queen'', accompanying [[Victoria Spivey]] and [[Big Joe Williams]] on a recording for [[Spivey Records]].&lt;ref&gt;A photo of Dylan with Victoria Spivey at this session was used by Dylan on the cover of his 1970 album, ''[[New Morning]]''. See Gray, ''The Bob Dylan Encyclopedia'', pp. 630–631.&lt;/ref&gt; While working for Columbia, Dylan also recorded several songs under the pseudonym Blind Boy Grunt,&lt;ref name = &quot;Grunt&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.allmusic.com/artist/blind-boy-grunt-p447197/biography| title = Blind Boy Grunt| author=Unterberger, Richie| accessdate =February 12, 2011| publisher=allmusic.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; for ''[[Broadside Magazine]]'', a folk music magazine and record label.&lt;ref&gt;Shelton, ''No Direction Home'', pp. 157–158.&lt;/ref&gt; Dylan used the pseudonym Bob Landy to record as a piano player on the 1964 anthology album, ''The Blues Project'', issued by [[Elektra Records]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Grunt&quot;/&gt; Under the pseudonym Tedham Porterhouse, Dylan contributed harmonica to [[Ramblin' Jack Elliott|Ramblin' Jack Elliott's]] 1964 album ''[[Jack Elliott (Ramblin' Jack Elliott album)|Jack Elliott]]''.&lt;ref name = &quot;Grunt&quot;/&gt;

Dylan made two important career moves in August 1962. He legally changed his name to Bob Dylan,&lt;ref&gt;Sounes, 2001, ''Down The Highway: The Life Of Bob Dylan'', p. 121&lt;/ref&gt; and signed a management contract with [[Albert Grossman]].&lt;ref&gt;Sounes, 2001, ''Down The Highway: The Life Of Bob Dylan'', p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; Grossman remained Dylan's manager until 1970, and was notable both for his sometimes confrontational personality, and for the fiercely protective loyalty he displayed towards his principal client.&lt;ref&gt;Gray, ''The Bob Dylan Encyclopedia'', pp. 283–284.&lt;/ref&gt; Dylan subsequently said of Grossman, &quot;He was kind of like a [[Colonel Tom Parker]] figure&amp;nbsp;... you could smell him coming.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;No Direction Home&quot; /&gt; Tensions between Grossman and [[John H. Hammond|John Hammond]] led to Hammond being replaced as the producer of Dylan's second album by the young African American jazz producer [[Tom Wilson (producer)|Tom Wilson]].&lt;ref&gt;Heylin, ''Bob Dylan: Behind the Shades Revisited'', pp. 115–116.&lt;/ref&gt;

From December 1962 to January 1963, Dylan made his first trip to the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name = &quot;Heylin-p35&quot;&gt;Heylin, 1996, ''Bob Dylan: A Life In Stolen Moments'', pp. 35–39.&lt;/ref&gt; He had been invited by TV director [[Philip Saville]] to appear in a drama, ''[[The Madhouse on Castle Street]]'', which Saville was directing for [[BBC Television]].&lt;ref name=madhouse&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfour/music/bobdylan/madhouse.shtml| title = Dylan in the Madhouse| date = October 14, 2007| accessdate =August 31, 2009| publisher=BBC TV}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the play, Dylan performed &quot;Blowin' in the Wind&quot;, one of the first major public performances of the song.&lt;ref&gt;Sounes, Howard. Down the Highway: The Life Of Bob Dylan. Doubleday 2001. p159.

By the time Dylan's second album, ''[[The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan]]'', was released in May 1963, he had begun to make his name as both a singer and a songwriter. Many of the songs on this album were labeled [[protest song]]s, inspired partly by Guthrie and influenced by [[Pete Seeger]]'s passion for topical songs.&lt;ref&gt;Shelton, ''No Direction Home'', pp. 138–142.&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Oxford Town&quot;, for example, was a sardonic account of [[James Meredith]]'s ordeal as the first black student to risk enrollment at the [[University of Mississippi]].&lt;ref&gt;Shelton, ''No Direction Home'', p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bob Dylan in November 1963.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Dylan with his guitar onstage, laughing and looking downwards.|Bob Dylan in November 1963]]
His most famous song at this time, &quot;Blowin' in the Wind&quot;, partially derived its melody from the traditional [[slave]] song &quot;No More Auction Block&quot;, while its lyrics questioned the social and political status quo.&lt;ref&gt;The booklet by [[John Bauldie]] accompanying Dylan's ''[[The Bootleg Series Volumes 1–3 (Rare &amp; Unreleased) 1961–1991]]'' (1991) says: &quot;Dylan acknowledged the debt in 1978 to journalist Marc Rowland: ''Blowin' In The Wind' has always been a spiritual. I took it off a song called 'No More Auction Block'—that's a spiritual and 'Blowin' In The Wind follows the same feeling.{{' &quot;}} pp. 6–8.&lt;/ref&gt; The song was widely recorded and became an international hit for [[Peter, Paul and Mary]], setting a precedent for many other artists who had hits with Dylan's songs. &quot;[[A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall]]&quot; was based on the tune of the folk ballad &quot;[[Lord Randall]]&quot;. With its veiled references to nuclear apocalypse, it gained even more resonance when the [[Cuban Missile Crisis|Cuban missile crisis]] developed only a few weeks after Dylan began performing it.&lt;ref&gt;Heylin, ''Bob Dylan: Behind the Shades Revisited'', pp. 101–103.&lt;/ref&gt; Like &quot;Blowin' in the Wind&quot;, &quot;A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall&quot; marked an important new direction in modern songwriting, blending a [[Stream of consciousness writing|stream-of-consciousness]], [[imagist]] lyrical attack with a traditional folk form.&lt;ref&gt;Ricks, ''Dylan's Visions of Sin'', pp. 329–344.&lt;/ref&gt;

|description=''[[Blowin' in the Wind]]'' was, according to critic Andy Gill, &quot;the song with which Dylan's name is most inextricably linked, and safeguarded his reputation as a civil libertarian through any number of changes in style and attitude.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Gill, ''My Back Pages'', 23&lt;/ref&gt;
|format=[[Ogg]]}}

While Dylan's topical songs solidified his early reputation, ''Freewheelin''' also included a mixture of love songs and jokey, surreal talking blues. Humor was a large part of Dylan's persona,&lt;ref&gt;Scaduto, ''Bob Dylan'', p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; and the range of material on the album impressed many listeners, including [[The Beatles]]. [[George Harrison]] said, &quot;We just played it, just wore it out. The content of the song lyrics and just the attitude—it was incredibly original and wonderful.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Mojo'' magazine, December 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

The rough edge of Dylan's singing was unsettling to some early listeners but an attraction to others. Describing the impact that Dylan had on her and her husband, [[Joyce Carol Oates]] wrote: &quot;When we first heard this raw, very young, and seemingly untrained voice, frankly nasal, as if sandpaper could sing, the effect was dramatic and electrifying.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hedin (ed.), 2004, ''Studio A: The Bob Dylan Reader'', p. 259.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of his most famous early songs first reached the public through more immediately palatable versions by other performers, such as [[Joan Baez]], who became Dylan's advocate, as well as his lover.&lt;ref&gt;Sounes, 2001, ''Down The Highway: The Life Of Bob Dylan'', pp. 136–138.&lt;/ref&gt; Baez was influential in bringing Dylan to national and international prominence by recording several of his early songs and inviting him onstage during her own concerts.&lt;ref&gt;Joan Baez entry, Gray, ''The Bob Dylan Encyclopedia'', pp. 28–31.&lt;/ref&gt;

Others who recorded and had hits with Dylan's songs in the early and mid-1960s included [[The Byrds]]; [[Sonny and Cher]]; [[The Hollies]]; [[Peter, Paul and Mary]]; [[The Association]]; [[Manfred Mann]]; and [[The Turtles]]. Most attempted to impart a pop feel and rhythm to the songs, while Dylan and Baez performed them mostly as sparse folk pieces. The cover versions became so ubiquitous that [[CBS]] started to promote him with the tag &quot;Nobody Sings Dylan Like Dylan.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.smh.com.au/news/music/bob-dylans-songs-offer-rich-pickings-for-other-singers/2007/08/14/1186857512999.html | title = It ain't me babe but I like how it sounds | date = August 15, 2007 | accessdate =September 24, 2008 | last = Meacham | first = Steve |work=The Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;Mixed Up Confusion&quot;, recorded during the ''Freewheelin''' sessions with a backing band, was released as a single and then quickly withdrawn. In contrast to the mostly solo acoustic performances on the album, the single showed a willingness to experiment with a [[rockabilly]] sound. [[Cameron Crowe]] described it as &quot;a fascinating look at a folk artist with his mind wandering towards [[Elvis Presley]] and [[Sun Records]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Biograph (album)|''Biograph'']], 1985, Liner notes &amp; text by [[Cameron Crowe]]. Musicians on &quot;Mixed Up Confusion&quot;: George Barnes &amp; [[Bruce Langhorne]] (guitars); [[Dick Wellstood]] (piano); [[Gene Ramey]] (bass); [[Herb Lovelle]] (drums)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Protest and ''Another Side''====

In May 1963, Dylan's political profile was raised when he walked out of ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]''. During rehearsals, Dylan had been informed by [[CBS Television]]'s &quot;head of program practices&quot; that the song he was planning to perform, &quot;[[Talkin' John Birch Paranoid Blues]]&quot;, was potentially libelous to the [[John Birch Society]]. Rather than comply with the censorship, Dylan refused to appear on the program.&lt;ref&gt;Dylan had recorded &quot;Talkin' John Birch Society Blues&quot; for his [[The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan|''Freewheelin'']] album, but the song was replaced by later compositions, including &quot;[[Masters of War]]&quot;. See Heylin, ''Bob Dylan: Behind the Shades Revisited'', pp. 114–115.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Listen
 |filename = Bob_Dylan_-_The_Times_They_Are_a-Changin'.ogg
 |title = &quot;The Times They Are a-Changin'&quot;
 |description= Dylan said of &quot;The Times They Are a-Changin'&quot;: &quot;This was definitely a song with a purpose. I wanted to write a big song, some kind of theme song, with short concise verses that piled up on each other in a hypnotic way. The civil rights movement and the folk music movement were pretty close and allied together at that time.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;Crowe-1985&quot;/&gt;
 |format = [[Ogg]]}}

By this time, Dylan and Baez were both prominent in the [[civil rights movement]], singing together at the [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom|March on Washington]] on August 28, 1963.&lt;ref&gt;Dylan performed &quot;[[Only a Pawn in Their Game]]&quot; and &quot;[[When the Ship Comes In]]&quot;; see Heylin, ''Bob Dylan: A Life In Stolen Moments'', p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; Dylan's third album, ''[[The Times They Are a-Changin']]'', reflected a more politicized and cynical Dylan.&lt;ref&gt;Gill, ''My Back Pages'', pp. 37–41.&lt;/ref&gt; The songs often took as their subject matter contemporary, real life stories, with &quot;Only A Pawn In Their Game&quot; addressing the murder of civil rights worker [[Medgar Evers]]; and the [[Bertolt Brecht|Brechtian]] &quot;[[The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll]]&quot; the death of black hotel barmaid Hattie Carroll, at the hands of young white socialite [[William Zantzinger]].&lt;ref&gt;Ricks, ''Dylan's Visions of Sin'', pp. 221–233.&lt;/ref&gt; On a more general theme, &quot;[[Ballad of Hollis Brown]]&quot; and &quot;[[North Country Blues]]&quot; address the despair engendered by the breakdown of farming and mining communities. This political material was accompanied by two personal love songs, &quot;Boots of Spanish Leather&quot; and &quot;One Too Many Mornings&quot;.&lt;ref name = bbctimeline/&gt;

By the end of 1963, Dylan felt both manipulated and constrained by the folk and protest movements.&lt;ref&gt;Shelton, ''No Direction Home'', pp. 200–205.&lt;/ref&gt; These tensions were publicly displayed when, accepting the &quot;[[Thomas Paine|Tom Paine]] Award&quot; from the [[National Emergency Civil Liberties Committee]] shortly after the assassination of [[John F. Kennedy]], an intoxicated Dylan brashly questioned the role of the committee, characterized the members as old and balding, and claimed to see something of himself (and of every man) in Kennedy's alleged assassin, [[Lee Harvey Oswald]].&lt;ref&gt;Part of Dylan's speech went: &quot;There's no black and white, left and right to me any more; there's only up and down and down is very close to the ground. And I'm trying to go up without thinking of anything trivial such as politics.&quot;; see, Shelton, ''No Direction Home'', pp. 200–205.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bob Dylan in November 1963-5.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A spotlight shines on Dylan as he performs onstage.|''Bobby'' Dylan, as the college yearbook lists him: [[St. Lawrence University]], upstate New York, November 1963]]

''[[Another Side of Bob Dylan]]'', recorded on a single June evening in 1964,&lt;ref&gt;Heylin, 1996, ''Bob Dylan: A Life In Stolen Moments'', p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; had a lighter mood than its predecessor. The surreal, humorous Dylan reemerged on &quot;I Shall Be Free #10&quot; and &quot;Motorpsycho Nightmare&quot;. &quot;[[Spanish Harlem Incident]]&quot; and &quot;[[To Ramona]]&quot; are romantic and passionate love songs, while &quot;[[Black Crow Blues]]&quot; and &quot;[[I Don't Believe You (She Acts Like We Never Have Met)]]&quot; suggest the rock and roll soon to dominate Dylan's music. &quot;[[It Ain't Me Babe]]&quot;, on the surface a song about spurned love, has been described as a rejection of the role his reputation had thrust at him.&lt;ref&gt;Shelton, ''No Direction Home'', p. 222.&lt;/ref&gt; His newest direction was signaled by two lengthy songs: the [[impressionism|impressionistic]] &quot;[[Chimes of Freedom (song)|Chimes of Freedom]],&quot; which sets elements of [[social commentary]] against a denser metaphorical landscape in a style later characterized by [[Allen Ginsberg]] as &quot;chains of flashing images,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;In an interview with Seth Goddard for ''Life'' magazine (July 5, 2001) Ginsberg claimed that Dylan's technique had been inspired by [[Jack Kerouac]]: &quot;(Dylan) pulled ''[[Mexico City Blues]]'' from my hand and started reading it and I said, 'What do you know about that?' He said, 'Somebody handed it to me in '59 in St. Paul and it blew my mind.' So I said 'Why?' He said, 'It was the first poetry that spoke to me in my own language.' So those chains of flashing images you get in Dylan, like 'the motorcycle black Madonna two-wheeled gypsy queen and her silver studded phantom lover,' they're influenced by Kerouac's chains of flashing images and spontaneous writing, and that spreads out into the people.&quot; Reproduced online: {{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;[[My Back Pages]],&quot; which attacks the simplistic and arch seriousness of his own earlier topical songs and seems to predict the backlash he was about to encounter from his former champions as he took a new direction.&lt;ref&gt;Shelton, ''No Direction Home'', pp. 219–222.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the latter half of 1964 and 1965, Dylan's appearance and musical style changed rapidly, as he made his move from leading contemporary songwriter of the folk scene to [[folk-rock]] pop-music star. His scruffy jeans and work shirts were replaced by a [[Carnaby Street]] wardrobe, sunglasses day or night, and pointy &quot;[[Beatle boots]]&quot;. A London reporter wrote: &quot;Hair that would set the teeth of a comb on edge. A loud shirt that would dim the neon lights of [[Leicester Square]]. He looks like an undernourished [[cockatoo]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Shelton, ''No Direction Home'', pp. 267–271; pp. 288–291.&lt;/ref&gt; Dylan also began to spar in increasingly surreal ways with his interviewers. Appearing on the [[Les Crane]] TV show and asked about a movie he was planning to make, he told Crane it would be a cowboy horror movie. Asked if he played the cowboy, Dylan replied, &quot;No, I play my mother.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Heylin, ''Bob Dylan: Behind the Shades Revisited'', pp. 178–181.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Going electric====
{{Main|Electric Dylan controversy}}

Dylan's April 1965 album ''[[Bringing It All Back Home]]'' was yet another stylistic leap,&lt;ref&gt;Heylin, ''Bob Dylan: Behind the Shades Revisited'', pp. 181–182.&lt;/ref&gt; featuring his first recordings made with electric instruments. The first single, &quot;[[Subterranean Homesick Blues]]&quot;, owed much to [[Chuck Berry]]'s &quot;[[Too Much Monkey Business]]&quot;;&lt;ref&gt;Heylin, 2009, ''Revolution In The Air, The Songs of Bob Dylan: Volume One'', pp. 220–222.&lt;/ref&gt; its free association lyrics have been described as both harkening back to the manic energy of [[Beat poetry]] and as a forerunner of [[rapping|rap]] and [[hip-hop]].&lt;ref&gt;Marqusee, ''Wicked Messenger'', p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt; The song was provided with an early music video which opened [[D. A. Pennebaker]]'s [[cinéma vérité]] presentation of Dylan's 1965 tour of England, ''[[Dont Look Back]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Gill, ''My Back Pages'', pp. 68–69.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of miming to the recording, Dylan illustrated the lyrics by throwing cue cards containing key words from the song on the ground. Pennebaker has said the sequence was Dylan's idea, and it has been widely imitated in both music videos and advertisements.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, ''Like a Bullet of Light: The Films of Bob Dylan'', p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[A-side and B-side|B side]] of ''Bringing It All Back Home'' consisted of four long songs on which Dylan accompanied himself on acoustic guitar and harmonica.&lt;ref name = &quot;Sounes-168&quot;&gt;Sounes, ''Down The Highway: The Life Of Bob Dylan'', pp. 168–169.&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;[[Mr. Tambourine Man]]&quot; quickly became one of Dylan's best known songs when The Byrds recorded an electric version that reached number one in both the U.S. and the U.K. charts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Warwick, N., Brown, T. &amp; Kutner, J.|year=2004|title=The Complete Book of the British Charts|edition=Third Edition|page=6|publisher=Omnibus Press|isbn=978-1-84449-058-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Whitburn, J.|page=130|year=2008|title=Top Pop Singles 1955–2006|publisher=Record Research Inc|isbn=0-89820-172-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;[[It's All Over Now Baby Blue]]&quot; and &quot;[[It's Alright Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)]]&quot; were acclaimed as two of Dylan's most important compositions.&lt;ref name = &quot;Sounes-168&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shelton, 2003, ''No Direction Home'', pp. 276–277.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 1965, as the headliner at the [[Newport Folk Festival]], Dylan performed his first electric set since his high school days with a [[pickup group]] drawn mostly from the [[Paul Butterfield|Paul Butterfield Blues Band]], featuring [[Mike Bloomfield]] (guitar), [[Sam Lay]] (drums) and Jerome Arnold (bass), plus [[Al Kooper]] (organ) and [[Barry Goldberg]] (piano).&lt;ref&gt;Heylin, ''Bob Dylan: Behind the Shades Revisited'', pp. 208–216.&lt;/ref&gt; Dylan had appeared at Newport in 1963 and 1964, but in 1965 Dylan, met with a mix of cheering and booing, left the stage after only three songs. One version of the legend has it that the boos were from the outraged folk fans whom Dylan had alienated by appearing, unexpectedly, with an electric guitar. [[Murray Lerner]], who filmed the performance, said: &quot;I absolutely think that they were booing Dylan going electric.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mojo4music.com/blog/2007/10/exclusive_dylan_at_newport_who.html| title = Exclusive: Dylan at Newport—Who Booed?| work=[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]
| date = October 25, 2007| accessdate =September 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative account claims audience members were merely upset by poor sound quality and a surprisingly short set. This account is supported by Kooper and one of the directors of the festival, who reports his audio recording of the concert proves that the only boos were in reaction to the emcee's announcement that there was only enough time for a short set.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=CP Staff|page=3|url=http://blogs.citypages.com/gimmenoise/2010/04/al_kooper_talks.php?page=3|title=

Nevertheless, Dylan's 1965 Newport performance provoked a hostile response from the folk music establishment.&lt;ref&gt;Shelton, ''No Direction Home'', pp. 305–314.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A year earlier, [[Irwin Silber]], the editor of ''[[Sing Out!]]'', had published an &quot;Open Letter to Bob Dylan&quot;, criticising Dylan's stepping away from political songwriting: &quot;I saw at Newport how you had somehow lost contact with people. Some of the paraphernalia of fame were getting in your way.&quot; ''Sing Out!'', November 1964, quoted in Shelton, ''No Direction Home'', p. 313. This letter has been mistakenly described as a response to Dylan's 1965 Newport appearance.&lt;/ref&gt; In the September issue of ''[[Sing Out!]]'', singer [[Ewan MacColl]] wrote: &quot;Our traditional songs and ballads are the creations of extraordinarily talented artists working inside disciplines formulated over time... 'But what of Bobby Dylan?' scream the outraged teenagers... Only a completely non-critical audience, nourished on the watery pap of pop music, could have fallen for such tenth-rate drivel.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Sing Out!'', September 1965, quoted in Shelton, ''No Direction Home'', p. 313&lt;/ref&gt; On July 29, just four days after his controversial performance at Newport, Dylan was back in the studio in New York, recording &quot;[[Positively 4th Street]]&quot;. The lyrics teemed with images of vengeance and paranoia,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;You got a lotta nerve/To say you are my friend/When I was down/You just stood there grinning&quot; Reproduced online:{{cite web | url = http://www.bobdylan.com/#/songs/positively-4th-street | title = Positively 4th Street| author=Bob Dylan| accessdate =September 30, 2008| publisher=bobdylan.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was widely interpreted as Dylan's put-down of former friends from the folk community—friends he had known in the clubs along West 4th Street.&lt;ref&gt;Sounes, ''Down The Highway: The Life Of Bob Dylan'', p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Highway 61 Revisited'' and ''Blonde on Blonde''====
{{listen|filename=Bob Dylan - Like a Rolling Stone.ogg |title=&quot;Like a Rolling Stone&quot;|description=Dylan's 1965 hit single, which appeared on the album ''Highway 61 Revisited''. In 2004, it was labelled the Greatest Song of All Time by ''Rolling Stone'' magazine.&lt;ref name = &quot;RS500&quot;/&gt;|format=[[Ogg]]}}

In July 1965, Dylan released the single &quot;[[Like a Rolling Stone]]&quot;, which peaked at No.2 in the U.S. and at No.4 in the UK charts. At over six minutes, the song has been widely credited with altering attitudes about what a pop single could convey. [[Bruce Springsteen]], in his speech during Dylan's inauguration into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] said that on first hearing the single, &quot;that snare shot sounded like somebody'd kicked open the door to your mind&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Springsteen's Speech during Dylan's induction into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], January 20, 1988 Quoted in Bauldie, ''Wanted Man'', p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, and again in 2011, ''[[Rolling Stone Magazine]]'' listed it as number one on its list of &quot;[[The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time]]&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;RS500&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/rstone.html#500Songs| title = The Rolling Stone 500 Greatest Songs of All Time| accessdate =May 2, 2010| publisher=Rock List Music}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/the-500-greatest-songs-of-all-time-20110407/bob-dylan-like-a-rolling-stone-19691231| title = 500 Greatest Songs Of All Time| date = May 31, 2011| accessdate =June 1, 2011|work=Rolling Stone}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song also opened Dylan's next album, ''[[Highway 61 Revisited]],'' titled after the road that led from Dylan's Minnesota to the musical hotbed of New Orleans.&lt;ref&gt;Gill, 1999, ''My Back Pages'', pp. 87–88.&lt;/ref&gt; The songs were in the same vein as the hit single, flavored by [[Mike Bloomfield]]'s blues guitar and [[Al Kooper]]'s organ riffs. &quot;[[Desolation Row]]&quot; offers the sole [[acoustic guitar|acoustic]] exception, with Dylan making surreal allusions to a variety of figures in Western culture during this epic song, which was described by Andy Gill as &quot;an 11-minute epic of entropy, which takes the form of a [[Frederico Fellini|Fellini-esque]] parade of grotesques and oddities featuring a huge cast of celebrated characters, some historical ([[Einstein]], [[Nero]]), some biblical (Noah, Cain and Abel), some fictional (Ophelia, Romeo, Cinderella), some literary ([[T.S. Eliot]] and [[Ezra Pound]]), and some who fit into none of the above categories, notably Dr. Filth and his dubious nurse.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Gill, ''My Back Pages'', p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

In support of the record, Dylan was booked for two U.S. concerts and set about assembling a band. [[Mike Bloomfield]] was unwilling to leave the Butterfield Band, so Dylan mixed Al Kooper and [[Harvey Brooks]] from his studio crew with [[Robbie Robertson]] and [[Levon Helm]], best known at the time for being part of [[Ronnie Hawkins]]'s backing band [[The Hawks (band)|The Hawks]] (later to become [[The Band]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/01/arts/recordings-robbie-robertson-waltzes-back-into-rock.html | title = Recordings; Robbie Robertson Waltzes Back Into Rock | date = November 1, 1987 | accessdate =September 27, 2008 | last = Palmer | first = Robert |work=The New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 28 at Forest Hills Tennis Stadium, the group was heckled by an audience still annoyed by Dylan's electric sound. The band's reception on September 3 at the [[Hollywood Bowl]] was more favorable.&lt;ref&gt;Sounes, ''Down The Highway: The Life Of Bob Dylan'', pp. 189–90.&lt;/ref&gt;

While Dylan and the Hawks met increasingly receptive audiences on tour, their studio efforts floundered. Producer [[Bob Johnston]] persuaded Dylan to record in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] in February 1966, and surrounded him with a cadre of top-notch session men. At Dylan's insistence, Robertson and Kooper came down from New York City to play on the sessions.&lt;ref&gt;Heylin, ''Bob Dylan: Behind the Shades Revisited'', pp. 238–243.&lt;/ref&gt; The Nashville sessions produced the double-album ''[[Blonde on Blonde]]'' (1966), featuring what Dylan later called &quot;that thin wild mercury sound&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The closest I ever got to the sound I hear in my mind was on individual bands in the ''Blonde on Blonde'' album. It's that thin, that wild mercury sound. It's metallic and bright gold, with whatever that conjures up.&quot; Dylan Interview, ''Playboy'', March 1978; reprinted in Cott, ''Dylan on Dylan: The Essential Interviews'', p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt; Al Kooper described the album as &quot;taking two cultures and smashing them together with a huge explosion&quot;: the musical world of Nashville and the world of the &quot;quintessential New York hipster&quot; Bob Dylan.&lt;ref&gt;Gill, ''My Back Pages'', p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 22, 1965, Dylan secretly married 25-year-old former model [[Sara Dylan|Sara Lownds]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Sounes-p193&quot;&gt;Sounes, ''Down The Highway: The Life Of Bob Dylan'', p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of Dylan's friends (including [[Ramblin' Jack Elliott]]) claim that, in conversation immediately after the event, Dylan denied that he was married.&lt;ref name = &quot;Sounes-p193&quot;/&gt; Journalist [[Nora Ephron]] first made the news public in the ''[[New York Post]]'' in February 1966 with the headline &quot;Hush! Bob Dylan is wed.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Shelton, ''No Direction Home'', p. 325.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dylan undertook a [[Bob Dylan World Tour 1966|world tour]] of Australia and Europe in the spring of 1966. Each show was split into two parts. Dylan performed solo during the first half, accompanying himself on [[Steel-string guitar|acoustic guitar]] and harmonica. In the second half, backed by [[The Band#Early years: The Hawks|the Hawks]], he played high voltage electric music. This contrast provoked many fans, who jeered and [[Slow clap|slow handclapped]].&lt;ref&gt;Heylin, ''Bob Dylan: Behind the Shades Revisited'', pp. 244–261.&lt;/ref&gt; The tour culminated in a famously raucous confrontation between Dylan and his audience at the Manchester [[Free Trade Hall]] in England on May 17, 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.nme.com/reviews/bob-dylan/199| title = Live 1966| date = September 6, 1998| accessdate =May 2, 2010|work=NME |location=UK }}&lt;/ref&gt; An official recording of this concert was finally released in 1998: ''[[The Bootleg Series Vol. 4: Bob Dylan Live 1966, The &quot;Royal Albert Hall&quot; Concert|The Bootleg Series Vol. 4: Bob Dylan Live 1966]]''. At the climax of the evening, a member of the audience, angered by Dylan's electric backing, shouted: &quot;[[Judas Iscariot|Judas]]!&quot; to which Dylan responded, &quot;I don't believe you&amp;nbsp;... You're a liar!&quot; Dylan turned to his band and said, &quot;Play it fucking loud!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Dylan's dialogue with the Manchester audience is recorded (with subtitles) in Martin Scorsese's documentary ''[[No Direction Home]]''&lt;/ref&gt; as they launched into the final song of the night—&quot;Like a Rolling Stone.&quot;

During his 1966 tour, Dylan was frequently described as exhausted and acting &quot;as if on a death trip&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Heylin, 2011, ''Bob Dylan: Behind the Shades: The 20th Anniversary Edition'', p. 251.&lt;/ref&gt; [[D. A. Pennebaker]], the film maker accompanying the tour, described Dylan as &quot;taking a lot of amphetamine and who-knows-what-else.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Heylin, 2011, ''Bob Dylan: Behind the Shades: The 20th Anniversary Edition'', p. 250.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1969 interview with [[Jann Wenner]], Dylan said, &quot;I was on the road for almost five years. It wore me down. I was on drugs, a lot of things... just to keep going, you know?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Rolling Stone'', November 29, 1969. Reprinted in Cott (ed.), ''Dylan on Dylan: The Essential Interviews'', p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, [[BBC Radio 4]] reported that, in an interview which [[Robert Shelton (critic)|Robert Shelton]] had taped in 1966, Dylan claimed that he had kicked a heroin habit in New York City: &quot;I got very, very strung out for a while... I had about a $25-a-day habit and I kicked it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/today/newsid_9492000/9492886.stm| title = Dylan tapes reveal heroin addiction| author=Jones, Rebecca| date = May 23, 2011| accessdate =May 26, 2011| publisher=BBC Radio 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some journalists questioned the validity of this confession, pointing out that Dylan had &quot;been telling journalists wild lies about his past since the earliest days of his career.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

====Motorcycle accident and reclusion====

After his European tour, Dylan returned to New York, but the pressures on him increased. [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC Television]] had paid an advance for a TV show they could screen.&lt;ref&gt;Sounes, ''Down The Highway: The Life Of Bob Dylan'', p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt; His publisher, [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]], was demanding a finished manuscript of the poem/novel ''[[Tarantula (book)|Tarantula]].'' Manager [[Albert Grossman]] had already scheduled an extensive concert tour for that summer and fall.

On July 29, 1966, Dylan crashed his 500cc [[Triumph Tiger 100]] motorcycle on a road near his home in [[Woodstock, New York|Woodstock]], New York, throwing him to the ground. Though the extent of his injuries were never fully disclosed, Dylan said that he broke several [[vertebrae]] in his neck.&lt;ref name = &quot;Sounes-217&quot;&gt;Sounes, ''Down The Highway: The Life Of Bob Dylan'', pp. 217–219.&lt;/ref&gt; Mystery still surrounds the circumstances of the accident since no ambulance was called to the scene and Dylan was not hospitalized.&lt;ref name = &quot;Sounes-217&quot;/&gt; Dylan's biographers have written that the crash offered Dylan the much-needed chance to escape from the pressures that had built up around him.&lt;ref name = &quot;Sounes-217&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;shades268&quot;&gt;Heylin, ''Bob Dylan: Behind the Shades Revisited'', pp. 268.&lt;/ref&gt; Dylan confirmed this interpretation of the crash when he stated in his autobiography, &quot;I had been in a motorcycle accident and I'd been hurt, but I recovered. Truth was that I wanted to get out of the rat race.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Dylan, ''Chronicles, Volume One'', p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; In the wake of his accident, Dylan withdrew from the public and, apart from a few select appearances, did not tour again for almost eight years.&lt;ref&gt;Heylin, 1996, ''Bob Dylan: A Life In Stolen Moments'', p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt;

Once Dylan was well enough to resume creative work, he began editing film footage of his 1966 tour for ''[[Eat the Document]]'', a rarely exhibited follow-up to ''[[Dont Look Back]]''. A rough-cut was shown to [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC Television]] and was promptly rejected as incomprehensible to a mainstream audience.&lt;ref&gt;Sounes, ''Down The Highway: The Life Of Bob Dylan'', p. 216.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1967 he began recording music with the Hawks at his home and in the basement of the Hawks' nearby house, called &quot;Big Pink&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Sounes, ''Down The Highway: The Life Of Bob Dylan'', pp.&amp;nbsp;222–225.&lt;/ref&gt; These songs, initially compiled as demos for other artists to record, provided hit singles for [[Julie Driscoll]] (&quot;[[This Wheel's on Fire (song)|This Wheel's on Fire]]&quot;), [[The Byrds]] (&quot;[[You Ain't Goin' Nowhere]]&quot;, &quot;Nothing Was Delivered&quot;), and [[Manfred Mann]] (&quot;[[Quinn the Eskimo (Mighty Quinn)|Mighty Quinn]]&quot;). Columbia belatedly released selections from them in 1975 as ''[[The Basement Tapes]]''. Over the years, more and more of the songs recorded by Dylan and his band in 1967 appeared on various [[bootleg recording]]s, culminating in a five-CD bootleg set titled ''The Genuine Basement Tapes'', containing [[List of Basement Tapes songs|107 songs and alternate takes]].&lt;ref&gt;Marcus, ''The Old, Weird America'', pp. 236–265.&lt;/ref&gt; In the coming months, the Hawks recorded the album ''[[Music from Big Pink]]'' using songs they first worked on in their basement in Woodstock, and renamed themselves [[The Band]],&lt;ref&gt;Helm, Levon and Davis, ''This Wheel's on Fire'', p. 164; p. 174.&lt;/ref&gt; thus beginning a long and successful recording and performing career of their own.

In October and November 1967, Dylan returned to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Bob Dylan's 1967 recording sessions| url = http://www.bjorner.com/DSN01620%201967.htm#DSN01640| accessdate =November 10, 2008| publisher=Bjorner's Still On the Road}}&lt;/ref&gt; Back in the recording studio after a 19-month break, he was accompanied only by [[Charlie McCoy]] on bass,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.charliemccoy.com/bio.html | title = Charlie McCoy's Bio | accessdate =September 25, 2008 | publisher=www.charliemccoy.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kenny Buttrey]] on drums,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/kenny-buttrey-550523.html | title = Kenny Buttrey :'Transcendental' drummer for artists from Elvis Presley to Bob Dylan and Neil Young | date = September 23, 2004 | accessdate =September 25, 2008 | last = Wadey | first = Paul |work=The Independent |location=UK }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Pete Drake]] on steel guitar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/drake_pete/bio.jhtml | title = Pete Drake: Biography | accessdate =September 25, 2008 | last = Harris | first = Craig | publisher=[[Country Music Television]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result was ''[[John Wesley Harding (album)|John Wesley Harding]]'', a quiet, contemplative record of shorter songs, set in a landscape that drew on both the [[American West]] and the Bible. The sparse structure and instrumentation, coupled with lyrics that took the [[Judeo-Christian]] tradition seriously, marked a departure not only from Dylan's own work but from the escalating psychedelic fervor of the 1960s musical culture.&lt;ref&gt;Heylin, ''Bob Dylan: Behind the Shades Revisited'', pp. 282–288.&lt;/ref&gt; It included &quot;[[All Along the Watchtower]]&quot;, with lyrics derived from the [[Book of Isaiah]] (21:5–9). The song was later recorded by [[Jimi Hendrix]], whose version Dylan later acknowledged as definitive.&lt;ref name = &quot;Crowe-1985&quot;/&gt; Woody Guthrie died on October 3, 1967, and Dylan made his first live appearance in twenty months at a Guthrie memorial concert held at [[Carnegie Hall]] on January 20, 1968, where he was backed by The Band.

 |format = [[Ogg]]}}

Dylan's next release, ''[[Nashville Skyline]]'' (1969), was virtually a mainstream country record featuring instrumental backing by [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] musicians, a mellow-voiced Dylan, a duet with [[Johnny Cash]], and the hit single &quot;[[Lay Lady Lay]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Gill, ''My Back Pages'', p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt; Dylan and Cash also recorded a series of duets, but only their recording of Dylan's &quot;[[Girl from the North Country]]&quot; was used on the album.

In May 1969, Dylan appeared on the first episode of [[Johnny Cash]]'s new television show, duetting with Cash on &quot;[[Girl from the North Country]]&quot;, &quot;I Threw It All Away&quot; and &quot;Living the Blues&quot;. Dylan next travelled to England to top the bill at the [[Isle of Wight]] rock festival on August 31, 1969, after rejecting overtures to appear at the [[Woodstock Festival]] far closer to his home.&lt;ref&gt;Sounes, ''Down The Highway: The Life Of Bob Dylan'', pp. 248–253.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1970s===
In the early 1970s, critics charged that Dylan's output was of varied and unpredictable quality. ''Rolling Stone'' magazine writer [[Greil Marcus]] notoriously asked &quot;What is this shit?&quot; on first listening to ''[[Self Portrait (Bob Dylan album)|Self Portrait]]'', released in June 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2011/may/15/bob-dylan-writings-marcus-review| title = Bob Dylan: Writings 1968-2010 by Greil Marcus| author = Ford, Mark| date = May 14, 2011| accessdate = August 20, 2011| publisher = guardian.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.mojo4music.com/blog/2007/11/bob_dylan.html | title = Bob Dylan—Disc of the Day: ''Self Portrait'' | last = Male | first = Andrew | date = November 26, 2007 | accessdate =September 24, 2008 | publisher=[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, ''Self Portrait'', a double LP including few original songs, was poorly received.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.robertchristgau.com/get_artist.php?name=Bob+Dylan| title = Self Portrait| author=Christgau, Robert| accessdate =May 2, 2010| publisher=robertchristgau.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1970, Dylan released ''[[New Morning]]'', which some considered a return to form.&lt;ref&gt;Shelton, ''No Direction Home'', p. 482.&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1968, Dylan had co-written &quot;I'd Have You Anytime&quot; with [[George Harrison]];&lt;ref&gt;Heylin, 2009, ''Revolution In The Air, The Songs of Bob Dylan: Volume One'', pp. 391–392.&lt;/ref&gt; Harrison recorded both &quot;I'd Have You Anytime&quot; and Dylan's &quot;If Not For You&quot; for his 1970 solo triple album ''[[All Things Must Pass]]''. Dylan's surprise appearance at Harrison's 1971 ''[[Concert for Bangladesh]]'' attracted much media coverage, reflecting that Dylan's live appearances had become rare.&lt;ref&gt;Heylin, ''Bob Dylan: Behind the Shades Revisited'', pp. 328–331.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between March 16 and 19, 1971, Dylan reserved three days at Blue Rock Studios, a small studio in New York's [[Greenwich Village]]. These sessions resulted in one single, &quot;[[Watching the River Flow]]&quot;, and a new recording of &quot;[[When I Paint My Masterpiece]]&quot;.&lt;ref name = bbctimeline&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfour/music/bobdylan/timeline/timeline_html.shtml | title = Bob Dylan Timeline | accessdate =September 25, 2008 |publisher=BBC }}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 4, 1971 Dylan recorded &quot;[[George Jackson (song)|George Jackson]]&quot;, which he released a week later.&lt;ref name = bbctimeline/&gt; For many, the single was a surprising return to protest material, mourning the killing of [[Black Panther Party|Black Panther]] [[George Jackson (Black Panther)|George Jackson]] in [[San Quentin Prison]] that summer.&lt;ref&gt;Gray, ''The Bob Dylan Encyclopedia'', ´pp. 342–343.&lt;/ref&gt; Dylan contributed piano and harmony vocals to [[Steve Goodman]]'s album, ''Somebody Else's Troubles'', under the pseudonym Robert Milkwood Thomas in September 1972.&lt;ref&gt;Gray, ''The Bob Dylan Encyclopedia'', p. 267.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, Dylan signed onto [[Sam Peckinpah]]'s film ''[[Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid]]'', providing [[Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid (album)|songs and backing music]] for the movie, and playing the role of &quot;Alias&quot;, a member of Billy's gang with some historical basis.&lt;ref&gt;C.

====Return to touring====

Dylan began 1973 by signing with a new record label, [[David Geffen]]'s [[Asylum Records]], when his contract with Columbia Records expired. On his next album, ''[[Planet Waves]]'', he used The Band as backing group, while rehearsing for a major tour. The album included two versions of &quot;Forever Young&quot;, which became one of his most popular songs.&lt;ref name = &quot;Sounes-p273&quot;&gt;Sounes, 2001, ''Down The Highway: The Life Of Bob Dylan'', pp. 273–274.&lt;/ref&gt; As one critic described it, the song projected &quot;something hymnal and heartfelt that spoke of the father in Dylan&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Heylin, ''Bob Dylan: Behind the Shades Revisited'', p. 354.&lt;/ref&gt; and Dylan himself commented: &quot;I wrote it thinking about one of my boys and not wanting to be too sentimental.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Dylan's comment in booklet notes to ''[[Biograph (album)|Biograph]]'', 1985, CBS Records.&lt;/ref&gt; Biographer [[Howard Sounes]] noted that [[Jakob Dylan]] believed the song was about him.&lt;ref name = &quot;Sounes-p273&quot;/&gt;

Columbia Records simultaneously released ''[[Dylan (1973 album)|Dylan]]'', a haphazard collection of studio outtakes (almost exclusively cover songs), which was widely interpreted as a churlish response to Dylan's signing with a rival record label.&lt;ref&gt;Heylin, ''Bob Dylan: Behind the Shades Revisited'', p. 358.&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1974, Dylan returned to live touring after a break of seven years; backed by The Band, he embarked on a high-profile, coast-to-coast [[Bob Dylan and The Band 1974 Tour|North American tour]], playing 40 concerts. A live double album of the tour, ''[[Before the Flood]]'', was released on Asylum Records. Soon, Columbia Records sent word that they &quot;will spare nothing to bring Dylan back into the fold&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;Shelton-378&quot;&gt;Shelton, ''No Direction Home'', p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; Dylan had second thoughts about Asylum, apparently miffed that while there had been millions of unfulfilled ticket requests for the 1974 tour, Geffen had managed to sell only 700,000 copies of ''Planet Waves''.&lt;ref name = &quot;Shelton-378&quot;/&gt; Dylan returned to Columbia Records, which subsequently reissued his two Asylum albums on their imprint.

{{Listen

 |title = &quot;Tangled Up in Blue&quot;
 |description= Dylan said of the opening song from ''[[Blood on the Tracks]]'': &quot;I was trying to deal with the concept of time, and the way the characters change from the first person to the third person, and you're never sure if the first person is talking or the third person. But as you look at the whole thing it really doesn't matter.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;Crowe-1985&quot;/&gt;
 |format = [[Ogg]]}}

After the tour, Dylan and his wife became publicly estranged. He filled a small red notebook with songs about relationships and ruptures, and quickly recorded a new album entitled ''[[Blood on the Tracks]]'' in September 1974.&lt;ref&gt;Heylin, ''Bob Dylan: Behind the Shades Revisited'', pp. 368–383.&lt;/ref&gt; Dylan delayed the album's release, however, and re-recorded half of the songs at [[Sound 80]] Studios in [[Minneapolis]] with production assistance from his brother David Zimmerman.&lt;ref&gt;Heylin, ''Bob Dylan: Behind the Shades Revisited'', pp. 369–387.&lt;/ref&gt;

Released in early 1975, ''[[Blood on the Tracks]]'' received mixed reviews. In the ''[[NME]]'', [[Nick Kent]] described &quot;the accompaniments [as] often so trashy they sound like mere practice takes.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;Heylin 383&quot;&gt;Heylin, ''Bob Dylan: Behind the Shades Revisited'', p. 383.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Rolling Stone'', reviewer [[Jon Landau]] wrote that &quot;the record has been made with typical shoddiness.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;Heylin 383&quot;/&gt; However, over the years critics have come to see it as one of Dylan's greatest achievements, perhaps the only serious rival to his mid-1960s trilogy of albums. In [[Salon.com]], Bill Wyman wrote: &quot;''Blood on the Tracks'' is his only flawless album and his best produced; the songs, each of them, are constructed in disciplined fashion. It is his kindest album and most dismayed, and seems in hindsight to have achieved a sublime balance between the logorrhea-plagued excesses of his mid-1960s output and the self-consciously simple compositions of his post-accident years.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Bob Dylan | publisher=[[Salon.com]] | date = May 5, 2001 | url = http://www.salon.com/people/bc/2001/05/22/dylan/index3.html | accessdate =September 7, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Novelist [[Rick Moody]] called it &quot;the truest, most honest account of a love affair from tip to stern ever put down on magnetic tape.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hedin, ''Studio A: The Bob Dylan Reader'', p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt;

That summer Dylan wrote a lengthy ballad championing the cause of boxer [[Rubin Carter|Rubin &quot;Hurricane&quot; Carter]], who had been imprisoned for a triple murder committed in [[Paterson, New Jersey|Paterson]], New Jersey, in 1966. After visiting Carter in jail, Dylan wrote &quot;[[Hurricane (song)|Hurricane]]&quot;, presenting the case for Carter's innocence. Despite its 8:32 minute length, the song was released as a single, peaking at No.33 on the U.S. [[Billboard Hot 100|Billboard Chart]], and performed at every 1975 date of Dylan's next tour, the [[Rolling Thunder Revue]], named after the [[Shoshone]] medicine man, shaman, teacher, and activist [[Rolling Thunder (person)|Rolling Thunder]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.motherearthnews.com/Homesteading-and-Self-Reliance/1981-07-01/The-Plowboy-Interview-Rolling-Thunder.aspx &quot;The PlowBoy Interview: Rolling Thunder&quot;, ''Mother Earth News'', July/August 1981]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Log of every performance of &quot;Hurricane&quot; | publisher=Bjorner's Still on the Road | date = August 20, 2006 | url = http://www.bjorner.com/sixh.htm#_Toc481036436 | accessdate =September 7, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The tour was a varied evening of entertainment featuring about one hundred performers and supporters drawn from the resurgent Greenwich Village folk scene, including [[T-Bone Burnett]], [[Ramblin' Jack Elliott]], [[Joni Mitchell]],&lt;ref name=Kokay&gt;{{cite web|author=Kokay, Les via Olof Björner|title=''Songs of the Underground: a collector's guide to the Rolling Thunder Revue 1975–1976''|year= 2000|url= http://www.bjorner.com/Underground.htm|accessdate=February 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sloman&gt;{{cite book| author=Sloman, Larry|title= On The Road with Bob Dylan|publisher=Three Rivers Press|isbn= 1-4000-4596-7|year= 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Mansfield]], [[Roger McGuinn]], [[Mick Ronson]], [[Joan Baez]], and violinist [[Scarlet Rivera]], whom Dylan discovered while she was walking down the street, her violin case hanging on her back.&lt;ref&gt;Gray, ''The Bob Dylan Encyclopedia'', p. 579.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Allen Ginsberg]] accompanied the troupe, staging scenes for the film Dylan was simultaneously shooting. [[Sam Shepard]] was initially hired to write the film's screenplay, but ended up accompanying the tour as informal chronicler.&lt;ref&gt;Shepard, ''Rolling Thunder Logbook'', pp. 2–49.&lt;/ref&gt;

Running through late 1975 and again through early 1976, the tour encompassed the release of the album ''[[Desire (Bob Dylan album)|Desire]]'', with many of Dylan's new songs featuring an almost [[travel literature|travelogue]]-like narrative style, showing the influence of his new collaborator, playwright [[Jacques Levy]].&lt;ref&gt;Heylin, ''Bob Dylan: Behind the Shades Revisited'', pp. 386–401,&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gray, ''The Bob Dylan Encyclopedia'', p. 408.&lt;/ref&gt; The spring 1976 half of the tour was documented by a TV concert special, ''Hard Rain'', and the LP ''[[Hard Rain (Bob Dylan album)|Hard Rain]]''; no concert album from the better-received and better-known opening half of the tour was released until 2002's ''[[The Bootleg Series Vol. 5: Bob Dylan Live 1975, The Rolling Thunder Revue|Live 1975]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[File:Bob Dylan 1978.jpg|thumb|180px|Dylan performing in Rotterdam, June 23, 1978]]
The fall 1975 tour with the Revue also provided the backdrop to Dylan's nearly four-hour film ''[[Renaldo and Clara]]'', a sprawling and improvised narrative, mixed with concert footage and reminiscences. Released in 1978, the movie received generally poor, sometimes scathing, reviews and had a very brief theatrical run.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In November 1976, Dylan appeared at The Band's &quot;farewell&quot; concert, along with other guests including [[Joni Mitchell]], [[Muddy Waters]], [[Van Morrison]] and [[Neil Young]]. [[Martin Scorsese]]'s acclaimed cinematic chronicle of this show, ''[[The Last Waltz]],'' was released in 1978 and included about half of Dylan's set.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 1978, Dylan embarked on a [[1978 Tour|year-long world tour]], performing 114 shows in Japan, the Far East, Europe and the US, to a total audience of two million people.

I put a lot of money into the movie, built a big house ... and it costs a lot to get divorced in California.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;Sounes314&quot;/&gt;

In April and May 1978, Dylan took the same large band and backing vocalists into Rundown Studios, a rehearsal space Dylan had rented in [[Santa Monica]], California, to record an album of new material: ''[[Street-Legal (album)|Street-Legal]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Heylin, 2011, ''Behind The Shades: The 20th Anniversary Edition'', pp. 479–481.&lt;/ref&gt; It was described by Michael Gray as, &quot;after ''Blood On The Tracks'', arguably Dylan's best record of the 1970s: a crucial album documenting a crucial period in Dylan's own life&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Gray, ''The Bob Dylan Encyclopedia'', p. 643.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it suffered from poor sound recording and mixing (attributed to Dylan's studio practices), muddying the instrumental detail until a remastered CD release in 1999 restored some of the songs' strengths.&lt;ref&gt;Heylin, ''Bob Dylan: Behind the Shades Revisited'', pp. 480–481.&lt;/ref&gt;

The second evangelical album, ''[[Saved (album)|Saved]]'' (1980), received mixed reviews, and was described by Dylan critic Michael Gray as &quot;the nearest thing to a follow-up album Dylan has ever made, ''Slow Train Coming II'' and inferior.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Gray, 2000, ''Song &amp; Dance Man III'', p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; When touring from the fall of 1979 through the spring of 1980, Dylan would not play any of his older, secular works, and he delivered declarations of his faith from the stage, such as:

{{quotation|Years ago they&amp;nbsp;... said I was a prophet. I used to say, &quot;No I'm not a prophet&quot; they say &quot;Yes you are, you're a prophet.&quot; I said, &quot;No it's not me.&quot; They used to say &quot;You sure are a prophet.&quot; They used to convince me I was a prophet. Now I come out and say Jesus Christ is the answer. They say, &quot;Bob Dylan's no prophet.&quot; They just can't handle it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Dylan's embrace of born-again Christianity was unpopular with some of his fans and fellow musicians.&lt;ref&gt;Sounes, ''Down The Highway: The Life Of Bob Dylan'', pp. 334–336.&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly before [[death of John Lennon|his murder]], [[John Lennon]] recorded &quot;Serve Yourself&quot; in response to Dylan's &quot;Gotta Serve Somebody&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Robert|last=Rosen|title=Nowhere Man: The Final Days of John Lennon|year=2002|publisher=Quick American Archives|page=137|isbn=0-932551-51-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1981, [[Stephen Holden]] wrote in the ''New York Times'' that &quot;neither age (he's now 40) nor his much-publicized conversion to born-again Christianity has altered his essentially iconoclastic temperament.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rock: Dylan, in Jersey, Revises Old Standbys |work=The New York Times | first = Stephen | last = Holden |date= October 29, 1981 | page=C19|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/29/arts/rock-dylan-in-jersey-revises-old-standbys.html|accessdate=May 12, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1980s===
[[File:Bob Dylan Barcelona.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Dylan plays his guitar and sings into a microphone onstage.|Dylan in [[Barcelona, Spain|Barcelona]], Spain, 1984]]
In the fall of 1980 Dylan briefly resumed touring for a series of concerts billed as &quot;A Musical Retrospective&quot;, where he restored several of his popular 1960s songs to the repertoire. ''[[Shot of Love]]'', recorded the next spring, featured Dylan's first secular compositions in more than two years, mixed with explicitly Christian songs; the song &quot;[[Every Grain of Sand (Bob Dylan song)|Every Grain of Sand]]&quot; reminded some critics of [[William Blake]]'s verses.&lt;ref&gt;Gray, ''The Bob Dylan Encyclopedia'', pp. 215–221.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s the reception of Dylan's recorded work varied, from the well-regarded ''[[Infidels]]'' in 1983 to the panned ''[[Down in the Groove]]'' in 1988. Critics such as [[Michael Gray (author)|Michael Gray]] condemned Dylan's 1980s albums both for showing an extraordinary carelessness in the studio and for failing to release his best songs.&lt;ref&gt;Gray, ''Song &amp; Dance Man III: The Art of Bob Dylan'', pp. 11–14.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Infidels'' recording sessions, for example, produced several notable songs that Dylan left off the album. Most well regarded of these were &quot;[[Blind Willie McTell (song)|Blind Willie McTell]]&quot;, a tribute to the dead blues musician and an evocation of [[African American history]],&lt;ref&gt;''The Bob Dylan Encyclopedia'', pp. 56–59.&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Foot of Pride&quot; and &quot;Lord Protect My Child&quot;. These three songs were later released on ''[[The Bootleg Series Volumes 1–3 (Rare &amp; Unreleased) 1961–1991]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Sounes, ''Down The Highway: The Life Of Bob Dylan''. pp. 354–356.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between July 1984 and March 1985, Dylan recorded his next studio album, ''[[Empire Burlesque]]''.&lt;ref name = Sounes362&gt;Sounes, 2001, ''Down The Highway: The Life Of Bob Dylan'', p. 362.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arthur Baker (musician)|Arthur Baker]], who had remixed hits for [[Bruce Springsteen]] and [[Cyndi Lauper]], was asked to engineer and mix the album. Baker has said he felt he was hired to make Dylan's album sound &quot;a little bit more contemporary&quot;.&lt;ref name = Sounes362/&gt;

Dylan sang on [[USA for Africa]]'s famine relief fundraising single &quot;[[We Are the World]]&quot;. On July 13, 1985, he appeared at the climax at the [[Live Aid]] concert at [[JFK Stadium]], Philadelphia. Backed by [[Keith Richards]] and [[Ronnie Wood]], Dylan performed a ragged version of &quot;Hollis Brown&quot;, his ballad of rural poverty, and then said to the worldwide audience exceeding one billion people: &quot;I hope that some of the money&amp;nbsp;... maybe they can just take a little bit of it, maybe&amp;nbsp;... one or two million, maybe&amp;nbsp;... and use it to pay the mortgages on some of the farms and, the farmers here, owe to the banks.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Sounes, ''Down The Highway: The Life Of Bob Dylan'', p. 367.&lt;/ref&gt; His remarks were widely criticized as inappropriate, but they did inspire [[Willie Nelson]] to organize a series of events, [[Farm Aid]], to benefit debt-ridden American farmers.&lt;ref&gt;Sounes, ''Down The Highway: The Life Of Bob Dylan'', pp. 365–367.&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1986, Dylan made a brief foray into the world of [[rap music]] when he added vocals to the opening verse of &quot;Street Rock&quot;, a song featured on [[Kurtis Blow]]'s album ''Kingdom Blow''.&lt;ref&gt;Gray, 2006, ''The Bob Dylan Encyclopedia'', p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; Dylan's next studio album, ''[[Knocked Out Loaded]]'', was released in July 1986 and contained three cover songs (by Little [[Junior Parker]], [[Kris Kristofferson]] and the traditional gospel hymn &quot;[[Precious Memories (hymn)|Precious Memories]]&quot;), plus three collaborations with other writers ([[Tom Petty]], [[Sam Shepard]] and [[Carole Bayer Sager]]), and two solo compositions by Dylan. One reviewer commented that &quot;the record follows too many detours to be consistently compelling, and some of those detours wind down roads that are indisputably dead ends. By 1986, such uneven records weren't entirely unexpected by Dylan, but that didn't make them any less frustrating.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = {{Allmusic|class=album|id=r6448|pure_url=yes}}| title = Knocked Out Loaded| author=Erlewine, Stephen Thomas| accessdate =May 2, 2010| publisher=allmusic}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first Dylan album since ''[[The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan|Freewheelin']]'' (1963) to fail to make the Top 50.&lt;ref&gt;Heylin, ''Bob Dylan: Behind the Shades Revisited'', p. 595.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, some critics have called the 11-minute epic that Dylan co-wrote with Sam Shepard, '[[Brownsville Girl]]', a work of genius.&lt;ref&gt;Gray, ''The Bob Dylan Encyclopedia'', pp. 95–100.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986 and 1987, Dylan toured extensively with [[Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers]], sharing vocals with Petty on several songs each night. Dylan also toured with [[Grateful Dead|The Grateful Dead]] in 1987, resulting in a live album ''[[Dylan &amp; The Dead]]''. This album received some very negative reviews: ''[[Allmusic]]'' said, &quot;Quite possibly the worst album by either Bob Dylan or the Grateful Dead.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = {{Allmusic|class=album|id=r54428|pure_url=yes}}

E. Smith]]. Dylan would continue to tour with a small, constantly evolving band for the next 20 years.&lt;ref name = bbctimeline/&gt;
[[File:Bob Dylan in Toronto2.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Dylan, onstage and with eyes closed, plays a chord on an electric guitar.|Dylan in Toronto April 18, 1980]]

In 1987, Dylan starred in [[Richard Marquand]]'s movie ''[[Hearts of Fire]]'', in which he played Billy Parker, a washed-up-rock-star-turned-chicken farmer whose teenage lover ([[Fiona (singer)|Fiona]]) leaves him for a jaded English synth-pop sensation (played by [[Rupert Everett]]).&lt;ref&gt;Sounes, ''Down The Highway: The Life Of Bob Dylan'', pp. 376–383.&lt;/ref&gt; Dylan also contributed two original songs to the soundtrack—&quot;Night After Night&quot;, and &quot;I Had a Dream About You, Baby&quot;, as well as a cover of [[John Hiatt]]'s &quot;The Usual&quot;. The film was a critical and commercial flop.&lt;ref&gt;Heylin, ''Bob Dylan: Behind the Shades Revisited'', pp. 599–604.&lt;/ref&gt;
Dylan was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in January 1988, with Bruce Springsteen's introductory speech declaring, &quot;Bob freed your mind the way Elvis freed your body. He showed us that just because music was innately physical did not mean that it was anti-intellectual.&lt;ref&gt;Speech on Bob Dylan's induction to the Rock'n'Roll Hall of Fame, January 20, 1988, reprinted in Bauldie (ed.), ''Wanted Man: In Search of Bob Dylan'', pp. 191–193.&lt;/ref&gt;

When Dylan released the album ''[[Down in the Groove]]'' in May 1988, it was even more unsuccessful in its sales than his previous studio album.&lt;ref name = &quot;Sounes 385&quot;&gt;Sounes, ''Down The Highway: The Life Of Bob Dylan'', p. 385.&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Gray wrote: &quot;The very title undercuts any idea that inspired work may lie within. Here was a further devaluing of the notion of a new Bob Dylan album as something significant.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gray 2000, p. 13&quot;&gt;Gray, 2000, ''Song &amp; Dance Man III'', p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; The critical and commercial disappointment of that album was swiftly followed by the success of the [[Traveling Wilburys]]. Dylan co-founded the band with [[George Harrison]], [[Jeff Lynne]], [[Roy Orbison]], and [[Tom Petty]], and in the fall of 1988 their multi-platinum ''[[Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1]]'' reached number three on the US album chart,&lt;ref name = &quot;Sounes 385&quot;/&gt; featuring songs that were described as Dylan's most accessible compositions in years.&lt;ref&gt;Heylin, ''Bob Dylan: Behind the Shades Revisited'', pp. 627–628.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite Orbison's death in December 1988, the remaining four recorded a second album in May 1990, which they released with the unexpected title ''[[Traveling Wilburys Vol. 3]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Heylin, ''Bob Dylan: Behind the Shades Revisited'', pp. 638–640.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dylan finished the decade on a critical high note with ''[[Oh Mercy]]'' produced by [[Daniel Lanois]]. Dylan critic Michael Gray wrote that the album was: &quot;Attentively written, vocally distinctive, musically warm, and uncompromisingly professional, this cohesive whole is the nearest thing to a great Bob Dylan album in the 1980s.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gray 2000, p. 13&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dylan, ''Chronicles, Volume One'', pp. 145–221.&lt;/ref&gt; The track &quot;Most of the Time&quot;, a lost love composition, was later prominently featured in the film ''[[High Fidelity (film)|High Fidelity]]'', while &quot;What Was It You Wanted?&quot; has been interpreted both as a catechism and a wry comment on the expectations of critics and fans.&lt;ref&gt;Ricks, ''Dylan's Visions of Sin'', pp. 413–20.&lt;/ref&gt; The religious imagery of &quot;Ring Them Bells&quot; struck some critics as a re-affirmation of faith.&lt;ref&gt;Scott Marshall wrote: &quot;When Dylan sings that 'The sun is going down upon the sacred cow', it's safe to assume that the sacred cow here is the biblical metaphor for all false gods. For Dylan, the world will eventually know that there is only one God.&quot; Marshall, ''Restless Pilgrim'', p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1990s===
Dylan's 1990s began with ''[[Under the Red Sky]]'' (1990), an about-face from the serious ''Oh Mercy''. The album contained several apparently simple songs, including &quot;Under the Red Sky&quot; and &quot;Wiggle Wiggle&quot;. The album was dedicated to &quot;Gabby Goo Goo&quot;; this was later explained as a nickname for the daughter of Dylan and [[Carolyn Dennis]], Desiree Gabrielle Dennis-Dylan, who was four at that time.&lt;ref&gt;Gray, ''The Bob Dylan Encyclopedia'', p. 174.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sidemen]] on the album included George Harrison, [[Slash (musician)|Slash]] from [[Guns N' Roses]], [[David Crosby]], [[Bruce Hornsby]], [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]], and [[Elton John]]. Despite the stellar line-up, the record received bad reviews and sold poorly.&lt;ref&gt;Sounes, ''Down The Highway: The Life Of Bob Dylan'', p. 391.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, Dylan was honored by the recording industry with a [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]] from American actor [[Jack Nicholson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.grammy.org/recording-academy/awards/lifetime-awards| title = Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award| accessdate =September 25, 2008| publisher=Grammy.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event coincided with the start of the [[Gulf War]] against [[Saddam Hussein]], and Dylan performed his song &quot;[[Masters of War]]&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;Heylin-664&quot; /&gt; Dylan then made a short speech that startled some of the audience.&lt;ref name = &quot;Heylin-664&quot;&gt;Heylin, ''Bob Dylan: Behind the Shades Revisited'', pp. 664–665. Heylin quotes the speech: &quot;My daddy once said to me, he said, 'Son, it is possible for you to become so defiled in this world that your own mother and father will abandon you. If that happens, God will believe in your ability to mend your own ways.' &quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

The next few years saw Dylan returning to his roots with two albums covering old folk and blues numbers: ''[[Good as I Been to You]]'' (1992) and ''[[World Gone Wrong]]'' (1993), featuring interpretations and acoustic guitar work. Many critics and fans commented on the quiet beauty of the song &quot;Lone Pilgrim&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Gray, ''The Bob Dylan Encyclopedia'', p. 423.&lt;/ref&gt; penned by a 19th century teacher and sung by Dylan with a haunting reverence. In November 1994 Dylan recorded two live shows for ''[[MTV Unplugged]]''. He claimed his wish to perform a set of traditional songs for the show was overruled by [[Sony]] executives who insisted on a greatest hits package.&lt;ref&gt;Sounes, ''Down The Highway: The Life Of Bob Dylan'', pp. 408–409.&lt;/ref&gt; The album produced from it, ''[[MTV Unplugged (Bob Dylan album)|MTV Unplugged]]'', included &quot;John Brown&quot;, an unreleased 1963 song detailing the ravages of both war and [[jingoism]].

With a collection of songs reportedly written while snowed-in on his Minnesota ranch,&lt;ref&gt;Heylin, ''Bob Dylan: Behind the Shades Revisited'', p. 693.&lt;/ref&gt; Dylan booked recording time with [[Daniel Lanois]] at [[Miami]]'s [[Criteria Studios]] in January 1997. The subsequent recording sessions were, by some accounts, fraught with musical tension.&lt;ref&gt;Heylin, ''Bob Dylan: Behind the Shades Revisited'', p. 697.&lt;/ref&gt; Late that spring, before the album's release, Dylan was hospitalized with a life-threatening heart infection, [[pericarditis]], brought on by [[histoplasmosis]]. His scheduled European tour was cancelled, but Dylan made a speedy recovery and left the hospital saying, &quot;I really thought I'd be seeing [[Elvis Presley|Elvis]] soon.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Sounes, ''Down The Highway: The Life Of Bob Dylan'', p. 420.&lt;/ref&gt; He was back on the road by midsummer, and in early fall performed before [[Pope John Paul II]] at the World Eucharistic Conference in [[Bologna]], Italy. The Pope treated the audience of 200,000 people to a homily based on Dylan's lyric &quot;Blowin' in the Wind&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Sounes, ''Down The Highway: The Life Of Bob Dylan'', p. 426.&lt;/ref&gt;

September saw the release of the new Lanois-produced album, ''[[Time Out of Mind]]''. With its bitter assessment of love and morbid ruminations, Dylan's first collection of original songs in seven years was highly acclaimed. One critic wrote: &quot;the songs themselves are uniformly powerful, adding up to Dylan's best overall collection in years.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = {{Allmusic|class=album|id=r314906|pure_url=yes}}| title = Time Out of Mind| author=Erlewine, Stephen Thomas| accessdate =May 1, 2010| publisher=allmusic}}&lt;/ref&gt; This collection of complex songs won him his first solo &quot;Album of the Year&quot; [[Grammy Award]].&lt;ref&gt;Dylan had been one of several artists who had won &quot;Album of the Year&quot; in 1971 for ''[[The Concert for Bangladesh (album)|The Concert for Bangladesh]]''{{cite web

In December 1997, U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]] presented Dylan with a [[Kennedy Center]] Honor in the East Room of the [[White House]], paying this tribute: &quot;He probably had more impact on people of my generation than any other creative artist. His voice and lyrics haven't always been easy on the ear, but throughout his career Bob Dylan has never aimed to please. He's disturbed the peace and discomforted the powerful.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = http://clinton4.nara.gov/textonly/WH/New/html/19971208-2814.html

''[[&quot;Love and Theft&quot;]]'' was released on September 11, 2001.

In 2003, Dylan revisited the evangelical songs from his &quot;born again&quot; period and participated in the CD project ''[[Gotta Serve Somebody: The Gospel Songs of Bob Dylan]]''. That year also saw the release of the film ''[[Masked &amp; Anonymous]]'', which Dylan co-wrote with director [[Larry Charles]] under the alias Sergei Petrov.&lt;ref&gt;Dylan co-wrote ''[[Masked &amp; Anonymous]]'' under the pseudonym Seregei Petrov, taken from an actor in the silent movie era; Larry Charles used the alias Rene Fontaine.

In October 2004, Dylan published the first part of his autobiography, ''[[Chronicles: Volume One]]''. The book confounded expectations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Maslin&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/05/books/05masl.html |title=So You Thought You Knew Dylan?

He also devoted chapters to the albums ''[[New Morning]]'' (1970) and ''[[Oh Mercy]]'' (1989).

Dylan earned yet another distinction in a 2007 study of US legal opinions and briefs that found his lyrics were quoted by judges and lawyers more than those of any other songwriter, 186 times versus 74 by [[The Beatles]], who were second. Among those quoting Dylan were [[US Supreme Court]] [[Chief Justice John Roberts]] and Justice [[Antonin Scalia]], both conservatives. The most widely cited lines included &quot;you don't need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows&quot; from &quot;[[Subterranean Homesick Blues]]&quot; and &quot;when you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose&quot; from &quot;[[Like a Rolling Stone]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Carol J. |last=Williams |title=Judges hand down the law with help from Bob Dylan |date=May 9, 2011 |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-bob-dylan-law-20110509,0,7507838.story |work=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=May 10, 2011 |postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Robert (host)|last=Siegel |date=May 10, 2011 |title=Bob Dylan's Words Find Place In Legal Writings |url=http://www.npr.org/2011/05/10/136181949/bob-dylans-words-find-place-in-legal-writings |publisher=[[NPR]] |accessdate=May 10, 2011 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Modern Times'' (2006–08)====
May 3, 2006, was the premiere of Dylan's radio presenting career, hosting a weekly radio program, ''[[Theme Time Radio Hour]]'', for [[XM Satellite Radio]], with song selections revolving around a chosen theme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006x4gt |title=Theme Time Radio Hour With Bob Dylan |date=November 30, 2009 |accessdate=February 6, 2011 |publisher=BBC Radio 6 Music}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.notdarkyet.org/themetime.html |title=Theme Time Radio playlists |accessdate=September 7, 2008 |publisher=Not Dark Yet}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dylan played classic and obscure records from the 1930s to the present day, including contemporary artists as diverse as [[Blur (band)|Blur]], [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], [[L.L.

On August 29, 2006, Dylan released his ''[[Modern Times (Bob Dylan album)|Modern Times]]'' album. Despite some coarsening of Dylan's voice (a critic for ''[[The Guardian]]'' characterised his singing on the album as &quot;a catarrhal death rattle&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2006/aug/25/popandrock.shopping3 | author=Petridis, Alex| title = Bob Dylan's ''Modern Times''| accessdate =September 5, 2006|work=The Guardian |location=UK | date = August 28, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) most reviewers praised the album, and many described it as the final installment of a successful trilogy, embracing ''Time Out of Mind'' and ''&quot;Love and Theft&quot;''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = http://www.metacritic.com/music/modern-times

In August 2007, the award-winning film biography of Dylan ''[[I'm Not There]]'', written and directed by [[Todd Haynes]], was released—bearing the tagline &quot;inspired by the music and many lives of Bob Dylan&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6985422.stm | title = Blanchett wins top Venice Award | date = September 9, 2007 | accessdate =September 12, 2008 |publisher=BBC News }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Variety-07&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url =

On October 1, 2007, Columbia Records released the triple CD retrospective album ''[[Dylan (2007 album)|Dylan]]'', anthologising his entire career under the ''Dylan 07'' logo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = http://www.dylan07.com/| title = ''Dylan 07''| accessdate =September 7, 2008 | publisher=Sony BMG Music Entertainment| date = August 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of this campaign, [[Mark Ronson]] produced a re-mix of Dylan's 1966 tune &quot;[[Most Likely You Go Your Way (And I'll Go Mine)]],&quot; which was released as a maxi-single. This was the first time Dylan had sanctioned a re-mix of one of his classic recordings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The sophistication of the ''Dylan 07'' marketing campaign was a reminder that Dylan's commercial profile had risen considerably since the 1990s. This first became evidenced in 2004, when Dylan appeared in a TV advertisement for [[Victoria's Secret]] lingerie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =

He first sang about the car in his 1963 nuclear war fantasy, &quot;Talkin' World War III Blues&quot;, when he described it as a &quot;good car to drive—after a war&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; Then, in 2009, he gave the highest profile endorsement of his career, appearing with rapper [[Will.i.am]] in a [[Pepsi]] ad that debuted during the telecast of [[Super Bowl XLIII]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2009/jan/30/bob-dylan-pepsi-advertisement-superbowl| title = Bob Dylan to appear with Will.I.Am in Pepsi advertisement| author=Michaels, Sean| date = January 30, 2009| accessdate =May 2, 2010|work=The Guardian |location=UK }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ad, broadcast to a record audience of 98 million viewers, opened with Dylan singing the first verse of &quot;Forever Young&quot; followed by Will.i.am doing a [[hip hop]] version of the song's third and final verse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Kissel | first=Rick | title=Super Bowl ratings hit new high | work=Variety| date=February 3, 2009 | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117999515?refCatId=1275 | accessdate=February 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Together Through Life'', ''Christmas in the Heart'' (2009)====
Bob Dylan released his album ''[[Together Through Life]]'' on April 28, 2009. In a conversation with music journalist Bill Flanagan, published on Dylan's website, Dylan explained that the genesis of the record was when French film director [[Olivier Dahan]] asked him to supply a song for his new [[road movie]], ''[[My Own Love Song]]''; initially only intending to record a single track, &quot;Life Is Hard,&quot; &quot;the record sort of took its own direction&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://web.archive.org/web/20110425235613/http://www.bobdylan.com/conversation| title = Bob Dylan talks about the new album with Bill Flanagan| author=Flanagan, Bill| date = April 10, 2009| accessdate =March 30, 2012| publisher=bobdylan.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nine of the ten songs on the album are credited as co-written by Bob Dylan and [[Robert Hunter (lyricist)|Robert Hunter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Andy Gill wrote in ''[[The Independent]]'' that the record &quot;features Dylan in fairly relaxed, spontaneous mood, content to grab such grooves and sentiments as flit momentarily across his radar. So while it may not contain too many landmark tracks, it's one of the most naturally enjoyable albums you'll hear all year.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/reviews/album-bob-dylan-together-through-life-columbia-1673287.html| title = Bob Dylan's Together Through Life| author=Gill, Andy| date = April 24, 2009| accessdate =April 28, 2009| publisher=Salon.com | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview published in ''[[The Big Issue]]'', journalist Bill Flanagan asked Dylan why he had performed the songs in a straightforward style, and Dylan responded: &quot;There wasn't any other way to play it.

On October 4, 2011, Dylan's label, Egyptian Records, released an album of previously unheard [[Hank Williams]] songs, ''[[The Lost Notebooks of Hank Williams]]''. Dylan had helped to curate this project, in which songs unfinished when Williams died in 1953 were completed and recorded by a variety of artists, including Dylan himself, his son [[Jakob Dylan]], [[Levon Helm]], [[Norah Jones]], [[Jack White (musician)|Jack White]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.themortonreport.com/entertainment/music/bob-dylan-helps-bring-hank-williams-lost-notebooks-back-from-the-dead/| title = Bob Dylan Helps Bring Hank Williams' Lost Notebooks Back from the Dead| author = Uhelszki, Jaan| date = August 4, 2011

Dylan's performances in [[People's Republic of China|China]] in April 2011 generated controversy.

==Personal life==
===Family===
Dylan married [[Sara Dylan|Sara Lownds]] on November 22, 1965.

Dylan also adopted Sara's daughter from a prior marriage, Maria Lownds (later Dylan, born October 21, 1961). Maria married musician [[Peter Himmelman]] in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;Himmelman turned down an invitation to perform on ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' when it became apparent that the performance would fall on the Jewish holiday [[Sukkot]]. {{cite web| url = http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=130515341| title = Peter Himmelman Puts Family Before Rock 'n' Roll| date = October 12, 2010| accessdate = August 8, 2011| publisher = npr.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s, Dylan's son Jakob became well known as the lead singer of the band [[The Wallflowers]].

In total, Bob Dylan has six children (five biological and one adopted) and eleven grandchildren as of 2011.

===Religious beliefs===
Growing up in [[Hibbing, Minnesota|Hibbing]], Minnesota, Dylan and his family were part of the area's small but close-knit Jewish community, and in May 1954 Dylan had his [[Bar and Bat Mitzvah|Bar Mitzvah]].&lt;ref&gt;According to Robert Shelton, Dylan's teacher was &quot;Rabbi Reuben Maier of the only synagogue on the [[Iron Range]], Hibbing's Agudath Achim Synagogue&quot;. See Shelton, ''No Direction Home'', pp. 35–36.&lt;/ref&gt; Around the time of his 30th birthday, in 1971, Dylan visited [[Israel]], and also met Rabbi [[Meir Kahane]], founder of the New York-based [[Jewish Defense League]].&lt;ref&gt;Heylin, ''Bob Dylan: Behind the Shades Revisited'', p. 328.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Time Magazine]] quoted Dylan saying about Kahane, &quot;He's a really sincere guy. He's really put it all together.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,944419,00.html| title = People, May&amp;nbsp;31, 1971| date = May 31, 1971| accessdate =December 9, 2010| work=TIME }}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, Dylan downplayed the extent of his contact with Kahane.&lt;ref&gt;Heylin, ''Bob Dylan: Behind the Shades Revisited'', p. 329.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bob Dylan 1984.jpg|thumb|upright|left|alt=Dylan performing onstage with an electric guitar.|Dylan touring in the Netherlands, in 1984]]

For a period during the late 1970s and early 1980s, Dylan was a public convert to Christianity. From January to April 1979, he participated in Bible study classes at the [[Association of Vineyard Churches|Vineyard School of Discipleship]] in [[Reseda, California|Reseda]], California. Pastor Kenn Gulliksen has recalled: &quot;Larry Myers and Paul Emond went over to Bob's house and ministered to him. He responded by saying, 'Yes he did in fact want Christ in his life.' And he prayed that day and received the Lord.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Heylin, ''Bob Dylan: Behind the Shades Revisited'', p. 494.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gray, ''The Bob Dylan Encyclopedia'', pp. 76–80.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1984, Dylan was distancing himself from the &quot;[[Born again (Christianity)|born-again]]&quot; label. He told [[Kurt Loder]] of ''Rolling Stone'' magazine: &quot;I've never said I'm [[Born again (Christianity)|born again]]. That's just a media term. I don't think I've been an [[agnosticism|agnostic]]. I've always thought there's a superior power, that this is not the real world and that there's a world to come.&quot; In response to Loder's asking whether he belonged to any Church or synagogue, Dylan laughingly replied, &quot;Not really. Uh, the Church of the Poison Mind.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Rolling Stone'', June 21, 1984, reprinted in Cott (ed.), ''Dylan on Dylan: The Essential Interviews'', p. 288.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997 he told [[David Gates (author)|David Gates]] of ''[[Newsweek]]'':
{{cquote|Here's the thing with me and the religious thing. This is the flat-out truth: I find the religiosity and philosophy in the music. I don't find it anywhere else. Songs like &quot;Let Me Rest on a Peaceful Mountain&quot; or &quot;[[I Saw the Light (Hank Williams song)|I Saw the Light]]&quot;—that's my religion. I don't adhere to rabbis, preachers, evangelists, all of that. I've learned more from the songs than I've learned from any of this kind of entity. The songs are my lexicon. I believe the songs.&lt;ref name = &quot;Newsweek97&quot;/&gt;}}

In an interview published in ''The New York Times'' on September 28, 1997, journalist [[Jon Pareles]] reported that &quot;Dylan says he now subscribes to no organized religion.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1997/09/28/arts/pop-jazz-a-wiser-voice-blowin-in-the-autumn-wind.html |title=A Wiser Voice Blowin' In the Autumn Wind|first=Jon|last=Pareles|work=The New York Times |date=September 28, 1997|accessdate=May 12, 2010}} Reprinted in Cott, ''Dylan on Dylan: The Essential Interviews'', pp. 391–396.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dylan has been a supporter of the [[Chabad Lubavitch]] movement in the last 20 years,&lt;ref&gt;Fishkoff, ''The Rebbe's Army: Inside the World of Chabad-Lubavitch'', p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt; and has privately participated in Jewish religious events, including the [[bar mitzvah]]s of his sons and attending [[Hadar Hatorah]], a [[Chabad Lubavitch]] [[yeshiva]]. In September 1989 and September 1991, Dylan appeared on the Chabad [[telethon]].&lt;ref&gt;Heylin, 1996, ''A Life In Stolen Moments'', p. 317 and p.343.&lt;/ref&gt; Dylan reportedly visits [[Chabad|Chabad synagogues]]; on September 22, 2007 ([[Yom Kippur]]), he attended Congregation Beth Tefillah, in [[Atlanta]], Georgia, where he was called to the [[Torah]] for the sixth [[Baal kore|aliyah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Arutz| last=Sheva | title = Day of Atonement Draws Dylan to the Torah | publisher=Arutz Sheva—Israel National News | date = September 24, 2007 | url = http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/Flash.aspx/133709| accessdate =September 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dylan has continued to perform songs from his gospel albums in concert, occasionally covering traditional religious songs. He has also made passing references to his religious faith—such as in a 2004 interview with ''[[60 Minutes]]'', when he told [[Ed Bradley]] that &quot;the only person you have to think twice about lying to is either yourself or to God.&quot; He also explained his constant touring schedule as part of a bargain he made a long time ago with the &quot;chief commander—in this earth and in the world we can't see.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;60minutes2005&quot;&gt;{{cite news

In a 2009 interview with Bill Flanagan promoting his Christmas LP, ''[[Christmas in the Heart]]'', Flanagan commented on the &quot;heroic performance&quot; Dylan gave of &quot;[[O Little Town of Bethlehem]]&quot; and that Dylan &quot;delivered the song like a true believer&quot;.

==Legacy==
Bob Dylan is one of the most influential figures of the 20th century, musically and culturally. Dylan was included in the [[Time 100: The Most Important People of the Century]] where he was called &quot;master poet, caustic social critic and intrepid, guiding spirit of the counterculture generation&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;Time100Dylan&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url = http://www.shrout.co.uk/TIME%20Bob%20Dylan.html| title = The Time 100: Bob Dylan| author=Cocks, Jay| date = June 14, 1999| accessdate =October 5, 2008| work=shrout.co.uk/TIME }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[President Obama]] described Dylan in 2012 as &quot;one of the most influential American musicians of the 20th century&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;Medal&quot;/&gt; Biographer [[Howard Sounes]] placed him among the most exalted company when he said, &quot;There are giant figures in art who are sublimely good—[[Mozart]], [[Picasso]], [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], [[Shakespeare]], [[Dickens]]. Dylan ranks alongside these artists.&quot;&lt;ref name = fuss&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/4274190.stm | title = Bob Dylan—why the fuss? | date = September 23, 2005 | accessdate =October 5, 2008 | last = Duffy | first = Jonathan |publisher=BBC }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]] ranked Dylan at number two in his 'Top 50 Artists Of All Time', a ranking based on the cumulative votes for each artist’s albums that appear in Larkin's [[All Time Top 1000 Albums]].&lt;ref&gt;'Top 50 Artists Of All Time',  [[All Time Top 1000 Albums]], Virgin Books, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; 

Initially modeling his writing style on the songs of Woody Guthrie,&lt;ref name = &quot;chronicles243&quot;&gt;Dylan, ''Chronicles, Volume One'', pp. 243–246.&lt;/ref&gt; and lessons learned from the blues of [[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson]],&lt;ref name = &quot;chronicles281&quot;&gt;Dylan, ''Chronicles, Volume One'', pp. 281–288.&lt;/ref&gt; Dylan added increasingly sophisticated lyrical techniques to the folk music of the early 1960s, infusing it &quot;with the intellectualism of classic literature and poetry&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/175077/Bob-Dylan | title = Bob Dylan | accessdate =October 5, 2008 | publisher=[[Britannica]] Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Simon]] suggested that Dylan's early compositions virtually took over the folk genre: &quot;[Dylan's] early songs were very rich&amp;nbsp;... with strong melodies. 'Blowin' in the Wind' has a really strong melody. He so enlarged himself through the folk background that he incorporated it for a while. He defined the genre for a while.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Fong-Torres, ''The Rolling Stone Interviews, Vol. 2'', p. 424. Reproduced online:{{cite web| url = http://www.bobdylanroots.com/simon.html| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080421172331/http://www.bobdylanroots.com/simon.html| archivedate = April 21, 2008| title = ''Rolling Stone'' interview (1972) | date = June 6, 1972| accessdate =September 8, 2009| publisher=Bob Dylan Roots}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Dylan made his move from acoustic music to a rock backing, the mix became more complex. For many critics, Dylan's greatest achievement was the cultural synthesis exemplified by his mid-1960s trilogy of albums—''Bringing It All Back Home'', ''Highway 61 Revisited'' and ''Blonde on Blonde''. In [[Mike Marqusee]]'s words: &quot;Between late 1964 and the summer of 1966, Dylan created a body of work that remains unique. Drawing on folk, blues, country, R&amp;B, rock'n'roll, gospel, British beat, [[Symbolist poetry|symbolist]], [[Modernist poetry in English|modernist]] and [[Beat poetry]], [[surrealism]] and [[Dada]], advertising jargon and social commentary, [[Federico Fellini|Fellini]] and [[Mad magazine|''Mad'' magazine]], he forged a coherent and original artistic voice and vision. The beauty of these albums retains the power to shock and console.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Marqusee, ''Wicked Messenger'', p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt;

One legacy of Dylan's verbal sophistication was the increasing attention paid by literary critics to his lyrics. [[Christopher Ricks|Professor Christopher Ricks]] published a 500-page analysis of Dylan's work, placing him in the context of [[T. S. Eliot|Eliot]], [[John Keats|Keats]] and [[Alfred Tennyson|Tennyson]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Christopher|last=Ricks|title=Dylan's Visions of Sin|publisher=Penguin/Viking|year=2003|isbn=0-670-80133-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; and claiming that Dylan was a poet worthy of the same close and painstaking analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2004/jul/13/academicexperts.highereducationprofile | title = Ricks profile: Someone's gotta hold of his art | author=MacLeod, Donald | date = July 13, 2004 | accessdate =September 7, 2008 | work=The Guardian | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former British [[poet laureate]], [[Andrew Motion]], argued that Bob Dylan's lyrics should be studied in schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/poetry/article2503109.ece| title = Andrew Motion explains why Bob Dylan's lyrics should be studied in schools | author=Motion, Andrew| date = September 22, 2007| accessdate =October 10, 2008| work=The Times | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1996, academics have lobbied the [[Swedish Academy]] to award Dylan the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.expectingrain.com/dok/art/nobel/nobelpress.html | title = Finally and Formally Launched as a Candidate for the Nobel Prize for Literature, 1997 |accessdate=September 7, 2008| publisher=expectingrain.com | date = May 24, 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Ball|first=Gordon| url = http://journal.oraltradition.org/files/articles/22i/Ball.pdf |format=PDF| title = Dylan and the Nobel| accessdate =September 7, 2008 | work=[[Oral Tradition Journal|Oral Tradition]] | date = March 7, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/10/06/entertainment/main647862.shtml | title = Dylan's Words Strike Nobel Debate | accessdate =September 7, 2008 | publisher=CBS News | date = October 6, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.monstersandcritics.com/people/features/article_1502239.php/Clamour-grows-for-singer-Bob-Dylan-to-be-awarded-Nobel-Feature| title = Clamour grows for Dylan to be awarded Nobel prize| author=Borchert, Thomas| date = September 21, 2009| accessdate =September 21, 2009| publisher=Monsters &amp; Critics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dylan's voice was, in some ways, as startling as his lyrics. New York Times critic [[Robert Shelton (critic)|Robert Shelton]] described Dylan's early vocal style as &quot;a rusty voice suggesting Guthrie's old performances, etched in gravel like [[Dave Van Ronk|Dave Van Ronk's]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Shelton, ''No Direction Home'', pp. 108–111.&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Bowie]], in his tribute, &quot;[[Song for Bob Dylan]]&quot;, described Dylan's singing as &quot;a voice like sand and glue&quot;. Dylan's voice continued to develop as he began to work with rock'n'roll backing bands; critic Michael Gray described the sound of Dylan's vocal on his hit single, &quot;Like a Rolling Stone&quot;, as &quot;at once young and jeeringly cynical&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Gray, 2006, ''The Bob Dylan Encyclopedia'', p. 413.&lt;/ref&gt; As Dylan's voice aged during the 1980s, for some critics, it became more expressive. Christophe Lebold writes in the journal ''[[Oral Tradition Journal|Oral Tradition]]'', &quot;Dylan's more recent broken voice enables him to present a world view at the sonic surface of the songs—this voice carries us across the landscape of a broken, fallen world. The anatomy of a broken world in &quot;Everything is Broken&quot; (on the album ''[[Oh Mercy]]'') is but an example of how the thematic concern with all things broken is grounded in a concrete sonic reality.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://journal.oraltradition.org/issues/22i/lebold| title = A Face like a Mask and a Voice that Croaks: An Integrated Poetics of Bob Dylan's Voice, Personae, and Lyrics | author=Lebold, Christophe| date = March 1, 2007| accessdate =May 3, 2010| work=Oral Tradition }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dylan's influence has been felt in several musical genres. As Edna Gundersen stated in ''USA Today'': &quot;Dylan's musical DNA has informed nearly every simple twist of pop since 1962.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.usatoday.com/life/music/2001-05-18-35-years-of-dylan.htm#more | title = Forever Dylan | date = May 17, 2001 | accessdate =October 5, 2008 | last = Gundersen | first = Edna |work=USA Today }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many musicians have testified to Dylan's influence, such as [[Joe Strummer]], who praised Dylan as having &quot;laid down the template for lyric, tune, seriousness, spirituality, depth of rock music.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/talking_point/1349116.stm| title = Bob Dylan: His Legacy to Music| date = May 29, 2001| accessdate =October 5, 2008|publisher=BBC News }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other major musicians to have acknowledged Dylan's importance include [[John Lennon]],&lt;ref&gt;Lennon: &quot;In Paris in 1964 was the first time I ever heard Dylan at all. Paul got the record (''[[The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan]]'') from a French DJ. For three weeks in Paris we didn't stop playing it. We all went potty about Dylan.&quot;: Beatles, (2000), ''The Beatles Anthology'', pp. 112–114.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul McCartney]],&lt;ref&gt;McCartney: &quot;I'm in awe of Bob&amp;nbsp;... He hit a period where people went, 'Oh, I don't like him now.' And I said, 'No. It's Bob Dylan.' To me, it's like Picasso, where people discuss his various periods, 'This was better than this, was better than this.' But I go, 'No. It's Picasso. It's all good.' &quot;{{cite web | url = http://www.avclub.com/articles/paul-mccartney,14120/ | title = Paul McCartney interview| author=Siegel, Robert| date = June 27, 2007| accessdate =October 13, 2008| publisher=A.V.

He's the master. If I'd like to be anyone, it's him. And he's a great writer, true to his music and done what he feels is the right thing to do for years and years and years. He's great.

Some critics have dissented from the view of Dylan as a visionary figure in popular music. In his book ''Awopbopaloobop Alopbamboom'', [[Nik Cohn]] objected: &quot;I can't take the vision of Dylan as seer, as teenage messiah, as everything else he's been worshipped as. The way I see him, he's a minor talent with a major gift for self-hype.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Cohn, ''Awopbopaloobop Alopbamboom'', 1969, pp. 164–165.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Australian critic [[Jack Marx]] credited Dylan with changing the persona of the rock star: &quot;What cannot be disputed is that Dylan invented the arrogant, faux-cerebral posturing that has been the dominant style in rock since, with everyone from [[Mick Jagger]] to [[Eminem]] educating themselves from the Dylan handbook.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/arts/tangled-up-in-blah/story-e6frg8px-1111117308423 | title = Tangled Up In Blah | author=Marx, Jack | date = September 2, 2008 | accessdate =October 5, 2008 | work=The Australian }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joni Mitchell]] described Dylan as a &quot;plagiarist&quot; and his voice as &quot;fake&quot; in a 2010 interview in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', in response to a suggestion that she and Dylan were similar since they had both changed their birthnames.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = http://articles.latimes.com/2010/apr/22/entertainment/la-et-jonimitchell-20100422| title = It's a Joni Mitchell concert| author=Diehl, Matt| date = April 22, 2010| accessdate =May 2, 2010| work=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|first=Bethany|last=Larson| title=Folk Face-Off: Joni Mitchell vs. Bob Dylan | url=http://flavorwire.com/85781/folk-face-off-joni-mitchell-vs-bob-dylan|date=April 23, 2010|accessdate=August 4, 2011|publisher=Flavorwire.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mitchell's comment led to discussions of Dylan's use of other people's material, both supporting and criticizing Dylan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2010-04-30/is-bob-dylan-a-phony/full/ | title = Is Bob Dylan a Phony?| author=Wilentz, Sean| authorlink = Sean Wilentz | date = April 30, 2010| accessdate =May 2, 2010| work=The Daily Beast}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If Bob Dylan's legacy in the 1960s was seen as bringing intellectual ambition to popular music, now that he has reached the age of 70, he has been described as a figure who has greatly expanded the folk culture from which he initially emerged. As [[J. Hoberman]] wrote in ''[[The Village Voice]]'', &quot;[[Elvis Presley|Elvis]] might never have been born, but someone else would surely have brought the world rock 'n' roll. No such logic accounts for Bob Dylan. No iron law of history demanded that a would-be Elvis from Hibbing, Minnesota, would swerve through the Greenwich Village folk revival to become the world's first and greatest rock 'n' roll beatnik bard and then—having achieved fame and adoration beyond reckoning—vanish into a folk tradition of his own making.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.villagevoice.com/2007-11-13/film/like-a-complete-unknown-i-m-not-there-and-the-changing-face-of-bob-dylan-on-film/| title = Like A Complete Unknown| author=J.
