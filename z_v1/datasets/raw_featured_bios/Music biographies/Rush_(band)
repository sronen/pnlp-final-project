'''Rush''' is a Canadian [[rock music|rock]] band formed in August 1968, in the [[Willowdale, Toronto|Willowdale]] neighbourhood of [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]]. The band is composed of bassist, keyboardist, and lead vocalist [[Geddy Lee]], guitarist and backing vocalist [[Alex Lifeson]], and drummer, [[Percussion instrument|percussionist]] and lyricist [[Neil Peart]]. The band and its membership went through a number of re-configurations between 1968 and 1974, achieving their current form when Peart replaced original drummer [[John Rutsey]] in July 1974, two weeks before the group's first United States tour. Rutsey's departure stemmed primarily from health concerns regarding his diabetes.

Since the release of the band's [[Rush (Rush album)|self-titled debut album]] in March 1974, Rush has become known for its musicianship, complex compositions, and eclectic lyrical motifs drawing heavily on [[science fiction]], [[fantasy]], and [[philosophy]]. Rush's music style has changed over the years, beginning with blues-inspired [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] on their first album, then encompassing [[hard rock]], [[progressive rock]], and a period with heavy use of [[synthesizer]]s. They have been cited as an influence by various musical artists, including [[Metallica]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Austin Chronicle&quot;&gt;[http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/review?oid=oid%3A218424 Rush's 30th Anniversary Tour].

Rush has won a number of [[Juno Award]]s, and was inducted into the [[Canadian Music Hall of Fame]] in 1994. Over their careers, the members of Rush have been acknowledged as some of the most proficient players on their respective instruments, with each band member winning numerous awards in magazine readers' polls.

The original line-up formed in the asshole of [[Willowdale, Toronto|Willowdale]] in Toronto, Ontario, by Lifeson, bassist and front man [[Jeff Jones (musician)|Jeff Jones]], and drummer [[John Rutsey]]. Within a couple of weeks of forming, and before their second performance, bassist and lead vocalist Jones was replaced by Geddy Lee, a schoolmate of Lifeson. After several line-up reformations, Rush's official incarnation was formed in May 1971 consisting of Lee, Lifeson, and Rutsey. The band was managed by local Toronto resident Ray Danniels, a frequent attendee of Rush's early shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last= Banasiewicz |first= Bill |title= Rush Visions: The Official Biography |publisher=Omnibus Press |year= 1990 |isbn= 0711911622}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Banasiewicz |first= Bill |title= Rush Visions: The Official Biography (excerpt) |url=http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/transcripts/BanasiewiczVisions.htm |accessdate=March 10, 2007 |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071011130610/http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/transcripts/BanasiewiczVisions.htm |archivedate= October 11, 2007 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After gaining stability in the line-up and honing their skills on the local bar/high school dance circuit, the band came to release their first single &quot;[[Not Fade Away (song)#Rush version|Not Fade Away]]&quot;, a cover of the [[Buddy Holly]] song, in 1973. Side B contained an original composition, &quot;You Can't Fight It&quot;, credited to Lee and Rutsey. The single generated little reaction and, because of record company indifference, the band formed their own independent record label, ''[[Moon Records (Canada)|Moon Records]]''. With the aid of Danniels and the newly enlisted engineer [[Terry Brown (record producer)|Terry Brown]], the band released their self-titled debut album in 1974, which was considered highly derivative of Led Zeppelin.&lt;ref name=&quot;Led Zeppelin&quot; /&gt; ''[[Rush (Rush album)|Rush]]'' had limited local popularity until the album was picked up by [[WMMS]], a radio station in [[Cleveland]], Ohio. [[Donna Halper]], a DJ working at the station, selected &quot;Working Man&quot; for her regular play list. The song's blue collar theme resonated with hard rock fans and this new found popularity led to the album being re-released by [[Mercury Records]] in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Halper, Donna.

Creem magazine, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Immediately after the release of the [[Rush (Rush album)|debut album]] in 1974, Rutsey was forced to leave the band due to health difficulties (stemming from [[diabetes]]) and his general distaste for touring. His last performance with the band was on July 25, 1974 at Centennial Hall in London, Ontario. Rush held auditions for a new drummer and eventually selected Neil Peart as Rutsey's replacement. Peart officially joined the band on July 29, 1974, two weeks before the group's first U.S. tour. They performed their first concert together, opening for [[Uriah Heep (band)|Uriah Heep]] and [[Manfred Mann]] with an attendance of over 11,000 people at the [[Civic Arena (Pittsburgh)|Civic Arena]] in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]], Pennsylvania on August 14. In addition to becoming the band's drummer, Peart assumed the role of principal lyricist from Lee, who had very little interest in writing, despite penning the lyrics of the band's first album.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/main/DEBUTlyrics.htm|title=Rush|publisher=www.2112.net|work=Power Windows|accessdate=February 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, Lee, along with Lifeson, focused primarily on the instrumental aspects of Rush. ''[[Fly by Night (album)|Fly by Night]]'' (1975), Rush's first album after recruiting Peart, saw the inclusion of the band's first epic mini-tale &quot;By-Tor and the Snow Dog&quot;, replete with complex arrangements and multi-section format. Lyrical themes also underwent dramatic changes after the addition of Peart because of his love for fantasy and science-fiction literature.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fly By Night Review&quot;&gt;[{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r17120|pure_url=yes}} Fly By Night Review].

Following quickly on the heels of ''Fly By Night'', the band released 1975's ''[[Caress of Steel]]'', a five-track hard rock/heavy metal album featuring two extended multi-chapter songs, &quot;The Necromancer&quot; and &quot;The Fountain of Lamneth.&quot; Some critics said ''Caress of Steel'' was unfocused and an audacious move for the band because of the placement of two back-to-back protracted songs, as well as a heavier reliance on atmospherics and story-telling, a large deviation from ''Fly by Night''.&lt;ref&gt;Greg Prato [{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r17118|pure_url=yes}} Caress of Steel Review], Allmusic.

However, the band ignored the requests and developed their next album, ''[[2112 (album)|2112]]'' with a 20-minute title track divided into seven sections. Despite this, the album was the band's first taste of commercial success and their first platinum album in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mytelus.com/music/artist_bio.do?id=642687 Mini-Rush Bio]. myTELUS/Music Beta.

=== Mainstream success (1977–1981) ===
After ''2112'', Rush retreated to the United Kingdom to record 1977's ''[[A Farewell to Kings]]'' and 1978's ''[[Hemispheres (Rush album)|Hemispheres]]'' at [[Rockfield Studios]] in Wales. These albums saw the band members expanding the use of progressive elements in their music. &quot;As our tastes got more obscure,&quot; Geddy Lee said in a recent interview, &quot;we discovered more progressive rock-based bands like Yes, Van der Graaf Generator and King Crimson, and we were very inspired by those bands. They made us want to make our music more interesting and more complex and we tried to blend that with our own personalities to see what we could come up with that was indisputably us.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ugo.com/channels/music/features/rush/geddylee.asp ''Geddy Lee Interview'', David Wanderman, UGO.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Trademarks such as increased synthesizer usage, lengthy songs reminiscent of miniature [[concept album]]s, and highly dynamic playing featuring complex [[time signature]] changes became a staple of Rush's compositions. To achieve a broader, more progressive palette of sound, Alex Lifeson began to experiment with classical and twelve-string guitars, and Geddy Lee added bass-pedal synthesizers and Minimoog. Likewise, Peart's percussion became diversified in the form of [[triangle (instrument)|triangles]], [[glockenspiel]], wood blocks, [[cowbell (instrument)|cowbells]], [[timpani]], [[gong]] and [[tubular bell|chimes]]. Beyond instrument additions, the band kept in stride with the progressive rock movement by continuing to compose long, conceptual songs with science fiction and fantasy overtones. However, as the new decade approached, Rush gradually began to dispose of their older styles of music in favour of shorter, and sometimes softer, arrangements. The lyrics up to this point (most of them written by Peart) were heavily influenced by classical poetry, fantasy literature, science fiction, and the writings of novelist [[Ayn Rand]], as exhibited most prominently by their 1975 song &quot;Anthem&quot; from ''Fly By Night'' and a specifically acknowledged derivation in 1976's ''2112''.&lt;ref&gt;2112 and Ayn Rand [http://www.nimitz.net/rush/faq2ans.html#62 Rush FAQ]. Retrieved March 16, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Permanent Waves]]'' (1980) dramatically shifted Rush's style of music via the introduction of [[reggae]] and [[New Wave music|new wave]] elements.&lt;ref name=&quot;ClassicRock&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Rush: Progressive To The Core|author=Geoff Barton|year=2006|month=September|journal=[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]]|volume=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although a hard rock style was still evident, more and more synthesizers were introduced. Moreover, because of the limited airplay Rush's previous extended-length songs received, ''Permanent Waves'' included shorter, more radio-friendly songs such as &quot;[[The Spirit of Radio]]&quot; and &quot;[[Freewill (song)|Freewill]]&quot;, two songs which helped ''Permanent Waves'' become Rush's first U.S. Top 5 album; both songs continue to make appearances on classic rock radio stations in Canada and the United States to this day.&lt;ref&gt;Review of ''Permanent Waves'' by Greg Prato [{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r17131|pure_url=yes}} Allmusic]. Retrieved March 22, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Peart's lyrics shifted toward an expository tone with subject matter that dwelled less on fantastical or [[allegory|allegorical]] story-telling and more heavily on topics that explored humanistic, social and emotional elements. Rush joined with fellow Toronto-based rock band [[Max Webster]] on July 28, 1980 to record &quot;Battle Scar&quot; for their 1980 release, ''[[Universal Juveniles]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;pwtour&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |last= Peart |first= Neil |title= Moving Pictures Tourbook – A Rush Newsreel |year= 1981 |url= http://www.cygnus-x1.net/links/rush/tourbook-movingpictures.php |accessdate=October 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; While on tour together following the release, both bands would join between sets to play &quot;Battle Scar&quot;. The song acted as both a transition from Max Webster to Rush, as well as a warm-up for Peart. In addition, Max Webster lyricist [[Pye Dubois]] offered the band lyrics to a song he had written.

Rush's popularity reached its pinnacle with the release of ''[[Moving Pictures (album)|Moving Pictures]]'' in 1981. ''Moving Pictures'' essentially continued where ''Permanent Waves'' left off, extending the trend of highly accessible and commercially friendly progressive rock that helped thrust them into the spotlight. The lead track, &quot;[[Tom Sawyer (song)|Tom Sawyer]]&quot;, is probably the band's best-known song&lt;ref&gt;Rush Biography [{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p5323|pure_url=yes}} Allmusic guide, Jason Ankeny]. Retrieved September 20, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; with &quot;[[Limelight (song)|Limelight]]&quot; also receiving satisfactory responses from listeners and radio stations. ''Moving Pictures'' was Rush's last album to feature an extended song, the eleven-minute &quot;The Camera Eye&quot;. The song also contained the band's heaviest usage of synthesizers up to that point, hinting that Rush's music was shifting direction once more. ''Moving Pictures'' reached No.3 on the ''[[Billboard 200]]'' album chart and has been certified quadruple platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]].&lt;ref&gt;Moving Pictures Certification [http://riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH Search ''Moving Pictures'']. Retrieved July 7, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the success of ''Moving Pictures'' and the completion of another four studio albums, Rush released their second live recording, ''[[Exit...Stage Left]]'', in 1981. The album delineates the apex of Rush's progressive period by featuring live material from the band's ''Permanent Waves'' and ''Moving Pictures'' tours. As with their first live release, ''Exit...Stage Left'' identified the margin of a new chapter of Rush's sound.

=== Synthesizer period (1982–1989) ===
[[File:Oberheim OBX.jpg|thumb|left|The OBX synthesizer used by Geddy Lee on the album ''Signals'' (1982).]]
The band underwent another radical stylistic transmutation with the release of ''[[Signals (Rush album)|Signals]]'' in 1982.&lt;ref name=&quot;Signals Review by Greg Prato&quot;&gt;Signals Review by Greg Prato [{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r17139|pure_url=yes}} Allmusic].

The band felt dissatisfied with Brown's studio treatment of ''Signals'', while Brown was becoming more uncomfortable with the increased use of synthesizers in the music.&lt;ref&gt;Rush: Beyond The Lighted Stage Documentary&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, Rush and Brown parted ways in 1983, and the experimentation with new electronic instruments and varying musical styles would come into further play on their next studio album.

[[File:Simmons SDS5 Electric Drum.jpg|thumb|right|Neil Peart began incorporating [[Simmons Drums|Simmons Electronic Drums]] beginning with 1984's ''Grace Under Pressure'']]

The style and production of ''Signals'' were augmented and taken to new heights on 1984's ''[[Grace Under Pressure (Rush album)|Grace Under Pressure]]''. It was Peart who named the album, as he borrowed the words of [[Ernest Hemingway]] to describe what the band had to go through after making the decision to leave Terry Brown. Producer [[Steve Lillywhite]], who gleaned fame with successful productions of [[Simple Minds]] and [[U2]], was enlisted to produce ''Grace Under Pressure''. However, he backed out at the last moment, much to the ire of Lee, Lifeson and Peart. Lee said &quot;Steve Lillywhite is really not a man of his word....after agreeing to do our record, he got an offer from Simple Minds, changed his mind, blew us off,... so it put us in a horrible position.&quot; Rush eventually hired Peter Henderson to co-produce and engineer the album in his stead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/main/GUPlyrics.htm|title=Grace Under Pressure|publisher=www.2112.net|work=Power Windows|accessdate=February 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Musically, although Lee's use of sequencers and synthesizers remained the band's cornerstone, his focus on new technology was complemented by Peart's adaptation of Simmons electronic drums and percussion. Lifeson's contributions on the album were decidedly enhanced to act as an overreaction to the minimalistic role he played on ''Signals''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/transcripts/GettSuccess.htm|title=Success Under Pressure|publisher=www.2112.net|work=Power Windows|accessdate=May 7, 2006|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080624102316/http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/transcripts/GettSuccess.htm|archivedate=June 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still, many of his trademark guitar textures remained intact in the form of open reggae chords and funk and new-wave rhythms.

With new producer [[Peter Collins (record producer)|Peter Collins]], the band released 1985's ''[[Power Windows (album)|Power Windows]]'' and 1987's ''[[Hold Your Fire]]''. The music on these two albums gives far more emphasis and prominence to Lee's multi-layered synthesizer work. While fans and critics took notice of Lifeson's diminished guitar work, his presence was still palpable. Lifeson, like many guitarists in the late 1980s, experimented with processors that reduced his instrument to echoey chord bursts and razor-thin leads. ''Hold Your Fire'' represents both a modest extension of the guitar stylings found on ''Power Windows'', and, according to Allmusic critic Eduardo Rivadavia, the culmination of this era of Rush.&lt;ref&gt;Hold Your Fire Review [{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r17147|pure_url=yes}} Allmusic, Eduardo Rivadavia]. Retrieved September 20, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas the previous five Rush albums sold platinum or better, ''Hold Your Fire'' only went gold in November 1987, although it managed to peak at number 13 on the ''Billboard 200''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/main/HYFlyrics.htm|title=Hold your Fire|publisher=www.2112.net|work=Power Windows website|accessdate=September 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A third live album and video, ''[[A Show of Hands]]'' (1989), was also released by Anthem and Mercury following the ''Power Windows '' and ''Hold Your Fire'' tours, demonstrating the aspects of Rush in the '80s. ''A Show of Hands'' met with strong fan approval, but ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' critic Michael Azerrad dismissed it as &quot;musical muscle&quot; with 1.5 stars, claiming Rush fans viewed their favourite power trio as &quot;the holy trinity&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/321540/a_show_of_hands|title=A Show of Hands Review|work=Rolling Stone|accessdate=June 6, 2006|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070817203049/http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/321540/a_show_of_hands|archivedate=August 17, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, ''A Show of Hands'' managed to surpass the gold album mark, reaching number 21 on the ''Billboard 200''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/main/ASOHlyrics.htm|title=A Show of Hands|publisher=www.2112.net|work=Power Windows|accessdate=December 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this point, the group decided to change international record labels from Mercury to [[Atlantic Records|Atlantic]].

|format=[[Ogg]]}}

Rush started to deviate from their 1980s style with the albums ''[[Presto (album)|Presto]]'' and ''[[Roll the Bones]]''. Produced by record engineer and musician [[Rupert Hine]], these two albums saw Rush shedding much of their keyboard-saturated sound. Beginning with 1989's ''Presto'', the band opted for arrangements that were notably more guitar-centric than the previous two studio albums. Although synthesizers were still used in many songs, the instrument was no longer featured as the centerpiece of Rush's compositions. Continuing this trend, 1991's ''Roll the Bones'' extended the use of the standard three-instrument approach with even less focus on synthesizers than its predecessor. While musically these albums do not deviate significantly from a general pop-rock sound, Rush incorporated traces of other musical styles. &quot;Roll the Bones&quot;, for instance, exhibits funk and [[hip hop music|hip hop]] elements, and the instrumental track &quot;[[Rush instrumentals#Where's My Thing?|Where's My Thing?]]&quot; features several jazz components.&lt;ref&gt;''Roll the Bones'' [{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r17152|pure_url=yes}} Allmusic:]. Retrieved March 18, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; This return to three-piece instrumentation helped pave the way for future albums in the mid-90s, which would adopt a more straightforward rock formula.

The transition from synthesizers to more guitar-oriented and organic instrumentation continued with the 1993 album ''[[Counterparts (album)|Counterparts]]''&lt;ref name=&quot;counter&quot;&gt;Counterparts Review [{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r188404|pure_url=yes}} Allmusic] Accessed April 18, 2007 {{Wayback|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r188404|pure_url=yes}}|date =20070930041355|bot=DASHBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its follow-up, 1996's ''[[Test for Echo]]'', again both produced in collaboration with Peter Collins. Musically, ''Counterparts''&lt;ref name=&quot;counter&quot; /&gt; and ''Test For Echo'' are two of Rush's most guitar-driven albums. Although the music in general did not meet the criteria for progressive rock, some songs adopted a dynamic format.&lt;ref&gt;Allmusic [{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r241096|pure_url=yes}} Test For Echo Review].

Musically, ''Test For Echo'' still retained much of the hard rock/alternative style already charted on the previous record with Lifeson and Lee's playing remaining more or less unchanged; however, a distinct modification in technique became apparent in Peart's playing from his [[jazz]] and [[swing (genre)|swing]] training under the tutelage of jazz instructor [[Freddie Gruber]] during the interim between ''Counterparts'' and ''Test For Echo''.&lt;ref&gt;Neil Peart's tutelage [http://www.drummerworld.com/drummers/Freddie_Gruber.html Drummerworld].

The tour was broken up into two segments spanning October through December 1996 and May through July 1997 with the band taking a respite between tour legs.

=== Hiatus and comeback (1997–2005) ===
After wrapping up the [[Test for Echo Tour|tour promoting ''Test for Echo'']] in 1997, the band entered a five-year hiatus primarily due to personal tragedies in Peart's life. Peart's daughter Selena died in an automobile accident in August 1997, followed by his wife Jacqueline's death from cancer in June 1998. Peart took a hiatus to mourn and reflect, during which time he travelled extensively throughout North America on his BMW motorcycle, covering {{convert|88,000|km|mi|abbr=on}}. At some point in his journey, Peart decided to return to the band. Peart wrote ''[[Ghost Rider: Travels on the Healing Road]]'' as a chronicle of his geographical and emotional journey. In this book he writes of how he had told his bandmates at Selena's funeral, &quot;consider me retired.&quot;&lt;ref name=Peart-GhostRider&gt;Peart, Neil. ''Ghost Rider: Travels on the Healing Road''. Toronto: ECW Press. 2002. ISBN 1-55022-546-4&lt;/ref&gt; On November 10, 1998 a triple CD live album entitled ''[[Different Stages (Rush album)|Different Stages]]'' was released, dedicated to the memory of Selena and Jacqueline. Mixed by producer [[Paul Northfield]] and engineered by Terry Brown, it contained three discs packed with recorded performances from the band's ''[[Counterparts Tour|Counterparts]]'', ''Test For Echo'', and ''A Farewell to Kings'' tours, marking the fourth officially released live album by the band.

After a time to grieve and reassemble the pieces of his life, and while visiting long-time Rush photographer Andrew MacNaughtan in Los Angeles, Peart was introduced to his future wife, photographer [[Carrie Nuttall]]. Peart married Nuttall on September 9, 2000. In early 2001 he announced to his band mates that he was ready to once again enter the studio and get back into the business of making music. With the help of producer [[Paul Northfield]] the band returned in May 2002 with ''[[Vapor Trails]]'', written and recorded in Toronto. To herald the band's comeback, the single and lead track from the album, &quot;[[One Little Victory]]&quot; was designed to grab the attention of listeners with its rapid guitar and drum tempos.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vapor Trails news archive&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/VTnews.htm|title=Vapor Trails news archive|publisher=www.2112.net|work=Power Windows|accessdate=March 16, 2006|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080616202159/http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/VTnews.htm|archivedate=June 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Vapor Trails'' marked the first studio recording not to include a single synthesizer, organ or keyboard part since the early 1970s. While the album is almost completely guitar-driven, it is mostly devoid of any conventional sounding guitar solos, a conscious decision made by Lifeson during the writing process. According to the band, the entire developmental process for ''Vapor Trails'' was extremely taxing and took approximately 14 months to finish, by far the longest the band had ever spent writing and recording a studio album.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vapor Trails news archive&quot;/&gt; The album was supported by the band's first [[Vapor Trails Tour|tour]] in six years, including first-ever concerts in Mexico City and Brazil, where they played to some of the largest crowds of their career.

During promotional interviews for the ''R30 Live In Frankfurt'' DVD, the band revealed their intention to begin writing new material in early 2006. While in Toronto, Lifeson and Lee began the songwriting process in January 2006. During this time, Peart simultaneously assumed his role of lyric writing while residing in Southern California. The following September, Rush chose to hire American producer [[Nick Raskulinecz]] to co-produce the album. The band officially entered Allaire Studios, in Shokan, New York in November 2006 in order to record the bulk of the material. Taking the band five weeks, the sessions ended in December. On February 14, 2007, an announcement was made on the official Rush web site that the title of the new album would be ''Snakes &amp; Arrows''. The first single, entitled &quot;[[Far Cry (Rush song)|Far Cry]]&quot;, was released to North American radio stations on March 12, 2007 and reached No.2 on the Mediabase Mainstream and Radio and Records Charts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rush.com/rush/ Rush Official Website], Rush.com.

== Musical style and influences ==
Rush's musical style has changed substantially over the years. Their debut album was strongly influenced by British blues rock: an amalgam of sounds and styles from such rock bands as [[Cream (band)|Cream]], [[Led Zeppelin]], and [[Deep Purple]]. Over the first few albums their style remained essentially hard rock, with heavy influences from [[The Who]]&lt;ref name=&quot;GuitarPlayer&quot;&gt;[http://2112.net/powerwindows/transcripts/20060300guitarplayer.htm Today's Tom Sawyer (Alex Lifeson Interview)].

== Reputation ==
More than 40 years of activity has provided Rush with the opportunity for musical diversity across their discography. As with many bands known for experimentation, changes have inevitably resulted in dissent among critics and fans. The bulk of the band's music has always included synthetic instruments in some form or another, and this is a great source of contention in the Rush camp, especially the band's heavy reliance on synthesizers and keyboards during the 1980s, particularly on albums ''Grace Under Pressure'', ''Power Windows'', and ''Hold Your Fire''.&lt;ref&gt;[{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r17142|pure_url=yes}} &quot;Grace Under Pressure&quot;].

On April 24, 2010, the documentary ''[[Rush: Beyond the Lighted Stage]]'', directed by [[Scot McFadyen]] and [[Sam Dunn]], premiered at the [[Tribeca Film Festival]]. It went on to receive the Tribeca Film Festival Audience Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118018632?refCatId=13|title=&quot;Rush&quot; wins Tribeca Fest Audience Award|publisher=Variety|date=May 3, 2010|accessdate=October 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film explores the band's influence on popular music and the reasons why that influence has been underrepresented over the years. This is done via interviews with popular musicians, music industry professionals, and the band members themselves. 

On June 25, 2010, Rush received a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]], located at 6752 [[Hollywood Boulevard]].

Geddy Lee's high-register vocal style has always been a signature of the band – and sometimes a focal point for criticism, especially during the early years of Rush's career when Lee's vocals were high-pitched, with a strong likeness to other singers like [[Robert Plant]] of [[Led Zeppelin]].&lt;ref name=allmusic_Lee/&gt;  Although his voice has softened over the years, it is often described as a &quot;wail&quot;.&lt;ref name=allmusic_Lee&gt;Prato, Greg.

This is most evident during live shows when Lee must play bass, supply lead vocals, manipulate keyboards, and trigger pedals during the course of a performance, as in the song &quot;[[Tom Sawyer (song)|Tom Sawyer]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;BassPlayer&quot;/&gt; Because of this, he is required to remain in one place during songs containing complex instrumentation. Lifeson and Peart are, to a lesser extent, responsible for similar actions during live shows.

=== Alex Lifeson ===

Instrumentally, Lifeson is regarded as a guitarist whose strengths and notability rely primarily on signature riffing, electronic effects and processing, unorthodox chord structures, and a copious arsenal of equipment used over the years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dinosaurrockguitar.com/bios/Lifeson.shtml|title=Dinosaur Rock God|accessdate=March 31, 2006| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060209005754/http://www.dinosaurrockguitar.com/bios/Lifeson.shtml| archivedate=February 9, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guitarplayer.com/story.asp?storycode=13124|title=Alex Lifeson minor overview|publisher=Guitar Player|accessdate=July 16, 2007 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070818163835/http://www.guitarplayer.com/story.asp?storycode=13124|archivedate=August 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his adolescent years, he was influenced by [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[Pete Townshend]], [[Jeff Beck]], [[Eric Clapton]] and [[Jimmy Page]].&lt;ref&gt;Alex Lifeson profile [http://www.epiphone.com/news.asp?NewsID=137 Epiphone]. Retrieved March 31, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; For versatility, Lifeson was known to incorporate touches of Spanish and classical music into Rush's guitar-driven sound during the 1970s. Taking a backseat to Lee's keyboards in the 1980s, Lifeson's guitar returned to the forefront in the 1990s, and especially on 2002's ''Vapor Trails''. During live performances, he is still responsible for cuing various guitar effects, the use of bass-pedal synthesizers and backing vocals.

=== Neil Peart ===

==== Music ====
Peart is commonly regarded by music fans, critics and fellow musicians as one of the greatest rock drummers of all time.&lt;ref&gt;Neil Peart profile [http://www.drummerworld.com/drummers/Neil_Peart.html Drummer World].

Modern Drummer Publishing Inc.

(Republished in Modern Drummer Magazine, April 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;  Incorporation of unusual instruments (for rock drummers of the time) such as the [[glockenspiel]] and [[tubular bell]]s, along with several standard kit elements, helped create a highly varied setup. Continually modified to this day, Peart's drumkit offers an enormous array of percussion instruments for sonic diversity. For two decades Peart honed his technique; each new Rush album introduced an expanded percussive vocabulary. In the 1990s, he reinvented his style with the help of drum coach [[Freddie Gruber]].

==== Lyrics ====
Peart also serves as Rush's primary lyricist, attracting much attention over the years for his eclectic style. Known for penning concept suites and songs inspired by literature, music fan opinions of his writing have varied greatly, running the gamut from cerebral and insightful to pretentious and preachy. During the band's early years, Peart's lyrics were largely fantasy/science fiction-focused,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.johnmcferrinmusicreviews.org/rush.html Rush profile], John Mcferrin's Rock and Prog Reviews. Retrieved March 18, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; though since 1980 he has focused more on social, emotional, and humanitarian issues. Peart's lyrics continue to divide audiences today. In 2007, he was placed second on ''[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]'' magazine's list of the &quot;40 Worst Lyricists In Rock&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amiannoying.com/%28S%28utgjz155ieknau45i1uadmrq%29%29/collection.aspx?collection=8128 Blender Magazine's Worst Lyricists in Rock], AmIAnnoying.com retrieved December 31, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Allmusic has called Peart &quot;one of rock's most accomplished lyricists&quot;,

Despite having completely dropped out of the public eye for five years after the gold-selling ''Test for Echo'' (which peaked at number 5 on the ''Billboard 200'') and the band being relegated almost solely to classic rock stations in the U.S., ''Vapor Trails'' reached No.6 on the ''Billboard 200'' chart in its first week of release in 2002 with 108,000 albums sold. It has sold approximately 343,000 units to date. The subsequent ''Vapor Trails'' tour grossed over $24&amp;nbsp;million and included the largest audience ever to see a headlining Rush show – 60,000 fans in [[São Paulo]], Brazil. Nevertheless, ''Vapor Trails'' remains their first album not to achieve at least gold status in the United States.

However, Rush's triple CD live album, 2003's ''Rush in Rio'', was certified gold by the RIAA, marking the fourth decade in which a Rush album had been released and certified at least gold. Moreover, in 2004 ''Feedback'' cracked the top 20 on the ''Billboard'' 200 chart and received radio airplay. The band's most recent album, ''[[Snakes &amp; Arrows]]'', debuted at No.3 (just one position shy of Rush's highest peaking album, 1993's ''Counterparts'', which debuted at #2) on the ''Billboard 200'' selling approximately 93,000 copies in its first week of release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/News.htm|title=Snakes &amp;amp; Arrows chart rankings|publisher=www.2112.net|work=Power Windows|accessdate=August 7, 2007|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070927185503/http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/News.htm|archivedate=September 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; This marks the 13th studio album to appear in the Top 20 and the band's 27th album to appear on the chart regardless of position over the course of their career. The album also debuted at No.1 on the Billboard's Top Rock Albums chart, as well as peaking at No.1 on the Top Internet Albums chart when the album was released on the MVI format a month later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/S&amp;Anews.htm|title=Snakes and Arrows news page|publisher=www.2112.net|work=Power Windows|accessdate=August 7, 2007|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080822095019/http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/S&amp;Anews.htm|archivedate=August 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still, ''Snakes &amp; Arrows'' has yet to accumulate sales that approach or eclipse ''Vapor Trails'' or ''Rush in Rio''.

The two consecutive tours in support of ''Snakes &amp; Arrows'' in 2007 and 2008 accrued $21&amp;nbsp;million and $18.3&amp;nbsp;million, respectively, earning Rush the number 6 and 8 spots among the top ten summer rock concerts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/22026885/midyear_music_biz_report_card/3|title=Summer Concert earnings|publisher=Rolling Stone Magazine|accessdate=August 8, 2008}} {{Dead link|date=June 2010| bot=DASHBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Summer concert earnings [http://www.usatoday.com/life/music/news/2007-10-10-summer-concerts_N.htm USAToday].

== Live performances ==
The members of Rush share a strong work ethic, desiring to accurately recreate songs from their albums when playing live performances. To achieve this goal, beginning in the late 1980s, Rush has included a capacious rack of [[sampler (musical instrument)|digital samplers]] in their concert equipment to recreate the sounds of non-traditional instruments, accompaniments, vocal harmonies, and other sound &quot;events&quot; in real-time to match the sounds on the studio versions of the songs. In live performances, the band members share duties throughout most songs. Each member has one or more [[MIDI controller]]s, which are loaded with different sounds for each song, and use available limbs to trigger the sounds while simultaneously playing their primary instrument(s).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onstagemag.com/ar/performance_rush_rolls_again/index.htm|title=Rush Rolls Again|date=September 2002|publisher=OnStage Magazine|accessdate=December 18, 2010|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20021018005414/http://onstagemag.com/ar/performance_rush_rolls_again/index.htm|archivedate=October 18, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is with this technology that the group is able to present their arrangements in a live setting with the level of complexity and fidelity fans have come to expect, and without the need to resort to the use of [[backing tracks]] or employing an additional band member.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://2112.net/powerwindows/transcripts/19900300backstageclub.htm|title=Backstage Club Newsletter|date=March 1990|publisher=www.2112.net|work=Power Windows|accessdate=December 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The band members' coordinated use of pedal keyboards and other electronic triggers to &quot;play&quot; sampled instruments and audio events is subtly visible in their live performances, especially so on [[R30: 30th Anniversary World Tour]], their 2005 concert DVD.

A staple of Rush's concerts is a Neil Peart drum solo. Peart's drum solos include a basic framework of routines connected by sections of improvisation, making each performance unique. Each successive tour sees the solo more advanced, with some routines dropped in favour of newer, more complex ones. Since the mid-1980s, Peart has used [[Musical Instrument Digital Interface|MIDI]] [[Sound module|trigger pads]] to trigger sounds sampled from various pieces of acoustic percussion that would otherwise consume far too much stage area, such as a [[marimba]], [[harp]], [[temple blocks]], [[Triangle (instrument)|triangles]], glockenspiel, [[Bell (instrument)|orchestra bells]], tubular bells, and [[vibraslap]] as well as other, more esoteric percussion.

== Philanthropy ==
Rush actively participates in philanthropic causes. The band was one of a number of hometown favourites to play [[Molson Canadian Rocks for Toronto]], also dubbed SARStock, at [[Downsview Park]] in Toronto on July 30, 2003, with an attendance of over half a million people. The concert was intended to benefit the Toronto economy after the [[SARS]] outbreaks earlier in the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RUSH - Tom Sawyer, Limelight and Dreamline - Live Toronto SARSfest 2003|url=http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=82c_1322951593&amp;comments=1|publisher=LiveLeak.com|accessdate=8 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The band has also sustained an interest in promoting human rights. They donated $100,000 to the [[Canadian Museum for Human Rights]] after a concert they held in Winnipeg on May 24, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.winnipegfirst.ca/article/2008/05/29/rush_contribute_to_canadian_museum_for_human_rights|title=Rush Contribute to Canadian Museum for Human Rights|publisher=Winnipeg First|date=May 29, 2008|accessdate=July 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Rush continues to sell t-shirts and donate the proceeds to the museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/manitoba/story/2008/05/28/rush-cmhr.html?ref=rss|title=Rockers Rush donate cash to human rights museum|publisher=CBC News|date=May 28, 2008|accessdate=July 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The individual members of Rush have also been a part of philanthropic causes. [[Hughes &amp; Kettner]] zenTeras and TriAmps have been endorsed and used by Lifeson for many years. A custom signature amplifier was engineered by Lifeson and released in April 2005 with the stipulation that [[UNICEF]] will receive a donation in the amount of $50 for every Alex Lifeson Signature TriAmp sold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.record-producer.com/learn.cfm?a=1963|title=Hughes &amp;amp; Kettner Introduces Alex Lifeson Signature TriAmp|publisher=record-producer.com|date=January 23, 2005|accessdate=July 25, 2008 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060110155912/http://www.record-producer.com/learn.cfm?a=1963|archivedate =January 10, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lee, a longtime fan of baseball, donated 200 baseballs signed by famous [[Negro League]] players, including [[Willie Mays]], [[Hank Aaron]] and [[Josh Gibson]], to the [[Negro Leagues Baseball Museum]] in June 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080606&amp;content_id=2853667&amp;vkey=news_mlb&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=mlb| title=Rush's Lee Makes Big Donataion|publisher=MLB News|date=June 6, 2008|accessdate=July 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In late 2009, Geddy Lee and Alex Lifeson launched an auction for their initiative &quot;Grapes Under Pressure&quot;, in support of the cause &quot;Grapes for Humanity&quot;. The auction consisted of items from the band such as signed guitars, cymbals and basses, as well as autographs on all items by the band members. There were also autographs by band members from [[Depeche Mode]], [[Tool (band)|Tool]], [[the Fray]], [[Judas Priest]], [[Pearl Jam]] and more, as well as signatures from Ricky, Julian and Bubbles from &quot;[[Trailer Park Boys: The Movie]]&quot; on a rare [[Epiphone]] guitar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grapesforhumanity.com/?p=295|title=Grapes for Humanity Charity Auction|publisher=Grapes for Humanity|accessdate=April 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
