'''Audioslave''' was an [[United States|American]] [[Rock music|rock]] [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] formed in [[Los Angeles, California]], in 2001 and disbanded in 2007. The four-piece band consisted of then-former [[Soundgarden]] [[lead vocalist|lead singer]]/[[rhythm guitarist]], [[Chris Cornell]], and then-former [[Rage Against the Machine]] members, [[Tom Morello]] ([[lead guitar]]), [[Tim Commerford]] ([[bass guitar|bass]]/[[backing vocals]]), and [[Brad Wilk]] ([[drummer|drums]]). Critics initially described Audioslave as an amalgamation of Soundgarden and Rage Against the Machine, but by the band's second album, ''[[Out of Exile]]'', it was noted that they had established a separate identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Slave New World|author=Roberts, Michael|publisher=''[[Cleveland Scene]]''|url=http://clevescene.com/2003-07-16/music/slave-new-world|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071114042407/http://clevescene.com/2003-07-16/music/slave-new-world|archivedate=2007-11-14|accessdate=2007-08-25|date=2003-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Audioslave's trademark sound was created by blending 1970s [[hard rock]] with 1990s [[alternative rock]]. Moreover, Morello incorporated his well-known, unconventional guitar solos into the mix. As with Rage Against the Machine, the band prided themselves on the fact that all sounds on their albums were produced using only guitar, bass, drums, and vocals.

After Audioslave released three successful albums, received three [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] nominations, and became the first American rock band to perform an open-air concert in [[Cuba]], Cornell issued a statement in February 2007 announcing that he was permanently leaving the band &quot;due to irresolvable personality conflicts as well as musical differences.&quot; The [[Rage Against the Machine reunion tour|2007 Rage Against the Machine reunion and tour]] involving three members as well as solo albums released that same year by Morello and Cornell cemented the supergroup's permanent demise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Video interview with Tom Morello|publisher=Toazted|url=http://www.toazted.com/playinterview/2245/Video-interview-with-Tom-Morello-27.html|accessdate=2007-08-20|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Formation (2000–2002)===
Audioslave's history dates back to October 18, 2000, when lead vocalist [[Zack de la Rocha]] announced he was leaving [[Rage Against the Machine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Zack Leaves Rage Against The Machine|publisher=MTV|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1433539/20001018/rage_against_the_machine.jhtml|accessdate=2007-08-25|date=2000-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the band's breakup, but the remaining three members of the band decided to stay together and announced plans to continue with a new vocalist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rage Against The Machine Biography|author=Ankeny, Jason|publisher=[[Allmusic]]|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p23206|pure_url=yes}}|accessdate=2007-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several vocalists jammed with the three, including [[B-Real]] of [[Cypress Hill]], but they did not want another [[Rapping|rapper]] or anybody who sounded like de la Rocha.&lt;ref name=&quot;MTV.com: Audioslave&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Audioslave: Unshackled, Ready To Rage|author=Moss, Corey; Parry, Heather|publisher=MTV|url=http://www.mtv.com/bands/a/audioslave/news_feature_112202/|accessdate=2007-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Music producer and friend [[Rick Rubin]] later suggested that they play with [[Chris Cornell]], the ex-frontman of [[Soundgarden]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Pushing Forward Back&quot;&gt;O'Brien, Clare. &quot;Pushing Forward Back.&quot; ''Zero Magazine''. September 7, 2005, Iss. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Rubin also persuaded the three of them to go into [[group therapy]] with performance coach [[Phil Towle]] after the breakup.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pushing Forward Back&quot;/&gt; Rubin was confident that with the right new voice Rage Against the Machine had the potential to become a better band; he believed &quot;it could turn into a [[The Yardbirds|Yardbirds]]-into-[[Led Zeppelin]] scenario.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Last Days of Rage?|author=Fricke, David|publisher=''[[Rolling Stone]]''|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5919862/the_last_days_of_rage|accessdate=2007-08-25|date=2001-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commerford later credited Rubin for being the catalyst that brought Audioslave together. He called him &quot;the angel at the crossroads&quot; because &quot;if it wasn't for him, I wouldn't be here today.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pushing Forward Back&quot;/&gt;

The chemistry between Cornell and the other three was immediately apparent; as Morello described: &quot;He stepped to the microphone and sang the song and I couldn't believe it. It didn't just sound good. It didn't sound great. It sounded transcendent. And...when there is an irreplaceable chemistry from the first moment, you can't deny it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;MTV.com: Audioslave&quot;/&gt; The quartet wrote 21 songs during 19 days of rehearsal,&lt;ref name=&quot;Pushing Forward Back&quot;/&gt; and began working in the studio in late May 2001 with Rubin as producer, while sorting out the label and management issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rage And Cornell To Enter Studio Next Week|author=Weiss, Neal|publisher=[[Yahoo!

====Name====
The original idea for the band's name was &quot;Civilian,&quot; but it was dropped when members found out that it was already taken. Morello later discredited the story, contradicting Commerford and Cornell,&lt;ref name=&quot;MTV.com: Audioslave 2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Audioslave: Unshackled, Ready To Rage (cont.)|author=Moss, Corey; Parry, Heather|publisher=MTV|url=http://www.mtv.com/bands/a/audioslave/news_feature_112202/index2.jhtml|accessdate=2007-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Metal Hammer - Straight Outta Rehab&quot;&gt;Ewing, Jerry. &quot;Straight Outta Rehab.&quot; ''[[Metal Hammer]]''.

He stated: &quot;The band has only ever had one name, and that is Audioslave.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Undercover&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Audioslave to the Rhythm|author=Cashmere, Tim|publisher=Undercover|url=http://www.undercover.com.au/idol/audioslave.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20030421093701/http://www.undercover.com.au/idol/audioslave.html|archivedate=2003-04-21|accessdate=2007-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morello described the origin of the &quot;Audioslave&quot; name to [[LAUNCHcast]] as follows:&lt;ref name=&quot;Yahoo! Music - Audioslave Works Out Settlement To Share Name With U.K. Band&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Audioslave Works Out Settlement To Share Name With U.K. Band|author=Anderson, Brett|publisher=Yahoo!

&lt;blockquote&gt;That was Chris's suggestion that sort of came to him in a vision. We're all on the two-way pagers, and Chris one night said, &quot;I got it. It's Audioslave.&quot; We were all, like, &quot;All right, fantastic.&quot; ... To paraphrase [[Elvis Costello]], talking about band names is like dancing about architecture—there's just no point in it because the band name becomes the music and the people.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After the name was announced, it emerged that it was already being used by an unsigned band from [[Liverpool]]. The two bands worked out a settlement, with the American Audioslave paying $30,000 in a deal that allowed each band to use the name. To avoid confusion, the Liverpool band would rename themselves &quot;The Most Terrifying Thing.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Yahoo! Music - Audioslave Works Out Settlement To Share Name With U.K. Band&quot;/&gt;

The name was mocked by critics due to its uninspired nature,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Audioslave album review|author=Kaye, Don|publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/showreview.aspx?reviewID=105|accessdate=2007-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was regarded as one of the worst in contemporary rock music,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Audioslave album review|author=Jansen, Bryan|publisher=[[Epinions]]|url=http://www99.epinions.com/content_90153127556|accessdate=2007-08-25|date=2003-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; or even of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Best &amp; Worst Band Names|author=Seely, Mike|publisher=''[[Seattle Weekly]]''|url=http://www.seattleweekly.com/arts/blogs/postalley/2006/10/best_worst_band_names.php|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20061106213051/http://www.seattleweekly.com/arts/blogs/postalley/2006/10/best_worst_band_names.php|archivedate=2006-11-06|accessdate=2007-08-25|date=2006-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pitchfork Media]] called it the &quot;most asinine bandname of the year,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Audioslave album review|author=Dahlen, Chris; Schreiber, Ryan|publisher=[[Pitchfork Media]]|url=http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/15109-audioslave?artist_title=15109-audioslave|accessdate=2007-08-25|date=2002-11-26}} {{Dead link|date=March 2012|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Chuck Klosterman]] of ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' magazine chided it as &quot;one of the dumbest band names in recent rock history.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Audioslave - Audioslave review|author=Klosterman, Chuck|publisher=''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]''|url=http://www.spin.com/reviews/audioslave-audioslave-epic|accessdate=2007-08-25|date=2003-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initial rumors suggested that Cornell took issue with having two managers actively involved in the project (Jim Guerinot of [[Rebel Waltz Recording Co.|Rebel Waltz]] represented Cornell, and Peter Mensch of Q Prime handled Rage Against the Machine).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rage, Cornell Unshackle Audioslave|author=Jenison, David|publisher=[[E!

The band divulged their official name and launched their website in early September.

It was the highest-charting single from the album, peaking at number one on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'''s [[Mainstream Rock Tracks]] and [[Modern Rock Tracks]] charts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Billboard – Artist Chart History - Audioslave&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Artist Chart History - Audioslave|publisher=''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''|url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/retrieve_chart_history.do?model.chartFormatGroupName=Singles&amp;model.vnuArtistId=499235&amp;model.vnuAlbumId=555734|accessdate=2007-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was certified [[RIAA single certification|gold]] by the RIAA, making it Audioslave's most successful single ever.&lt;ref name=&quot;RIAA&quot;/&gt;  The music video for &quot;[[Like a Stone]]&quot; was written and directed by [[Meiert Avis]].

The music video for the third single, &quot;[[Show Me How to Live (song)|Show Me How to Live]]&quot;, was banned from [[MTV]], reportedly because it shows the band in a high-speed car chase running police cars and motorcycles off the road.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Banned Audioslave Video Posted Online|publisher=Blabbermouth.net|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=13271|accessdate=2007-08-25|date=2003-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band's first DVD, ''[[Audioslave (DVD)|Audioslave]]'', was released on July 29, 2003.

===''Out of Exile'' (2004–2005)===
In 2004, Audioslave was among the nominees for the [[46th Grammy Awards]]: &quot;Like a Stone&quot; was nominated for &quot;[[Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance|Best Hard Rock Performance]]&quot; and ''Audioslave'' for &quot;[[Grammy Award for Best Rock Album|Best Rock Album]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=46th Grammy Awards - 2004|publisher=Rockonthenet.com|url=http://www.rockonthenet.com/archive/2004/grammys.htm|accessdate=2007-08-25|date=2004-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; They spent the rest of 2004 on break from touring and working on the second album. This gave Morello time to concentrate on his solo project, [[The Nightwatchman]], and also to take an active part in political activities. Cornell had time to focus on his personal life; after his divorce from his first wife was finalized, he married Vicky Karayiannis, a [[Paris]]-based publicist he met during Audioslave's first European tour.&lt;ref name=&quot;San Diego CityBEAT – A Career in Slavery&quot;/&gt;

Work on a new album had started in 2003 during the Lollapalooza tour,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Audioslave To Work On Next Album After Lollapalooza|publisher=Blabbermouth.net|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=14002|accessdate=2007-08-25|date=2003-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and continued at the end of the year when band members entered the studio. Aside from writing new material, the band also had some leftover songs from the ''Audioslave'' sessions; according to Morello, they had &quot;almost another album's worth of stuff [already done].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;MTV News - Morello Says Audioslave Have Songs For Second LP Already&quot;/&gt; &quot;[[Be Yourself (Audioslave song)|Be Yourself]]&quot;, the first single from the still-untitled album, was panned by some critics, who felt it was &quot;limp, and the lyrics are bland and directionless.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Singles Jukebox - Singles Going Steady|publisher=[[Stylus Magazine]]|url=http://www.stylusmagazine.com/articles/the_singles_jukebox/singles-going-steady40.htm|accessdate=2007-08-25|date=2005-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, it reached number one on the Mainstream and Modern Rock charts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Billboard – Artist Chart History - Audioslave&quot;/&gt;

In April 2005, the band launched a club tour, which lasted until late May. Although on previous tours Audioslave occasionally played [[Cover version|cover songs]], they deliberately avoided playing their former bands' songs to avoid using those songs as a &quot;crutch&quot; to &quot;help sell and break Audioslave&quot; as their aim was to establish the band as an &quot;independent entity.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;The San Diego Union-Tribune&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=The members of Audioslave built the band on foundation of harmony – 'We take care of each other'|author=Varga, George| publisher=''[[The San Diego Union-Tribune]]''|url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20050512/news_lz1w12slave.html|accessdate=2007-08-25|date=2005-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; After achieving that goal, they thought it was &quot;time to own those histories,&quot; and began performing a selection of the two bands' most popular songs on the tour.&lt;ref name=&quot;The San Diego Union-Tribune&quot;/&gt;

The second single, &quot;[[Your Time Has Come]]&quot; was released through a unique promotion, lasting one week, which involved radio listeners around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=It Takes A Million Audioslave Fans To Hear New Single|publisher=Blabbermouth.net|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=35971|accessdate=2007-08-25|date=2005-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Radio stations were asked to post a link on their websites to a special timed-out download of the song. Once one million people clicked on the link, the song was unlocked and became downloadable by all one million.

On May 6, 2005, Audioslave played a free show in [[Havana]], [[Cuba]], in front of an estimated 50,000 people at the La Tribuna Antiimperialista José Martí ([[José Martí]] Anti-Imperialist Stand) venue, which was purpose-built in 2000 for mass protests against the U.S. government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Audioslave Slay Havana With Historic Show|author=Fraenkel, Jim; Corey, Moss|publisher=MTV|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1501463/20050507/audioslave.jhtml|accessdate=2007-08-25|date=2005-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Audioslave became the first American rock group to perform an open-air concert in the [[socialist]] republic of [[Cuba]].

''[[Out of Exile]]'' was released internationally on May 23, 2005, then a day later in the U.S. It debuted at the top of the Billboard 200 chart, the only Audioslave album to reach this position. The following week, however, it dropped to number three, with a 62-percent sales decrease&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mariah Stops The Rock, Reclaims Billboard #1|author=Harris, Chris|publisher=MTV|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1503707/20050608/carey_mariah.jhtml|accessdate=2007-08-25|date=2005-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;—consequently reaching platinum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Audioslave: 'Out Of Exile' Certified Platinum|publisher=Blabbermouth.net|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=40342|accessdate=2007-08-25|date=2005-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cornell admitted to writing his most personal songs ever on this album, influenced by the positive changes in his life since 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Audioslave Singer Says New Album Will Be 'One Of The Best Rock Records Ever' Made|publisher=Blabbermouth.net|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=35360|accessdate=2007-08-25|date=2005-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also described the album as more varied than the debut and relying less on heavy guitar riffs.&lt;ref name=&quot;San Diego CityBEAT – A Career in Slavery&quot;/&gt;

Following the album's release, the band embarked on a European tour, performed at the [[Live 8]] benefit concert in [[Berlin]] on July 2, 2005, and played their first North American headlining arena tour from late September to November 2005. The music video for &quot;[[Doesn't Remind Me]]&quot;, the third single from ''Out of Exile,'' was posted online in September 2005. Audioslave's second DVD, ''[[Live in Cuba]]'', featuring the concert in Havana, was released on October 11, 2005. It was certified platinum in less than two months.&lt;ref name=&quot;RIAA&quot;/&gt;

Cornell decided to delay the Revelations tour until 2007, because he wanted to &quot;let the album come out for awhile&quot; and also concentrate on his second solo album.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Audioslave Frontman Wants To Wait Before Hitting The Road|publisher=Blabbermouth.net|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=56194|accessdate=2007-08-25|date=2006-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rest of the band went along; Morello also revealed his plans to release his debut solo album in early 2007. The second, and final single from the album, &quot;Revelations&quot; was released in October 2006 with an accompanying music video a month later.

On January 22, 2007, Rage Against the Machine was announced to reunite for one show only, at the [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival]], on April 29, 2007. Less than a month later, on February 15, 2007, Cornell officially announced his departure from Audioslave, issuing this statement:&lt;ref name=&quot;MTV News - Chris Cornell Talks Audioslave Split, Nixes Soundgarden Reunion&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Chris Cornell Talks Audioslave Split, Nixes Soundgarden Reunion|author=Harris, Chris|publisher=MTV|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1552582/20070215/audioslave.jhtml|accessdate=2007-08-25|date=2007-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cornell admits that he has not spoken to the other members of Audioslave since the breakup. He has said that the breakup was not about money, but that he was just not getting along with the other members during their later years. Said Cornell, &quot;Getting along as people is one thing. Getting along as a group of people that can work together in a band situation...We weren't particularly getting along well, no.

I went through a lot of personal turmoil right around the time Audioslave formed and unfortunately I think that affected the band a little bit in terms of me not really being grounded.... I think there was stuff that could have been resolved, and there was drama that was probably unnecessary, typical rock band stuff. I certainly played a role in it. I definitely feel like I was part of a lot of unnecessary stuff. It didn’t need to become what it became. You learn with experience.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fasterlouder.com.au/features/30233/Chris-Cornell?page=2 |title=Chris Cornell on FasterLouder |publisher=fasterlouder.com.au |date= |accessdate=2011-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both [[Soundgarden]] and [[Rage Against the Machine]] have reformed since Audioslave's breakup.

==Musical style and influences==
By combining '70s style hard rock riffing with alternative rock, Audioslave created a distinctive sound.&lt;ref name=&quot;Plugged In Online - Audioslave Comes 'Out of Exile'&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Audioslave Comes 'Out of Exile'|publisher=[[Plugged In Online]]|url=http://www.pluggedinonline.com/thisweekonly/a0002248.cfm|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060317123056/http://www.pluggedinonline.com/thisweekonly/a0002248.cfm|archivedate=2006-03-17|accessdate=2007-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; This mix was driven by Cornell's wide vocal range,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chris Cornell's New Band and their Self-Titled CD|author=Longo, Mike|publisher=''The Clock''|url=http://media.www.theclockonline.com/media/storage/paper569/news/2002/12/13/ArtsEntertainment/Chris.Cornells.New.Band.And.Their.SelfTitled.Cd-361032.shtml|accessdate=2007-08-25|date=2002-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morello's innovative guitar solos and the rhythm section of Wilk and Commerford.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview with Brad Wilk|author=Parillo, Michael|publisher=''[[Modern Drummer]]''|url=http://www.moderndrummer.com/updatefull/200001513|accessdate=2007-08-20}} {{Dead link|date=March 2012|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morello, although stating he &quot;never felt musically limited&quot; in Rage Against the Machine, did say that he had &quot;a lot more scope to explore with Audioslave&quot; and a &quot;wider musical territory.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Sidwell, Jason. &quot;Tom Morello.&quot; ''[[Total Guitar]]''. August 2003, Iss. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; This meant that the instrumentalists had the opportunity to write slow and melodic songs, something they had not done before.

As opposed to de la Rocha's lyrics, Cornell's were mostly apolitical; Morello referred to them as &quot;haunted, existential poetry.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Christianity Today – Audioslave – Audioslave review&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title= Audioslave – Audioslave review|author=Breimeier, Russ|publisher=''[[Christianity Today]]''|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/music/glimpses/2003/audioslave.html|accessdate=2007-09-23|year=2003| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070914005821/http://www.christianitytoday.com/music/glimpses/2003/audioslave.html| archivedate = September 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were characterised by his cryptic approach, often dealing with themes of [[existentialism]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Plugged In Online - Audioslave Comes 'Out of Exile'&quot;/&gt; love, [[hedonism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Album reviews - Audioslave - Out Of Exile|publisher=[[Virgin Media]]|url=http://www.virginmedia.com/music/reviews/albumreviews/audioslave_outofexile.php|accessdate=2007-09-23| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071011034825/http://virginmedia.com/music/reviews/albumreviews/audioslave_outofexile.php| archivedate = October 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[spirituality]] and [[Christianity]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Christianity Today – Audioslave – Audioslave review&quot;/&gt;
Audioslave's first two albums drew influences from 1970s hard rock such as Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath and from the members' previous bands (the [[grunge]] sound of Soundgarden and the [[funk metal]] sound of Rage Against the Machine).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview with Tim Commerford of Audioslave|author=Gabriella|publisher=NY Rock|url=http://www.nyrock.com/interviews/2003/audioslave_int.asp|accessdate=2007-08-20|date=2003-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; For ''Revelations'', which was influenced by 1960s and '70s funk, soul and R&amp;B music, Morello used vintage guitars and amplifiers and Cornell adopted his &quot;seventies funk and R&amp;B-flavor vocals.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tom Morello Swings His Hammer|author=Rogulewski, Charley|publisher=''Rolling Stone''|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/10146985/tom_morello_swings_his_hammer?rnd=1146173101411&amp;has-player=true&amp;version=6.0.12.872|accessdate=2007-08-20|date=2006-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The guitarist also cited [[Sly &amp; the Family Stone]], [[James Brown]] and [[Funkadelic]] as a reason for the funk overtones on the album.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Audioslave Guitarist: 'We've Been Very Unafraid Creatively'|publisher=Blabbermouth.net|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=57992|accessdate=2007-08-20|date=2006-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Just as Rage Against the Machine did, Audioslave also included the statement &quot;All sounds made by guitar, bass, drums and vocals&quot; in their albums' booklets as Morello's guitar work often caused listeners to believe that the band used [[Sampling (music)|samples]], [[synthesiser]] effects or different [[Turntablism|turntable techniques]] to produce certain sounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Audioslave Guitarist Tom Morello: 'I'm A Great Believer In A Good Riff'|date=2006-01-06|publisher=[[Ultimate Guitar Archive]]|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060111084622/http://ultimate-guitar.com/news/interviews/audioslave_guitarist_tom_morello_im_a_great_believer_in_a_good_riff.html|url=http://ultimate-guitar.com/news/interviews/audioslave_guitarist_tom_morello_im_a_great_believer_in_a_good_riff.html|archivedate=2006-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Songwriting and recording process===
All of Audioslave's lyrics were written by Cornell, while all four members—as a band—were credited with writing the music. Their songwriting process was described by Wilk as &quot;more collaborative&quot; and &quot;satisfying&quot; than Rage Against the Machine's, which was &quot;a battle creatively.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kevin Murphy - Audioslave – Classic Rock&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Audioslave – Classic Rock|author=Murphy, Kevin|publisher=Kevin Murphy|url=http://mysite.verizon.net/res8xin8/id23.html|accessdate=2007-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cornell also felt the same way; he saw Soundgarden's songwriting method inferior to Audioslave's.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kevin Murphy - Audioslave – Classic Rock&quot;/&gt; Rick Rubin, producer of the band's first two albums, was also lauded as &quot;a great collaborative partner&quot; and was likened to &quot;the [[fifth Beatle]]&quot; by Tom Morello.&lt;ref name=&quot;MTV News - Audioslave's Morello Says New LP Feels Less Like Soundgarden + Rage&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Audioslave's Morello Says New LP Feels Less Like Soundgarden + Rage|author=Moss, Corey|publisher=MTV|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1489715/20040726/audioslave.jhtml|accessdate=2007-08-25|date=2004-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The time spent on songwriting by the band was always short. They wrote 21 songs in 19 days for the first album and exceeded that rate for the second album by having a song or sometimes two written every day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Audioslave 'Surprised' By Adventurous New Songs, Morello Says|author=Wiederhorn, Jon|publisher=MTV|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1485673/20040311/audioslave.jhtml|accessdate=2007-08-25|date=2004-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; This method was adopted for the third album as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Audioslave Crank Out A Song A Day, Explore New Sounds|author=Harris, Chris|publisher=MTV|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1512814/20051102/audioslave.jhtml|accessdate=2007-08-25|date=2005-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cornell's battle with drug addiction and alcoholism was a defining factor in the writing and recording process of the debut album. The singer admitted that he was &quot;never able to write effectively&quot; while drinking,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Audioslave's Cornell given a new lease on life|author=Elfman, Doug|publisher=reviewjournal.com|url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2005/Apr-14-Thu-2005/living/26252849.html|accessdate=2007-08-25|date=2005-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and attended rehab after recording ''Audioslave''. Although Morello stated that ''Revelations'' was &quot;the first record [Cornell] didn't smoke, drink or take drugs through the recording,&quot; he later clarified his statement by saying: &quot;Chris was stone sober during the making of our ''Out of Exile'' album. Chris was also sober during the making of ''Revelations'' and prior to recording he gave up smoking as well.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Slaves To The Music'|publisher=theage.com.au|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/music/slaves-to-the-music/2006/08/24/1156012641945.html?page=2|accessdate=2008-04-28|date=2006-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
While Rage Against the Machine's music was politically influenced, Audioslave's originally was not. Cornell stated he did not want to become the new singer of Rage Against the Machine or any political band, but he would play benefits the other band members wanted to play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview With Tim Commerford Of Audioslave (unedited)|author=McKay, Chris|publisher=Concert Shots|url=http://www.concertshots.com/audioslave_interview_unedited.htm|accessdate=2007-08-25|date=2003-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his reluctance to write political lyrics, he himself never discounted the possibility; he already touched upon political issues in ''Audioslave'''s &quot;Set It Off&quot;—a song inspired by 1999's [[WTO]] riots (the &quot;[[WTO Ministerial Conference of 1999 protest activity|Battle of Seattle]]&quot;)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Audioslave: Unshackled, Ready To Rage (cont.)|author=Moss, Corey; Parry, Heather|publisher=MTV|url=http://www.mtv.com/bands/a/audioslave/news_feature_112202/index3.jhtml|accessdate=2007-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;—then later wrote an anti-war song, &quot;Sound of a Gun,&quot; and what Morello called &quot;the most political song Audioslave's ever written,&quot; &quot;Wide Awake&quot; for ''Revelations.''&lt;ref name=&quot;MTV News - New Audioslave LP: 'Led Zeppelin Meets Earth, Wind &amp; Fire'&quot;/&gt; &quot;Wide Awake&quot; was an attack on the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]]'s failure to act over the consequences of [[Hurricane Katrina]].

The band was openly anti-[[George W. Bush|Bush]] and against the [[Iraq War]] from the beginning; on March 17, 2003, only hours after President Bush announced plans to invade Iraq, the band performed live in Hollywood with messages reading &quot;How many Iraqis per gallon?&quot; and &quot;Somewhere in [[Texas]], a Village is Missing an Idiot,&quot; scrolled across the stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Audioslave's Free Speech|publisher=Blabbermouth.net|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=10670|accessdate=2007-08-25|date=2003-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The music video for &quot;Doesn't Remind Me&quot; was also critical of the Iraq war. Wilk called Bush &quot;a fucking scam&quot; in an interview, criticizing the Bush administration's rationale for war in Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Audioslave stays focused|author=Hammer, Steve|publisher=''[[NUVO (newspaper)|NUVO]]''|url=http://www.nuvo.net/archive/2005/11/09/audioslave_stays_focused.html|accessdate=2007-08-25|date=2005-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the time of the second album's release several politically charged Rage Against the Machine songs resurfaced in Audioslave's live set. Although the members committed to not making political statements during their Cuba tour, Commerford stated in an interview that the concert made Audioslave more politically active than Rage Against the Machine ever was.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Audioslave Get Political In Their Own Way|publisher=Blabbermouth.net|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=42885|accessdate=2007-08-25|date=2005-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; While in Cuba, Cornell said that he takes &quot;every aspect of human life&quot; into consideration, when it comes to writing lyrics, and that he would write about the experience in a song, or more songs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rolling Stone - Airborne With Audioslave&quot;/&gt; This culminated in the political influences on ''Revelations'', although he did not write about Cuba specifically. He asserted that he felt Audioslave can be a band like [[U2]], which is &quot;not overtly political, but [[Bono]] gets a lot done.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rolling Stone - Airborne With Audioslave&quot;/&gt; That year, the band played at two more concerts organized to raise political awareness: [[Live 8]], which aimed to end global poverty, and the Hurricane Katrina benefit concert, [[ReAct Now: Music &amp; Relief]].

Audioslave was prominently involved in the [[Axis of Justice]], a non-profit organization formed by Tom Morello and [[System of a Down]]'s [[Serj Tankian]] to &quot;bring together musicians, fans of music, and [[grassroots]] political organizations to fight for [[social justice]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mission|publisher=[[Axis of Justice]]|url=http://www.axisofjustice.org/mission.htm|accessdate=2007-08-25| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070823102657/http://www.axisofjustice.org/mission.htm| archivedate = August 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Axis of Justice tents were set up at almost every Audioslave show, and with the exception of Commerford all band members appeared on the ''[[Concert Series Volume 1]]'' CD/DVD charity album released in 2004.
