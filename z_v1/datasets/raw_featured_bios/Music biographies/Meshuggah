'''Meshuggah''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|m|ə|ˈ|ʃ|ʊ|ɡ|ə}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/meshuggah|title=Meshuggah|work=[[Merriam-Webster]]|accessdate=9 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
is a Swedish [[extreme metal]] band from [[Umeå]], formed in 1987. Meshuggah's line-up has primarily consisted of founding members vocalist [[Jens Kidman]] and lead guitarist [[Fredrik Thordendal]], drummer [[Tomas Haake]], who joined in 1990, and rhythm guitarist [[Mårten Hagström]], who joined in 1992. The band has gone through a number of bassists, with the position currently being held by [[Dick Lövgren]] since 2004.

Meshuggah first attracted international attention with the 1995 release ''[[Destroy Erase Improve]]'' for its fusion of fast-tempo [[death metal]], [[thrash metal]] and [[progressive metal]] with [[jazz fusion]] elements. Since its 2002 album ''[[Nothing (Meshuggah album)|Nothing]]'', Meshuggah has used downtuned [[eight-string guitar]]s. Meshuggah has become known for their innovative musical style, complex, [[Meter (music)#Polymeter|polymetered]] song structures and [[polyrhythm]]s. They were labeled as one of the ten most important [[hard rock|hard]] and [[heavy metal music|heavy]] bands by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' and as the most important band in metal by ''[[Alternative Press]]''. Meshuggah has found little mainstream success as yet, but is a significant act in extreme [[underground music]].

''Nothing'' and the albums that followed have all charted on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. In 2006 and 2009, the band was nominated for a [[Grammis|Swedish Grammy Award]]. Meshuggah's most commercially successful album, 2008's ''[[obZen]]'', peaked at No. 59 and sold 11,400 copies in the first week and 50,000 copies six months after its release in the United States. Since its formation, Meshuggah has released six studio albums, five [[Extended play|EPs]] and eight music videos. The band has performed in various international festivals, including [[Ozzfest]] and [[Download Festival|Download]], and embarked on the [[ObZen Tour|''obZen'' world tour]] from 2008 to 2010. A new studio album, ''[[Koloss]]'' was released on March 23, 2012.

After replacing drummer Niclas Lundgren with [[Tomas Haake]] in 1990, Meshuggah signed a contract with German heavy metal [[record label]] [[Nuclear Blast]] and recorded its debut full-length album, ''[[Contradictions Collapse]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Allmusic Bio + Rockdetector Bio&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = {{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p169489|pure_url=yes}}|publisher = [[Allmusic]]|title = Meshuggah Biography|author = Jason Ankeny and Bradley Torreano|accessdate = 2008-05-11}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite web

During this period, Thordendal, who was working as a carpenter, severed the tip of his left middle finger, while Haake injured his hand in a grinder accident.&lt;ref name=&quot;AMG bio&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Official Bio + Rockdetector Bio&quot;/&gt; As a result, the band was unable to perform for several months. Thordendal's fingertip was later reattached, and he went on to make a full recovery.&lt;ref name=&quot;Official bio&quot; /&gt; The ''[[Selfcaged]]'' EP was recorded in April and May 1994, but its release was delayed to later in 1995 due to the accidents.&lt;ref name=&quot;AMG bio&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Official bio&quot; /&gt;

=== ''Destroy Erase Improve'' (1995–1997) ===

In January 1995, Meshuggah undertook a short European tour organized by its record label Nuclear Blast. Afterwards, the band returned to the studio to record the album ''[[Destroy Erase Improve]]''&lt;ref name=&quot;Official bio&quot; /&gt; at Soundfront Studios in [[Uppsala]], with Daniel Bergstrand as a producer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rockdetector Bio&quot; /&gt; Shortly thereafter, the band went on a European tour supporting [[Machine Head (band)|Machine Head]] for two months.&lt;ref name=&quot;Official bio&quot; /&gt; During the tour, Nordin became ill and experienced difficulties with his inner ear balance. Due to the resulting chronic dizziness and vertigo, Nordin was forced to leave the tour and travel to Sweden. Machine Head's bassist [[Adam Duce]] offered to cover his absence; however, Meshuggah decided to continue as a four-piece. Sometimes Thordendal played bass, while other times the band performed with two guitars. In this lineup, Hagström would use a [[Pitch shifter (audio processor)|pitch shifter]] to play his guitar at an [[octave]] lower than usual.&lt;ref name=&quot;Official Bio + Rockdetector Bio&quot;/&gt;

''Destroy Erase Improve'' was released in July 1995, with positive response from critics for the &quot;heady tempos and abstract approach&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;AMG bio&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AMG DEI&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = {{Allmusic|class=album|id=r228054|pure_url=yes}}|publisher = [[Allmusic]]|title = Destroy Erase Improve review|author = John Serba|accessdate = 2008-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kidman described the album cover: &quot;The title fits the pictures we cut out and stole from reference books in the library.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=59436|publisher = [[Blabbermouth.net]]|title = Meshuggah's 'Destroy Erase Improve' Inducted Into Decibel's 'Hall Of Fame' - Sep. 29, 2006|accessdate = 2008-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-1995, Meshuggah had a short tour with Swedish band [[Clawfinger]] in Scandinavia and Germany. Nordin had to leave the band because of his sickness and was replaced by bassist Gustaf Hielm during the tour.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rockdetector Bio&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Blabbermouth Meshuggah Guitarist: 'We're Always Experimental In One Way Or Another'&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=101386|publisher = [[Blabbermouth.net]]|title = Meshuggah Guitarist: 'We're Always Experimental In One Way Or Another' - July 22, 2008|author =|accessdate = 2008-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1995, Meshuggah went on a month-long tour with [[Hypocrisy (band)|Hypocrisy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Rockdetector Bio&quot; /&gt;

During 1996 and 1997, Thordendal worked on his solo album ''[[Sol Niger Within]]'', which was released in March 1997 in Scandinavia and in April in Japan. He also hosted [[Mats/Morgan Band]]'s debut. In 1997, Meshuggah recorded an unreleased demo, toured occasionally, and played a few concerts in its hometown. In May, Meshuggah moved to Stockholm to be closer to its management and the record industry in general.&lt;ref name=&quot;Official Bio + Rockdetector Bio&quot;/&gt;

The EP ''[[The True Human Design]]'' was recorded and released in late 1997. It contained one new song entitled &quot;Sane&quot;, and one live and two alternate versions of ''Destroy Erase Improve'''s opening track &quot;Future Breed Machine&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Official Bio + Rockdetector Bio&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = The True Human Design - 1997|url = http://www.meshuggah.net/disco/tthd/|publisher = meshuggah.net|accessdate = 2008-05-11|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080725211031/http://www.meshuggah.net/disco/tthd/ |archivedate = July 25, 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thordendal's solo album ''Sol Niger Within'' was simultaneously released in the United States, and Meshuggah started to plan its next album at the end of the year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Official bio&quot; /&gt;

=== ''Chaosphere'' and ''Nothing'' (1998–2002) ===
Hielm officially joined the band in January&amp;nbsp;1998 after more than two years as a session member. Nuclear Blast re-released ''Contradictions Collapse'' with the addition of songs from the ''None'' EP. In May&amp;nbsp;1998, the title of the next album, ''[[Chaosphere]]'', was reported and recording began. Immediately after recording the album, Meshuggah went on a short US tour, and the album was released later in November 1998. Shortly after the release, Meshuggah toured Scandinavia with [[Entombed (band)|Entombed]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Official Bio + Rockdetector Bio&quot;/&gt;

In early 1999, Meshuggah joined [[Slayer]] on their U.S. tour.&lt;ref name=&quot;Decibel story&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rockdetector Bio&quot; /&gt; After the new album and the live performances, Meshuggah was beginning to be recognized by mainstream music, guitar, drum and metal magazines.&lt;ref name=&quot;Allmusic Bio + Rockdetector Bio&quot;/&gt; In mid-1999, Meshuggah performed in several Swedish concerts. The band started to write some new material but reported in mid-2000 that &quot;songwriting isn't that dramatic, but we're getting there slowly&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Official bio&quot; /&gt; While fans were waiting for the next album, a collection of demos (from the ''Psykisk Testbild'' EP), remixes and unreleased songs from the ''Chaosphere'' sessions were released as the ''[[Rare Trax]]'' album.&lt;ref name=&quot;AMG bio&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Official bio&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.exclaim.ca/articles/multiarticlesub.aspx?csid2=4&amp;fid1=543&amp;csid1=23 |publisher = ''[[Exclaim!]]'' |title = Meshuggah Are Breaking the Silence |author = Greg Pratt |accessdate = 2008-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hielm left the band in July 2001 for unclear reasons.&lt;ref name=&quot;Official Bio + Rockdetector Bio&quot;/&gt; Meshuggah joined [[Tool (band)|Tool]] on a lengthy tour, playing for more than 100,000 people total.&lt;ref name=&quot;Decibel story&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/Blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=219|publisher = [[Blabbermouth.net]]|title = Archive News - Oct. 5, 2001|author =|accessdate = 2008-09-01}} {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2002, Meshuggah recorded three-track demos with programmed drums in their home studio, which were based on Haake's sample ''Drumkit from Hell''. The upcoming album was recorded in five to six weeks in May&lt;ref name=&quot;Official bio&quot; /&gt; and was produced by the band at Dug-Out Studios in Uppsala and at its home studio in Stockholm.&lt;ref name=&quot;MTV Jack Osbourne's Favorite Metallists Meshuggah Prepare For Nothing&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1454009/20020516/meshuggah.jhtml|publisher = [[MTV.com]]|title = Jack Osbourne's Favorite Metallists Meshuggah Prepare For Nothing|author = Jon Wiederhorn|accessdate = 2008-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last-minute decision to join 2002's [[Ozzfest]] tour forced the band to mix the album in two days and master it in one.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stylus Nothing&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.stylusmagazine.com/reviews/meshuggah/nothing.htm|publisher = ''[[Stylus Magazine]]''|title = Meshuggah Nothing|author = Cosmo Lee|accessdate = 2008-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meshuggah immediately went on another US tour after finishing the recording.&lt;ref name=&quot;Official bio&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MTV Jack Osbourne's Favorite Metallists Meshuggah Prepare For Nothing&quot;/&gt;

=== ''I'' and ''Catch Thirtythree'' (2003–2006) ===
In 2003, Hagström hinted at the direction of the band's next album by saying, &quot;There's only one thing I really feel that is important. We've never measured our success in terms of sales, because we're quite an extreme band. It's more that people understand where we're coming from. I get more out of a fan coming up and saying that we've totally changed their way of looking on metal music, than having like 200 kids buy it. I mean, it would be nice for the money, but that's not why we're in it. So what I'd like to see is that we keep progressing. Keeping the core of what Meshuggah has always been, but exploring the bar, so to speak. ''Destroy Erase Improve'' was like exploring the dynamics of the band, ''Chaosphere'' was exploring the aggressiveness, the all-out side, and ''Nothing'' is more of a sinister, dark, pretty slow album, actually. So honestly, now I don't know where we're going. It might be a mix of all of them.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=13041|publisher = [[Blabbermouth.net]]|title = Meshuggah: Off Nuclear Blast, Weighing Their Options - June 24, 2003|author =|accessdate = 2008-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Genre and typical traits ===
[[Image:Meshuggah Thordendal 2008 Prague.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Lead guitarist [[Fredrik Thordendal]] performing in 2008 in [[Prague]], [[Czech Republic]]]]
Meshuggah's experimentation, stylistic variation and changes during its career cross several musical subgenres. Heavy metal subgenres [[avant-garde metal]] or [[Avant-garde metal|experimental metal]] are umbrella terms that enable description of the career of the band in general.{{ref label|a|a|none}} [[Extreme metal]] crosses both [[thrash metal]] and [[death metal]] (or [[technical death metal]]), which are at root of the sound of Meshuggah's music.{{ref label|b|b|none}} The band is often labelled as math metal (for using elements of [[math rock]]) and [[progressive metal]].{{ref label|c|c|none}} Meshuggah also incorporates elements of [[free jazz|experimental jazz]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AMG bio&quot; /&gt; In its review of ''Nothing'', [[Allmusic]] describes Meshuggah as &quot;masterminds of cosmic calculus metal—call it Einstein metal if you want&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;AMG Nothing&quot; /&gt; Meshuggah creates a recognizable sonic imprint&lt;ref name=&quot;AMG Catch-33&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = {{Allmusic|class=album|id=r742522|pure_url=yes}}|publisher = [[Allmusic]]|title = Catch Thirty-Three review|author = Eduardo Rivadavia|accessdate = 2008-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and distinct style.&lt;ref name=&quot;Exclaim! Meshuggah's One-Track Mind&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.exclaim.ca/articles/multiarticlesub.aspx?csid2=4&amp;fid1=3907&amp;csid1=70
|publisher = ''[[Exclaim!]]''|title = Meshuggah's One-Track Mind|author = Jill Mikkelson|accessdate = 2008-07-05
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trademarks and characteristics that define Meshuggah's sound and songwriting include [[polyrhythm]]s, [[polymeter]]ed riff cycles, rhythmic [[syncopation]], rapid [[Key (music)|key]] and [[tempo]] changes and neo-[[jazz]] [[Diatonic and chromatic|chromatics]].{{ref label|d|d|none}} Hagström notes that &quot;it doesn’t really matter if something is hard to play or not. The thing is, what does it do to your mind when you listen to it? Where does it take you?&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Decibel story&quot; /&gt; A trademark of Thordendal is [[jazz fusion]]-like soloing and improvisation. He is also known for the usage of a &quot;breath controller&quot; device. Haake is known for his [[cross-rhythm]] drumming with &quot;jazzlike cadence&quot;.{{ref label|e|e|none}} The vocal style of Jens Kidman varies between [[Hardcore punk|hardcore]]-style shouts&lt;ref name=&quot;AMG DEI&quot; /&gt; and &quot;robotic&quot; death metal vocals.&lt;ref name=&quot;AMG Nothing&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Blender obZen&quot; /&gt;

In a typical polyrhythm by Meshuggah, the guitars might play in odd meters such as 5/16 or 17/16, while drums play in normal 4/4.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stylus Nothing&quot; /&gt; An example of Haake's dual rhythms is a 4/4 and 23/16 rhythm. He keeps the [[hi-hat]] and [[ride cymbal]] in simple 4/4 time but uses the [[Snare drum|snare]] and [[Bass drum#Double bass drum|double bass drums]] for 23/16 rhythm.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rockdetector Bio&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PopMatters I&quot; /&gt; On &quot;Rational Gaze&quot; (from ''Nothing''), Haake plays simple 4/4 time, hitting the snare on each third beat, for 16 bars. At the same time, the guitars and bass are playing the same quarter notes, albeit in a different time signature, and eventually both sides meet up again at the 64th beat.&lt;ref name=&quot;Popmatters Nothing&quot; /&gt; Hagström notes about the polyrhythms, &quot;We’ve never really been into the odd time signatures we get accused of using. Everything we do is based around a 4/4 core. It’s just that we arrange parts differently around that center to make it seem like something else is going on.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Decibel story&quot; /&gt;

=== Early work, ''Destroy Erase Improve'' and ''Chaosphere'' ===
{{listen|filename=Meshuggah - Future Breed Machine (solo).ogg|title=&quot;Future Breed Machine&quot; (1995)|description=&quot;Future Breed Machine&quot; demonstrates the jazzlike soloing of Fredrik Thordendal. He also uses his &quot;breath controller&quot; device on this song.}}

The early work of Meshuggah, influenced mainly by [[Metallica]], is &quot;simpler and more straightforward than their more recent material, but some of their more progressive elements are present in the form of time-changes and polyrhythmics, and Fredrik Thordendal's lead playing stands out&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Decibel story&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Official bio&quot; /&gt; According to Allmusic, the debut album is a relatively immature, but original, release.&lt;ref name=&quot;AMG DEI&quot; /&gt; [[Bass drum#Double bass drum|Double bass drums]] and &quot;angular&quot; riffing also defined the early work of Meshuggah.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blabbermouth.net - Meshuggah: Prague Concert Footage Available&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=76586|publisher = [[Blabbermouth.net]]|title = Meshuggah: Prague Concert Footage Available - July 11, 2007|accessdate = 2008-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the groundbreaking ''Destroy Erase Improve'', Meshuggah showed [[Fusion (music)|fusion]] of death metal, thrash metal, progressive metal and technical polyrhythmic math metal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rockdetector Bio&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AMG DEI&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PopMatters Catch 33&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.popmatters.com/music/reviews/m/meshuggah-catch.shtml|publisher = [[PopMatters]]|title = Meshuggah Catch Thirtythree

''Chaosphere'' incorporates typically fast,&lt;ref name=&quot;PopMatters I&quot; /&gt; still tempo changing death metal. Allmusic compares the genre also with [[grindcore]] fathers [[Napalm Death]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AMG Chaosphere&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = {{Allmusic|class=album|id=r382654|pure_url=yes}}

Hagström notes, &quot;The eight-strings really have given us a whole new musical vocabulary to work with. Part of it is the restrictions they impose: you really can't play power chords with them; the sound just turns to mush. Instead, we concentrated on coming up with really unusual single-note parts, new tunings and chord voicings.

=== ''obZen'' ===
{{listen|filename=Meshuggah - Bleed.ogg|title=&quot;Bleed&quot; (2008)|description=Tomas Haake's drumming on the song &quot;Bleed&quot; from 2008's ''obZen'' attracted the attention of music journalists.

With 2008's ''obZen'', Meshuggah moved away from the experimentation of 2002's ''Nothing'' and 2005's ''Catch Thirtythree'' to return to the musical style of its previous albums, such as ''Contradictions Collapse'', ''Destroy Erase Improve'' and ''Chaosphere'',&lt;ref name=&quot;AMG obZen&quot;&gt;{{cite web

For ''obZen'', Haake returned to the drum kit most notably with his performance on the song &quot;Bleed&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;AMG obZen&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;RS obZen&quot; /&gt; In an interview for Gravemusic.com, Haake stated, &quot;['Bleed'] was a big effort for me to learn, I had to find a totally new approach to playing the double bass drums to be able to do that stuff. I had never really done anything like that before like the fast bursts that go all the way through the song basically. So I actually spent as much time practicing that track alone as I did with all of the other tracks combined. It's kind of a big feat to change your approach like that and I'm glad we were able to nail it for the album. For a while though we didn't even know if it was going to make it to the album.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Blabbermouth Bleed&quot; /&gt; Hagström also stated, &quot;''obZen'' is one of the most highly technical offerings the band has ever put to tape&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;MTV.com Jan 18 2008&quot;/&gt; ''Revolver magazine'' confirms this statement: &quot;At first listen, ''obZen'' seems less challenging to the listener than some of the band’s other records, and most of the songs flow smoothly from one syncopated passage to the next. However, careful examination reveals that the material is some of the group’s most complicated&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Revolver Meshuggah&quot;/&gt;

== Legacy and reception ==
[[Image:Tomas Haake 2005.jpg|thumb|left|
[[Tomas Haake]] in Stockholm, Sweden, in 2005.

Meshuggah has become known for its innovative musical style that evolves between each release and pushes heavy metal into new territory, and for its technical prowess.{{ref label|f|f|none}} Hagström comments: &quot;We try never to repeat ourselves.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Decibel story&quot; /&gt; Rockdetector stated about ''Destroy Erase Improve'': &quot;[T]he band...stripped Metal down to the bare essentials before completely rebuilding it in a totally abstract form&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rockdetector Bio&quot; /&gt; Official Meshuggah biography criticizes ''Chaosphere'' with: &quot;Some fans felt that Meshuggah had left their dynamic and progressive elements behind; while others thought they were only progressing naturally and focusing on their original sound&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Official bio&quot; /&gt; and ''Nothing'' with: &quot;[I]t displayed a very mature and convincing Meshuggah, now focusing on groove and sound...Meshuggah once again divided their fans into the 'ecstatic' and the 'slightly disappointed'&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Official bio&quot; /&gt; The polyrhythms can make the music sound [[Phonaesthetics|cacophonous]], like band members are playing different songs simultaneously.&lt;ref name=&quot;Popmatters Nothing&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Popmatters Nothing2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.popmatters.com/pm/review/meshuggah-nothing|publisher = [[PopMatters]]|title = Nothing (Special Edition)|author = Adrien Begrand|accessdate = 2008-06-10

== Songwriting, recording and lyrics ==
Meshuggah's music is written by Thordendal, Hagström and Haake with assistance from Kidman. During songwriting, a member programs the drums, and records the guitar and bass via computer. He presents his idea to the other members as a finished work. Meshuggah typically adheres to the original idea and rarely changes the song afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=106332| publisher = [[Blabbermouth.net]]| title = Meshuggah Guitarist On Songwriting, Touring And Influencing Younger Bands - Oct. 6, 2008| author =| accessdate = 2008-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hagström explains that each member has an idea of what the others are doing conceptually, and nobody thinks exclusively in terms of a particular instrument. Kidman does not play guitar in the band anymore, but he is involved in writing riffs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Decibel story&quot; /&gt;

Except for when Hagström needs a soloist, he and Thordendal rarely record together. Both play guitar and bass while composing. Haake says about his songwriting, &quot;Sometimes I’ll sample guitar parts, cut them up, pitch-shift and tweak them until I’ve built the riffs I want, just for demoing purposes. But most of the time I’ll just present the drums, and explain my ideas for the rest of the song, sing some riffs.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Decibel story2&quot; /&gt;

Approximately once a year, Haake writes most of the band's lyrics, with the exception of finished tracks. His lyrical inspirations are derived from books and films. Although Meshuggah does not record [[concept album]]s, the band prefers strong conceptual underpinnings in the background.&lt;ref name=&quot;Decibel story&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Aquarian: Challenges Collapse&quot;&gt;{{cite web

Often [[esotericism|esoteric]]&lt;ref name=&quot;AMG bio&quot; /&gt; and conceptual,&lt;ref name=&quot;MTV Jack Osbourne's Favorite Metallists Meshuggah Prepare For Nothing&quot;/&gt; Meshuggah's lyrics explore themes such as [[existentialism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AMG Nothing&quot; /&gt; Allmusic describes ''Destroy Erase Improve''&lt;nowiki&gt;'s&lt;/nowiki&gt; lyrical focus as &quot;the integration of machines with organisms as humanity's next logical evolutionary step&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;AMG DEI&quot; /&gt; PopMatters' review of ''Nothing'' singles out the lyrics from &quot;Rational Gaze&quot;: &quot;Our light-induced image of truth—filtered blank of its substance / As our eyes won’t adhere to intuitive lines / Everything examined. Separated, one thing at a time / The harder we stare the more complete the disintegration.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Popmatters Nothing2&quot;/&gt; Haake explains that ''Catch Thirtythree''&lt;nowiki&gt;'s&lt;/nowiki&gt; cover, title and lyrics deal with &quot;the paradoxes /negations /contradictions of life and death (as we see it in our finest moments of unrestrained metaphoric interpretation)&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blabbermouth Catch33 cover&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=33194|publisher = [[Blabbermouth.net]]|title = Meshuggah: 'Catch 33' Cover Art Posted Online - Feb. 21, 2005|author =|accessdate = 2008-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main theme of ''obZen'' is &quot;human evil&quot;, according to Haake. The title is a play on the words &quot;[[obscenity|obscene]]&quot; and &quot;[[Zen]]&quot;; in addition, &quot;ob&quot; means &quot;anti&quot; in Latin. Therefore, the title suggests that the human species has found harmony and balance in warfare and bloodshed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Decibel story2&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Exclaim! obZen Greg Pratt&quot;&gt;{{cite web

But with these songs, I think we really wanted to paint a picture lyrically that might be seen as a cautionary tale. We're going, ‘Heads up. Here's what some of the parts of being human are about, and this is what we can be at our worst.’ So it’s more about being aware of negative feelings than actually living them all the time.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Revolver Meshuggah&quot;/&gt;
