'''John Anthony Frusciante''' {{IPAc-en|audio=Frusciante.ogg|f|r|uː|ˈ|ʃ|ɑː|n|t|eɪ}} ({{IPA-it|fruʃˈʃante}}; born March 5, 1970) is an American [[guitarist]], singer, songwriter, record and film producer. He is best known as the former guitarist of the [[Rock music|rock]] band [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]], with whom he had been for a number of years and recorded five studio albums. Frusciante has an active solo career, having released ten albums under his own name, as well as two with [[Josh Klinghoffer]] and [[Joe Lally]] as [[Ataxia (band)|Ataxia]]. His solo recordings include elements ranging from [[experimental rock]] and [[ambient music]] to [[New Wave music|New Wave]] and [[electronica]]. Influenced by guitarists of various genres, Frusciante emphasizes melody and emotion in his guitar playing, and favors vintage guitars and analog recording techniques.

Frusciante joined the Red Hot Chili Peppers at eighteen years old, first appearing on the band's 1989 album, ''[[Mother's Milk]]''. The group's follow-up album, ''[[Blood Sugar Sex Magik]]'' (1991), was a breakthrough success. However, he was overwhelmed by the band's new popularity and quit in 1992. He became a recluse and entered a long period of drug addiction, during which he released his first solo recordings: ''[[Niandra Lades and Usually Just a T-Shirt]]'' (1994) and then ''[[Smile from the Streets You Hold]]'' (1997). In 1998, he successfully completed drug rehabilitation and rejoined the Red Hot Chili Peppers with the album ''[[Californication (album)|Californication]]'' (1999). His album ''[[To Record Only Water for Ten Days]]'' was made in 2001. On a creative spree, Frusciante released six solo albums in 2004; each album explored different recording techniques and genres. In 2009, Frusciante released ''[[The Empyrean]]'' and again parted ways with the Red Hot Chili Peppers. As of 2011, Frusciante is currently working on his eleventh solo album. Frusciante has produced and/or recorded with the [[Wu-Tang Clan]], [[The Mars Volta]], [[George Clinton (funk musician)|George Clinton]] and others.

Frusciante has received critical recognition for his guitar playing, ranking at #18 on ''[[Rolling Stone]]''{{'}}s list of &quot;The 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time&quot; in 2003 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-guitarists-of-all-time-19691231/john-frusciante-19691231 |title=18 John Frusciante |publisher=Rolling Stone |accessdate=June 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;; however, on the revised list in 2011, Frusciante was ranked at #72.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-guitarists-20111123/john-frusciante-19691231|title=72 John Frusciante |publisher=Rolling Stone |accessdate=November 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also voted the best guitarist of the last 30 years in a 2010 BBC poll called &quot;The Axe Factor&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/6music/news/20100409_axefactor.shtml |title=6Music News – Chilis star wins Axe Factor |publisher=BBC |date=2010-04-30 |accessdate=2010-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frusciante was inducted into the [[Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame]] as a member of the Red Hot Chili Peppers on April 14, 2012 although he did not attend the ceremony.

==Biography==
===1970–1987: Childhood and early life===
Frusciante was born in [[Astoria, Queens, New York|Queens]], [[New York]] on March 5, 1970. His father, John Sr., is a [[Juilliard School|Juilliard]]-trained [[pianist]], and his mother Gail was a promising [[vocalist]] who gave up her career to be a stay-at-home mother.&lt;ref name=&quot;gpm1&quot;&gt;Rotondigic, James (November, 1997). &quot;Till I Reach the Higher Ground&quot;. ''[[Guitar Player]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Frusciante's family moved to [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]], [[Arizona]], and then [[Florida]], where his father served as a [[Broward County, Florida|Broward County]] judge until October 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kay&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailybusinessreview.com/PubArticleDBR.jsp?id=1202469828776|author=Kay, Julie|title= Broward Judge Frusciante Resigns.|accessdate=2010-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; His parents separated, and he and his mother moved to [[Santa Monica, California|Santa Monica]], [[California]].&lt;ref name=&quot;gpm1&quot;/&gt;

A year later, Frusciante and his mother moved to [[Mar Vista, Los Angeles, California|Mar Vista]], [[Los Angeles]] with his new stepfather who, he says, &quot;really supported me and made me feel good about being an artist.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;gpm1&quot;/&gt; Like many young people in the area, he became intimately involved in the L.A. [[punk rock]] scene. At nine he was infatuated with [[The Germs]], wearing out several copies of their record ''[[(GI)]]''. By ten, he had taught himself how to play most of ''(GI)'s'' songs. He has stated that he didn't really know what he was doing, and that he would play every chord with a single-finger [[Barre chord|barre]].&lt;ref name=&quot;gpm1&quot;/&gt; 

Frusciante began studying guitarists like [[Jeff Beck]], [[Jimmy Page]], [[David Gilmour]] and [[Jimi Hendrix]] at eleven. After mastering the [[Hexatonic scale|blues scale]], he discovered [[Frank Zappa]], whose work he would study for hours.&lt;ref name=&quot;gpm1&quot;/&gt; Frusciante first heard of the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] around 1984 when his guitar instructor was auditioning as a guitarist for that band.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kramer&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.johnfrusciante.com/articles.php#inter03|author=Kramer, Dan|title= John Frusciante talks to Dan Kramer|accessdate=2007-08-31|publisher=Johnfrusciante.com| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070821182509/http://www.johnfrusciante.com/articles.php| archivedate = August 21, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He dropped out of high school at sixteen with the permission of his parents and completion of a proficiency test. With their support, he moved to Los Angeles in order to develop his musical proficiency.&lt;ref name=&quot;rs-fricke&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/chilipeppers_tattooed_love_boys/page/1|author=Fricke, David|date=June 15, 2006|title=Tattooed Love Boys: After twenty-three years, nine albums, death, love, and addiction, the Red Hot Chili Peppers are at Number One for the very first time|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20081224100730/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/chilipeppers_tattooed_love_boys/page/1|archivedate=2008-12-24|accessdate=2007-10-02|publisher=Rolling Stone}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began taking classes at the [[Musicians Institute|Guitar Institute of Technology]], but turned to punching in without actually attending and left shortly thereafter.&lt;ref name=&quot;gpm1&quot;/&gt;

===1988–1992: Red Hot Chili Peppers===
Frusciante first attended a Red Hot Chili Peppers performance at fifteen and he rapidly became a devoted fan.&lt;ref name=&quot;rs-fricke&quot;/&gt; He idolized guitarist [[Hillel Slovak]]—familiarizing himself with virtually all the guitar and bass parts from the Chili Peppers' first three records. He became acquainted with Slovak; the two spoke months before Slovak's death and Frusciante's subsequent joining:&lt;ref name=raw1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://johnfrusciante.com/articles.php#raw01|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071011180908/http://johnfrusciante.com/articles.php#raw01|archivedate=2007-10-11|author=Nelson, Artie|date=November 23, 1994|title=Space Cadet|accessdate=2007-08-31|publisher=''Raw Magazine'', Issue #163}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote|...Hillel asked me, 'Would you still like the Chilis if they got so popular they played the [[The Forum (Inglewood, California)|Forum]]?' I said, 'No. It would ruin the whole thing. That's great about the band, the audience feels no different from the band at all.' There was this real kind of historical vibe at their shows, none of the frustration that runs through the audience when they jump around and can't get out of their seat. I didn't even watch the shows. I'd get so excited that I'd flip around the slam pit the whole time. I really felt like a part of the band, and all the sensitive people in the audience did too.}}

Frusciante became friends with former [[Dead Kennedys]] drummer [[D. H. Peligro]] in early 1988. They often jammed together, and Peligro invited his friend [[Flea (musician)|Flea]] (bassist of Red Hot Chili Peppers) to join. Frusciante and Flea developed a musical chemistry immediately, with Flea later acknowledging that might have been the day he first played the bass riff to &quot;[[Nobody Weird Like Me]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Mother's Milk'' 2003 reissue liner notes&lt;/ref&gt; Around the same time, Frusciante intended to audition for Frank Zappa's band, but changed his mind before the final try-out as Zappa strictly prohibited illegal drug use. Frusciante said, &quot;I realized that I wanted to be a rock star, do drugs and get girls, and that I wouldn't be able to do that if I was in Zappa's band.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;gpm1&quot;/&gt;

Slovak died of a heroin overdose in 1988, and Red Hot Chili Peppers drummer [[Jack Irons]], incapable of coping with Slovak's death, left the group. Remaining members Flea and vocalist [[Anthony Kiedis]] regrouped, determined to persevere. The pair added Peligro on drums and [[DeWayne &quot;Blackbyrd&quot; McKnight]], formerly of [[Parliament-Funkadelic|P-Funk]], on guitar.&lt;ref&gt;Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 234&lt;/ref&gt; McKnight, however, failed to connect musically within the group. Flea proposed auditioning Frusciante, whose intimate knowledge of the Chili Peppers' repertoire astonished him. Flea and Kiedis auditioned him and agreed that he would be a suitable replacement for McKnight, who was promptly fired.&lt;ref&gt;Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 239&lt;/ref&gt; When Flea called Frusciante with the news of his acceptance into the Chili Peppers, Frusciante was elated; he ran through his house screaming with joy, and jumped on a wall, leaving permanent boot marks.&lt;ref name=vh1btm&gt;{{cite episode | title = [http://www.vh1.com/shows/dyn/behind_the_music/51363/episode_about.jhtml Red Hot Chili Peppers] | series = [[Behind the Music]] | network = [[VH1]] | airdate = 1999-05-30 | accessdate=2007-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was in the midst of signing a contract{{Vague|date=May 2009}}&lt;!-- How can you be in the midst of signing something? &quot;On the point of&quot;? --&gt; with [[Thelonious Monster]] at the time—and had actually been playing with the act for two weeks—but his unanticipated reception into the Chili Peppers prompted him to change his plans.&lt;ref name=GuitarMag1&gt;Forsythe, Tom. (February  1991) &quot;Laughing All the Way&quot;. ''Guitar Magazine''.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Frusciante was not familiar with the funk genre of Red Hot Chili Peppers' sound: &quot;I wasn't really a funk player before I joined the band. I learned everything I needed to know about how to sound good with Flea by studying Hillel [Slovak's] playing and I just took it sideways from there.&quot;&lt;ref name=apter181&gt;Apter, 2004. p. 181&lt;/ref&gt; Several weeks into the band's new lineup, Peligro, whose performance was suffering due to extreme drug abuse, was fired.&lt;ref&gt;Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 242&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after, [[Chad Smith]] was added as the group's new drummer and the new lineup began recording their first album, 1989's ''[[Mother's Milk]]''. Frusciante focused on emulating Slovak's signature style, rather than imposing his own personal style on the group. Producer [[Michael Beinhorn]] disagreed, and wanted Frusciante to play with an uncharacteristic [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] tone, largely absent from the band's three preceding records.&lt;ref name=p.249&gt;Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 249&lt;/ref&gt; Frusciante and Beinhorn fought frequently over guitar tone and layering, and Beinhorn's idea ultimately prevailed as Frusciante felt pressured by the producer's much greater knowledge of the studio.&lt;ref name=p.249/&gt; Kiedis recalls that &quot;[Beinhorn] wanted John to have a big, crunching, almost metal-sounding guitar tone whereas before we always had some interesting acid-rock guitar tones as well as a lot of slinky, sexy, funky guitar tones.&quot;&lt;ref name=scartissue239&gt;Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. pp. 239–241&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chili Peppers collaborated with producer [[Rick Rubin]] for their second record with Frusciante, ''[[Blood Sugar Sex Magik]]''. Rubin felt that it was important to record the album in an unorthodox setting, so he suggested an old [[Hollywood Hills]] mansion, and the band agreed.&lt;ref&gt;Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 284&lt;/ref&gt; Frusciante, Kiedis and Flea isolated themselves there for the duration of the recording. Frusciante and Flea seldom went outside, and spent most of their time smoking [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]].&lt;ref name=&quot;tgm2002&quot;&gt;Dalley, Helen (August 2002). &quot;John Frusciante&quot; ''Total Guitar''. Retrieved on August 27, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Around this time, Frusciante started a side collaboration with Flea and [[Jane's Addiction]] drummer [[Stephen Perkins]] called The Three Amoebas. They recorded roughly ten to fifteen hours of material, none of which has ever been released.&lt;ref name=raw1/&gt;

''Blood Sugar Sex Magik'' was hugely successful upon its release on September 24, 1991. It peaked at number three on the ''Billboard'' charts, and went on to sell thirteen million copies worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/retrieve_chart_history.do?model.chartFormatGroupName=Albums&amp;model.vnuArtistId=5507&amp;model.vnuAlbumId=815996 |title=Billboard 200|date= |publisher=Billboard.com |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090224021621/http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/retrieve_chart_history.do?model.chartFormatGroupName=Albums&amp;model.vnuArtistId=5507&amp;model.vnuAlbumId=815996 |archivedate=2009-02-24 |accessdate=2011-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/red-hot-chili-peppers/5507#/artist/red-hot-chili-peppers/bio/5507|author=Prato, Greg|title=Red Hot Chili Peppers biography|accessdate=2007-09-12|publisher=Billboard}}&lt;/ref&gt; The unexpected success instantly turned the Red Hot Chili Peppers into rock stars. Frusciante was blindsided by his newfound fame, and struggled to cope with it. Soon after the album's release, he began to develop a dislike for the band's popularity. Kiedis recalled that he and Frusciante used to get into heated discussions backstage after concerts: &quot;John would say, 'We're too popular. I don't need to be at this level of success. I would just be proud to be playing this music in clubs like you guys were doing two years ago.'&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 229&lt;/ref&gt; Frusciante later said that the band's rise to popularity was &quot;too high, too far, too soon. Everything seemed to be happening at once and I just couldn't cope with it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Gabriella. | url = http://www.nyrock.com/interviews/rhcp_int.htm | title = &quot;Interview with the Red Hot Chili Peppers&quot;. The Californication of John Frusciante | work = NY Rock | month = July | year = 1999 | accessdate = 2007-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also began to feel that destiny was leading him away from the band. When the Chili Peppers began their world tour, he started to hear voices in his head telling him &quot;you won't make it during the tour, you have to go now.&quot;&lt;ref name=selvaggio&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.johnfrusciante.com/interviews/translation_mucchioselvaggio.pdf|format=PDF|title= &quot;John Frusciante: Perso e Ritrovato&quot; (English translation as pdf file)|publisher=Il Mucchio.

To balance it out, I had to be extra-humble, extra-anti-rock star.&quot;&lt;ref name=rise&gt;&quot;The Chili Peppers Rise Again&quot;. ''Rolling Stone''. Retrieved on 2007-08-08&lt;/ref&gt; He refused to take the stage during a performance at Tokyo's Club Quattro on May 7, 1992, telling his bandmates that he was leaving the band. He was persuaded to perform, but left for California the next morning;&lt;ref name=vh1btm/&gt; according to the guitarist, &quot;it was just impossible for me to stay in the band any longer. It had come to the point where even though they wanted me in the band, it felt like I was forced out of the band. Not by any members in particular or management in particular, but just the direction it was going.&quot;&lt;ref name=rockinfreak&gt;Broxvoort, Brian (1994). &quot;John Frusciante Goes Over a Bridge.&quot; ''Rockinfreakapotamus''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1992–1997: Drug addiction===
Frusciante developed serious drug habits while touring with the band during the previous four years. He said that when he &quot;found out that Flea was stoned out of his mind at every show, that inspired me to be a pothead&quot;.&lt;ref name=hightimes&gt;Kennealy, Tim (July 1995). &quot;Chilly Pepper&quot;. ''[[High Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Not only was Frusciante smoking large amounts of marijuana, but he began to use heroin and was on the verge of full-scale addiction. Upon returning to California in the summer of 1992, Frusciante entered a deep [[depression (mood)|depression]], feeling that his life was over and that he could no longer write music or play guitar.&lt;ref name=&quot;selvaggio&quot;/&gt; For a long time, he focused on painting, producing 4-track recordings he had made while working on ''Blood Sugar Sex Magik'', and writing short stories and screenplays. To cope with his worsening depression, Frusciante increased his heroin use and spiraled into a life-threatening dependency.&lt;ref name=rsm1/&gt; His use of heroin to medicate his depression was a clear decision: &quot;I was very sad, and I was always happy when I was on drugs; therefore, I should be on drugs all the time. I was never guilty—I was always really proud to be an addict.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan, Kate (August 2002). &quot;Interview with Flea, Anthony and John&quot;. ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Although he openly admitted to being a &quot;junkie&quot;, he believed drugs were the only way of &quot;making sure you stay in touch with beauty instead of letting the ugliness of the world corrupt your soul.&quot;
{{Listen|filename=Pussy.ogg|title=&quot;Your Pussy's Glued to a Building on Fire&quot;|description=Sample of &quot;Your Pussy's Glued to a Building on Fire&quot;, from Frusciante's first solo album, ''Niandra Lades and Usually Just a T-Shirt''}}

Frusciante released his first solo album ''[[Niandra Lades and Usually Just a T-Shirt]]'', on March 8, 1994. Despite the common belief that most of the tracks were recorded while he was strung out on heroin in his home in the [[Hollywood Hills]],&lt;ref name=jfcom-niandra&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Johnfrusciante.com|url=http://www.johnfrusciante.com/music/niandra.php|title=''Niandra Lades and Usually Just a T-Shirt''|accessdate=2007-07-31 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071010131249/www.johnfrusciante.com/music/niandra.php |archivedate=2007-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frusciante has said that &quot;That album was not recorded when I was a heroin addict. It was released when I was a heroin addict.&quot; &lt;ref name=MagnetMagazine&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.magnetmagazine.com/2004/10/01/john-frusciante-perfect-from-now-on/ |title=Interview with John Frusciante (2004) |publisher=Magnetmagazine.com |date=2004-10-01 |accessdate=2010-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first half of ''Niandra Lades and Usually Just a T-Shirt'' was recorded shortly after the completion of ''Blood Sugar Sex Magik''; the second half between late 1991 and early 1992, during the album's tour.&lt;ref name=jfcom-niandra/&gt; &quot;Running Away Into You&quot; is the only track recorded after he left the Chili Peppers. The album is a heavily experimental [[avant-garde]] composition whose initial purpose was spiritual and emotional expression: &quot;I wrote [the record] because I was in a really big place in my head—it was a huge, spiritual place telling me what to do. As long as I'm obeying those forces, it's always going to be meaningful. I could be playing guitar and I could say 'Play something that sucks,' and if I'm in that place, it's gonna be great. And it has nothing to do with me, except in ways that can't be understood.&quot;&lt;ref name=warpmag&gt;{{cite web|url=http://johnfrusciante.com/articles.php#warp01|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071011180908/http://johnfrusciante.com/articles.php#warp01|archivedate=2007-10-11|title=John Frusciante|accessdate=2008-11-28|publisher=Warp}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frusciante further asserted that the album was meant to be experienced as a cohesive unit rather than separate entities or songs.&lt;ref name=warpmag/&gt; ''Niandra Lades and Usually Just a T-Shirt'' was released on Rick Rubin's label [[American Recordings (US)|American Recordings]]. [[Warner Bros. Records|Warner Bros.]], the Chili Peppers' label, owned rights to the album because of the leaving-artist clause in Frusciante's Chili Peppers contract. However, because he was reclusive, the label gladly handed the rights over to Rubin, who released the album at the urging of Frusciante's friends.&lt;ref name=&quot;pnt&quot;&gt;{{cite web| last = Wilonsky | first = Robert | url =http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/1996-12-12/music/blood-on-the-tracks/ | title = Blood on the Tracks | publisher = Phoenix New Times Music | date = December 12, 1996 | accessdate = 2007-06-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An article in the ''[[New Times LA]]'' described Frusciante as &quot;a skeleton covered in thin skin&quot; who at the nadir of his addictions nearly died from a blood infection.&lt;ref name=&quot;pnt&quot;/&gt; His arms became fiercely scarred from improperly shooting heroin and [[cocaine]], leaving permanent [[abscess]]es.&lt;ref name=rise/&gt; He spent the next three years holed up in his Hollywood Hills home, the walls of which were badly damaged and covered in graffiti.&lt;ref name=&quot;papermag&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.papermag.com/arts_and_style/2004/03/john-frusciante.php | title = Blood Sugar Sex Magic: Damaged Genius John Frusciante is Back, Again!| last = Zafiais | first = Alex| publisher = Papermag |date = March 24, 2004| accessdate = 2006-08-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, his friends [[Johnny Depp]] and [[Gibby Haynes]] went to his house and filmed an unreleased documentary short called ''[[Stuff (film)|Stuff]]'', depicting the squalor in which he was living.&lt;ref name=&quot;papermag&quot;/&gt; The house was eventually destroyed by a fire that claimed his vintage guitar collection along with several recorded tapes of music and left him with serious burns after he narrowly escaped.&lt;ref name=DiPerna&gt;Di Perna, Alan (July, 2006). &quot;Guided by Voices&quot;.

Frusciante released his second solo album, ''[[Smile from the Streets You Hold]]'', in 1997. The album's first track, &quot;Enter a Uh&quot;, was largely characterized by cryptic lyrics and hysterical screeches. Frusciante also coughs throughout the track, showcasing his deteriorating health.

In late 1997, after more than five years of addiction to heroin, Frusciante quit it [[cold turkey]].&lt;ref name=p.407&gt;Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 407&lt;/ref&gt; However, months later he was still unable to break addictions to [[crack cocaine]] and [[alcohol]].&lt;ref name=p.407/&gt; In January 1998, urged by longtime friend [[Bob Forrest]], Frusciante checked into Las Encinas, a [[drug rehabilitation]] clinic in [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]], to begin a full recovery.&lt;ref name=p.407/&gt; Upon arrival, he was diagnosed with a potentially lethal oral infection, which could only be alleviated by removing all of his teeth and replacing them with dental implants.&lt;ref name=gpm1/&gt; He also received skin grafts to help repair the abscesses on his ravaged arms.&lt;ref name=&quot;papermag&quot;/&gt; About a month later, Frusciante checked out of Las Encinas and reentered society.&lt;ref name=p.408&gt;Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 408&lt;/ref&gt;

Fully recovered and once again healthy, Frusciante began living a more spiritual, [[asceticism|ascetic]] lifestyle. He changed his diet, becoming more health-conscious and eating mostly unprocessed foods.&lt;ref name=selvaggio/&gt; Through regular practice of [[vipassana]] and [[yoga]], he discovered the effect that self-discipline has on the body.&lt;ref name=DiPerna/&gt; To maintain his increased spiritual awareness and reduce distraction from his music, Frusciante decided to [[Sexual abstinence|abstain]] from sexual activity stating: &quot;I'm very well without it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;selvaggio&quot;/&gt; All of these changes in his life have led him to a complete change in his attitude toward drugs:&lt;ref name=rsm1&gt;&quot;Water Music&quot;. ''Rock Sound'' #21&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote|I don't need to take drugs. I feel so much more high all the time right now because of the type of momentum that a person can get going when you really dedicate yourself to something that you really love. I don't even consider doing them, they're completely silly. Between my dedication to trying to constantly be a better musician and eating my health foods and doing yoga, I feel so much more high than I did for the last few years of doing drugs.

At this point I'm the happiest person in the world. These things do not fuck with me at all, and I'm so proud of that—you don't know how proud I am. It's such a beautiful thing to be able to face life, to face yourself, without hiding behind drugs; without having to have anger towards people who love you. There are people who are scared of losing stuff, but you don't lose anything for any other reason than if you just give up on yourself.}}
Despite his experience as an addict, Frusciante does not view his drug use as a &quot;dark period&quot; in his life. He considers it a period of rebirth, during which he found himself and cleared his mind.&lt;ref name=kerrang1&gt;Bryant, Tom. (May 3, 2006) &quot;War Ensemble.&quot; ''Kerrang!''&lt;/ref&gt; Frusciante has since stopped practicing yoga, due to its effects on his back, but he still tries to meditate daily.&lt;ref name=DiPerna/&gt;

In early 1998, the Red Hot Chili Peppers fired guitarist [[Dave Navarro]] and were on the verge of breaking up. Flea told Kiedis, &quot;the only way I could imagine carrying on [with the Red Hot Chili Peppers] is if we got John back in the band.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 404&lt;/ref&gt; With Frusciante free of his addictions and ailments, Kiedis and Flea thought it was an appropriate time to invite him back. When Flea visited him at his home and asked him to rejoin the band, Frusciante began sobbing and said &quot;nothing would make me happier in the world.&quot;&lt;ref name=p.408/&gt; With Frusciante back on guitar, the Chili Peppers began recording their next album, ''[[Californication (album)|Californication]]'', released in 1999. Frusciante's return restored a key component of the Chili Peppers' sound, as well as a healthy morale. He brought with him his deep devotion to music, which had an impact on the band's recording style during the album.&lt;ref name=tgm2002/&gt; Frusciante has frequently stated that his work on ''Californication'' was his favorite.&lt;ref name=tgm2002/&gt;

During the ''Californication'' world tour, Frusciante continued to compose his own songs, many of which would be released in 2001 on his third solo album ''[[To Record Only Water for Ten Days]]''. The album was stylistically unlike his previous records, less markedly [[Stream of consciousness writing|stream-of-consciousness]] or [[avant-garde]]. However, the lyrics were still very cryptic and its sound was notably stripped down.&lt;ref name=Chonin&gt;{{cite web| title=''To Record Only Water for Ten Days'' review |author=Chonin, Neva|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/johnfrusciante/albums/album/103023/review/5942707/to_record_only_water_for_ten_days|date=February 5, 2001|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090525091015/http://rollingstone.com/artists/johnfrusciante/albums/album/103023/review/5942707/to_record_only_water_for_ten_days|archivedate=2009-05-25|publisher = Rolling Stone}}&lt;/ref&gt; The songwriting and production of ''To Record Only Water for Ten Days'' were more efficient and straightforward than on his previous recordings.&lt;ref name=Chonin/&gt; The album strayed from the alternative rock he had just written with the Chili Peppers on ''Californication'', focusing more on [[electronica|electronic]] and [[New Wave music|New Wave]] elements.&lt;ref name=TROWFTD&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Johnfrusciante.com|url=http://www.johnfrusciante.com/music/ten_days.php|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071017023538/http://www.johnfrusciante.com/music/ten_days.php|archivedate=2007-10-17|title=''To Record only Water for Ten Days''|date=February 13, 2001|accessdate=2009-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to his guitar work, Frusciante experimented with a variety of synthesizers, a distinctive feature of the record.&lt;ref name=TROWFTD/&gt;

In 2001, Frusciante began recording his fourth album with Red Hot Chili Peppers, ''[[By the Way]]'' (2002); he considered the time to be among the happiest in his life.&lt;ref name=tgm2002/&gt; He relished the chance the album gave him to &quot;keep writing better songs&quot;.&lt;ref name=tgm2002/&gt; While working on ''By the Way'', he also composed most of what would become ''[[Shadows Collide with People]]'', as well as the songs created for the movie ''[[The Brown Bunny]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Guitar World Acoustic, February/March 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; His goal to improve his guitar playing on the album was largely driven by a desire to emulate guitar players such as [[Andy Partridge]], [[Johnny Marr]] and [[John McGeoch]]; or as he put it, &quot;people who used good chords&quot;.&lt;ref name=tgm2002/&gt; The album marked Frusciante's shift to a more group-minded mentality within the Chili Peppers, viewing the band as a cohesive unit rather than as four separate entities.&lt;ref name=tgm2002/&gt;

===2002–2007: 2004 recordings and ''Stadium Arcadium''===
Frusciante wrote and recorded a plethora of songs during and after the ''By the Way'' tour. In February 2004, he started a side project with [[Joe Lally]] of [[Fugazi (band)|Fugazi]] and [[Josh Klinghoffer]], called [[Ataxia (band)|Ataxia]]. The group was together for about two weeks, during which they recorded about ninety minutes of material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Johnfrusciante.com|url=http://www.johnfrusciante.com/news.php|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071019051807/http://www.johnfrusciante.com/news.php|archivedate=2007-10-19|title=Ataxia II is due out on May 29th 2007!|date=March 16, 2005|accessdate=2009-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ataxia&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Johnfrusciante.com|url=http://www.johnfrusciante.com/music/automatic_writing.php|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071023070925/http://www.johnfrusciante.com/music/automatic_writing.php|archivedate=2007-10-23|title=ATAXIA – ''Automatic Writing''|date=June 10, 2004|accessdate=2007-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; After two days in the recording studio, they played two shows at the [[Knitting Factory]] in Hollywood, and spent two more days in the studio before disbanding.&lt;ref name=ataxia/&gt; Later that year, five songs provided by Frusciante appeared on ''[[The Brown Bunny (soundtrack)|The Brown Bunny]]'' soundtrack.&lt;ref&gt;''The Brown Bunny soundtrack'' liner notes.&lt;/ref&gt;

Frusciante released his fourth full-length solo album ''[[Shadows Collide with People]]'' on February 24, 2004. This featured guest appearances from some of his friends, including Klinghoffer, and Chili Peppers bandmates Smith and Flea.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shadows&quot;&gt;''Shadows Collide with People'' liner notes&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2004, he announced that he would be releasing six records over six months:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/news/upcoming_releases/frusciante_prepares_a_feast.html |title=Frusciante Prepares a Feast |author=Devenish, Colin|date=2004-06-30 |work= |publisher=Ultimate Guitar |accessdate=2011-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Will to Death]]'', Ataxia's ''[[Automatic Writing (album)|Automatic Writing]]'', ''[[DC EP]]'', ''[[Inside of Emptiness]]'', ''[[A Sphere in the Heart of Silence]]'' and ''[[Curtains (John Frusciante album)|Curtains]]''. With the release of ''Curtains'' Frusciante debuted his only music video of 2004, for the track &quot;The Past Recedes&quot;. He wanted to produce these records quickly and inexpensively on analog tape, avoiding modern studio and computer-assisted recording processes.&lt;ref name=law1&gt;Payne, John.

I made a list of all the songs I had and they totaled about seventy. My objective was to record as many songs as I could during the break that I had. In the midst of doing that, I was writing some of my best songs, so some of these albums have as many new songs as old songs.

In early 2005, Frusciante entered the studio to work on his fifth and final studio album with the Chili Peppers, ''[[Stadium Arcadium]]''. His guitar playing is dominant throughout the album, and he provides backing vocals on most of the tracks.

He worked continuously with Rubin over-dubbing guitar progressions, changing harmonies and using all his technical resources.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guitar Player&quot;/&gt;

Frusciante began a series of collaborations with friend [[Omar Rodríguez-López]] and his band [[The Mars Volta]], by contributing guitar and electronic instrumentation to song &quot;Cicatriz ESP&quot; off their album ''[[De-Loused in the Comatorium]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''De-Loused in the Comatorium'' liner notes&lt;/ref&gt; He also contributed guitar solos on their 2005 album ''[[Frances the Mute]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Frances the Mute'' liner notes&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, he helped The Mars Volta complete their third album ''[[Amputechture]]'' by playing guitar on seven of its eight tracks.&lt;ref&gt;''Amputechture'' liner notes&lt;/ref&gt; In return, Rodriguez-Lopez has played on several of Frusciante's solo albums, as well as making a guest appearance on ''Stadium Arcadium''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shadows&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Curtains'' liner notes&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Stadium Arcadium'' liner notes&lt;/ref&gt;

===2007–present: Red Hot Chili Peppers departure, ''The Empyrean'' and further collaborations===
Ataxia released its second and final studio album, ''[[AW II]]'' in 2007. Following the ''Stadium Arcadium'' tour (early May 2006 to late August 2007), the Red Hot Chili Peppers agreed to a hiatus of indefinite length.&lt;ref name=rshiatusak&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/q-a-anthony-kiedis-20080519 |title=Q&amp;A: Anthony Kiedis: Rolling Stone |accessdate=2008-05-22 |last=Anderson |first=Kyle |date=2008-05-19 |publisher=Rolling Stone}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2008, Anthony Kiedis finally confirmed this, citing exhaustion from constant work since ''Californication'' as the main reason.&lt;ref name=rshiatusak/&gt;  Frusciante quit the group during this period, but did not publicly announce his departure until December 2009, two months after the band ended their hiatus in October 2009 and began work on their next album with Josh Klinghoffer as their new guitarist.&lt;ref&gt;http://download.wbr.com/rhcp/RHCP_rs.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2009/12/17/john-frusciante-quits-red-hot-chili-peppers-with-no-drama/ | title=John Frusciante Quits Red Hot Chili Peppers With &quot;No Drama&quot; |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100105185126/http://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2009/12/17/john-frusciante-quits-red-hot-chili-peppers-with-no-drama/|archivedate=2010-01-05|accessdate=2009-12-18 |last=Kreps |first=Daniel |date=2009-12-17 |publisher=Rolling Stone}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frusciante stated: &quot;I'm really happy with [the record] and I've listened to it a lot for the psychedelic experience it provides,&quot; suggesting the album is &quot;to be played as loud as possible and is suited to dark living rooms late at night.&quot;&lt;ref name=rhcpemp/&gt;

After the release of ''The Empyrean'', Frusciante continued to collaborate with other artists. Along with continuing to provide guitar work to The Mars Volta's studio albums, ''[[The Bedlam In Goliath]]'', and ''[[Octahedron (album)|Octahedron]]'', Frusciante also began an electronic trio with [[Aaron Funk]] and Chris McDonald under the name Speed Dealer Moms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.factmag.com/2009/01/07/speed-dealer-moms/ |title=Speed Dealer Moms… – FACT magazine: music and art |publisher=Factmag.com |date=2009-01-07 |accessdate=2010-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://74.6.146.127/search/cache?ei=UTF-8&amp;p=speed+dealer+moms&amp;fr=moz35&amp;u=www.invisible-movement.net/works/projects/speed-dealer-moms&amp;w=speed+speeding+dealer+dealers+moms&amp;d=d1Gqkd29UJGn&amp;icp=1&amp;.intl=us&amp;sig=Kwpgac.7OSpZr4d2vjql.Q-- |title=Speed Dealer Moms &amp;#124; John Frusciante unofficial website â Invisible Movement |publisher=74.6.146.127 |date= |accessdate=2010-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their first EP was released in December 2010 on [[Planet Mu Records]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=FINALLY!

In 2012 John Frusciante is releasing a new album. [[Truth Hurts]] has posted a video with her in the studio with him. [[RZA]] has also mentioned him on his twitter.

In March 2012, Frusciante declined to be present for the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]]' induction into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in April. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/news/general_music_news/john_frusciante_declines_hall_of_fame_invite.html&lt;/ref&gt; 

In an interview with Blare Magazine [[Omar Rodriguez-Lopez]], when asked about possible future collaborations with John, stated: &quot;Maybe in the future, but John’s in a different place right now. He’s in a place where he couldn’t care less about putting things out or about something being a product. He’s living by different standards right now with a different philosophy, so he doesn’t want to be a part of anything that he knows is going to end up being a product.

All the guitars that he owns, records, and tours with were made before 1970.&lt;ref name=cantstopmaking&gt;Making of &quot;Can't Stop&quot; music video. Red Hot Chili Peppers ''Greatest Hits''.&lt;/ref&gt; Frusciante will use the specific guitar that he finds appropriate for a certain song. All of the guitars he owned before quitting the band were destroyed when his house burned down in 1996.&lt;ref name=guitaristmag&gt;Ascott, Phil (June, 2003). &quot;Universally Speaking&quot;. ''[[Guitarist (magazine)|Guitarist]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; The first guitar he bought after rejoining the Chili Peppers was a 1962 red [[Fender Jaguar]].&lt;ref name=guitaristmag/&gt; His most-often used guitar, however, is a 1962 Sunburst [[Fender Stratocaster]] which he has played on every album since joining the Chili Peppers, and their ensuing tours.&lt;ref name=guitaristmag/&gt;&lt;ref name=guitarx&gt;&quot;Interview with John Frusciante&quot;. ''Guitar Xtreme'', June 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Frusciante's most prized instrument is a 1957 [[Gretsch White Falcon]], which he used twice per show during the ''By the Way'' tour. He has since stopped using it, saying there was &quot;no room for it&quot;.&lt;ref name=guitarx/&gt; Virtually all of Frusciante's acoustic work is played with a 1950s [[C. F. Martin &amp; Company|Martin]] 0–15.&lt;ref name=guitaristmag/&gt;&lt;ref name=gpsainterview&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guitarplayer.com/article/red-hot-chili/sep-06/23160|title=Red Hot Chili Peppers' John Frusciante|author=Cleveland, Barry|month=September | year=2006|publisher=Guitar Player|accessdate=2008-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frusciante uses a variety of vocal styles on his solo albums, ranging from the distressed screeches on ''Niandra Lades and Usually Just a T-Shirt'' and ''Smile from the Streets You Hold'' to more conventional styles on later records.&lt;ref name=stylusSCWP&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stylusmagazine.com/review.php?ID=1748&amp;PHPSESSID=575b6a2a9b7d580e58a060316e0673f1|author=McKeating, Scott|title=''Shadows Collide With People'' Album Review|date=February 23, 2004|accessdate=2007-08-27|publisher=Stylus Magazine| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071229021504/http://www.stylusmagazine.com/review.php?ID=1748&amp;PHPSESSID=575b6a2a9b7d580e58a060316e0673f1| archivedate = December 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the Chili Peppers, Frusciante provided backing vocals in a [[falsetto]] tenor, a style he started on ''Blood Sugar Sex Magik''. He thoroughly enjoyed his role in the Chili Peppers as backup singer, and said that backing vocals are a &quot;real art form&quot;.&lt;ref name=radio&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.locborg.de/fru/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=806&amp;Itemid=124|author=|title=Radio interview|date=April 3, 2004|accessdate=2007-09-02|publisher=}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his commitment to the Chili Peppers, he felt that his work with the band should remain separate from his solo projects. When he returned to the Chili Peppers in 1998, Kiedis wanted the band to record &quot;Living in Hell&quot;, a song Frusciante had written several years before. Frusciante refused, feeling that the creative freedom he needs for his solo projects would conflict with his role in the band.&lt;ref name=radio/&gt;

===Technique===
Frusciante's guitar playing employs emphasis on phrasing rather than virtuosity. Although virtuoso influences can be heard throughout his career, he has said that he often minimizes this.&lt;ref name=Kerrangspain&gt;''Kerrang!'' Issue #21; pp. 76–82&lt;/ref&gt; He feels that in general, guitar mastery has not evolved much since the 1960s and considers the greatest players of that decade unsurpassed.&lt;ref name=Kerrangspain/&gt; When he was growing up in the 1980s, many mainstream guitarists focused on speed. Because of this, he thinks that the skills of many defiant New Wave and punk guitarists were largely overlooked.&lt;ref name=&quot;tgm2002&quot;/&gt; Therefore he accentuates the melodically-driven technique of players such as [[Matthew Ashman]] of [[Bow Wow Wow]] and [[Bernard Sumner]] of [[Joy Division]] as much as possible because he thinks that their style has been overlooked and consequently underexplored.&lt;ref name=&quot;tgm2002&quot;/&gt; Despite this, he considers himself a fan of technique-driven guitarists like [[Randy Rhoads]] and [[Steve Vai]], but represses an urge to emulate their style: &quot;People believe that by playing faster and creating new playing techniques you can progress forward, but then they realize that emotionally they don't progress at all. They transmit nothing to the people listening and they stay at where Hendrix was three decades ago. Something like that happened to Vai in the 80s.&quot;&lt;ref name=Kerrangspain/&gt; Believing that focusing only on &quot;clean tones&quot; is negative, Frusciante developed an interest in playing with what he calls a &quot;grimy&quot; sound. As a result, he considers it beneficial to &quot;mistreat&quot; his guitar and employ various forms of distortion when soloing.&lt;ref name=Kerrangspain/&gt; He also tries to break as many &quot;stylistic boundaries&quot; as he can to expand his musical horizons. He thinks that much of the output from today's guitarists is unoriginal, and that many of his contemporaries &quot;follow the rules with no risk&quot;.&lt;ref name=Kerrangspain/&gt;

Frusciante's approach to album composition has changed. On his early recordings, he welcomed sonic imperfections, noting that &quot;even on [''To Record Only Water for Ten Days''] there are off-pitch vocals and out-of-tune guitars.&quot;&lt;ref name=guitarplayer2006/&gt; However, on later albums such as ''Shadows Collide With People'', he pursued the opposite: &quot;I just wanted everything to be perfect—I didn't want anything off pitch, or off time, or any unintentional this or that.&quot;&lt;ref name=guitarplayer2006&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guitarplayer.com/article/exclusive-outtakes-from/Sep-06/23282|author=Cleveland, Barry|title=''Exclusive Outtakes from GP's Interview with John Frusciante!''|month=November | year=2006|accessdate=2007-08-27|publisher=Guitar Player}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frusciante views songwriting as taking time, and does not force it: &quot;If a song wants to come to me, I'm always ready to receive it, but I don't work at it.&quot;&lt;ref name=selvaggio/&gt; Much of his solo material is first written on an acoustic or unamplified electric guitar.&lt;ref name=Acoustic&gt;Di Perna, Alan. (April, 2005). &quot;Basic Instinct&quot;. ''Guitar World Acoustic''.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;&quot;Me and My Friends&quot;. ''Austin Chronicle''.&lt;/ref&gt; He also prefers to record his albums on analog tapes and other relatively primitive equipment.&lt;ref name=electronic&gt;Tingen, Paul. (July, 2004). &quot;John Frusciante's Creative Explosion&quot;. ''Electronic Musician''.&lt;/ref&gt; This preference stems from his belief that older equipment can actually speed up the recording process, and that modern computerized recording technology gives only an illusion of efficiency.&lt;ref name=law1/&gt; Frusciante tries to streamline the recording process as much as possible, because he thinks &quot;music comes alive when [you] are creating it fast&quot;. He also enjoys the challenge of having to record something in very few takes, and believes that when musicians are unable to handle the pressure of having to record something quickly they often get frustrated or bogged down by perfectionism.&lt;ref name=electronic/&gt;

===Influences===
Although Jimi Hendrix and Hillel Slovak were arguably Frusciante's most profound influences, he was also inspired by [[glam rock]] artists [[David Bowie]] and [[T. Rex (band)|T. Rex]] as well as avant-garde acts like [[Captain Beefheart]], [[The Residents]], [[The Velvet Underground]], [[Neu!]], [[Frank Zappa]] and [[Kraftwerk]].&lt;ref name=gpm1/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kramer&quot;/&gt; He credits his inspiration for learning guitar to [[Greg Ginn]], [[Pat Smear]], [[Joe Strummer]] and [[David Gilmour]], among others.&lt;ref name=fricke/&gt; As an adolescent, he began focusing on Hendrix and [[Led Zeppelin]], as well as other bands like [[Public Image Ltd.]], [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]] and [[The Smiths]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Kramer&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;tgm2002&quot;/&gt; During the recording of ''Blood Sugar Sex Magik'', Captain Beefheart and the acoustic, one-man blues of [[Leadbelly]] and [[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson]], were among the most noteworthy influences.&lt;ref name=MOJO&gt;Page, Scarlet (July, 2004). &quot;Red Hot Chili Peppers: The LA Punks Who Defied Death, Grunge And A Burning Crack Den&quot;. ''Mojo''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, Ed. &quot;Robert Johnson – King of the Delta Blues Singers&quot;. ''Total Guitar''. February 2006. p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; On ''Californication'' and ''By the Way'', Frusciante derived the technique of creating tonal texture through chord patterns from [[post-punk]] guitarist [[Vini Reilly]] of [[The Durutti Column]], and bands such as [[Fugazi (band)|Fugazi]] and [[The Cure]].&lt;ref name=&quot;tgm2002&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=MOJO/&gt; He originally intended ''By the Way'' to be made up of &quot;these punky, rough songs&quot;, drawing inspiration from early punk artists such as The Germs and [[The Damned (band)|The Damned]]. However, this was discouraged by producer Rick Rubin, and he instead built upon ''Californication'''s melodically-driven style.&lt;ref&gt;Apter, 2004. p. 329&lt;/ref&gt; During the recording of ''Stadium Arcadium'', he moved away from his New Wave influences and concentrated on emulating flashier guitar players such as Jimi Hendrix and Eddie Van Halen.&lt;ref name=interview2006/&gt; With his recent solo work, he has cited [[electronic music]]—in which the guitar is often completely absent—as an influence. His electronic music influences include [[Depeche Mode]], [[New Order]], [[The Human League]], [[Ekkehard Ehlers]], [[Peter Rehberg]] and [[Christian Fennesz]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Kramer&quot;/&gt; His interests are constantly changing, as he believes that without change he will no longer have any interest in playing: &quot;I'm always drawing inspiration from different kinds of music and playing guitar along with records, and I go into each new album project with a preconceived idea of what styles I want to combine.&quot;&lt;ref name=guitarplayer2006/&gt;
