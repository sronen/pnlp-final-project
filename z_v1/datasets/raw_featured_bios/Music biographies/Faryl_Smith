'''Faryl Smith''' (born 23 July 1995) is a British teen [[mezzo-soprano]] who rose to fame after appearing on the second series of the [[ITV]] television talent show ''[[Britain's Got Talent]]'' in 2008. She received praise throughout the competition, and although the favourite to win after the second round, she finished outside the top three in the live final on 31 May. During the competition, she was tutored by singing coach [[Yvie Burnett]] and received offers from various record labels. After the show, she, unlike other finalists, did not sign with [[Simon Cowell]]'s [[Syco]], although she did appear on fellow finalist [[Andrew Johnston (singer)|Andrew Johnston]]'s debut album, ''[[One Voice (Andrew Johnston album)|One Voice]]''.

Smith signed a contract with [[Universal Classics and Jazz]] for a £2.3 million advance in December 2008, the largest ever granted to a schoolgirl. Her debut album, ''[[Faryl]]'', was recorded from December 2008 to January 2009 and released in March 2009. ''Faryl'' became the fastest-selling solo classical album in British chart history, selling 29,200 copies in the first week. It debuted at number six, but rose to number four in the following week, making Smith the third ''Britain's Got Talent'' contestant to have a top ten album. In 2010, on account of ''Faryl'', Smith was nominated for two Classical BRIT Awards and became the youngest artist ever to receive a double nomination.

Smith's second album, ''[[Wonderland (Faryl Smith album)|Wonderland]]'', was released in November 2009. A concept album based on ''[[Alice in Wonderland]]'', the album was well received by critics, but was not successful in the charts. In addition releasing her albums, she featured on a charity cover of &quot;[[The Prayer (Celine Dion and Andrea Bocelli song)|The Prayer]]&quot;, released in March 2010, and has performed at numerous events, including the 2009 [[Royal Variety Performance]]. Smith lives with her parents in Kettering, where she attends Southfield School for Girls.

{{main|Wonderland (Faryl Smith album)}}
In July 2009 it was announced that Smith was hoping to release her second album later in the year. In an interview, she expressed surprise and pleasure that the label wanted her to do another album so soon after the first.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Faryl gets ready for second album|url= http://www.northamptonchron.co.uk/news/Faryl-gets-ready-for-second.5453881.jp|publisher= ''[[Northampton Chronicle &amp; Echo]]''|date= 13 July 2009|accessdate=13 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September, further details about the album were released, including its name, ''Wonderland'', and planned release date, 30 November. Smith claimed that ''Faryl'' &quot;was an introduction to me and an introduction for me to recording&quot;, while Cohen, producer of both ''Faryl'' and ''Wonderland'', said Smith had &quot;matured as an artist since the first album and I have no doubt that once again, people will be astonished and moved by her performances&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Faryl Smith to release Christmas album|newspaper= [[Northamptonshire Evening Telegraph]]|date= 26 September 2009|url= http://www.northantset.co.uk/news/Faryl-Smith-to-release-Christmas.5680978.jp|accessdate=15 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album, which was recorded at [[Sarm Studios]] in [[Notting Hill]], London, was completed in early October,&lt;ref name=&quot;Take That&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title= Take That star's good luck wishes to singer Faryl|author= Cleaver, Monique|newspaper= [[Northamptonshire Evening Telegraph]]|date= 8 October 2009|url= http://www.northantset.co.uk/news/Take-That-star39s-good-luck.5713626.jp|accessdate=15 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is loosely based on [[Lewis Carroll]]'s ''[[Alice in Wonderland]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jackson&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title= A Wonderland that's Faryl|author= Jackson, David|newspaper= [[Northamptonshire Evening Telegraph]]|date= 19 November 2009|url= http://www.northantset.co.uk/news/A-Wonderland-that39s-Faryl.5837595.jp|accessdate=14 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Wonderland'' was released on 30 November.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goodjohn&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title= A Wonderland of stardom for Faryl|author= Goodjohn, Bernie|newspaper= [[Northamptonshire Evening Telegraph]]|date= 30 November 2009|url= http://www.northantset.co.uk/news/A-Wonderland-of-stardom-for.5867816.jp|accessdate=19 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; To publicise the album, Smith appeared on numerous radio shows, as well as television appearances including ''[[Ready Steady Cook]]'', ''[[Blue Peter]]'', the [[BBC News Channel]], ''[[The Alan Titchmarsh Show]]'' and ''[[Sky News Sunrise]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goodjohn&quot;/&gt;

''Wonderland'' was well received by critics; Paul Callan, reviewing the album for the ''Daily Express'', described it as &quot;a joy&quot;. He compared it to other Christmas albums, saying that &quot;[t]oo many are tired, much-repeated carol selections.&quot; He described Smith's &quot;control, tone and warmth&quot; as &quot;very moving&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Album reviews|author= Callan, Paul|newspaper= [[Daily Express]]|date= 11 December 2009|page= 54}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andy Gill, reviewing ''Wonderland'' for ''[[The Independent]]'', gave a less positive review. He said that the influence of ''Alice in Wonderland'' was often hard to perceive and that Cohen and Smith had &quot;sweetened the classical elements&quot;. However, he praised the arrangements of &quot;Adiemus&quot;, &quot;Barcarolle&quot;, &quot;Merry Christmas, Mr Lawrence&quot; and &quot;Blow The Wind Southerly&quot;, but noted that on tracks including &quot;Close To You&quot;, &quot;the lack of emotional weight is telling.&quot; Overall, Gill gave ''Wonderland'' 3 out of 5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Album: Faryl, Wonderland (Decca)|author= Gill, Andy|url= http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/classical/reviews/album-faryl-wonderland-decca-1828334.html|newspaper= [[The Independent]]|date= 27 November 2009|accessdate=11 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the album failed to perform as well as ''Faryl'', appearing on the top 75 of the UK Albums Chart for only one week, and peaked at 54th place.&lt;ref name=&quot;occ&quot;/&gt;

Smith performed at the 2009 [[Royal Variety Performance]] in front of [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]], where she sang &quot;God Save the Queen&quot; with [[The Soldiers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Blackpool Royal Variety performers entertain Queen|publisher= [[BBC]]|date= 8 December 2009|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/lancashire/8398060.stm|accessdate=19 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; She later said that the experience, including subsequently meeting the Queen, as the highlight of her year.&lt;ref name=&quot;thanks&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title= Faryl thanks fans for all of their support|author= Jackson, David|newspaper= [[Northamptonshire Evening Telegraph]]|date= 18 December 2009|url= http://www.northantset.co.uk/news/Faryl-thanks-fans-for-all.5923622.jp|accessdate=19 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith also performed elsewhere with The Soldiers, including at [[St Paul's Cathedral]] and [[Great Ormond Street Children's Hospital]].&lt;ref name=&quot;thanks&quot;/&gt;
