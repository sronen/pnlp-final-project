'''Nancy Cartwright''' (born October 25, 1957) is an American film and television actress, comedian and [[Voice acting|voice artist]]. She is best known for her long-running role as [[Bart Simpson]] on the animated television series ''[[The Simpsons]]''. Cartwright voices other characters for the show, including [[Nelson Muntz]], [[Ralph Wiggum]], [[List of recurring The Simpsons characters#Todd Flanders|Todd Flanders]], [[List of recurring The Simpsons characters#Kearney Zzyzwicz|Kearney]], and [[List of recurring The Simpsons characters#Database|Database]].

Born in [[Dayton, Ohio]], Cartwright moved to Hollywood in 1978 and trained alongside voice actor [[Daws Butler]]. Her first professional role was voicing Gloria in the animated series ''[[Richie Rich (1980 TV series)|Richie Rich]]'', which she followed with a starring role in the television movie ''Marian Rose White'' (1982) and her first feature film, ''[[Twilight Zone: The Movie]]'' (1983).

After continuing to search for acting work, in 1987 Cartwright auditioned for a role in [[The Simpsons shorts|a series of animated shorts]] about a [[dysfunctional family]] that was to appear on ''[[The Tracey Ullman Show]]''. Cartwright intended to audition for the role of [[Lisa Simpson]], the middle child; when she arrived at the audition, she found the role of Bart—Lisa's brother—to be more interesting. [[Matt Groening]], the series' creator, allowed her to audition for Bart and offered her the role on the spot. She voiced Bart for three seasons on ''The Tracey Ullman Show'', and in 1989, the shorts were spun off into a half-hour show called ''[[The Simpsons]]''. For her subsequent work as Bart, Cartwright received a [[Primetime Emmy Award]] for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance|Outstanding Voice-Over Performance]] in 1992 and an [[Annie Award]] for Best Voice Acting in the Field of Animation in 1995.

Cartwright has voiced dozens of animated characters, including [[Chuckie Finster]] in ''[[Rugrats]]'' and ''[[All Grown Up!]]'', [[List of characters in Kim Possible#Rufus|Rufus]] in ''[[Kim Possible]]'', [[Buttons and Mindy|Mindy]] in ''[[Animaniacs]]'', Margo Sherman in ''[[The Critic]]'' and Chip in ''The Kellys''. In 2000, she published her autobiography, ''[[My Life as a 10-Year-Old Boy]]'', and four years later adapted it into a [[One person show|one-woman play]].

==Early life==
Nancy Cartwright was born in Dayton, Ohio,&lt;ref name=&quot;Little&quot;/&gt; on October 25, 1957, the fourth of Frank and Miriam Cartwright's six children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nancycartwright.com/html/about/bio.html|title=Biography highlights|publisher=Nancycartwright.com|accessdate=2009-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; She grew up in [[Kettering, Ohio]],&lt;ref name=Cincinatti/&gt; and discovered her talent for voices at an early age. While in the [[fourth grade]], she won a school-wide speech competition with her performance of [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s ''[[Just So Stories|How the Camel Got His Hump]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eat my shorts&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Nancy Cartwright: Eat my shorts|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre-dance/features/nancy-cartwright-eat-my-shorts-491916.html|date=2005-05-24|work=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=2009-02-06 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cartwright attended [[Fairmont High School (Ohio)|Fairmont West High School]], and participated in the school's theater and marching band. She regularly entered public speaking competitions, placing first in the &quot;Humorous Interpretation&quot; category at the National District Tournament two years running. The judges often suggested to her that she should perform cartoon voices. Cartwright graduated from high school in 1976 and accepted a scholarship from [[Ohio University]].&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright, pp. 9–10.&lt;/ref&gt; She continued to compete in public speaking competitions; during her sophomore year, she placed fifth in the National Speech Tournament's exposition category with her speech &quot;The Art of Animation&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright, pp. 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976, Cartwright landed a part-time job doing voice-overs for commercials on [[WING]] radio in Dayton.&lt;ref name=Cincinatti&gt;{{Cite web|title=Bart Simpson's secrets revealed |url=http://www.enquirer.com/editions/2000/12/18/tem_kiesewetter_bart.html|author=Kieswetter, John|work=[[The Cincinnati Enquirer]]|date=2000, 12-18|accessdate=2009-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; A representative from [[Warner Bros. Records]] visited WING and later sent Cartwright a list of contacts in the animation industry.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright, pp. 12–13.&lt;/ref&gt; One of these was [[Daws Butler]], known for voicing characters such as [[Huckleberry Hound]], [[Snagglepuss]], [[The Jetsons|Elroy Jetson]] and [[Yogi Bear]]. Cartwright called him, and left a message in a Cockney accent on his answering machine.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eat my shorts&quot;/&gt; Butler immediately called her back and agreed to be her mentor. He mailed her a script and instructed her to send him a tape recording of herself reading it. Once he received the tape, Butler critiqued it and sent her notes. For the next year they continued in this way, completing a new script every few weeks. Cartwright described Butler as &quot;absolutely amazing, always encouraging, always polite&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cartwright returned to [[Ohio University]] for her sophomore year, but transferred to the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (UCLA) so she could be closer to Hollywood and Butler.&lt;ref name=Cincinatti/&gt; Her mother, Miriam, died late in the summer of 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Just don't call me Bart|work=[[Scotland on Sunday]]|date=2000-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cartwright nearly changed her relocation plans but, on September 17, 1978, &quot;joylessly&quot; left for [[Westwood, Los Angeles, California|Westwood]], [[Los Angeles]].&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright, pp. 16–18.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early career===
[[File:Daws Butler (1976).jpg|right|thumb|[[Daws Butler]] was Cartwright's mentor and helped her become a voice actor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Edinburgh&quot;/&gt;]]
While attending UCLA, which did not have a public speaking team,&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Cartwright continued training as a voice actor with Butler. She recalled, &quot;every Sunday I’d take a 20-minute bus ride to his house in [[Beverly Hills, California|Beverly Hills]] for a one-hour lesson and be there for four hours&amp;nbsp;...

After she met the director [[Gordon Hunt (director)|Gordon Hunt]], he asked her to audition for a recurring role as Gloria in ''[[Richie Rich (1980 TV series)|Richie Rich]]''. She received the part, and later worked with Hunt on several other projects. At the end of 1980, Cartwright signed with a talent agency and landed a lead role in a pilot for a [[situation comedy|sitcom]] called ''In Trouble''. Cartwright described the show as &quot;forgettable, but it jump-started my on-camera career&quot;.&lt;ref name=p25&gt;Cartwright, pp. 23–25.&lt;/ref&gt; She graduated from UCLA in 1981 with a degree in theater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=12253984|title=Cartwright: It's Bearable Being Bart's Likeness|accessdate=2007-07-26|author=Terry Gross Interview on &quot;Fresh Air&quot; (Interview confirms transfer to UCLA)|date=2007-07-26|publisher=[[National Public Radio]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the summer, Cartwright worked with [[Jonathan Winters]] as part of an improvisation troupe at [[Kenyon College]] in [[Gambier, Ohio]].&lt;ref name=p25/&gt;

Returning to [[Los Angeles]], Cartwright won the lead role in the television movie ''Marian Rose White''. [[Janet Maslin]], a critic for ''[[The New York Times]]'', described Cartwright as &quot;a chubby, lumbering, slightly [[Strabismus|cross-eyed]] actress whose naturalness adds greatly to the film's impact&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0DE1D81138F93AA25752C0A964948260|title=TV: 'Marian Rose White' in a mental institution|author=Maslin, Janet|authorlink=Janet Maslin|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=1982-01-19|accessdate=2009-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cartwright replied by sending Maslin a letter insisting she was not cross-eyed, and included a photograph.&lt;ref name=&quot;bartisagoodgirl&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|title=Bart is a good girl at heart; the mischievous little boy, who brings his iconoclastic status to the big screen, is really a middle aged woman|work=[[Guelph Mercury]]|date=2007-07-26|author=New York Times News Service}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Cartwright auditioned for the role of Ethel, a girl who becomes trapped in a cartoon world in the third segment of ''[[Twilight Zone: The Movie]]''. She met with director [[Joe Dante]] and later described him as &quot;a total cartoon buff, and once he took a look at my resume and noticed Daws Butler's name on it, we were off and running, sharing anecdotes about Daws and animation. After about twenty minutes, he said, 'considering your background, I don't see how I could cast anyone ''but'' you in this part!{{' &quot;}}&lt;ref name=&quot;p27&quot;/&gt; It was her first role in a feature film.&lt;ref name=&quot;p27&quot;&gt;Cartwright, pp. 26–27.&lt;/ref&gt; The segment was based on ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'' television series episode &quot;[[It's a Good Life (The Twilight Zone)|It's a Good Life]]&quot;, which was later parodied in ''The Simpsons'' episode &quot;[[Treehouse of Horror II]]&quot; (1992).&lt;ref&gt;Groening, Matt; [[Al Jean|Jean, Al]]; [[Mike Reiss|Reiss, Mike]]; [[Dan Castellaneta|Castellaneta, Dan]]; [[Jeff Martin (writer)|Martin, Jeff]]; [[Jim Reardon|Reardon, Jim]].

Cartwright continued to do voice work for projects including ''[[Pound Puppies]]'', ''[[Popeye and Son]]'', ''[[Snorks]]'', ''[[My Little Pony (TV series)|My Little Pony]]'' and ''[[Saturday Supercade]]''.&lt;ref name=p28&gt;Cartwright, pp. 27–28.&lt;/ref&gt; She joined a &quot;[[Dubbing (filmmaking)|loop group]]&quot;, and recorded vocals for characters in the background of films, although in most cases the sound was turned down so that very little of her voice was heard. She did minor voice-over work for several films, including ''[[The Clan of the Cave Bear (film)|The Clan of the Cave Bear]]'' (1986), ''[[Silverado (film)|Silverado]]'' (1985), ''[[Sixteen Candles]]'' (1984), ''[[Back to the Future 2]]'' (1989) and ''[[The Color Purple (film)|The Color Purple]]'' (1985).&lt;ref name=p29&gt;Cartwright, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; The most notable of these was a role in ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'' (1988) as a shoe that was &quot;dipped&quot; in acid. She described it as her first &quot;off-screen death scene&quot;,&lt;ref name=p29/&gt; and worked to correctly convey the emotion involved.&lt;ref name=&quot;My Boy&quot;/&gt;

{{Quote box |width=30em | bgcolor=transparent |align=left|quote=Once I had graduated from UCLA, I decided that as long as I was an actress, I was going to find related work in the industry.

In 1985, she auditioned for a guest spot as Cynthia in ''[[Cheers]]''. The audition called for her to say her line and walk off the set. Cartwright decided to take a chance on being different and continued walking, leaving the building and returning home. The production crew was confused, but she received the part.&lt;ref name=p29/&gt; In search of more training as an actor, Cartwright joined a class taught by Hollywood coach [[Milton Katselas]]. He recommended that Cartwright study ''[[La strada]]'', a 1956 Italian film starring [[Giulietta Masina]] and directed by [[Federico Fellini]]. She began performing &quot;every imaginable scene&quot; from ''La strada'' in her class and spent several months trying to secure the rights to produce a stage adaptation.&lt;ref name=&quot;p30&quot;/&gt; She visited Italy with the intention of meeting Fellini and requesting his permission in person. Although they never met, Cartwright kept a journal of the trip and later wrote a one-woman play called ''In Search of Fellini'', partially based on her voyage.&lt;ref name=&quot;p30&quot;&gt;Cartwright, pp. 30–33.&lt;/ref&gt; The play was co-written by Peter Kjenaas, and Cartwright won a [[Drama-Logue Award]] after performing it in Los Angeles in 1995. In a 1998 interview, she stated her intention to make it into a feature film.&lt;ref name=&quot;Logue&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|title=Voicing her ambitions - The Kettering native stretches her wings - from the sounds of Bart Simpson to producing films |work=[[Dayton Daily News]]|author=Hopkins, Tom|date=1998-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cartwright is best known for her role as [[Bart Simpson]] on the long-running animated television show ''[[The Simpsons]]''. On March 13, 1987, Nancy Cartwright auditioned for a series of animated shorts about a dysfunctional family that was to appear on ''[[The Tracey Ullman Show]]'', a sketch comedy program. Cartwright intended to audition for the role of [[Lisa Simpson]], the younger daughter. After arriving at the audition, she found that Lisa was simply described as the middle child and at the time did not have much personality. Cartwright became more interested in the role of Bart, described as &quot;devious, underachieving, school-hating, irreverent, [and] clever&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright, pp. 35–40&lt;/ref&gt; Creator [[Matt Groening]] let her try out for Bart, and gave her the job on the spot.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC News&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/1017238.stm|title=Bart's voice tells all|accessdate=2009-02-05|date=2000-11-10|publisher=[[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bart's voice came naturally to Cartwright, as she had previously used elements of it in ''My Little Pony'', ''Snorks'', and ''Pound Puppies''.&lt;ref name=&quot;My Boy&quot;/&gt; Cartwright describes Bart's voice as easy to perform compared with other characters.&lt;ref name=&quot;My Boy&quot;/&gt; The recording of the shorts was often primitive; the dialog was recorded on a portable tape deck in a makeshift studio above the bleachers on the set of the ''The Tracey Ullman Show''. Cartwright, the only cast member to have been professionally trained in voice acting,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Turner|Turner]], p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; described the sessions as &quot;great fun&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;P43&quot;/&gt; However, she wanted to appear in the live-action sketches and occasionally showed up for recording sessions early, hoping to be noticed by a producer.&lt;ref name=&quot;P43&quot;&gt;Cartwright, pp. 43–50.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, the shorts were spun off into a half-hour show on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] called ''The Simpsons''. Bart quickly became the show's [[List of breakout characters|breakout personality]] and one of the most celebrated characters on television—his popularity in 1990 and 1991 was known as &quot;Bartmania&quot;.&lt;ref name=p120&gt;[[#Turner|Turner]], pp. 120–121&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cartoon leads a revolt against apple-pie family&amp;nbsp;— Simpsons|date=1990-07-08|author=Cassidy, John|work=[[The Sunday Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,22049,22062437-5009160,00.html|title=Simpsons set for big screen|accessdate=2009-02-07|date=2007-07-15|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE0D71F3AF93AA15757C0A966958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=4|title=Cashing in on a Hot New Brand Name |author=Kleinfield, N.R.|accessdate=2009-02-07|date=1990-04-29|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bart was described as &quot;television's brightest new star&quot; by Mike Boone of ''[[The Gazette (Montreal)|The Gazette]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bart Simpson was ray of hope in a year of generally drab television|date=1990-12-30|author=Boone, Mike|work=[[The Gazette (Montreal)|The Gazette]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was named 1990's &quot;entertainer of the year&quot; by ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,318928,00.html|title=1.

During the first season of ''The Simpsons'', Fox ordered Cartwright not to give interviews, because they did not want to publicize the fact that Bart was voiced by a woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bart Simpson's secret: he's a woman|author=Bark, Ed|date=1990-07-15|work=[[Ottawa Citizen]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cartwright's normal speaking voice is said to have &quot;no obvious traces of Bart&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;My Boy&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2004/aug/02/broadcasting.edinburgh04|title=That's my boy|author=Brockes, Emma|accessdate=2009-02-05|date=2004-08-02|work=[[The Guardian]] | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and she believes her role is &quot;the best acting job in the world&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;My Boy&quot;/&gt; since she is rarely recognized in public.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eat my shorts&quot;/&gt; When she is recognized and asked to perform Bart's voice in front of children, Cartwright refuses because it &quot;freaks [them] out&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;My Boy&quot;/&gt; Bart's catchphrase &quot;Eat My Shorts&quot; was an ad-lib by Cartwright in one of the original table readings, referring to an incident from her high school days. Once while performing, members of the Fairmont High School marching band switched their chant from the usual &quot;Fairmont West! Fairmont West!&quot; to the irreverent &quot;Eat my shorts!&quot; Cartwright felt it appropriate for Bart, and improvised the line; it became a popular catchphrase on the show.&lt;ref name=Trivia&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1565538/20070725/story.jhtml|title='Simpsons' Trivia, From Swearing Lisa To 'Burns-Sexual' Smithers|accessdate=2007-07-29|date=2007-07-26|author=Carroll, Larry|publisher=[[MTV]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, Cartwright published her autobiography, ''[[My Life as a 10-Year-Old Boy]]''.

Cartwright met writer [[Warren Murphy]] on her birthday in 1988 and married him two months later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Bart's voice is claim to fame - Kettering woman home to give thanks|work=Dayton Daily News|author=Hopkins, Tom|date=1990-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her book, she describes Murphy as her &quot;personal laugh track&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright, pp. 76–77.&lt;/ref&gt; The couple had two children, Lucy and Jack, before divorcing in 2002.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eat my shorts&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/sep/13/home/hm-cartwright13|title=Country charm?

Cartwright was raised a [[Roman Catholic]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Broadway&quot;/&gt; but joined the [[Church of Scientology]] in the late 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ay caramba!

She said later, &quot;I felt he was talking directly to me, I said to myself, 'I want to stop that feeling.'&quot; Cartwright was awarded Scientology's Patron Laureate Award after she donated $10 million, almost twice her annual salary, to the Church in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nypost.com/seven/01312008/news/nationalnews/the_church_of_impsontology_366572.htm|title=The Church of $impsontology|work=[[The New York Post]]|author=Li, David K.|accessdate=2009-02-07|date=2008-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Times&quot;/&gt;
