'''Joseph Roland Barbera''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|b|ɑr|ˈ|b|ɛr|ə}} {{respell|bar|BERR|ə}}; March 24, 1911 &amp;ndash; December 18, 2006) was an influential American [[animator]], [[Film director|director]], [[Film producer|producer]], [[storyboard artist]], and [[cartoonist|cartoon artist]], whose film and television cartoon characters entertained millions of fans worldwide for much of the twentieth century.

Through his young adult years, Barbera lived, attended college, and began his career in New York City. After working odd jobs and as a banker, Barbera joined [[Van Beuren Studios]] in 1932 and subsequently [[Terrytoons]] in 1936. In 1937, he moved to California and while working at [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] (MGM), Barbera met [[William Hanna]]. The two men began a collaboration that was at first best known for  producing ''[[Tom and Jerry]]'' and [[Live-action/animated film|live action films]]. In 1957, after MGM dissolved their animation department, they co-founded [[Hanna-Barbera]], which became the most successful television animation studio in the business, producing programs such as ''[[The Flintstones]]'', ''[[The Huckleberry Hound Show]]'', ''[[Top Cat]]'', ''[[Scooby-Doo]]'', ''[[The Quick Draw McGraw Show]]'', ''[[Yogi Bear]]'', ''[[The Smurfs (1981 TV series)|The Smurfs]]'', ''[[Wacky Races]]'', and ''[[The Jetsons]]''. In 1967, Hanna-Barbera was sold to [[Taft Broadcasting]] for $12&amp;nbsp;million, but Hanna and Barbera remained head of the company until 1991. At that time, the studio was sold to [[Turner Broadcasting System]], which in turn was merged with [[Time Warner]], owners of [[Warner Bros.]], in 1996; Hanna and Barbera stayed on as advisors.

Hanna and Barbera won seven [[Academy Award]]s and eight [[Emmy Award]]s. Their cartoon shows have become cultural icons, and their cartoon characters have appeared in other media such as films, books, and toys. Hanna-Barbera's shows had a global audience of over 300&amp;nbsp;million people in the 1960s and have been translated into more than 20 languages.

As a member of the [[United States Army]], Larry participated in the [[Operation Husky|invasion of Sicily]]. Ted was a fighter pilot with the [[United States Army Air Forces]] and served in the [[Aleutian Islands Campaign]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BarberaAutoBio&quot;/&gt;{{rp|91–95}} Barbera's father, Vincent, was the prosperous owner of three [[barber]]shops who squandered the family fortunes on gambling.&lt;ref name=&quot;BarberaAutoBio&quot;/&gt;{{rp|19}} By the time Barbera was 15, his father had abandoned the family and his maternal uncle Jim became a father figure to him.&lt;ref name=&quot;BarberaAutoBio&quot;/&gt;{{rp|22–24}}

Barbera displayed a talent for drawing as early as the first grade.&lt;ref name=&quot;BarberaAutoBio&quot;/&gt;{{rp|25–26}} He graduated from [[Erasmus Hall High School]] in Brooklyn in 1928.&lt;ref name=&quot;BarberaAutoBio&quot;/&gt;{{rp|23}}&lt;ref&gt;English, Merle.

Accessed October 22, 2009. &quot;But his most cherished memories are of his days at Erasmus Hall High School, from which he was graduated in 1928.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; While in high school, Barbera won several [[boxing]] titles. He was briefly managed by World Lightweight Boxing Champion [[Al Singer]]'s manager but soon lost interest in boxing.&lt;ref name=&quot;BarberaAutoBio&quot;/&gt;{{rp|30–32}} In 1935, Barbera married his high school sweetheart, Dorothy Earl. In school, they had been known as &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;BarberaAutoBio&quot;/&gt;{{rp|28}}

Barbera and his wife briefly separated when he went to [[California]]. They reunited but were on the verge of another separation when they discovered that Dorothy was pregnant with their first child. The marriage officially ended in 1963.&lt;ref name=&quot;BarberaAutoBio&quot;/&gt;{{rp|58, 61, 66, 90, 129}} Shortly after his divorce, Barbera met his second wife, Sheila Holden, at Musso &amp; Frank's restaurant, where she worked as [[bookkeeper]] and cashier. Unlike Dorothy, who had preferred to stay at home with the children, Sheila enjoyed the [[Hollywood]] social scene that Barbera often frequented.&lt;ref name=&quot;BarberaAutoBio&quot;/&gt;{{rp|137–139, 147}}&lt;ref name=&quot;TOwife&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article758281.ece|title=Joseph Barbera |date=2006-12-20|work = The Times|accessdate=2008-09-20 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===Early career===
During high school, Barbera worked as a tailor's delivery boy.&lt;ref name=&quot;BarberaAutoBio&quot;/&gt;{{rp|28}} During the [[Great Depression]], he tried unsuccessfully to become a cartoonist for a magazine called ''The NY Hits Magazine''. He supported himself with a job at a bank, and continued to pursue publication for his cartoons. His magazine drawings of single cartoons, not comic strips, began to be published in ''[[Redbook]]'', ''[[Saturday Evening Post]]'', and ''[[Collier's]]''—the magazine with which he had the most success.&lt;ref name=&quot;BarberaAutoBio&quot;/&gt;{{rp|35–36}} Barbera also wrote to [[Walt Disney]] for advice on getting started in the [[animation]] industry.&lt;ref name=&quot;GrantBio&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Grant|first=John|title=Masters of Animation|year=1994|publisher=Watson-Guptill Publications|location=New York, NY|isbn= 0-8230-3041-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|105}} Disney wrote back, saying he would call Barbera during an upcoming trip to New York, but the call never took place.&lt;ref name=&quot;BarberaAutoBio&quot;/&gt;{{rp|38}}&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTBarberaObit&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/19/arts/19barbera.html?scp=1&amp;sq=Joseph%20Barbera,%20Half%20of%20Cartoon%20Duo,%20Dies%20at%2095%20-%20New%20York%20Times&amp;st=cse|title=Joseph Barbera, Half of Cartoon Duo, Dies at 95|last=Itzkoff|first=Dave|date=2006-12-19|work=The New York Times|accessdate=2008-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barbera took art classes at the [[Art Students League of New York]] and the [[Pratt Institute]] and was hired to work in the [[Traditional animation#Traditional ink-and-paint and camera|ink and paint]] department of [[Fleischer Studios]]. In 1932, he joined the Van Beuren Studios as an animator and [[storyboard]] artist.&lt;ref name=&quot;BarberaAutoBio&quot;/&gt;{{rp|38–42}} He worked on cartoon series such as ''Cubby Bear'' and ''Rainbow Parades'', and ''[[Tom and Jerry (Van Beuren)|Tom and Jerry]]''. This ''Tom and Jerry'' series starred two humans; it was unrelated to Barbera's later cat-and-mouse series. When Van Beuren closed down in 1936, Barbera moved over to [[Paul Terry (cartoonist)|Paul Terry]]'s Terrytoons studio.&lt;ref name=&quot;BarberaAutoBio&quot;/&gt;{{rp|53–54}}

===Film===
Lured by a substantial salary increase, Barbera left Terrytoons and New York for the new Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) cartoon unit in California in 1937.&lt;ref name=&quot;BarberaAutoBio&quot;/&gt;{{rp|58–59}}&lt;ref name=&quot;GrantBio&quot;/&gt;{{rp|106}} He found that Los Angeles was suffering just as much from the Great Depression as Brooklyn and almost returned to Brooklyn.&lt;ref name=&quot;BarberaAutoBio&quot;/&gt;{{rp|201}}

Barbera's desk was opposite that of [[William Hanna]]. The two quickly realized they would make a good team.&lt;ref name=&quot;AutoBiog&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Hanna|first=William|coauthors=Tom Ito|title=A Cast of Friends|publisher=Da Capo Press|location=Emeryville, California|year=2000|isbn=0-306-80917-6|url=http://books.google.com/?id=pHhw_ZgO6WoC|accessdate=2008-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|Foreword}} By 1939, they had solidified a partnership that would last 60 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meshing&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/william-hanna-728958.html|title=William Hanna|last=Vallance|first=Tom|date=2001-03-24|work=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=2008-08-04 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;APobit&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newsday.com/news/a-cartoon-king-is-dead-at-90-1.352770|title=A Cartoon King Is Dead at 90|date=2001-03-22|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=2008-08-14}}{{Subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barbera and Hanna worked alongside animator [[Tex Avery]], who had created [[Daffy Duck]] and [[Bugs Bunny]] for [[Warner Bros.

[[File:TomandJerryTitleCardc.jpg|thumb|left|Joseph Barbera first worked at MGM, as one of the directors of the ''[[Tom and Jerry]]'' shorts.]]
In 1940, Hanna and Barbera jointly directed ''[[Puss Gets the Boot]]'', which was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Animated Short Film|Academy Award for Best (Cartoon) Short Subject]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DreamTeam&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1237649.stm|title=The cartoon dream team|date=2001-03-21|work=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=2008-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;UPI&quot;&gt;
{{cite news|title=Legendary cartoonist William Hanna dies|date=2001-03-23|work=[[United Press International]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The studio wanted a diversified cartoon portfolio, so despite the success of ''Puss Gets the Boot'', Barbera and Hanna's supervisor, [[Fred Quimby]], did not want to produce more cat and mouse cartoons believing that there were already enough cartoons of those in existence.&lt;ref name=&quot;BarberaAutoBio&quot;/&gt;{{rp|75–76}} Surprised by the success of ''Puss Gets the Boot'', Barbera and Hanna ignored Quimby's resistance&lt;ref name=&quot;AutoBiog&quot;/&gt;{{rp|45}} and continued developing the cat-and-mouse theme. By this time, however, Hanna wanted to return to working for Ising, to whom he felt very loyal. Barbera and Hanna met with Quimby, who discovered that although Ising had taken sole credit for producing ''Puss Gets the Boot'', he never actually worked on it. Quimby then gave Hanna and Barbera permission to pursue their cat-and-mouse idea. The result was their most famous creation, ''Tom and Jerry''.&lt;ref name=&quot;BarberaAutoBio&quot;/&gt;{{rp|78–79}}

Modeled after the ''Puss Gets the Boot'' characters with slight differences, the series followed Jerry, the pesky rodent who continuously outwitted his feline foe, Tom.&lt;ref name=&quot;GuardianObit&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=William Hanna: Master animator whose cartoon creations included Tom and Jerry and the Flintstones|last=Gifford|first=Denis|date=2001-03-24|work=[[The Guardian]]|url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/2001/mar/24/guardianobituaries.filmnews1|accessdate= 2008-08-21 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;TelegraphObit&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1327678/William-Hanna.html|title=William Hanna|date=2001-11-22|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=2008-08-16 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hanna said they settled on the cat and mouse theme for this cartoon because &quot;we knew we needed two characters.

Quimby accepted each Academy Award for ''Tom and Jerry'' without inviting Barbera and Hanna onstage. The cartoons were also released with Quimby listed as the sole producer, following the same practice for which he had condemned Ising.&lt;ref name=&quot;BarberaAutoBio&quot;/&gt;{{rp|83–84}} Quimby once delayed a promised raise to Barbera by six months .&lt;ref name=&quot;BarberaAutoBio&quot;/&gt;{{rp|82}} When Quimby retired in late 1955, Hanna and Barbera were placed in charge of MGM's animation division.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTBarberaObit&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Meshing&quot;/&gt; As the studio began to lose more revenue due to television,&lt;ref name=&quot;TimesLondon&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=William Hanna|date=2001-03-24|work=[[The Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;DailyRecord&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Moore|first=Ron|title=Toons King Dies; Hanna's Magic Touch Brought Us Fred, Yogi, and Scooby-Doo|date=2001-03-24|publisher=[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; MGM soon realized that re-releasing old cartoons was far more profitable than producing new ones.&lt;ref name=&quot;BarberaAutoBio&quot;/&gt;{{rp|2–3, 109}} In 1957, MGM ordered Barbera and Hanna's business manager to close the cartoon division and lay off everyone by a phone call.&lt;ref name=&quot;BarberaAutoBio&quot;/&gt;{{rp|2–3, 109}} Barbera and Hanna found the no-notice closing puzzling because ''Tom and Jerry'' had been so successful.&lt;ref name=&quot;CBSobit&quot;/&gt;

===Television===
In 1957, Barbera reteamed with his former partner Hanna to produce cartoon films for television and theatrical release.&lt;ref name=&quot;TelegraphObit&quot;/&gt; As they had at MGM, the two brought their different skills to the company; Barbera was a skilled gag writer and sketch artist, while Hanna had a gift for timing, story construction, and recruiting top artists. Major business decisions would be made together, though each year the title of president alternated between them.&lt;ref name=&quot;BarberaAutoBio&quot;/&gt;{{rp|120}}&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTBarberaObit&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AutoBiog&quot;/&gt;{{rp|77, 146}}  A [[Coin flipping|coin toss]] determined that Hanna would have precedence in the naming of the new company,&lt;ref name=&quot;AutoBiog&quot;/&gt;{{rp|Foreword}} first called H-B Enterprises but soon changed to [[Hanna-Barbera|Hanna-Barbera Productions]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTBarberaObit&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;DailyRecord&quot;/&gt;

A 1960 survey showed that half of the viewers of ''Huckleberry Hound'' were adults.  This prompted the company to create a new animated series, ''The Flintstones''.&lt;ref name=&quot;CNNobit&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GoldenAge&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6193603.stm|title=Hanna Barbera's golden age of animation|last=Savage|first=Mark|date=2006-12-19|work=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=2008-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; A parody of ''[[The Honeymooners]]'', the new show followed a typical [[Stone Age]] family with home appliances, talking animals, and celebrity guests.

Although both shows reappeared in the 1970s and 1980s, ''The Flintstones'' was far more popular.&lt;ref name=&quot;MuseumTV&quot;/&gt;

By the late 1960s, Hanna-Barbera Productions was the most successful television animation studio in the business.

Barbera and Hanna continued to advise their former company and periodically worked on new Hanna-Barbera shows, including shorts for the series ''[[The Cartoon Cartoon Show]]'' and feature film versions of ''[[The Flintstones (film)|The Flintstones]]'' (1994) and ''[[Scooby-Doo (film)|Scooby-Doo]]'' (2002).&lt;ref name=&quot;CNNobit&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Collectibles&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rinker|first=Harry L.|year=1996|month=February|title= William Danby Hanna and Joseph Roland Barbera|journal=Antiques &amp; Collecting Magazine|volume=100|issue=12|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a new ''Tom and Jerry'' cartoon produced in 2000, ''[[The Mansion Cat]]'', Barbera voiced the houseowner.&lt;ref name=&quot;TWpostHanna&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timewarner.com/corp/newsroom/pr/0,20812,1571324,00.html|title=Animation Legend Joseph Barbera Died Today|date=2006-12-18|publisher=TimeWarner|accessdate=2008-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Hanna's death from throat cancer in March 2001, Hanna-Barbera was absorbed into [[Warner Bros. Animation]] and spun off into [[Cartoon Network Studios]].

==Legacy==
Most of the cartoons Barbera and Hanna created revolved around close friendship or partnership; this theme is evident with Fred and Barney, Tom &amp; Jerry, Scooby and Shaggy, The Jetson family and Yogi &amp; Boo-Boo. These may have been a reflection of the close business friendship and partnership that Barbera and Hanna  shared for over 60 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;AutoBiog&quot;/&gt;{{rp|214}} Although their professional strengths, weaknesses, and personalities meshed perfectly,&lt;ref name=&quot;Meshing&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTt&amp;j&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CNNobit&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;IrishObit&quot;/&gt; Barbera and Hanna travelled in completely different social circles. Hanna's circle of personal friends primarily included other animators; Barbera had an affinity for Hollywood's celebrity society—[[Zsa Zsa Gabor]] was a frequent visitor to his house.&lt;ref name=&quot;AutoBiog&quot;/&gt;{{rp|52–53, 137–139, 147, 222–224}} Their division of work roles complemented each other but they rarely talked outside of work since Hanna was interested in the outdoors and Barbera liked beaches and good food and drink.&lt;ref name=&quot;BarberaAutoBio&quot;/&gt;{{rp|120–121}} Nevertheless, in their long partnership, in which they worked with over 2000 animated characters, Barbera and Hanna rarely exchanged a cross word.&lt;ref name=&quot;TelegraphObit&quot;/&gt; Barbera said: &quot;We understood each other perfectly, and each of us had deep respect for the other's work.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;DreamTeam&quot;/&gt; Hanna once said he was never a good artist but his partner could &quot;capture mood and expression in a quick sketch better than anyone I've ever known.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBCNewsObit&quot;/&gt;

''[[The Cat Concerto]]'' (1946) and ''[[Johann Mouse]]'' (1952) have both been called &quot;masterpieces of animation&quot; largely because of their classical music.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meshing&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sennett&quot;/&gt;{{rp|34}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Smoodin&quot;/&gt;{{rp|133}}

In 1992, Barbera met with pop musician [[Michael Jackson]], an avid cartoon fan, in an unsuccessful attempt to arrange for him to sing in ''[[Tom and Jerry: The Movie]]''. Barbera drew five quick sketches of ''Tom and Jerry'' for Jackson and autographed them. Jackson autographed a picture of himself and his niece Nicole for Barbera with the words: &quot;To my hero of yesterday, today, and tomorrow, with many thanks for all the many cartoon friends you gave me as a child. They were all I had.—Michael&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;BarberaAutoBio&quot;/&gt;{{rp|236–237}}
