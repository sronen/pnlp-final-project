'''William Denby Hanna''' (July 14, 1910&amp;nbsp;– March 22, 2001) was an American [[animator]], director, producer, and [[cartoonist|cartoon artist]], whose film and television cartoon characters entertained millions of people for much of the 20th century. When he was a young child, Hanna's family moved frequently, but they settled in [[Compton, California]], by 1919. There, Hanna became an [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]]. Hanna graduated from [[Compton High School]] in 1928. He briefly attended [[El Camino College Compton Center|Compton City College]] but dropped out at the onset of the [[Great Depression]].

After working odd jobs in the first months of the Depression, Hanna joined the [[Harman and Ising]] [[animation]] [[studio]] in 1930. During the 1930s, Hanna steadily gained skill and prominence while working on cartoons such as ''[[The Captain and the Kids (MGM animated series)|Captain and the Kids]]''. In 1937, while working at [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] (MGM), Hanna met [[Joseph Barbera]]. The two men began a collaboration that was at first best known for producing ''[[Tom and Jerry]]'' and [[Live-action/animated film|live action films]]. In 1957, they co-founded [[Hanna-Barbera]], which became the most successful television animation studio in the business, producing programs such as ''[[The Flintstones]]'', ''[[Huckleberry Hound|The Huckleberry Hound Show]]'', ''[[The Jetsons]]'', ''[[Scooby-Doo]]'', ''[[The Smurfs (1981 TV series)|The Smurfs]]'', and ''[[Yogi Bear]]''. In 1967, Hanna–Barbera was sold to [[Taft Broadcasting]] for $12&amp;nbsp;million, but Hanna and Barbera remained heads of the company until 1991. At that time, the studio was sold to [[Turner Broadcasting System]], which in turn was merged with [[Time Warner]], owners of Hanna's first employer [[Warner Bros.]], in 1996; Hanna and Barbera stayed on as advisors.

Hanna and Barbera won seven [[Academy Award]]s and eight [[Emmy Award]]s. Their cartoons have become cultural icons, and their cartoon characters have appeared in other media such as films, books, and toys. Hanna–Barbera's shows have a global audience of over 300&amp;nbsp;million people and have been translated into more than 20 languages.

William Hanna was born to William John and Avice Joyce (Denby) Hanna in [[Melrose, New Mexico]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AutoBiog&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Hanna|first=William|coauthors=Tom Ito|title=A Cast of Friends|publisher=Da Capo Press|location=Emeryville, California|year=2000|isbn=0-306-80917-6|url=http://books.google.com/?id=pHhw_ZgO6WoC|accessdate=2008-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|5}} The third of seven children and the only son, Hanna maintained that there was no war between the sexes nor sibling rivalry in their home.&lt;ref name=&quot;AutoBiog&quot;/&gt;{{rp|5}}&lt;ref name=&quot;IrishObit&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/obituaries/2001/0331/01033100098.html|title=William Hanna|last=Hogan|first=Sean|date=2001-03-23|work=The Irish Times |page=16|accessdate=2008-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hanna described his family as &quot;a red-blooded, Irish-American family&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;AutoBiog&quot;/&gt;{{rp|9}} His father was a construction superintendent for railroads as well as water and sewer systems throughout the western regions of America, requiring the family to move frequently.&lt;ref name=&quot;AutoBiog&quot;/&gt;{{rp|6}} When Hanna was three years old, the family moved to [[Baker City, Oregon]], where his father worked on the construction of the Balm Creek Dam.

==Career==
===Film===
After dropping out of college, Hanna worked briefly as a construction engineer and helped build the [[Pantages Theatre (Hollywood)|Pantages Theatre]] in Hollywood.&lt;ref name=&quot;CNSobit&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;DV2&quot;/&gt;{{rp|6}} He lost that job during the Great Depression and found another at a car wash.

Besides inking and painting, Hanna also wrote songs and lyrics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meshing&quot;/&gt; For the first several years of Hanna's employment, the studio partnered with Pacific Title and Art's [[Leon Schlesinger]], who released the Harman-Ising output through [[Warner Bros.]] When Hugh Harman and Rudolph Ising chose to break with Schlesinger and begin producing cartoons independently for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) in 1933, Hanna was one of the employees who followed them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meshing&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;APobit&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newsday.com/features/ny-hannaobit,0,282729.story|title=A Cartoon King Is Dead at 90|date=2001-03-23|agency=Associated Press  |accessdate=2008-08-14}} {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hanna was given the opportunity to direct his first cartoon in 1936; the result was ''To Spring'', part of the Harman-Ising ''Happy Harmonies'' series.&lt;ref name=&quot;GuardianObit&quot;/&gt; The following year, MGM decided to terminate their partnership with Harman-Ising and bring production in-house.&lt;ref name=&quot;BarberaAutoBio&quot;/&gt;{{rp|68}} Hanna was among the first people MGM hired away from Harman-Ising to [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer cartoon studio|their new cartoon studio]]. During 1938–39, he served as a senior director on MGM's ''Captain and the Kids'' series, based upon the comic strip of the same name (an alternate version of the ''[[Katzenjammer Kids]]'' that had resulted from a 1914 lawsuit). The series did not do well; consequently, Hanna was demoted to a story man and the series was canceled.&lt;ref name=&quot;BarberaAutoBio&quot;/&gt;{{rp|68–69}} Hanna's desk at MGM was opposite that of Joseph Barbera, who had previously worked at [[Terrytoons]]. The two quickly realized they would make a good team.&lt;ref name=&quot;AutoBiog&quot;/&gt;{{rp|Foreword}} By 1939 they had solidified a partnership that would last 50 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meshing&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;APobit&quot;/&gt; Hanna and Barbera worked alongside animation director [[Tex Avery]], who had created [[Daffy Duck]] and [[Bugs Bunny]] for [[Warner Bros.

In 1940, Hanna and Barbera jointly directed ''[[Puss Gets the Boot]]'', which was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Animated Short Film|Academy Award for Best (Cartoon) Short Subject]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DreamTeam&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1237649.stm|title=The cartoon dream team|date=2001-03-21|work=BBC News  |accessdate=2008-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;UPI&quot;&gt;
{{cite news|title=Legendary cartoonist William Hanna dies|date=2001-03-23|work=[[United Press International]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The studio wanted a diversified cartoon portfolio, so despite the success of ''Puss Gets the Boot'', Hanna and Barbera's supervisor, [[Fred Quimby]], did not want to produce more cat and mouse cartoons.&lt;ref name=&quot;BarberaAutoBio&quot;/&gt;{{rp|75–76}} Surprised by the success of ''Puss Gets the Boot'', Hanna and Barbera ignored Quimby's resistance&lt;ref name=&quot;AutoBiog&quot;/&gt;{{rp|45}} and continued developing the cat-and-mouse theme. By this time, however, Hanna wanted to return to working for Ising, to whom he felt very loyal. Hanna and Barbera met with Quimby, who discovered that although Ising had taken sole credit for producing ''Puss Gets the Boot'', he never actually worked on it. Quimby then gave Hanna and Barbera permission to pursue their cat-and-mouse idea. The result was their most famous creation, ''Tom and Jerry''.&lt;ref name=&quot;BarberaAutoBio&quot;/&gt;{{rp|78–79}}

Modeled after the ''Puss Gets the Boot'' characters with slight differences, the series followed Jerry, the pesky rodent who continually outwitted his feline foe, Tom.&lt;ref name=&quot;GuardianObit&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;TelegraphObit&quot;/&gt; Hanna said they settled on the cat and mouse theme for this cartoon because: &quot;We knew we needed two characters. We thought we needed conflict, and chase and action. And a cat after a mouse seemed like a good, basic thought.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;CNSobit&quot;/&gt; The revamped characters first appeared in 1941's ''[[The Midnight Snack]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;AutoBiog&quot;/&gt;{{rp|46}} Over the next 17 years Hanna and Barbera worked almost exclusively on ''Tom and Jerry'',&lt;ref name=&quot;DreamTeam&quot;/&gt; directing more than 114 highly popular cartoon shorts.&lt;ref name=&quot;CNepisodeguide&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cartoonnetwork.com/tv_shows/tomjerry/index.html|title=Tom and Jerry: Episode Guide|year=2008|publisher=Cartoon Network|accessdate=2008-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; During World War&amp;nbsp;II they also made animated training films.&lt;ref name=&quot;BarberaAutoBio&quot;/&gt;{{rp|92–93}} ''Tom and Jerry'' relied mostly on motion instead of dialog.&lt;ref name=&quot;APobit&quot;/&gt; Despite its popularity, ''Tom and Jerry'' has often been criticized as excessively violent.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sennett&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Hanna|first=William|coauthors=Joseph Barbera, with Ted Sennett|title=The Art of Hanna-Barbera: Fifty Years of Creativity|year=1989|publisher=Viking Studio Books|location=New York, NY|isbn= 0-670-82978-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|42}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Smoodin&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smoodin|first=Eric|title=Cartoon and Comic Classicism: High-Art Histories of Lowbrow Culture|journal=American Literary History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|location=Oxford, England|date=Spring, 1992|volume=4|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|134}} Nonetheless, the series won its first Academy Award for the 11th short, ''[[The Yankee Doodle Mouse]]'' (1943)—a war-time adventure.&lt;ref name=&quot;GuardianObit&quot;/&gt; ''Tom and Jerry'' was ultimately nominated for 14 Academy Awards, winning 7.&lt;ref name=&quot;WashPost&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Pearson|first=Richard|title=William Hanna TV Animator |date=2001-03-25|page=C04|work=[[The Washington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; No other character-based theatrical animated series has won more awards, nor has any other series featuring the same characters.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meshing&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CBSobit&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2001/03/22/entertainment/main281056.shtml?source=search_story|title=Animation Legend William Hanna Dead|date=2001-03-21|work=[[CBS News]]|accessdate=2008-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tom and Jerry also made guest appearances in several of MGM's live-action films, including ''[[Anchors Aweigh (film)|Anchors Aweigh]]'' (1945) and ''[[Invitation to the Dance (film)|Invitation to the Dance]]'' (1956) with [[Gene Kelly]], and ''[[Dangerous When Wet]]'' (1953) with [[Esther Williams]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTt&amp;j&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CBSobit&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CNNobit&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2001/SHOWBIZ/TV/03/23/obit.hanna/index.html|title= Animation legend William Hanna dies at 90|date=2001-03-23|publisher=CNN|accessdate=2008-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Quimby accepted each Academy Award for ''Tom and Jerry's'' without inviting Hanna and Barbera onstage. The cartoons were also released with Quimby listed as the sole producer, following the same practice for which he had condemned Ising.&lt;ref name=&quot;BarberaAutoBio&quot;/&gt;{{rp|83–84}} When Quimby retired in late 1955, Hanna and Barbera were placed in charge of MGM's animation division.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meshing&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTBarberaObit&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/19/arts/19barbera.html?scp=1&amp;sq=Joseph%20Barbera,%20Half%20of%20Cartoon%20Duo,%20Dies%20at%2095%20-%20New%20York%20Times&amp;st=cse|title=Joseph Barbera, Half of Cartoon Duo, Dies at 95|last=Itzkoff|first=Dave|date=2006-12-19|work=The New York Times|accessdate=2008-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the studio began to lose more revenue due to television,&lt;ref name=&quot;DailyRecord&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;TimesLondon&quot;/&gt; MGM soon realized that re-releasing old cartoons was far more profitable than producing new ones.&lt;ref name=&quot;BarberaAutoBio&quot;/&gt;{{rp|2–3, 109}} In 1957, MGM ordered Hanna and Barbera's business manager to close the cartoon division and lay off everyone by a phone call.&lt;ref name=&quot;BarberaAutoBio&quot;/&gt;{{rp|2–3, 109}} Hanna and Barbera found the no-notice closing puzzling because ''Tom and Jerry'' had been so successful.&lt;ref name=&quot;CBSobit&quot;/&gt;

===Television===
During his last year at MGM, Hanna branched out into television, forming the short-lived company Shield Productions with fellow animator [[Jay Ward]],&lt;ref name=&quot;MooseRoar&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Scott|first=Keith|title=The Moose That Roared|publisher=St. Martin's Griffin|location=New York, NY|year=2001|isbn=0-312-28383-0|url=http://books.google.com/?id=qdwcbJxM-HsC&amp;pg=PA29&amp;lpg=PA29&amp;dq=William+Hanna+%22Jay+Ward%22+%22Shield+Productions%22|accessdate=2008-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{rp|27–29}} who had created the series ''[[Crusader Rabbit]]''. Their partnership soon ended, and in 1957 Hanna reteamed with his former partner Joseph Barbera to produce cartoons for television and theatrical release.&lt;ref name=&quot;TelegraphObit&quot;/&gt; The two brought different skills to the company; Barbera was a skilled gag writer and sketch artist, while Hanna had a gift for timing, story construction, and recruiting top artists. Major business decisions would be made together, though each year the title of president alternated between them.&lt;ref name=&quot;AutoBiog&quot;/&gt;{{rp|77, 146}}&lt;ref name=&quot;BarberaAutoBio&quot;/&gt;{{rp|120}}&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTBarberaObit&quot;/&gt; A [[Coin flipping|coin toss]] determined that Hanna would have precedence in the naming of the new company,&lt;ref name=&quot;AutoBiog&quot;/&gt;{{rp|Foreword}} first called H-B Enterprises but soon changed to [[Hanna–Barbera|Hanna–Barbera Productions]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DailyRecord&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTBarberaObit&quot;/&gt;

The first offering from the new company was ''[[The Ruff &amp; Reddy Show]]'',&lt;ref name=&quot;TelegraphObit&quot;/&gt; a series which detailed the friendship between a dog and cat.&lt;ref name=&quot;MuseumTV&quot;/&gt; Despite a lukewarm response for their first theatrical venture, ''[[Loopy De Loop]]'', Hanna–Barbera soon established themselves with two successful television series: ''The Huckleberry Hound Show'' and ''The Yogi Bear Show''. A 1960 survey showed that half of the viewers of ''Huckleberry Hound'' were adults. This prompted the company to create a new animated series, ''[[The Flintstones]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;CNNobit&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GoldenAge&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6193603.stm|title=Hanna Barbera's golden age of animation|last=Savage|first=Mark|date=2006-12-19|work=BBC News  |accessdate=2008-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; A parody of ''[[The Honeymooners]]'', the new show followed a typical [[Stone Age]] family with home appliances, talking animals, and celebrity guests.

Although both shows reappeared in the 1970s and 1980s, ''The Flintstones'' was far more popular.&lt;ref name=&quot;MuseumTV&quot;/&gt;

By the late 1960s, Hanna–Barbera Productions was the most successful television animation studio in the business.

As popular as their cartoons were with 1960s audiences, they were disliked by artists.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTvision&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E06E0D91231F933A05751C1A9679C8B63|title= The Times They Lived: William Hanna, B. 1910; Stone-Age Visionary|last=Nash|first=Eric P.|date=2001-12-30|work=The New York Times |accessdate=2008-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Television programs had lower budgets than theatrical animation, and this economic reality caused many animation studios to go out of business in the 1950s and 1960s, putting many people in the industry out of work.&lt;ref name=&quot;APobit&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GoldenAge&quot;/&gt; Hanna–Barbera was key in the development of [[limited animation]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Wells&quot;/&gt;{{rp|75}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Thompson&quot;/&gt;{{rp|54}}, which allowed television animation to be more cost-effective, but often sacrificed artistic quality.&lt;ref name=&quot;HeraldObit&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;TelegraphObit&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;IndBuncombe&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CBSobit&quot;/&gt; Hanna and Barbera had first experimented with these techniques in the early days of ''Tom and Jerry''.&lt;ref name=&quot;BarberaAutoBio&quot;/&gt;{{rp|74, 115}} To reduce the cost of each episode, shows often focused more on character dialogue than detailed animation.&lt;ref name=&quot;APobit&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTvision&quot;/&gt; The number of drawings for a seven-minute cartoon decreased from 14,000 to nearly 2,000, and the company implemented innovative techniques such as rapid background changes to improve viewing.&lt;ref name=&quot;GoldenAge&quot;/&gt; Critics criticized the change from lush, detailed animation to flat characters with repetitive motion.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTvision&quot;/&gt; Barbera once said that their choice was to adapt to the television budgets or change careers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wells&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Wells|first=Paul|title=Animation and America|publisher=Rutgers University Press|location=New Brunswick, NJ|isbn=0-8135-3160-8|url=http://books.google.com/?id=8YAXkfe__H8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Animation+and+America|accessdate=2008-08-23|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|75}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Thompson&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thompson|first=Kirsten Moana|date= 2004-01-12 |title=Animation and America by Paul Wells|journal=Film Quarterly|publisher=University of California Press| volume=58|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|54}} The new style did not limit the success of their animated shows, enabling Hanna–Barbera to stay in business, providing employment to many who would otherwise have been out of work.&lt;ref name=&quot;GoldenAge&quot;/&gt; Limited animation became the standard for television animation, and continues to be used today in television programs such as ''[[The Simpsons]]'' and ''[[South Park]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;IrishObit&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTvision&quot;/&gt;

==Death==
Hanna died of [[Esophageal cancer|throat cancer]] on March 22, 2001, in [[North Hollywood, Los Angeles, California]] and was interred in Ascension Cemetery in [[Lake Forest, California]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CalGraves&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Brooks|first=Patricia|coauthors=Jonathan Brooks|title=Laid To Rest In California|publisher=Insider's Guide|location=Guilford, CT|year=2006|isbn=0-7627-4101-5|url=http://books.google.com/?id=dN5pWzZUvoMC&amp;pg=PA224&amp;lpg=PA224&amp;dq=%22William+Hanna%22+%22Ascension+Cemetery%22|accessdate=2008-08-22|page=224}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Hanna's death, [[Cartoon Network (United States)|Cartoon Network]] aired a 20-second segment with black dots tracing Hanna's [[portrait]] with the words &quot;We'll miss you - Cartoon Network&quot; fading in on the right-hand side.

==Legacy==
Most of the cartoons Hanna and Barbera created revolved around close friendship or partnership; this theme is evident with Tom and Jerry, [[Yogi Bear]] and Boo Boo, Fred Flintstone and [[Barney Rubble]], Ruff and Reddy, ''The Jetsons'' family and the friends in ''Scooby-Doo''. These may have been a reflection of the close business friendship and partnership that Hanna and Barbera shared for almost 60 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;AutoBiog&quot;/&gt;{{rp|214}} Although their professional strengths, weaknesses, and personalities meshed perfectly,&lt;ref name=&quot;IrishObit&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTt&amp;j&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Meshing&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CNNobit&quot;/&gt; Hanna and Barbera traveled in completely different social circles. Hanna's circle of personal friends primarily included other animators; Barbera had an affinity for Hollywood's celebrity society.&lt;ref name=&quot;AutoBiog&quot;/&gt;{{rp|52–53}} Their division of work roles complemented each other but they rarely talked outside of work since Hanna was interested in the outdoors and Barbera liked beaches and good food and drink.&lt;ref name=&quot;BarberaAutoBio&quot;/&gt;{{rp|120–121}} Nevertheless, in their long partnership, in which they worked with over 2000 animated characters, Hanna and Barbera rarely exchanged a cross word.&lt;ref name=&quot;TelegraphObit&quot;/&gt; Barbera said: &quot;We understood each other perfectly, and each of us had deep respect for the other's work.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;DreamTeam&quot;/&gt;

Hanna is considered one of the all-time great animators and on a par with [[Tex Avery]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BBCobit&quot;/&gt; Hanna and Barbera were also among the first animators to realize the enormous potential of television and to successfully adapt to the change it brought to the industry.&lt;ref name=&quot;IndBuncombe&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;USAToday&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/2001-03-22-hanna-obit.htm|title=Cartoon pioneer William Hanna dead at 90|date=2001-03-23|work=USA Today |accessdate=2008-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leonard Maltin]] says the Hanna–Barbera team &quot;[may] hold a record for producing consistently superior cartoons using the same characters year after year—without a break or change in routine.

''[[The Cat Concerto]]'' (1946) and ''[[Johann Mouse]]'' (1952) have both been called &quot;masterpieces of animation&quot; largely because of their classical music.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meshing&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sennett&quot;/&gt;{{rp|34}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Smoodin&quot;/&gt;{{rp|133}}
