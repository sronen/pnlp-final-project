Well known in her hometown of [[Patterson, Georgia]], when she was a child, she began acting during high school. Strickland studied the profession in [[Philadelphia]] and [[New York City]], where she obtained mostly small roles in film, television and theater projects, among them ''[[The Sixth Sense]]'' (1999). Her participation in the 2003 [[Hollywood cinema|Hollywood]] films ''[[Anything Else]]'' and ''[[Something's Gotta Give (film)|Something's Gotta Give]]'' led to her receiving significant parts in the horror pictures ''[[Anacondas: The Hunt for the Blood Orchid|Anacondas]]'' and ''[[The Grudge]]'' (both 2004). In the period they were released, Strickland was referred to as &quot;the pride of Patterson&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Soergel&quot;/&gt; and the horror fandom's &quot;newest [[scream queen]]&quot;,&lt;ref name=HorrorAsylum/&gt; though her performances in both films received mixed critical reviews.

In 2005, Strickland garnered positive critical comment for the romantic comedy ''[[Fever Pitch (2005 film)|Fever Pitch]]'', and in 2007, she was a cast regular in the television show ''[[The Wedding Bells]]'' and subsequently was added to the cast of ''[[Private Practice (TV series)|Private Practice]]''. Strickland has spoken against the emphasis placed on beauty in the [[Los Angeles]] acting community, in which she says her [[Southern U.S.]] background has helped to distinguish herself from other [[blonde|blonde-haired]] actors.&lt;ref name=&quot;Soergel&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=LatinoReview/&gt; She has spoken of an affinity for her strong female characters&lt;ref name=&quot;Soergel&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=HorrorAsylum/&gt;&lt;ref name=LatinoReview/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Horrordotcom&quot;/&gt; and a desire to avoid sexualizing or sensationalizing her self-presentation as a woman.&lt;ref name=EZ-Entertainment/&gt;

== Early life and education ==
Strickland was born in [[Blackshear, Georgia|Blackshear]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]&lt;!--, and is the third and youngest child of --&gt; to Susan Strickland, a [[nurse]], and Dee Strickland, a high school [[American football|football]] coach, principal and [[superintendent (education)|superintendent]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Soergel&quot; /&gt; KaDee's birthname is Katherine Dee; her parents combined the ''K'' in Katherine with her father's name to make ''KaDee''.&lt;ref name=IGN/&gt; She was raised in [[Patterson, Georgia]], which she said is a &quot;one-stoplight town&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Soergel&quot;/&gt; and she had a job picking [[tobacco]] on a local farm for eight years. When she was a child, Strickland watched the Woody Allen film ''[[Annie Hall]]'' (1975) and was, as she put it, &quot;wanting to be in that place, and being completely taken with the energy of those people. I wanted to be in it&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Soergel&quot; /&gt; During her childhood, she was well known locally as a member of the Strickland family and for her extracurricular activities and achievements (she was the [[Homecoming Queen]] in elementary, middle and high school, the [[student council]] president and a [[cheerleader]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Soergel&quot;/&gt; She never considered a career in the [[performing arts]] until her participation in a one-act play performed by students of her high school: &quot;[...] the minute I set foot on stage, that was it. Destiny took over. There were no other options. I felt like I fit my skin, I knew what I was here to do&quot;, Strickland said.&lt;ref name=&quot;Soergel&quot; /&gt;

After graduating from high school, Strickland wanted to study drama at college in [[New York City]], but her parents did not want her to live in such a large city so soon.&lt;ref name=&quot;Soergel&quot; /&gt; Consequently, she applied instead to the [[University of the Arts (Philadelphia)|University of the Arts]] in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]]. During her studies there, she joined the [[Screen Actors Guild]] and considered using her given name, Katherine, as the first part of her stage name, before deciding she was &quot;much too tomboy&quot; for it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Soergel&quot; /&gt; Strickland took a part-time waitressing job at a local restaurant and [[intern]]ed at a [[casting (performing arts)|casting]] agency, where one of her tasks was to read lines at auditions for small roles in local film and television projects; the job landed Strickland her first film role. After graduating from university with a [[Fine Arts]] degree,&lt;ref&gt;[http://1015thepoint.com/common/movies/notes/40175-1-full.html &quot;Movie: ''The Grudge''&quot;]. 101.5 ''The Point''.

Strickland's career began in 1999 with a brief appearance as a mourner at a funeral after-party in ''[[The Sixth Sense]]'', a two-line part that she received after impressing writer-director [[M.

=== Major film roles ===
Strickland's first lead role came when producer [[Doug Belgrad]] saw the [[dailies]] of her scene in ''Something's Gotta Give''. He cast her opposite [[Johnny Messner (actor)|Johnny Messner]] and [[Morris Chestnut]] in the jungle-set horror film ''[[Anacondas: The Hunt for the Blood Orchid]]'', the sequel to ''[[Anaconda (film)|Anaconda]]'' (1997).&lt;ref name=HorrorAsylum/&gt; Strickland played an accomplished research scientist who travels to [[Borneo]] as part of an expedition team searching for a species of plant rumored to have life-extending properties. She said she initially did not want to follow a Woody Allen film with a &quot;''snake'' movie&quot;, but that she changed her mind because the hero was a female [[Culture of the Southern United States#People|Southerner]] who was not &quot;a complete idiot&quot; or &quot;a chick in shorts about to get whacked&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Soergel&quot; /&gt; Though its box office revenue tripled its production budget, ''Anacondas'' did not perform as well as its predecessor, and most reviews panned the project.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=anacondas.htm &quot;Anacondas: The Hunt for the Blood Orchid&quot;].

She said that Japan and [[Japanese cinema]] had always fascinated her, and that she wanted to be &quot;a part of that world&quot; in which filmmakers communicate the story via action rather than dialogue; she also highlighted the importance of being &quot;able to explore being in the wrong place at the wrong time without being a [[Sexual objectification|sex object]]/[[damsel in distress]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Horrordotcom&quot;/&gt; ''The Grudge'' was a number-one U.S. box office hit and quickly became one of the year's most profitable films,&lt;ref&gt;Gray, Brandon.
