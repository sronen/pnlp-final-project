'''Frances Ethel Gumm''' (June 10, 1922 – June 22, 1969), professionally known as '''Judy Garland''', was an American actress, singer and vaudevillian. Through a career that spanned 45 of her 47 years and for her renowned [[contralto]] voice,&lt;ref&gt;Louis Bayard, [http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/52656045.html?dids=52656045:52656045&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Apr+16%2C+2000&amp;author=Louis+Bayard&amp;pub=The+Washington+Post&amp;desc=Supernova&amp;pqatl=google &quot;Supernova&quot;], ''Washington Post'', April 16, 2000, p. X9&lt;/ref&gt; she attained international stardom as an actress in musical and dramatic roles, as a [[musician|recording artist]] and on the concert stage. Respected for her versatility, she received a [[Academy Juvenile Award|Juvenile Academy Award]] and won a [[Golden Globe Award]], as well as [[Grammy Award]]s and a [[Special Tony Award]]. She was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] for her role in the remake of ''[[A Star is Born (1954 film)|A Star is Born]]'' and for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] for her performance in the 1961 film, ''[[Judgment at Nuremberg]]''. At 39 years of age, she remains the youngest recipient of the [[Cecil B. DeMille Award]] for lifetime achievement in the motion picture industry.

After appearing in [[vaudeville]] with her two older sisters, Garland was signed to [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] as a teenager. There she made more than two dozen films, including nine with [[Mickey Rooney]] and the 1939 film with which she would be most identified, ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]''. After 15 years, she was released from the studio but gained renewed success through record-breaking concert appearances, including a return to acting beginning with critically acclaimed performances.

Despite her professional triumphs, Garland battled personal problems throughout her life. Insecure about her appearance, her feelings were compounded by film executives who told her she was unattractive and manipulated her on-screen physical appearance. She was plagued by financial instability, often owing hundreds of thousands of dollars in [[back taxes]]. She married five times, with her first four marriages ending in divorce. She had a long struggle with alcohol and drug use during most of her career, dying of an accidental [[drug overdose]] at the age of 47, leaving children [[Liza Minnelli]], [[Lorna Luft]], and Joey Luft.

In 1997, Garland was posthumously awarded a [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]]. Several of her recordings have been inducted into the [[Grammy Hall of Fame Award|Grammy Hall of Fame]]. In 1999, the [[American Film Institute]] placed her among the ten [[AFI's 100 Years…100 Stars|greatest female stars]] in the history of [[Cinema of the United States|American cinema]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afi.com/100Years/stars.aspx http://www.afi.com/100Years/stars.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
[[File:Judy Garland Birth House Matt Anderson.JPG|thumb|240px|Garland's birthplace in [[Grand Rapids, Minnesota]]]]
Born '''Frances Ethel Gumm''' in [[Grand Rapids, Minnesota]], Garland was the youngest child of Ethel Marion (née Milne; November 17, 1893–January 5, 1953) and Francis Avent &quot;Frank&quot; Gumm (March 20, 1886–November 17, 1935). Her parents were [[vaudeville|vaudevillians]] who settled in Grand Rapids to run a movie theatre that featured vaudeville acts.

Garland's ancestry on both sides of her family can be traced back to the early [[Colonial history of the United States|colonial days of the United States]]. Her father was descended from the Marable family of [[Virginia]], her grandfather from a Milne ancestry from [[Aberdeen]],&lt;ref&gt;as she told an audience on May 29, 1951 in Edinburgh&lt;/ref&gt; and her maternal grandmother from a Patrick Fitzpatrick, who emigrated to America in the 1770s from Smithtown, [[County Meath]], Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McClure|first=Rhonda|title=Ancestry of Liza Minnelli|publisher=[[The Generations Network|Genealogy.com]]|date=June 13, 2002|url=http://www.genealogy.com/famousfolks/liza-minnelli|accessdate=December 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Named after both her parents and [[baptism|baptized]] at a local [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal church]], &quot;Baby&quot; (as she was called by her parents and sisters) shared her family's flair for song and dance. Her first appearance came at the age of two-and-a-half when she joined her two older sisters, Mary Jane &quot;Suzy/Suzanne&quot; Gumm (1915–1964) and Dorothy Virginia &quot;Jimmie&quot; Gumm (1917–1977), on the stage of her father's movie theater during a Christmas show and sang a chorus of &quot;[[Jingle Bells]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Shipman p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; Accompanied by their mother on piano, The Gumm Sisters performed there for the next few years. 

Following rumors that Frank Gumm had made sexual advances toward male ushers, the family relocated to [[Lancaster, California]] in June 1926.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; Frank purchased and operated another theater in Lancaster, and Ethel, acting as their manager, began working to get her daughters into motion pictures. &lt;!---Question: If she was born in 1922, how was she able to graduate from high school in the mid-1920s?] Answer: She didn't. She attended school at MGM and &quot;graduated&quot; from Hollywood High School.---&gt;

==Early career==
===The Gumm Sisters===
[[File:The Gumm Sisters.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Gumm Sisters, AKA The Garland Sisters, circa 1935, from left to right: Mary Jane, Frances Ethel (Judy Garland) and Dorothy Virginia Gumm.]]
In 1928, The Gumm Sisters enrolled in a dance school run by [[Ethel Meglin]], proprietress of the [[Meglin Kiddies]] dance troupe. They appeared with the troupe at its annual Christmas show.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, pp. 29–30&lt;/ref&gt; It was through the Meglin Kiddies that they made their film debut, in a 1929 short subject called ''The Big Revue''. This was followed by appearances in two [[Vitaphone]] shorts the following year, ''A Holiday in Storyland'' (featuring Garland's first on-screen solo) and ''The Wedding of Jack and Jill''. They next appeared together in ''Bubbles''. Their final on-screen appearance came in 1935, in another short entitled ''[[La Fiesta de Santa Barbara]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Finch pp. 43–47, 76&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1934, the trio, who by then had been touring the [[vaudeville]] circuit as &quot;The Gumm Sisters&quot; for many years, performed in Chicago at the [[Ford Center for the Performing Arts Oriental Theatre|Oriental Theater]] with [[George Jessel (actor)|George Jessel]]. He encouraged the group to choose a more appealing name after &quot;Gumm&quot; was met with laughter from the audience. According to theatrical legend, their act was once erroneously billed at a Chicago theater as &quot;The Glum Sisters&quot;.&lt;ref name=nytobit&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/books/00/04/09/specials/garland-obit.html Judy Garland, 47, Found Dead, ''The New York Times'', June 23, 1969]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Several stories persist regarding the origin of the name &quot;Garland&quot;. One is that it was originated by Jessel after [[Carole Lombard]]'s character Lily Garland in the film ''[[Twentieth Century (film)|Twentieth Century]]'' which was then playing at the Oriental; another is that the girls chose the surname after drama critic Robert Garland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Judy: Beyond the Rainbow|series=Biography|serieslink=Biography (TV series)|airdate=January 1, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Garland's daughter, Lorna Luft, stated that her mother selected the name when Jessel announced that the trio &quot;looked prettier than a garland of flowers&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Luft, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; Another variation surfaced when he was a guest on Garland's television show in 1963. He claimed that he had sent actress [[Judith Anderson]] a telegram containing the word &quot;garland,&quot; and it stuck in his mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Episode 12|series=The Judy Garland Show|airdate=November 1, 1963|season=1|number=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

By late 1934 the Gumm Sisters had changed their name to the Garland Sisters.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Program of Comedy Due --- Eddie Conrad Will Head Ebell Vaudeville.&quot; ''Los Angeles Times''. December 7, 1934. p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Frances changed her name to &quot;Judy&quot; soon after, inspired by a popular [[Hoagy Carmichael]] song.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;  By August 1935 they were broken up when Suzanne Garland flew to [[Reno, Nevada]] and married musician Lee Kahn, a member of the Jimmy Davis orchestra playing at [[Cal Neva Lodge &amp; Casino|Cal-Neva Lodge]], Lake Tahoe.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Nuptials Turn Trio to Duet --- Cupid Robs Radio Team --- Suzanne Garland Flies to Reno to Become Bride of Musician.&quot; ''Los Angeles Times''. August 15, 1935. p. A3.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Signed at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer===
[[File:Love Finds Andy Hardy trailer.JPG|thumb|left|250px|Garland with [[Mickey Rooney]] in ''[[Love Finds Andy Hardy]]'' (1938)]]
In 1935, Garland was signed to a contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, supposedly without a [[screen test]], though she had made a test for the studio several months earlier. It did not know what to do with her, as at age 13 she was older than the traditional child star but too young for adult roles. Her physical appearance created a dilemma for MGM. At only {{convert|4|ft|11.5|in|cm}}, her &quot;cute&quot; or &quot;[[girl next door]]&quot; looks did not exemplify the more glamorous persona required of leading ladies of the time. She was self-conscious and anxious about her appearance. &quot;Judy went to school at Metro with [[Ava Gardner]], [[Lana Turner]], [[Elizabeth Taylor]], real beauties,&quot; said [[Charles Walters]], who directed her in a number of films. &quot;Judy was the big money-maker at the time, a big success, but she was the [[The Ugly Duckling|ugly duckling]]&amp;nbsp;...I think it had a very damaging effect on her emotionally for a long time. I think it lasted forever, really.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Judy: Impressions of Garland|url=http://imdb.com/title/tt0813809|series=Omnibus|airdate=1972}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her insecurity was exacerbated by the attitude of studio chief [[Louis B. Mayer]], who referred to her as his &quot;little hunchback&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Wayne, p. 204&lt;/ref&gt; During her early years at the studio, she was photographed and dressed in plain garments or frilly juvenile gowns and costumes to match the &quot;girl next door&quot; image that was created for her. She was made to wear removable [[Crown (dentistry)|caps]] on her teeth and rubberized disks to reshape her nose.&lt;ref&gt;Frank p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; 

She performed at various studio functions and was eventually cast opposite [[Deanna Durbin]] in the musical short ''[[Every Sunday]]''. The film contrasted her [[alto]] vocal range&lt;ref name=&quot;hippodrome&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://users.deltacomm.com/rainbowz/con070951.html|title=Judy Garland at the Hippodrome|accessdate=September 5, 2008|publisher=Judy Garland – The Live Performances!}}&lt;/ref&gt; and swing style with Durbin's operatic soprano and served as an extended screen test for the pair, as studio executives were questioning the wisdom of having two girl singers on the roster.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; Mayer finally decided to keep both actresses, but by that time Durbin's option had lapsed and she was signed by [[Universal Studios]].

On November 16, 1935, in the midst of preparing for a radio performance on the ''[[Shell Oil Company|Shell]] Chateau Hour,'' Garland learned that her father, who had been hospitalized with [[meningitis]], had taken a turn for the worse. Frank Gumm died the following morning, on November 17, leaving her devastated. Her song for the ''Shell Chateau Hour'' was her first professional rendition of &quot;[[Zing! Went the Strings of My Heart]]&quot;, a song which would become a standard in many of her concerts.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke p. 58&lt;/ref&gt;

Garland next came to the attention of studio executives by singing a special arrangement of &quot;[[You Made Me Love You (I Didn't Want to Do It)|You Made Me Love You]]&quot; to [[Clark Gable]] at a birthday party held by the studio for the actor; her rendition was so well regarded that she performed the song in the all-star extravaganza ''[[Broadway Melody of 1938]]'' (1937), singing to a photograph of him.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; 

MGM hit on a winning formula when it paired Garland with [[Mickey Rooney]] in a string of &quot;backyard musicals&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitallyobsessed.com/displaylegacy.php?ID=9718|title=dOc DVD Review: Mickey Rooney &amp; Judy Garland Collection (Babes in Arms/Strike Up the Band/Babes on Broadway/Girl Crazy) (1939–1943)|publisher=Digitallyobsessed.com|date=April 1, 2009|accessdate=April 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The duo first appeared together in the 1937 [[B movie]] ''[[Thoroughbreds Don't Cry]]''. They became a sensation and teamed up again in ''[[Love Finds Andy Hardy]]''. She would eventually star with him in nine films. 

To keep up with the frantic pace of making one film after another, Garland, Rooney, and other young performers were constantly given [[amphetamine]]s, as well as [[barbiturate]]s to take before going to bed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Judy Garland: By Myself|series=[[American Masters]]|airdate=February 25, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Garland, this regular dose of drugs led to addiction and a lifelong struggle and contributed to her eventual demise. She later resented the hectic schedule and felt that her youth had been stolen from her by MGM. Despite successful film and recording careers, awards, critical praise and her ability to fill concert halls worldwide, she was plagued throughout her life with self-doubt and required constant reassurance that she was talented and attractive.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke pp. 135–36&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Wizard of Oz''===
[[File:Judy Garland in The Wizard of Oz trailer.jpg|thumb|240px|Garland as [[Dorothy Gale]] in ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' (1939)]]
In 1938, aged 16, she was cast as [[Dorothy Gale]] in ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' (1939), a film based on the children's book by [[L. Frank Baum]]. In this film, she sang the song for which she would forever be identified, &quot;[[Over the Rainbow]]&quot;. Although producers [[Arthur Freed]] and [[Mervyn LeRoy]] had wanted her from the start, studio chief Mayer tried first to borrow [[Shirley Temple]] from [[20th Century Fox]]. Her services were denied and Garland was cast.&lt;ref&gt;Juneau p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; 

She was initially outfitted in a blonde wig for the part, but Freed and LeRoy decided against it shortly into filming. Her breasts were bound with tape and she was made to wear a special corset to flatten out her curves and make her appear younger; her blue [[gingham]] dress was also chosen for its blurring effect on her figure.&lt;ref&gt;Finch pp. 134–35&lt;/ref&gt;

Shooting commenced on October 13, 1938,&lt;ref&gt;Clarke p. 95&lt;/ref&gt; and was completed on March 16, 1939,&lt;ref&gt;Clarke p. 100&lt;/ref&gt; with a final cost of more than US$2&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; With the conclusion of filming, MGM kept Garland busy with promotional tours and the shooting of ''[[Babes in Arms (film)|Babes in Arms]]''. She and Rooney were sent on a cross-country promotional tour, culminating in the August 17 New York City premiere at the Capitol Theater, which included a five-show-a-day appearance schedule for the two stars.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke pp. 102–03&lt;/ref&gt; 

''The Wizard of Oz'' was a tremendous critical success, though its high budget and promotions costs of an estimated $4&amp;nbsp;million coupled with the lower revenue generated by children's tickets meant that the film did not make a profit until it was re-released in the 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke p. 104&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[13th Academy Awards|1940 Academy Awards]] ceremony, Garland received an [[Academy Juvenile Award]] for her performances in 1939, including ''The Wizard of Oz'' and ''Babes in Arms''.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; Following this recognition, she became one of MGM's most bankable stars.

==Stardom as an adult==
[[File:Judy Garland in Meet Me in St Louis trailer 2.jpg|left|thumb|260px|Garland performing &quot;The Trolley Song&quot; in ''[[Meet Me in St. Louis]]'' (1944)]]
In 1940, she starred in three films: ''[[Andy Hardy Meets Debutante]]'', ''[[Strike Up the Band (film)|Strike Up the Band]]'', and ''[[Little Nellie Kelly]]''. In the latter, she played her first adult role, a dual role of both mother and daughter. ''Little Nellie Kelly'' was purchased from [[George M. Cohan]] as a vehicle for her to display both her audience appeal and her physical appearance. The role was a challenge for her, requiring the use of an accent, her first adult kiss, and the only death scene of her career.&lt;ref&gt;Juneau pp. 55–56&lt;/ref&gt; The success of these three films, and a further three films in 1941, secured her position at MGM as a major property.

During this time Garland experienced her first serious adult romances. The first was with the band leader [[Artie Shaw]]. She was deeply devoted to him and was devastated in early 1940 when he eloped with [[Lana Turner]].&lt;ref&gt;Frank pp. 148–49&lt;/ref&gt; Garland began a relationship with musician [[David Rose (musician)|David Rose]], and, on her 18th birthday, he gave her an engagement ring. The studio intervened because he was still married at the time to the actress and singer [[Martha Raye]]. They agreed to wait a year to allow for his divorce from her to become final, and were wed on July 27, 1941.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; Garland, who had aborted her pregnancy by him in 1942, agreed to a [[trial separation]] in January 1943, and they divorced in 1944.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke p. 211&lt;/ref&gt; She was noticeably thinner in her next film, ''[[For Me and My Gal (film)|For Me and My Gal]]'', alongside [[Gene Kelly]] in his first screen appearance. She was [[billing (filmmaking)|top billed]] over the credits for the first time and effectively made the transition from teenage star to adult actress.

At the age of 21, she was given the &quot;glamour treatment&quot; in ''[[Presenting Lily Mars]]'', in which she was dressed in &quot;grown-up&quot; gowns. Her lightened hair was also pulled up in a stylish fashion. However, no matter how glamorous or beautiful she appeared on screen or in photographs, she was never confident in her appearance and never escaped the &quot;girl next door&quot; image that had been created for her.&lt;ref&gt;Frank p 175&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:TillTheClouds3.jpg|thumb|Garland in ''[[Till the Clouds Roll By]]'' (1946)]]
One of Garland's most successful films for MGM was ''[[Meet Me in St. Louis]]'' (1944), in which she introduced three standards: &quot;[[The Trolley Song]]&quot;, &quot;[[The Boy Next Door (song)|The Boy Next Door]]&quot;, and &quot;[[Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas]]&quot;. [[Vincente Minnelli]] was assigned to direct and he requested that makeup artist Dorothy Ponedel be assigned to Garland. Ponedel refined her appearance in several ways, including extending and reshaping her eyebrows, changing her hairline, modifying her lip line and removing her nose discs. She appreciated the results so much that Ponedel was written into her contract for all her remaining pictures at MGM. 

During the filming of ''Meet Me in St. Louis'', after some initial conflict between them, Garland and Minnelli entered a relationship. They were married June 15, 1945,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hopper|first=Hedda|authorlink=Hedda Hopper|title=No More Tears for Judy|work=[[Woman's Home Companion]] |date=September 1954}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on March 12, 1946, daughter [[Liza Minnelli|Liza]] was born.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke p. 223&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951, they divorced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Judy Garland Files Suit for Divorce|publisher=U.P.|date=February 22, 1952}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Clock (film)|The Clock]]'' (1945) was her first straight dramatic film, opposite [[Robert Walker (actor)|Robert Walker]]. Though the film was critically praised and earned a profit, most movie fans expected her to sing. It would be many years before she acted again in a non-singing dramatic role. Garland's other famous films of the 1940s include ''[[The Harvey Girls]]'' (1946), in which she introduced the [[Academy Award]]-winning song &quot;[[On the Atchison, Topeka and the Santa Fe]]&quot;, and ''[[The Pirate]]'' (1948).

==Leaving Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer==
During filming for ''The Pirate'' in April 1947, Garland suffered a [[mental breakdown|nervous breakdown]] and was placed in a private [[Sanatorium|sanitarium]].&lt;ref&gt;Edwards p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; She was able to complete filming, but in July she undertook her first [[suicide|suicide attempt]], making minor cuts to her wrist with a broken glass.&lt;ref&gt;Frank p. 231&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, she spent two weeks in treatment at the [[Austen Riggs Center]], a psychiatric hospital in Stockbridge, Massachusetts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/episodes/judy-garland/career-timeline/601/ |title=Judy Garland – Career Timeline &amp;#124; American Masters |publisher=PBS |date=July 7, 2004 |accessdate=April 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following her work on ''The Pirate'', she completed three more films for MGM: ''[[Easter Parade (film)|Easter Parade]]'' (in which she danced with [[Fred Astaire]]), ''[[In the Good Old Summertime]]'', and her final film with MGM, ''[[Summer Stock]]''.

Because of her mental condition, Garland was unable to complete a series of films. During the filming of ''[[The Barkleys of Broadway]]'', she was taking [[Medical prescription|prescription]] sleeping medication along with illicitly obtained pills containing [[morphine]]. It was around this time she also developed a serious problem with [[alcohol]]. These, in combination with [[migraine]] headaches, led her to miss several shooting days in a row. After being advised by her doctor that she would only be able to work in four-to-five-day increments with extended rest periods between, MGM executive Arthur Freed made the decision to suspend her on July 18, 1948. She was replaced by [[Ginger Rogers]].&lt;ref&gt;Shipman p. 225&lt;/ref&gt;

Garland was cast in the film adaptation of ''[[Annie Get Your Gun (film)|Annie Get Your Gun]]'' in the title role of [[Annie Oakley]]. She was nervous at the prospect of taking on a role strongly identified with [[Ethel Merman]], anxious about appearing in an unglamorous part after breaking from juvenile parts for several years and disturbed by her treatment at the hands of director [[Busby Berkeley]]. She began arriving late to the set and sometimes failed to appear. She was suspended from the picture on May 10, 1949, and was replaced by [[Betty Hutton]].&lt;ref&gt;Clarke p. 255&lt;/ref&gt;

Garland was next cast in the film ''[[Royal Wedding]]'' with Fred Astaire after [[June Allyson]] became pregnant in 1950. She again failed to report to the set on multiple occasions and the studio suspended her contract on June 17, 1950. She was replaced by [[Jane Powell]].&lt;ref&gt;Frank p. 271&lt;/ref&gt; Reputable biographies following her death stated that after this latest dismissal, she slightly grazed her neck with a broken water glass, requiring only a [[Band-Aid]], but at the time, the public was informed that a despondent Garland had slashed her throat.&lt;ref name=Shana&gt;{{cite news|last=Alexander|first=Shana|title=Judy's New Rainbow|work=[[Life (magazine)|Life]]|date=June 2, 1961}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;All I could see ahead was more confusion,&quot; Garland later said of this suicide attempt. &quot;I wanted to black out the future as well as the past. I wanted to hurt myself and everyone who had hurt me.&quot;&lt;ref name=Hyams&gt;{{cite news|last=Hyams|first=Joe|authorlink=Joe Hyams|title=Crack-Up

==Later career==
===Renewed stardom on the stage===
In October 1951, Garland opened in a vaudeville-style, two-a-day engagement at [[Broadway theatre|Broadway's]] newly refurbished [[Palace Theatre (Broadway)|Palace Theatre]]. Her 19-week engagement exceeded all previous records for the theater, and was described as &quot;one of the greatest personal triumphs in show business history&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Garver|first=Jack|title=Judy Garland Ends Triumphant Vaudeville Run|publisher=UPI|date=February 24, 1952}}&lt;/ref&gt; Garland was honored for her contribution to the revival of vaudeville with a [[Special Tony Award]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Judy Garland|publisher=American Theatre Wing|url=http://www.tonyawards.com/p/tonys_search|accessdate=December 24, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1952, at the height of Garland's comeback, her mother Ethel was featured in a ''[[Los Angeles Times|Los Angeles Mirror]]'' story in which she revealed that while Garland was making a small fortune at the Palace, Ethel was working a [[white-collar worker|desk job]] at [[Douglas Aircraft Company]] for $61 a week.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke p. 311&lt;/ref&gt; They had been estranged for years, with Garland characterizing her mother as &quot;no good for anything except to create chaos and fear&quot; and accusing her of mismanaging and misappropriating her salary from the earliest days of her career.&lt;ref name=Plot&gt;{{cite news|last=Garland|first=Judy|title=The Plot Against Judy Garland|work=[[Ladies' Home Journal]]|date=August 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt; Garland's sister Virginia denied this, stating &quot;Mama never took a dime from Judy.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Shearer|first=Lloyd|title=Judy Garland's Sister: The Happy One in the Family|work=[[Parade (magazine)|Parade]]|date=October 4, 1964}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 5, 1953, Ethel Gumm was found dead in the Douglas Aircraft parking lot. She was 59 years old.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke p. 309&lt;/ref&gt;

===''A Star Is Born''===
[[File:Garland Star Born recrop.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Garland in ''[[A Star Is Born (1954 film)|A Star Is Born]]'' (1954)]]
In 1954, Garland filmed a [[A Star Is Born (1954 film)|musical remake]] of the 1937 film ''[[A Star Is Born (1937 film)|A Star is Born]]'' for [[Warner Bros.]] She and her third husband, [[Sid Luft]] (whom she had married in 1952) produced the film through their [[production company]], Transcona Enterprises, while Warner Bros. supplied the funds, production facilities, and crew.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, p. 308&lt;/ref&gt; Directed by [[George Cukor]] and costarring [[James Mason]], it was a large undertaking to which she initially fully dedicated herself. 

As shooting progressed, however, she began making the same pleas of illness which she had so often made during her final films at MGM. Production delays led to cost overruns and angry confrontations with Warner Bros. head [[Jack Warner]]. Principal photography wrapped on March 17, 1954. At Luft's suggestion, the &quot;Born in a Trunk&quot; medley was filmed as a showcase for her and inserted over director Cukor's objections, who feared the additional length would lead to cuts in other areas. It was completed on July 29.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke p. 319&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon its September 29, 1954 world premiere, the film was met with tremendous critical and popular acclaim. Before release, it was edited at the instruction of Jack Warner; theater operators, concerned that they were losing money because they were only able to run the film for three or four shows per day instead of five or six, pressured the studio to make additional reductions. About 30 minutes of footage was cut, sparking outrage among critics and filmgoers. ''A Star is Born'' ended up losing money, and the secure financial position Garland had expected from the profits did not materialize.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke p. 325&lt;/ref&gt; Transcona made no more films with Warner.&lt;ref&gt;Juneau p. 126&lt;/ref&gt;

Garland was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] and, in the run-up to the [[27th Academy Awards]], was generally expected to win. She could not attend the ceremony because she had just given birth to her son, Joseph Luft, so a television crew was in her hospital room with cameras and wires to televise her anticipated acceptance speech. The Oscar was won, however, by [[Grace Kelly]] for ''[[The Country Girl (1954 film)|The Country Girl]]'' (1954). The camera crew was packing up before Kelly could even reach the stage. [[Groucho Marx]] sent her a telegram after the awards ceremony, declaring her loss &quot;the biggest robbery since [[Great Brink's Robbery|Brinks]]&quot;. ''[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]'' magazine labeled her performance as &quot;just about the greatest one-woman show in modern movie history&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke p. 326&lt;/ref&gt; Garland won the [[Golden Globe Award]] for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|Best Actress in a Musical]] for the role.&lt;ref name=Globes&gt;{{cite web|title=Judy Garland|publisher=[[Hollywood Foreign Press Association]]|url=http://www.goldenglobes.org/browse/member/29377|accessdate=December 24, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Garland's films after ''A Star Is Born'' included ''[[Judgment at Nuremberg]]'' (1961) (for which she was Oscar- and Golden Globe-nominated for Best Supporting Actress), the animated feature ''[[Gay Purr-ee]]'' (1962), and ''[[A Child Is Waiting]]'' (1963) with [[Burt Lancaster]]. Her final film was ''[[I Could Go On Singing]]'' (1963), costarring [[Dirk Bogarde]].

===Television, concerts, and Carnegie Hall===
[[File:Judy Garland at Greek Theater.jpg|left|thumb|260px|Garland before a concert, circa 1957]]
Garland engaged [[Sidney Luft|Sid Luft]] as her manager the same year she divorced Minnelli.&lt;ref&gt;Juneau p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; He arranged a four-month concert tour of the United Kingdom, where she played to sold-out audiences throughout England, Scotland, and Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;Frank p. 304&lt;/ref&gt; It included her first appearances at the renowned [[London Palladium]], for a four-week stand in April.&lt;ref name = MacPherson&gt;{{cite news|last=MacPherson|first=Virginia|title=Judy Garland in Comeback with Palladium Contract|publisher=U.P.|date=April 10, 1951}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although some in the British press chided her before her opening for being &quot;too plump&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Gerold Frank, ''Judy'', page 326 (De Capo Press, 1999). ISBN 0-306-80894-3&lt;/ref&gt; she received rave reviews and the ovation was described by the Palladium manager as the loudest he had ever heard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=British Give Judy Garland Big Ovation|agency=Associated Press|date=April 10, 1951}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Garland and Luft were married on June 8, 1952, in [[Hollister, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Garver|first=Jack|title=Judy Garland Married With Simple Ceremony|publisher=U.P.|date=June 12, 1952}}&lt;/ref&gt; Garland gave birth to [[Lorna Luft]], herself a future actress and singer, on November 21, 1952, and to Joey Luft on March 29, 1955.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards p. 166&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 1955, Garland appeared in a number of [[television special]]s. The first, the 1955 debut episode of ''[[Ford Star Jubilee]]'', was the first full-scale color broadcast ever on [[CBS]] and was a ratings triumph, scoring a 34.8 [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen rating]]. She signed a three-year, $300,000 contract with the network. Only one additional special, a live concert edition of ''[[General Electric Theater]]'', was broadcast in 1956 before the relationship between the Lufts and CBS broke down in a dispute over the planned format of upcoming specials.&lt;ref&gt;Sanders p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1956, Garland performed four weeks at the [[New Frontier Hotel and Casino|New Frontier Hotel]] on the [[Las Vegas Strip]] for a salary of $55,000 per week, making her the highest-paid entertainer to work in Las Vegas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/episodes/judy-garland/about-judy-garland/600/ |title=Judy Garland – About Judy Garland &amp;#124; American Masters |publisher=PBS |date=July 7, 2004 |accessdate=April 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite a brief bout of [[laryngitis]], her performances there were so successful that her run was extended an extra week.&lt;ref&gt;Frank pp. 420–21&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year she returned to the Palace Theatre, site of her two-a-day triumph. She opened in September, once again to rave reviews and popular acclaim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

In November 1959 Garland was hospitalized, diagnosed with acute [[hepatitis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

She was told by doctors that she likely had five years or less to live, and that even if she did survive she would be a semi-invalid and would never sing again.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke p. 347&lt;/ref&gt; She initially felt &quot;greatly relieved&quot; at the diagnosis. &quot;The pressure was off me for the first time in my life.&quot;&lt;ref name = Shana /&gt; However, she recovered over the next several months and, in August of that year, returned to the stage of the Palladium. She felt so warmly embraced by the British that she announced her intention to move permanently to England.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke p. 349&lt;/ref&gt;

Her concert appearance at Carnegie Hall on April 23, 1961, was a considerable highlight, called by many &quot;the greatest night in show business history&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

In 1961, Garland and CBS settled their contract disputes with the help of her new agent, [[Freddie Fields]], and negotiated a new round of specials. The first, entitled ''The Judy Garland Show'', aired in 1962 and featured guests [[Frank Sinatra]] and [[Dean Martin]].&lt;ref&gt;Sanders p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; Following this success, CBS made a $24&amp;nbsp;million offer to her for a weekly television series of her own, also to be called ''[[The Judy Garland Show]]'', which was deemed at the time in the press to be &quot;the biggest talent deal in TV history&quot;. Although she had said as early as 1955 that she would never do a weekly television series,&lt;ref name=Parsons&gt;{{cite news|last=Parsons|first=Louella|authorlink=Louella Parsons|title=TV Spectacular Gives New Rainbow to Judy|work=[[The Daily Review]]|date =September 23, 1955}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the early 1960s she was in a financially precarious situation. She was several hundred thousand dollars in debt to the [[Internal Revenue Service]], having failed to pay taxes in 1951 and 1952, and the failure of ''A Star is Born'' meant that she received nothing from that investment.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; A successful run on television was intended to secure her financial future.

Following a third special, ''Judy Garland and Her Guests [[Phil Silvers]] and [[Robert Goulet]]'', Garland's weekly series debuted September 29, 1963.&lt;ref&gt;Sanders p. 391&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Judy Garland Show'' was critically praised,&lt;ref&gt;Sanders pp. 108–109&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lewis|first=Richard Warren|title=The TV Troubles of Judy Garland|work=[[The Saturday Evening Post]]|date=December 7, 1963}}&lt;/ref&gt; but for a variety of reasons (including being placed in the time slot opposite ''[[Bonanza]]'' on [[NBC]]) the show lasted only one season and was canceled in 1964 after 26 episodes. Despite its short run, the series was nominated for four [[Emmy Award]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Awards for The Judy Garland Show (1963)|publisher=[[Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences]]|url=http://www.emmys.tv/awards/awardsearch.php|accessdate=December 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The demise of the series was personally and financially devastating for Garland. 

Garland sued Luft for divorce in 1963, claiming &quot;cruelty&quot; as the grounds. She also asserted that he had repeatedly struck her while he was drinking and that he had attempted to take their children from her by force.&lt;ref name=Divorce&gt;{{cite news|title=Judy Wins Divorce From Sid Luft|work=[[Wisconsin State Journal]]|date=May 20, 1965}}&lt;/ref&gt; She had filed for divorce from Luft more than once previously, including as early as 1956, but had reconciled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Irwin|first=Elson|title=Judy Garland: Femme Fatale|work=[[Stars and Stripes (newspaper)|Stars and Stripes]]|date=November 17, 1968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Final years==
[[File:Mickey Deans Judy Garland Allan Warren.jpg|right|thumb|250px|[[Mickey Deans]] and Garland, at their wedding in March 1969, only three months before her death]]
With the demise of her television series, Garland returned to the stage. Most notably, she performed at the [[London Palladium]] with her then 18-year-old daughter [[Liza Minnelli]] in November 1964. The concert, which was also filmed for British television network [[ITV]], was one of her final appearances at the venue. She made guest appearances on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'', ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson|The Tonight Show]]'', ''[[The Hollywood Palace]]'', and ''[[The Merv Griffin Show]]'', on which she guest-hosted an episode.&lt;ref&gt;DiOrio, p. 202&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1964 tour of Australia was largely disastrous. Garland's first concert in Sydney, held in the [[Sydney Stadium]] because no concert hall could accommodate the crowds who wanted to see her, went well and received positive reviews. Her second performance, in Melbourne, started an hour late. The crowd of 7,000, angered by her tardiness and believing her to be drunk, booed and heckled her, and she fled the stage after just 45 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards p. 213&lt;/ref&gt; She later characterized the Melbourne crowd as &quot;brutish&quot;.&lt;ref name=Plot /&gt; A second concert in Sydney was uneventful but the Melbourne appearance garnered her significant bad press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Judy Garland Locks Self in Hotel Room|work=[[Stars and Stripes (newspaper)|Stars and Stripes]]|publisher=[[United Press International|UPI]]|date=May 24, 1964}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of that bad press was deflected by the announcement of a near fatal episode of [[pleurisy]].

Garland's tour promoter [[Mark Herron]] announced that they had married aboard a freighter off the coast of Hong Kong; however, she was not legally divorced from Luft at the time the ceremony was performed.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards p. 214&lt;/ref&gt; It became final on May 19, 1965,&lt;ref name=Divorce /&gt; but she and Herron did not legally marry until November 14, 1965 and then separated six months later.&lt;ref&gt;Frank p. 556&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1967, Garland was cast as Helen Lawson in ''[[Valley of the Dolls (film)|Valley of the Dolls]]'' for [[20th Century Fox]].&lt;ref&gt;Seaman, pp. 292–93&lt;/ref&gt; During the filming, she missed rehearsals and was fired in April, replaced by [[Susan Hayward]].&lt;ref&gt;Seaman, p. 343&lt;/ref&gt; Her [[soundtrack|prerecording]] of the song &quot;I'll Plant My Own Tree&quot; survived, along with her [[stage clothes|wardrobe tests]].

Returning to the stage, Garland made her last appearances at New York's Palace Theatre in July, a 16-show tour, performing with her children Lorna and Joey Luft. She wore a sequined pantsuit on stage for this tour, which was part of the original wardrobe for her character in ''Valley of the Dolls.''&lt;ref&gt;Shipman p. 494&lt;/ref&gt;

By early 1969, Garland's health had deteriorated. She performed in London at the [[Hippodrome, London|Talk of the Town]] nightclub for a five-week run&lt;ref&gt;Clarke p. 412&lt;/ref&gt; and made her last concert appearance in [[Copenhagen]] during March 1969.&lt;ref&gt;DiOrio, p. 204&lt;/ref&gt; She married her fifth and final husband, musician  [[Mickey Deans]], at Chelsea Register Office, London, on March 15, 1969,&lt;ref&gt;Steiger, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; her divorce from Herron having been finalized on February 11.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards p. 275&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
On June 22, 1969, Garland was found dead by Deans in the bathroom of their rented house in [[Chelsea, London]]. At the subsequent inquest, coroner Gavin Thursdon stated that the cause of death was &quot;an incautious [[drug overdose|self-overdosage]]&quot; of [[barbiturate]]s; her blood contained the equivalent of ten {{convert|1.5|gr|mg|adj=on|lk=in}} [[secobarbital|Seconal]] capsules.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke p. 422&lt;/ref&gt; Thursdon stressed that the overdose had been unintentional and that there was no evidence to suggest she had committed suicide. Her autopsy showed that there was no inflammation of her stomach lining and no drug residue there, which indicated that the drug had been ingested over a long period of time, rather than in one dose. Her death certificate stated that her death had been &quot;accidental&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Judy Garland The Live Performances. The End of the Rainbow

Her ''Wizard of Oz'' costar [[Ray Bolger]] commented at her funeral, &quot;She just plain wore out.&quot; 

On June 26, Deans took Garland's remains to New York City, where an estimated 20,000 people lined up for hours at the [[Frank E. Campbell Funeral Chapel]] in [[Manhattan]] to pay their respects. On June 27, [[James Mason]] gave a eulogy at the funeral, an [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] service led by the Rev. Peter A. Delaney of [[St Marylebone Parish Church|Marylebone Church]], London, who had officiated at her marriage to Deans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=End of the Rainbow|work=TIME|date=July 4, 1969|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,840196-1,00.html|accessdate=December 18, 2007}} {{Cite web|last=Van Gelder|first=Lawrence|title=Judy Garland's Funeral Draws Her Colleagues|work=The New York Times: Books|date=June 28, 1969|url=http://www.nytimes.com/books/00/04/09/specials/garland-funeral.html?_r=5|accessdate =August 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The public and press were barred.
