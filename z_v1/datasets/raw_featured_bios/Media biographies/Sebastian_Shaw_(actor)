'''Sebastian Lewis Shaw''' (29 May 1905 – 23 December 1994) was an English [[actor]], [[theatre director|director]], [[novelist]], [[playwright]] and [[poet]]. During his 65-year career, Shaw appeared in dozens of stage performances and more than 40 film and television productions.

Shaw was born and raised in [[Holt, Norfolk|Holt]], [[Norfolk]] and made his acting debut at age eight at a London theatre. He studied acting at [[Gresham's School]] and the [[Royal Academy of Dramatic Art]]. Although he worked primarily on the London stage, he made his [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] debut in 1929, when he played one of the two murderers in ''[[Rope (play)|Rope's End]]''. He appeared in his first film, ''Caste'', in 1930 and quickly began to create a name for himself in films. Nevertheless, he described himself as a &quot;rotten actor&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Telegraph Obit&quot;&gt;&quot;Sebastian Shaw Obituary,&quot; ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', 2 January 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; as a youth and said his success was primarily due to his good looks. He claimed to mature as a performer only after returning from service in the [[Royal Air Force]] during [[World War II]].

Shaw was particularly known for his performances in [[William Shakespeare]] productions, which were considered daring and ahead of their time. In 1966, he joined the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]], where he remained for a decade and delivered some of his most acclaimed performances. He also wrote several poems and a novel, ''The Christening'', in 1975. He is also known for his brief but important performance in ''[[Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi|Return of the Jedi]]'', the original third installment in the ''[[Star Wars]]'' franchise, in which he portrayed an unmasked [[Darth Vader]] and as [[Anakin Skywalker]]'s ghost in the original version of the film.

==Early life and career==
Shaw was born in [[Holt, Norfolk]] in England on 29 May 1905. He was one of three children born to [[Geoffrey Shaw (composer)|Dr. Geoffrey Shaw]], the [[Music education|music master]] at [[Gresham's School]], a [[North Norfolk]] independent boarding school, where Shaw began his education.&lt;ref name=&quot;Better Than Beefcake&quot;&gt;Leech, Richard. &quot;Better Than Beefcake: Sebastian Shaw,&quot; ''[[The Guardian]]'', 29 December 1994, Features (section), pg. T12.&lt;/ref&gt; His uncle, [[Martin Shaw (composer)|Martin Shaw]], was a composer of [[church music]], and his family's love of music heavily influenced Shaw's career path.&lt;ref name=&quot;Times Obit&quot;&gt;&quot;Sebastian Shaw,&quot; ''[[The Times]]'', 30 December 1994, Features (section).&lt;/ref&gt; Shaw made his acting debut at age eight on the London stage as one of the juvenile band in ''The Cockyolly Bird'' at the [[Royal Court Theatre]] in [[Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea|Chelsea]] &lt;ref name=&quot;Better Than Beefcake&quot; /&gt; on [[New Year's Day]] of 1914.&lt;ref name=&quot;Times Obit&quot; /&gt; During his time at Gresham's, he also played [[Petruchio]] in ''[[The Taming of the Shrew]]'', his first of many performances from the works of [[William Shakespeare]]; classmate [[W.H. Auden]], who would go on to become a highly regarded poet, portrayed Katherina in the play opposite him. After Gresham's, Shaw planned to become a painter and spent two years at the [[Slade School of Fine Art]] before switching his interests to acting; regarding the change, his father informed him, &quot;I wondered when you would come to your senses.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Times Obit&quot; /&gt; He earned a scholarship to the [[Royal Academy of Dramatic Art]] in [[Bloomsbury]], London.&lt;ref name=&quot;Better Than Beefcake&quot; /&gt; Actor [[Charles Laughton]] enrolled in the Academy at the same time as Shaw, who later said his first impression of Laughton was &quot;a poor fat boy&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Post Shaw&quot;&gt;[[Michael Kernan|Kernan, Michael]]. &quot;Sebastian Shaw &amp; the Shades of the Bard&quot; ''[[The Washington Post]]'', 1 March 1980, Style (section), pg. B2.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Shaw and his fellow students initially felt pity for Laughton, they were quickly impressed with his talent.&lt;ref name=&quot;Post Shaw&quot; /&gt;
[[Image:sebastian_shaw.jpg|thumb|left|160px|A young Sebastian Shaw]]

Shaw appeared in regional theatres in [[Bristol]], [[Liverpool]] and [[Hull Repertory Theatre Company|Hull]]. In 1925, he performed in London as the Archangel in ''The Sign of the Sun'', and played first Lewis Dodd and then the Major in separate productions of ''The Constant Nymph''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Telegraph Obit&quot; /&gt; He received instruction in verse speaking under famed theatre director [[William Bridges-Adams (Theatre director)|William Bridges-Adams]] in the [[Stratford Shakespeare Festival|Stratford Festival Company]] at [[Stratford-upon-Avon]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Times Obit&quot;/&gt; where he played some of his early Shakespeare roles, including [[Romeo Montague|Romeo]] in ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', Ferdinand in ''[[The Tempest]]'' and Prince Hal in ''[[Henry IV, Part 1|Henry IV]]'' in 1926. He was criticised for the audacity he displayed in the latter role. When Prince Hal takes on his kingship and rejects the self-indulgent character [[Falstaff]], convention of the day called for Prince Hal to change from a jovial drinking partner to an arrogant snob, but Shaw saw the view as simple-minded and contradictory toward Shakespeare's script. Instead, he displayed inward regrets about leaving Falstaff and accepting the new responsibilities. The interpretation was criticised at the time but, years later, became the standard approach to the character.&lt;ref name=&quot;Express and Star&quot;&gt;Seaton, Ray. &quot;Mr. Shaw's Voyage of Discovery,&quot; ''[[Express and Star]]'', 29 April 1974.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shaw made his [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] debut in 1929, when he played the murderer Wyndham Brandon in [[Patrick Hamilton (dramatist)|Patrick Hamilton's]] stage thriller, ''[[Rope (play)|Rope's End]]''; although he played the role in [[New York City|New York]], he was passed over when the show moved to London. In 1929, he married Margaret Delamere and lived with her in [[Albany (London)|the Albany]], an apartment complex off of [[Piccadilly]] in London.&lt;ref name=&quot;Better Than Beefcake&quot; /&gt; The two would eventually have a daughter together named Drusilla (born 1932).&lt;ref name=&quot;Telegraph Memoriam&quot;&gt;&quot;IN MEMORIAM Mr. Sebastian Shaw,&quot; ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', 15 February 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to the works of William Shakespeare in 1931, playing Claudio in ''[[Measure for Measure]]'' at London's [[Fortune Playhouse]]. In 1932 he once again played Romeo at the [[Embassy Theatre (London)|Embassy Theatre]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Telegraph Obit&quot; /&gt; Other works around this period included productions of [[Ivor Novello|Ivor Novello's]] ''Sunshine Sisters'' in 1933, ''Double Door'' alongside actress [[Sybil Thorndike]] in 1934, [[J.M. Barrie|J.M. Barrie's]] ''A Kiss for Cinderella'' in 1937, and [[Robert Morley|Robert Morley's]] ''Goodness, How Sad!'' in 1938.&lt;ref name=&quot;Times Obit&quot; /&gt;

The first film Shaw appeared in was ''Caste'' in 1930. He soon began to make a name for himself in films such as ''Brewster's Millions'' in 1935, ''Men Are Not Gods'' in 1936 and ''Farewell Again'' in 1937.&lt;ref name=&quot;Telegraph Obit&quot; /&gt; He was making about [[Pound sterling|£300]] a week during this stage of his career,&lt;ref name=&quot;Better Than Beefcake&quot; /&gt; which translates to about £15,500 in 2007. He brought what ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' described as a &quot;smooth villainy&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Telegraph Obit&quot; /&gt; to the role of Frank Sutton in ''The Squeaker'' in 1937, while in 1939 he played the hero Cmdr. David Blacklock alongside [[Conrad Veidt]] and [[Valerie Hobson]] in ''[[The Spy in Black]]'', [[Michael Powell (director)|Michael Powell]] and [[Emeric Pressburger]]'s first collaboration.&lt;ref name=&quot;Telegraph Obit&quot; /&gt; Shaw described himself as a film buff and called [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]]-winning actor [[Spencer Tracy]] his &quot;great god of all screen actors&quot;;&lt;ref name=&quot;Starlog&quot;&gt;Pirani, Adam. &quot;Sebastian Shaw: The Return of Anakin Skywalker,&quot; ''[[Starlog]]'', July 1987, Vol. 11, Iss. 120, pg. 56–57,+96.&lt;/ref&gt; he was so impressed by Tracy's technique that he claimed to become depressed while watching his films because Tracy made acting look simple, while Shaw claimed to find it so difficult to master himself.&lt;ref name=&quot;Starlog&quot; /&gt;

==World War II and post-war career==
When [[World War II]] broke out, Shaw took a break from acting and joined the [[Royal Air Force]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Better Than Beefcake&quot; /&gt; He was commissioned as an Acting-[[Pilot Officer]] on probation in the Administrative and Special Duties Branch on 25 April 1941&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=35171|startpage=2952|date=23 May 1941|accessdate=2 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and over the next three months was promoted to Pilot Officer on probation,&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=35391|startpage=7255|date=23 December 1941|accessdate=2 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; then [[flying officer]]&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=35606|startpage=2767|date=23 June 1942|accessdate=2 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then [[Flight Lieutenant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=36618|supp=yes|startpage=3402|endpage=3403|date=18 July 1944|accessdate=2 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to his obituary in ''[[The Guardian]]'', he saw little action in the service and was told the only chance he would have to fly would be as a [[tail gunner|rear gunner]]. Some of his fellow airmen hounded Shaw for autographs while others mocked his posh accent, to which he retaliated with an excellent and unflattering imitation of their less refined speech.&lt;ref name=&quot;Better Than Beefcake&quot; /&gt; He continued to hold a [[Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve]] commission after the war until he resigned the commission in 10 February 1954; he was permitted to retain his rank.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=40271|supp=yes|startpage=5138|endpage=5140|date=3 September 1954|accessdate=2 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Immediately upon returning to London after the war, Shaw lost his Albany flat and his acting contract, and essentially had to restart his acting career.&lt;ref name=&quot;Better Than Beefcake&quot; /&gt; Although he made 20 films before [[World War II|the war]] and had already began to develop a reputation as a strong leading man, in later years he would describe himself as &quot;a rotten actor&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Telegraph Obit&quot; /&gt; in the 1930s who landed roles based mainly on his good looks. He used the phrase &quot;a piece of cinema [[beefcake]]&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Telegraph Obit&quot; /&gt; to describe himself as an actor during that period,&lt;ref name=&quot;Telegraph Obit&quot; /&gt; and felt it was after his return home from military service that he learned to act properly and began to mature as a performer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Better Than Beefcake&quot; /&gt; Shaw's Royal Air Force experience was put to good use when he played a pilot in ''Journey Together'', the 1946 RAF training film in which actor [[Edward G. Robinson]] coached actor [[Richard Attenborough]] in the rudiments of flying.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Independent&quot;&gt;Benedick, Adan. &quot;Sebastian Shaw,&quot; ''[[The Independent]]'', 13 February 1995 Gazette (section), pg. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1945, Shaw returned to the Embassy Theatre to direct [[Fyodor Dostoevsky|Fyodor Dostoevsky's]] ''[[The Gambler (novel)|The Gambler]]''. Significant theatre roles that decade included [[Hercules]] in ''The Thracian Horses'' at the [[Lyric Hammersmith|Lyric Theatre]], [[Hammersmith]] in 1946, Mr. Hern-Lawrence in [[Florida Scott-Maxwell]]'s experimental ''I Said to Myself'' at the [[Mercury Theatre, Notting Hill Gate]] in 1947,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=3 July 1947|title=Classified Advertising: Theatre|journal=[[The Times]]|location=London|issue=50803|pages=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sir James Kirkham in ''[[His Excellency (opera)|His Excellency]]'' at [[Shaftesbury Theatre|Prince's Theatre]] in 1950, and Filmer Jesson, [[Member of Parliament|MP]], in [[Arthur Wing Pinero|Arthur Wing Pinero's]] ''His House In Order'' at [[Noël Coward Theatre|New Theatre]] in 1951. In 1956, he played the title role in the first English production of [[Hugo von Hofmannsthal|Hugo von Hofmannsthal's]] ''[[Everyman (play)|Everyman]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Telegraph Obit&quot; /&gt; That same year, he wrote the lyrics to his father's ballad-opera, ''All at Sea'', which played at the [[Royal College of Music]]. In 1957, he played [[Lucifer]] in ''Brother Lucifer'' in [[Shrewsbury]], [[Shropshire]], and a sinister [[Venice|Venetian]] agent in Jonathan Griffin's ''The Hidden King'' in [[Edinburgh]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Times Obit&quot; /&gt;

As Shaw grew older, his reputation as a dramatic actor grew stronger, and he became known for a sharp intelligence and dignified style. Although his good looks diminished, reviewers felt that he used his florid and weatherbeaten face well in evoking grandeur and self-assuredness in such roles as generals, priests and his familiar Shakespearean parts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Telegraph Obit&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Independent&quot; /&gt; In 1956, his wife Margaret Delamere died; she was survived by their daughter Drusilla.&lt;ref name=&quot;Telegraph Memoriam&quot; /&gt; Shaw began a romantic relationship in the mid-1950s with [[Joan Ingpen]], the well-known [[classical music]] and [[opera]] talent agent who had previously represented him. The two were romantically involved, to the point that she even took his surname, until Shaw's death.&lt;ref name=&quot;Obituary:Joan Ingpen&quot;&gt;Sutcliffe, Tom. [http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2008/jan/14/classicalmusicandopera.art &quot;Obituary: Joan Ingpen, Inspirational artistic organiser at Covent Garden, Paris Opera and the New York Met,&quot;] ''[[The Guardian]]'', 14 January 2008, Obituaries Pages (section), pg. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1980s, however, Shaw also had a brief relationship with Harriet Ravenscroft, the mother of disc jockey [[John Peel]], whom he met while performing at [[Ludlow Castle]] at [[Ludlow]]. He split his time between Ingpen and Ravenscroft on a four-day rotating basis to which both women consented. Although Peel got along with Shaw and said he made his mother happy, he said he did not feel comfortable with the arrangement and felt it disrupted his mother's friendships and prospects for a more stable relationship.&lt;ref name=&quot;John Peel&quot;&gt;[[:John Peel|Peel, John]] and Ravenscroft, Sheila (2007). ''Margrave of the Marches'', Chicago: Chicago Review Press, pg. 87–89. ISBN 1556526520.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, British theatre director [[William Gaskill]] was named artistic director of the Royal Court Theatre, where he hoped to re-establish a repertoire. He approached Shaw, who had made his acting début at the Royal Court Theatre as a youth, and Shaw agreed to return.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Independent&quot; /&gt; There he delivered several performances over the next year, including General Conrad von Hotzendorf in [[Joan Osborne]]'s ''[[A Patriot for Me]]''; various roles in [[Ann Jellicoe]]'s ''Shelley''; Sir Francis Harker in [[N.F. Simpson]]'s ''[[The Cresta Run]]'' and [[Private (rank)|Pte]] Atterclife in [[John Arden]]'s ''[[Serjeant Musgrave's Dance]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Telegraph Obit&quot; /&gt;

==Royal Shakespeare Company==
In 1966, Shaw joined the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]], where he spent the next decade of his career&lt;ref name=&quot;Better Than Beefcake&quot; /&gt; and eventually became an associate artist.&lt;ref name=&quot;Times Obit&quot; /&gt; He mostly appeared in Shakespeare plays, including the title role in ''[[Cymbeline]]'', [[Edmund of Langley]] in ''[[Richard II (play)|Richard II]]'',&lt;ref name=&quot;Telegraph Obit&quot; /&gt; the King in ''[[All's Well That Ends Well]]'', [[Odysseus|Ulysses]] in ''[[Troilus and Cressida]]'', and Leonato in ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Times Obit&quot; /&gt; ''[[The Times]]'' described his performance in the title role of ''[[Cymbeline]]'' as &quot;awe-inspiring&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Times Obit&quot; /&gt; and ''[[The Independent]]'' described his performance as [[Polonius]] in ''[[Hamlet]]'' as &quot;unrivalled in his complacency and sense of circumstance&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Independent&quot; /&gt; The ''Telegraph'' described his performance of Gloucester in ''[[King Lear]]'' as &quot;doleful&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Telegraph Obit&quot; /&gt; and his performance of [[Duncan I of Scotland|Duncan]] in ''[[Macbeth]]'' as &quot;decent&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Telegraph Obit&quot; /&gt; Many of the company's Shakespearean productions at the time were considered interpretive and modern, which drew criticism from some traditionalists, but Shaw defended the experimental nature of the shows and rejected the notion that plays should be restricted to preconceived interpretations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Express and Star&quot; /&gt;

During his time with the company, he also demonstrated what the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' called a &quot;crusty charm&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Telegraph Obit&quot; /&gt; as Sir Oblong Fitz Oblong in [[Robert Bolt|Robert Bolt's]] children's play ''The Thwarting of Baron Bolligrew''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Telegraph Obit&quot; /&gt; He was also noted as possessing a gift for [[Deadpan|dry comedy]] during this period of his acting career, exemplified by his roles in [[Maxim Gorky|Maxim Gorky's]] plays ''Enemies'' and ''[[Summerfolk (play)|Summerfolk]]''. He demonstrated a particular knack for [[Russia]]n comedy in [[Jonathan Miller|Jonathan Miller's]] productions of the [[Anton Chekhov]] plays ''[[Three Sisters (play)|Three Sisters]]'' and ''[[Ivanov (play)|Ivanov]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Telegraph Obit&quot; /&gt;

In 1978, Shaw earned acclaim for his performance as a judge in the stage debut of ''[[Whose Life Is It Anyway?]]'' at the Mermaid Theatre, where he had debuted his first play 17&amp;nbsp;years earlier. The production won [[Laurence Olivier Awards]] for Best Play and Best Actor ([[Tom Conti]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Telegraph Obit&quot; /&gt; Although 73&amp;nbsp;years old, Shaw did not let his age slow down his career. During the run of this production a mugger tried to steal his money, but Shaw chased him down, tackled him and recovered his property. Later that year, he was painted in the nude by his nephew, Brian Ocean.&lt;ref name=&quot;Better Than Beefcake&quot; /&gt; During his later years, Shaw suffered a physical disability that made him tremble, which had a negative impact on his television roles, particularly when handling cups or trays of drinks. One of his later television appearances was in ''[[The Old Curiosity Shop (1979 miniseries)|The Old Curiosity Shop]]'', a 1979 mini-series based on the novel by [[Charles Dickens]]. Around this time, he also voiced the part of Squire Beltham in a radio production of ''[[The Adventures of Harry Richmond]]'', which the ''Daily Telegraph'' said was &quot;remembered with affection&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Telegraph Obit&quot; /&gt; He lent his voice to several radio performances, both Shakespearean and modern, including protagonist John Tanner in the five-hour ''[[Man and Superman]]'' by [[George Bernard Shaw]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Times Obit&quot; /&gt;

==Writing career==
Shaw wrote ''Take a Life'', his first play, in 1961. He directed a production of the show at London's [[Mermaid Theatre]], where he also played the lead role of the Detective.&lt;ref name=&quot;Better Than Beefcake&quot;/&gt; That same year he played two lead roles in [[George Bernard Shaw]] plays at the [[Dublin Theatre Festival]]: ''[[Mrs. Warren's Profession]]'' and ''[[Candida (play)|Candida]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Telegraph Obit&quot; /&gt; Around this time, he also wrote an outline for a [[television comedy]] [[Television program|series]] about four girls sharing a flat, inspired by his real-life daughter, who was in her early twenties and living in a flat with other girls her age. The series was submitted to the [[Granada Television]] company, which expressed interest in the show and said it was one of two under consideration for television. The company ultimately chose the other show, the long-running British soap opera ''[[Coronation Street]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Express and Star&quot; /&gt;

Shaw agreed to take certain roles only on the condition that he have complete freedom to rewrite his dialogue. When he appeared in ''[[It Happened Here]]'', a 1966 World War II film, he wrote many of his own lines, which the filmmakers later said &quot;gave his dialogue an individual slant which enhanced his performance&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Independent&quot; /&gt; He also helped in other aspects of the filmmaking, including casting; he introduced the filmmakers to Fiona Leland, who would be cast as Shaw's wife in ''It Happened Here''.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Independent&quot; /&gt; He wrote other plays, including ''The Ship's Bell'', ''The Cliff Walk'', ''The Glass Maze'' and ''Cul de Sac''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Post Shaw&quot; /&gt; He also wrote ''Poems'', a collection of his personal poetry, which saw a limited print of 300 editions by publisher [[University of Exeter|Exeter University]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Sebastian Shaw Poems&quot;&gt;Shaw, Sebastian (1969). ''Poems - Sebastian Shaw'', [[Exeter]]: [[University of Exeter]]. ISBN n/a.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shaw wrote ''The Christening'', his only novel, in 1975.&lt;ref name=&quot;Telegraph Obit&quot; /&gt; It centres around Miles Madgwick, who believes that he is [[bisexual]] but is too timid to find out through physical intercourse, so he instead describes his most intimate thoughts in his diary. He then meets a married woman named Alice and her son, Rodney; he comes to identify with Rodney's childhood innocence, and in Alice sees a symbol both of his mother and a heterosexual lover. Alice starts to tire of her husband and grow fonder of Madgwick, who experiences mixed emotions in his continued interactions with her and Rodney. One night, Rodney stays overnight at Madgwick's house and, when he takes the boy home in a taxicab, the driver observes their strange behaviour and accuses Madgwick of being a [[pederast]]. When Alice asks Madgwick to become the godfather to her new child, the driver threatens to expose Madgwick, creating a conflict between losing his first feelings of intimacy with others or facing humiliation and ridicule at the driver's exposure.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Christening&quot;&gt;Shaw, Sebastian (1975). ''The Christening'', London: [[Virgin Books|W.H. Allen Ltd]]. ISBN 0491018231.&lt;/ref&gt;

A description in the book cover flap reads, &quot;In this tender, sensitive and blackly comic novel, Sebastian Shaw, the distinguished Shakespearean actor, explores areas of sexual and emotional encounter that are rarely seen and, unfortunately, too rarely understood.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Telegraph Obit&quot; /&gt; Shaw originally planned to call the novel ''The Godfather'', but later said he was glad he did not due to the popularity of [[Mario Puzo|Mario Puzo's]] book of [[The Godfather (novel)|that name]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Express and Star&quot; /&gt; He was said to have been working on another novel shortly after ''The Christening'' was completed, but no others were ever published.&lt;ref name=&quot;Express and Star&quot; /&gt;

==''Return of the Jedi''==
[[File:Sebastian Shaw as Anakin Skywalker.jpg|thumb|right|Shaw in his portrayal as [[Darth Vader]], unmasked in ''[[Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi|Return of the Jedi]]'']]In 1982, Shaw was chosen for the small but crucial role of [[Darth Vader]] in ''[[Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi|Return of the Jedi]]'', the third and final film in the [[Star Wars#Original trilogy|original Star Wars trilogy]]. Although [[David Prowse]] played the costumed scenes and [[James Earl Jones]] voiced Darth Vader, just as they had in the first two films, Shaw was cast in a single scene with [[Mark Hamill]], during the moment aboard ''[[Death Star|Death Star II]]'' when [[Luke Skywalker|Luke]] unmasks his dying father. Since the scene was unarguably the emotional climax of the film, the casting crew wanted an experienced actor for the role.&lt;ref name=&quot;Starlog&quot; /&gt; 

When Shaw arrived at the set for filming, he ran into his friend [[Ian McDiarmid]], the actor playing Emperor [[Palpatine]]. When McDiarmid asked him what he was doing there, Shaw responded, &quot;I don't know, dear boy, I think it's something to do with [[science-fiction]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;SWInsider&quot;&gt;Chernoff, Scott. &quot;Ian McDiarmid: An Interview with the Emperor.&quot; ''[[Star Wars Insider]]'', iss. 37, April/May 1998, pg. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; His presence during the filming was kept secret from all but the minimum cast and crew, and Shaw himself was contractually obligated not to discuss any film secrets with anyone, even his family. The unmasking scene, directed by [[Richard Marquand]], was filmed in one day and required only a few takes, with no alteration from the original dialogue.&lt;ref name=&quot;Starlog&quot; /&gt; When the film was re-released on DVD in 2004, a few changes were made: the unmasking scene with Hamill remained mostly the same, but Shaw's eyebrows were digitally removed as they would be burned off Vader's face in ''[[Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith|Revenge of the Sith]]''. Shaw's eyes were also digitally coloured to look like those of [[Hayden Christensen]], who played Vader in ''[[Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones|Attack of the Clones]]'' and ''Revenge of the Sith''.

''Star Wars'' creator [[George Lucas]] also personally directed Shaw for his appearance in the final scene of the film, in which he is a [[Force (Star Wars)|Force]] ghost of Anakin.&lt;ref name=&quot;Starlog&quot; /&gt; Shaw's image in this scene was replaced with that of Christensen in the 2004 release. This attempt to tie the prequel and original trilogies together proved to be one of the most controversial changes in the ''Star Wars'' re-releases.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brooker&quot;&gt;Johnson, Derek. &quot;Star Wars fans, DVD, and cultural ownership: an interview with Will Brooker; Interview,&quot; ''[[Velvet Light Trap]]'', 22 September 2005, pg. 36–44.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ebert&quot;&gt;Ebert, Roger. &quot;Anakin's fans strike back,&quot; ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', 1 May 2005, Sunday Showcase (section), pg. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;
  
Although Shaw's unmasking scene lasted only two minutes and seven seconds and included just 24 words of dialogue spoken by Shaw,&lt;ref name=&quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;&gt;''[[Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi]]'' (1983), written by [[George Lucas]] and [[Lawrence Kasdan]], directed by [[Richard Marquand]].&lt;/ref&gt; he received more fan mail and autograph requests from ''Return of the Jedi'' than he had for any role in his career. He later reflected that he very much enjoyed his experience filming for ''Return of the Jedi'' and expressed particular surprise that an [[action figure]] was made of him from the film.&lt;ref name=&quot;Starlog&quot; /&gt;

==Later career and death==
Shaw remained active in his later years; along with fellow Royal Shakespeare Company actors [[Ian Richardson]], [[John Nettles]], Martin Best and Ann Firbank, he engaged in discussions and workshops with acting teachers and students in the early 1980s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Post Shaw&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Post Acting&quot;&gt;Lardner, James. &quot;Theater Notes&quot; ''[[The Washington Post]]'', 28 February 1980, Style (section), pg. D9.&lt;/ref&gt; Although appearances in films became far less common in his later career, he received much acclaim for his performance as the [[Cold War]] spy Sharp in Clare Peploe's ''High Season'' at the [[New York Film Festival]] in 1987;&lt;ref name=&quot;Times Obit&quot; /&gt; ''[[The San Diego Union-Tribune]]'' said Shaw played the role with &quot;endearing, sweet gravity&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;High Season&quot;&gt;Elliott, David. &quot;Paradise found in witty, sensual 'High Tension',&quot; ''[[The San Diego Union-Tribune]]'', 6 July 1988, Lifestyle (section), pg.

''[[The Times]]'' said audiences were &quot;delighted to recognise his honeyed threats from behind the great carapace that disguised the Wizard of Oz&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Times Obit&quot; /&gt; Shaw became an honorary life-member at the [[Garrick Club]], which included such past members as writers [[Charles Dickens]], [[J.M.
