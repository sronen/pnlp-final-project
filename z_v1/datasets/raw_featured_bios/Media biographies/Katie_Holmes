At age 14, she began classes at a modeling school in Toledo run by Margaret O'Brien, who took her to IMTA, the [[International Modeling and Talent Association]] Competition held in New York City in 1996. Eventually, Holmes was signed to an agent after performing a monologue from ''[[To Kill a Mockingbird]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2002&quot;/&gt; An audition tape was sent to the casting director for the 1997 film ''[[The Ice Storm (film)|The Ice Storm]]'', directed by [[Ang Lee]]. She was cast in the role of Libbets Casey, in the film which starred [[Kevin Kline]] and [[Sigourney Weaver]].&lt;ref name=&quot;It Girl&quot;/&gt;

==Career==
===Early work===
In January 1997, Holmes went to Los Angeles for pilot season,when producers cast and shoot new programs in the hopes of securing a spot on a network schedule. ''[[The Toledo Blade]]'' reported she was offered the lead in ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' but she turned it down.&lt;ref name=&quot;It Girl&quot;/&gt; [[Columbia Tri-Star Television]], producer of a new show created by screenwriter [[Kevin Williamson (screenwriter)|Kevin Williamson]], asked her to come to Los Angeles to audition, but there was a conflict with her schedule. &quot;I was doing my school play, ''Damn Yankees''. And I was playing Lola. I even got to wear the feather boa. I thought, 'There is no way I'm not playing Lola to go audition for some network. I couldn't let my school down. We had already sold a lot of tickets. So I told Kevin and The WB, 'I'm sorry. I just can't meet with you this week. I've got other commitments.'&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;It Girl&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mangels177&gt;Andy Mangels. ''From'' Scream ''to'' Dawson's Creek: ''An Unauthorized Take on the Phenomenal Career of Kevin Williamson''. Los Angeles: Renaissance Books, 2000.

The producers permitted her to audition on videotape. Holmes read for the part of [[Joey Potter]], the [[tomboy]] best friend of the title character Dawson, on a videotape shot in her basement, her mother reading Dawson's lines.&lt;!--the prurient details distract from the point that immediately follows--&gt;&lt;ref name=Mangels177/&gt;&lt;ref name=JohnsonandSoutham&gt;Marilyn Johnson and Andrew Southam. &quot;Nice Girls Finish First: So what does it mean that a very nice girl playing a very thoughtful girl has become TV's teen idol?

March 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' claimed the story of Holmes's audition &quot;has become the stuff of legend&quot; and &quot;no one even thought that it was weird that one of the female leads would audition via [[FedEx|Federal Express]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Ray Richmond. &quot;Youth ache 100 episodes: The WB's signature show, 'Dawson's Creek' brings intellect and frankness to the portrayal of young adults.&quot; ''The Hollywood Reporter''.

Holmes won the part.

May 4, 2003. D1.&lt;/ref&gt; Creator and executive producer Kevin Williamson said Holmes has a &quot;unique combination of talent, beauty and skill that makes Hollywood come calling. But that's just the beginning. To meet her is to instantly fall under her spell.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Williamson.

===''Dawson's Creek''===
{{Main|Dawson's Creek}}
&quot;[[Joey Potter]] is a headstrong, vibrant, wily, sultry, and determined go-getter. And yet, in a gloriously contradictory manner, in spite of her tough-as-nails exterior demeanor, Joey's also a frail, sometimes uncertain, emotionally sensitive, in-need-of-love person&quot;, said the show's official book.&lt;ref&gt;Darren Crosdale. ''Dawson's Creek: The Official Companion''. Kansas City, Missouri: Andrews McMeel, 1999. ISBN 0-7407-0725-6. 77–78.&lt;/ref&gt; Joey, named for Jo in ''[[Little Women]]'', for years had been climbing in Dawson's bedroom window and platonically sharing his bed. Joey's mother had died from cancer when Joey was thirteen and her father, Mike ([[Gareth Williams (actor)|Gareth Williams]]), was in prison for &quot;conspiracy to traffic in [[marijuana]] in excess of 10,000&amp;nbsp;pounds.&quot; Her harried, unmarried, and very pregnant sister, Bessie ([[Nina Repeta]]), about ten years older than Joey,&lt;ref group =n&gt;Dawson's Creek, Season 2, confirmed Bessie was in high school when Joey was in kindergarten&lt;/ref&gt; was raising her while running the Ice House restaurant, where Joey worked as a waitress. ''[[GQ]]'' described Joey as &quot;kind of an uptight fussbudget—one who's always twisted up over doing the right thing and bungling-up ways to hook up with her crush and across the creek neighbor, Dawson.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rapoport&quot; /&gt;

&quot;I'm a lot like Joey&quot;, said Holmes. &quot;I think they saw that. I come from a small town. I was a tomboy. Joey tries to be articulate and deny that she doesn't have a lot of experience in life. Her life parallels mine, which is all about new everything—relationships, personal perceptions—and about being guarded.&quot; Holmes filmed the pilot of ''Dawson's Creek'' in [[Wilmington, North Carolina]], during spring break of her senior year of high school in 1997.&lt;ref name=&quot;cohen2005&quot;/&gt;

Review of ''Dawson's Creek''. ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''. January 19, 1998. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; Holmes made such an impression in Hollywood, ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'' claimed everyone was seeking to cast a &quot;Katie Holmes type&quot;, who, the reporter claimed, &quot;is a throwback to the 1950s: she is a smart girl next door (as opposed to the babe-o-rama blondes)&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn Hirschberg. &quot;Desperate to Seem 16.&quot; ''The [[New York Times]] Magazine''.

''Anywhere''.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Richard Galpin. &quot;Special K.&quot; ''Arena''. Issue 127. October 2002. 170–176.&lt;/ref&gt;

Holmes was soon on the covers of magazines such as ''[[Seventeen (magazine)|Seventeen]]'', ''[[TV Guide]]'', and ''[[Rolling Stone]]''. Jancee Dunn, an editor at ''Rolling Stone'' said she was chosen for the cover because &quot;every time you mention ''Dawson's Creek'' you tend to get a lot of [[dolphin]]-like shrieks from teenage girls. The fact that she is drop-dead gorgeous didn't hurt either.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Borrelli. &quot;Toledoan Captures Coveted Cover of the Rolling Stone.&quot; ''[[The Blade (newspaper)|The Blade]]''.

''Dawson's Creek'' ran from 1998 to 2003, and Holmes was the only actor to appear in all 128 episodes. &quot;It was very difficult for me to leave Wilmington, to have my little glass bubble burst and move on. I hate change. On the other hand it was refreshing to play someone else&quot;, she said in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;Nancy Mills.

In ''[[Wonder Boys (film)|Wonder Boys]]'' (2000), directed by [[Curtis Hanson]] from the novel by [[Michael Chabon]], Holmes had a small role (six and one-half minutes of screen time) but nevertheless attracted the attention of numerous film critics with her performance as Hannah Green, the talented student who lusts after Professor Grady Tripp ([[Michael Douglas]]), her creative writing instructor and landlord.

Holmes played the President's daughter in ''[[First Daughter (2004 film)|First Daughter]]'', which was originally to be released in January 2004 on the same day as ''[[Chasing Liberty]]'', another film about a president's daughter, but was ultimately released in September 2004 to dismal reviews and ticket sales.

June 6, 2005. 19, 29.&lt;/ref&gt; She was nominated for a [[2005 Golden Raspberry Awards|Golden Raspberry]] for &quot;worst supporting actress&quot; for the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.razzies.com/history/05nomSActr.asp |title=Razzies© 2005 Nominees for Worst Supporting Actress |publisher=Razzies.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, she appeared in the film version of [[Christopher Buckley (novelist)|Christopher Buckley]]'s satirical novel ''[[Thank You for Smoking (novel)|Thank You for Smoking]]'' about a tobacco lobbyist played by [[Aaron Eckhart]], whom Holmes's character, a Washington reporter, seduces. ''Variety'' wrote one of the film's &quot;sole relatively weak notes [came] from Holmes, who lacks even a hint of the wiliness of a ruthless reporter&quot; and ''[[The New York Times]]'' said the cast was &quot;exceptionally fine&quot; except for Holmes, who &quot;strain[ed] credulity&quot; in her role.&lt;ref&gt;David Rooney.

Holmes had agreed to play in ''Shame on You'', a [[biopic]] about the country singer [[Spade Cooley]] written and directed by [[Dennis Quaid]], as the wife whom Cooley (played by Quaid) stomps to death. But the picture, set to shoot in [[New Orleans, Louisiana]], was delayed by [[Hurricane Katrina]], and Holmes dropped out because of her pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Kirschling. &quot;The Deal Report.&quot; ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''.

After speculation about Holmes reprising her role in ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]'', the sequel to ''Batman Begins'', it was finally confirmed that she would not appear. Her role was later recast with [[Maggie Gyllenhaal]] in her place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Warner Bros. |url=http://www.cleveland.com/moviebuff/index.ssf/2008/07/heath_ledgers_highimpact_joker.html |title=Heath Ledger's high-impact Joker rules 'Dark Night' |publisher=cleveland.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, Holmes decided to star in the comedy ''[[Mad Money (film)|Mad Money]]'', opposite [[Diane Keaton]] and [[Queen Latifah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cleveland.com/sun/intermission/index.ssf/2008/01/holmes_sweet_about_mad_money.html |title=Holmes sweet about 'Mad Money' |publisher=cleveland.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[The Canadian Press]]'' criticized Katie Holmes&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s performance &quot;While Keaton has long done zany and giddy well, and she and Latifah have an interesting contrast of personalities, Holmes' presence feels like an afterthought.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Caper comedy 'Mad Money' comes up short as a female empowerment movie | work = [[The Canadian Press]] | date = January 17, 2008 | url = http://canadianpress.google.com/article/ALeqM5gf2JF7Kjkzi0Gi-4_slpdxvaza5Q | accessdate =2008-01-18 }}{{dead link|date=January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[New York Post]]'', ''[[The New York Times]]'' and ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' also criticized Katie Holmes&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s performance in the film, and ''The New York Times'' called Holmes &quot;the movie's weakest link.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Lu | first = Anne (Celebrity News Service News Writer) | title = Critics: Katie Holmes Is Movie's Weakest Link | work = All Headline News | date = January 19, 2008 | url = http://www.allheadlinenews.com/articles/7009769069 | accessdate =2008-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Pike | first = Julie | title = Katie Holmes Box Office Woes: Mad Money Flops, Report Claims | work = The National Ledger | date = January 20, 2008 | url = http://www.nationalledger.com/artman/publish/article_272618356.shtml | accessdate =2008-01-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In early July 2009, Holmes began filming a remake of the 1970s ABC telemovie ''[[Don't Be Afraid of the Dark (2011 film)|Don't Be Afraid of the Dark]]''; the film was released in August 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|1270761|Don't Be Afraid of the Dark}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stage===
Holmes made her Broadway debut in the revival of [[Arthur Miller]]'s ''[[All My Sons]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/news/e3i9189f73c48e7dd5132c67332e81a2d40 &quot;Katie Holmes headed to Broadway&quot;]{{dead link|date=July 2011}} ''The Hollywood Reporter''. May 19, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; in September 2008. She opened to mixed reviews. [[Ben Brantley]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' claimed &quot;the neophyte Ms. Holmes&quot; is a &quot;sad casualty&quot; of director Simon McBurney's &quot;high concept approach&quot; to the play.
He adds that &quot;Ms. Holmes delivers most of her lines with meaningful asperity, italicising every word&quot;. Clive Barnes of the ''[[New York Post]]'' was similarly unimpressed by Holmes – and had few compliments for her co-stars. He wrote, &quot;Lithgow starts in a sunny, benign fashion, but eventually finds himself screeching alongside Holmes, looking tough under a glossy wig.&quot; However, ''[[The New York Daily News]]''' Joe Dziemianowicz was won over by the actress' first stint on stage, writing, &quot;Holmes, a TV and film vet, makes a fine Broadway debut. Her rather grand speech pattern takes getting used to, but she seems comfortable and adds a fitting glint of glamour.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc2news.com/entertainment/story.aspx?content_id=65485a1b-6c70-44da-b055-cd0928ddbb36 Critics Battle Over Holmes' Broadway Debut]{{Dead link|date=February 2010}} (October 17, 2008) World Entertainment News Network. Retrieved 2008-10-17.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Holmes appeared in the [[National Memorial Day Concert]] on the Mall in Washington, D.C. in a dialogue with [[Dianne Wiest]] celebrating the life of an American veteran seriously wounded in Iraq, José Pequeño.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/memorialdayconcert/features/families.html |title=Families of Disabled Vets &amp;#124; National Memorial Day Concert &amp;#124; PBS |publisher=PBS&lt;! |date= |accessdate=2009-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===TV work===
Holmes hosted ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' on February 24, 2001, participating in a send-up of ''Dawson's Creek'' where she falls madly in love with [[Chris Kattan]]'s Mr. Peepers character and singing &quot;Big Spender&quot; from ''[[Sweet Charity]]''. On the November 9, 2003 episode, she was ''[[Punk'd]]'' by [[Ashton Kutcher]] and the next year she was the subject of an episode of the MTV program ''Diary''.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Borrelli.

August 27, 2004. B1.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 Holmes appeared in an episode of ''[[Eli Stone]]'' as Grace, a lawyer, and her singing and dancing was praised by Tim Stack of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stack |first=Tim |url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2008/10/22/katie-holmes-on/ |title=Katie Holmes on 'Eli Stone': The girl can kick!

In 2011, Katie Holmes played the role of [[Jackie Kennedy]] in ''[[The Kennedys (TV miniseries)|The Kennedys]]''.  Linda Stasi felt that Holmes took a while to get into the role, but was ultimately convincing as Kennedy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Stasi, Linda |url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/national/tv_series_is_candid_camelot_zV6ecduxGmqAcUKycuBJBI |title='The Kennedys' is one of the most riveting, accurate historical dramas ever on TV |publisher=[[New York Post]] |date=March 25, 2011 |accessdate=2011-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bob Owen felt that while Holmes resembled Kennedy, Holmes could not perform her accent correctly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Owen, Rob |url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/11091/1136122-67.stm |title=Tuned In: Famous family dramas debut |publisher=[[Pittsburgh Post Gazette]] |date=April 1, 2011 |accessdate=2011-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dorothy Rabinovitz felt that while Holmes had Kennedy's &quot;whispery tone&quot;, that she could not pull off Kennedy's class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rabinowitz |first=Dorothy |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703806304576233232252176142.html?mod=WSJ_ArtsEnt_LifestyleArtEnt_6 |title=The Series They Tried to Block |publisher=Wall Street Journal |date=April 1, 2011 |accessdate=2011-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2011 she also played the role of the &quot;Slutty Pumpkin&quot; (Naomi), in the TV show ''[[How I Met Your Mother]]'', episode &quot;[[The Slutty Pumpkin Returns]]&quot;.
