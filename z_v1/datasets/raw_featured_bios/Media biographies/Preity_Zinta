'''Preity Zinta''' (pronounced {{IPA-hns|ˈpriːt̪i ˈzɪɳʈaː|}}; born 31 January 1975)&lt;ref name=&quot;birth_details&quot; /&gt; is an Indian film actress. She has appeared in [[Hindi]] films of [[Bollywood]], as well as [[Telugu cinema|Telugu]], [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] and English language films. After graduating with a degree in [[criminal psychology]], Zinta made her acting debut in ''[[Dil Se..]]'' in 1998 followed by a role in ''[[Soldier (1998 film)|Soldier]]'' the same year. These performances earned her a [[Filmfare Award for Best Female Debut]], and she was later recognised for her role as a teenage single mother in ''[[Kya Kehna]]'' (2000). She subsequently played a variety of character types; her film roles along with her screen persona contributed to a change in the concept of a Hindi film heroine.&lt;ref name=&quot;The only man in Bollywood&quot; /&gt;

Zinta received a [[Filmfare Award for Best Actress]] in 2003 for her performance in the drama ''[[Kal Ho Naa Ho]]''. She went on to play the lead female role in two consecutive annual top-grossing films in India: the science fiction film ''[[Koi... Mil Gaya]]'' (2003), her biggest commercial success,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Most Grossing Movies by actresses |url=http://ibosnetwork.com/asp/clsFilmography.asp?class=actor&amp;id=Preity+Zinta&amp;layout=TABLE&amp;sortorder=adjusted_gross |publisher=IBOS |accessdate=2007-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[star-crossed]] romance ''[[Veer-Zaara]]'' (2004), which earned her critical acclaim. She was later noted for her portrayal of independent, modern Indian women in ''[[Salaam Namaste]]'' (2005) and ''[[Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna]]'' (2006), top-grossing productions in overseas markets.&lt;ref name=&quot;Overseas market&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Top Lifetime Grossers OVERSEAS (IND Rs) |url=http://boxofficeindia.com/showProd.php?itemCat=337&amp;catName=TGlmZXRpbWUgSW4gSU5EIFJz |publisher=BoxOfficeIndia.Com |accessdate=2010-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; These accomplishments have established her as a leading actress of Hindi cinema.&lt;ref name=&quot;rediff2003&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author=Kulkarni, Ronjita |title=The unanimous No 1: Preity Zinta|year=2003 |url=http://in.rediff.com/movies/2003/dec/08sld1.htm |publisher=[[Rediff.com]] |accessdate=2007-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Exceptional roles in Hollywood acceptable : Priety |url=http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/holnus/009200609201360.htm |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071223174417/http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/holnus/009200609201360.htm |archivedate=2007-12-23 |newspaper=[[The Hindu]] |date=2006-09-20 |accessdate=2007-11-06 |location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her first international film role was in the Canadian film ''[[Heaven on Earth (film)|Heaven on Earth]]'', for which she was awarded the [[Silver Hugo Award for Best Actress]] at the 2008 [[Chicago International Film Festival]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Chicago&quot; /&gt;

==Early life and background==
Zinta was born into a [[Hindu]] [[Rajput]] family from [[Rohru]] in [[Shimla district]], Himachal Pradesh.&lt;ref name=&quot;birth_details&quot; /&gt; Her father, Durganand Zinta, was an officer in the [[Indian Army]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Zinta the PM&quot;&gt;{{cite news |author=Sharma, Mandvi |title='I would've been the PM' |date=2006-06-24 |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/msid-1676771,curpg-1.cms |newspaper=[[The Times of India]] |accessdate=2006-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died in a car accident when she was 13&amp;nbsp;years old; the accident also involved her mother, Nilprabha, who was severely injured and consequently remained bedridden for two years. Zinta called the tragic accident and her father's death a significant turning point in her life, which forced her to mature rapidly.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Preity Zinta interview&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author=Khubchandani, Lata |title='I had this illusion that filmstars are like kings and queens' |date=2000-05-22 |url=http://www.rediff.com/movies/2000/may/22preity.htm |publisher=Rediff.com |accessdate=2007-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has two brothers; Deepankar and Manish, a year older and a year younger respectively.

Zinta, who describes herself as a [[tomboy]] as a child, has emphasised her father's military background as having a lasting impression on how family life was conducted. He asserted the importance of discipline and punctuality to the children.&lt;ref name=&quot;Early life&quot;&gt;{{cite news |author=Khubchandani, Lata |title=My Fundays&amp;nbsp;— Preity Zinta |date=2006-05-04 |url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1060504/asp/telekids/story_6177744.asp |newspaper=[[The Telegraph (Kolkata)|The Telegraph]] |accessdate=2007-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; She studied at the Convent of Jesus and Mary boarding school in Shimla. Although she confesses to loneliness in the boarding school, she noted that it was compensated by her finding a &quot;...&amp;nbsp;perfect set of friends&quot; there.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zinta the PM&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/mp/2002/09/09/stories/2002090900390100.htm |title=Poised for pretty good times! |accessdate=2007-11-09 |author=Siddiqui, Rana |date=2002-09-09 |newspaper=[[The Hindu]] |location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a student, she developed a love for literature, particularly the works of [[William Shakespeare]] and poetry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zinta the PM&quot; /&gt; According to Zinta, she enjoyed schoolwork and received good grades; in her free time she played sports, especially basketball.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Preity Zinta interview&quot; /&gt;

Upon graduating from the boarding school at age 18, Zinta enrolled at St Bede's College in Shimla. She graduated college with an [[English literature|English honours]] degree, and then started a graduate programme in psychology.&lt;ref name=&quot;Talk Asia interview&quot;&gt;{{cite news |author=Hahn, Lorraine |title=Bollywood Actress, Preity Zinta Talk Asia Interview Transcript |date=2005-01-11 |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/asiapcf/01/11/talkasia.zinta.script/ |publisher=CNN  |accessdate=2007-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; She earned a postgraduate degree in criminal psychology, but later took up modelling.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zinta the PM&quot; /&gt; Zinta's first television commercial was for ''Perk chocolates'', the result of a chance meeting with a director at a friend's birthday party in 1996.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zinta the PM&quot; /&gt; The director persuaded Zinta to audition for the spot, and she was selected. Afterwards, she appeared in other catalogues and commercials, including one for the soap [[Liril]].&lt;ref name=&quot;The Preity Zinta interview&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Talk Asia interview&quot; /&gt;

==Acting career==
===Early work (1997–99)===
In 1997, Zinta met film-maker [[Shekhar Kapur]] when she accompanied a friend to an audition, and was asked if she would audition too. Upon seeing her audition, Kapur insisted that she become an actress. She was originally scheduled to make her screen debut in Kapur's ''Tara Rum Pum Pum'' opposite [[Hrithik Roshan]], but the filming was cancelled. Kapur later recommended her for director [[Mani Ratnam]]'s movie ''[[Dil Se..]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Talk Asia interview&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BAFTA&quot;&gt;{{cite video|date=2006-08-15|title=BAFTA Goes Bollywood: Preity Zinta|accessdate=2008-05-17|time=01:40&amp;nbsp;– 07:00}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zinta often recalls that when she joined the film industry, her friends teased her that she would typically &quot;wear white saris and dance in the rain&quot;, thereby motivating her to play different parts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zinta the PM&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BAFTA&quot;/&gt;

Zinta commenced shooting for [[Kundan Shah]]'s ''[[Kya Kehna]]'', whose release was delayed until 2000.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chopra-India-Today&quot;/&gt; The delay of another film, ''[[Soldier (1998 film)|Soldier]]'', meant that her first release was ''Dil Se..'' (1998) opposite [[Shahrukh Khan]] and [[Manisha Koirala]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BAFTA&quot;/&gt; She was introduced as Preeti Nair, a middle-class Delhi girl and Khan's fiancée. The film was considered an unusual launch for a newcomer, as her role called for only 20&amp;nbsp;minutes of screen time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chopra-India-Today&quot;/&gt; However, she was eventually noticed for her role, particularly for the forthright character she played.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Preity Zinta interview&quot;/&gt; Her scene with Khan, in which she asked him, &quot;Are you a virgin?&quot;, became well-known, and her portrayal earned her a nomination for the [[Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Chopra-India-Today&quot;/&gt; She played her first leading role in the action-drama ''Soldier'' (1998), a commercial hit of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Box Office 1998|url=http://boxofficeindia.com/showProd.php?itemCat=204&amp;catName=MTk5OA==|publisher=BoxOfficeIndia.Com|accessdate=2008-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; She won the [[Filmfare Award for Best Female Debut]] for her performance in both ''Dil Se..'' and ''Soldier''.

Zinta next acted in two [[Telugu language|Telugu]] films, ''[[Premante Idera]]'' (1998), opposite [[Daggubati Venkatesh|Venkatesh]]; and ''[[Raja Kumarudu]]'' (1999), opposite [[Mahesh Babu]]. She followed with the leading role in the thriller ''[[Sangharsh (1999 film)|Sangharsh]]'', alongside [[Akshay Kumar]]. The film, based on ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|The Silence of the Lambs]]'' (1991),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/bollywood-plays-the-aping-game/articleshow/65034.cms|title=Bollywood plays the aping game|author=Jha, Subhash K.|date=2003-07-08|accessdate=2011-05-11|newspaper=The Economic Times|publisher=Times Internet Limited}}&lt;/ref&gt; was directed by [[Tanuja Chandra]] and written by [[Mahesh Bhatt]]. Zinta portrayed the character of Reet Oberoi, a [[Central Bureau of Investigation|CBI]] officer who falls in love with a captured killer played by Kumar. The film was not a box-office success, although Zinta's performance was appreciated by critics.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Preity Zinta interview&quot;/&gt;

===Breakthrough (2000–02)===
Zinta's first role in 2000 was in the drama ''[[Kya Kehna]]'', which unexpectedly became a box-office success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/mp/2002/09/09/stories/2002090900440300.htm|date=2002-09-09|author=Us Salam, Ziya|title=The week of affairs of the heart...|accessdate=2007-12-26|newspaper=[[The Hindu]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film addressed themes of [[single parent]]hood and [[teenage pregnancy]], and gained Zinta wider recognition from the public as well as film critics.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Preity Zinta interview&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Chopra-India-Today&quot;/&gt; Her portrayal of Priya Bakshi, a teenage [[single mother]] who fights social prejudice, earned her several award nominations, including her first nomination for [[Filmfare Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] at the [[Filmfare Awards]]. ''[[India Today]]'' reported that Zinta belonged to a new breed of Hindi film actors that breaks away from character stereotypes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chopra-India-Today&quot;/&gt;

[[File:ZintaKya Kehnazinta.jpg|thumb|left|Zinta as the teenage single mother Priya Bakshi in ''[[Kya Kehna]]'' (2000) which earned the actress her first nomination for [[Filmfare Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] at [[Filmfare Awards|Filmfare]].]]

Later that year, Zinta starred in [[Vidhu Vinod Chopra]]'s drama ''[[Mission Kashmir]]'' alongside [[Sanjay Dutt]] and [[Hrithik Roshan]]. Set in the valley of [[Kashmir]] during the [[Indo-Pakistani wars and conflicts|Indo-Pakistani conflicts]], the film dealt with the topic of terrorism and crime. Zinta's role was that of Sufiya Parvez, a TV reporter and Roshan's childhood love. A review in ''[[The Hindu]]'' said about her performance, &quot;Preity Zinta is her usual cherubic self and lends colour to the otherwise serious proceedings&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Padmanabhan, Savitha|title=Film Review: Mission Kashmir|url=http://www.hindu.com/2000/11/03/stories/09030222.htm|newspaper=[[The Hindu]]|date=2000-11-03|accessdate=2007-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was an economic success, becoming the third-highest grossing film of the year in India.&lt;ref name=&quot;2000 BO&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Box Office 2000|url=http://boxofficeindia.com/showProd.php?itemCat=206&amp;catName=MjAwMA==|publisher=BoxOfficeIndia.Com|accessdate=2008-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, Zinta earned positive reviews for her role in [[Farhan Akhtar]]'s [[National Film Award]]-winning ''[[Dil Chahta Hai]]''. Depicting the contemporary routine life of Indian affluent youth, it is set in modern-day urban Mumbai and focuses on a major period of transition in the lives of three young friends ([[Aamir Khan]], [[Saif Ali Khan]] and [[Akshaye Khanna]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Arora, Pratiksha|title='It's the maddest unit I've worked with'|url=http://www.rediff.com/entertai/2001/aug/09pre2.htm|publisher=Rediff.com|accessdate=2007-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zinta starred as Aamir Khan's love interest, Shalini. ''Dil Chahta Hai'' was popular with critics, some of whom noted it broke new ground by introducing a realistic portrayal of Indian youth. The film was a moderate box-office success in India; it performed well in the big cities but failed in the rural areas, which was attributed by critics to the urban-oriented lifestyle it presented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficeindia.com/showProd.php?itemCat=207&amp;catName=MjAwMQ==|title=Box Office 2001|publisher=BoxOfficeIndia.Com|accessdate=2008-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gulzar; Nihalani, Govind; Chatterjee, Saibal|title=Encyclopaedia of Hindi Cinema|year=2003|publisher=Encyclopaedia Britannica (India)|isbn=8179910660|page=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rediff.com]] wrote of Zinta that she &quot;...&amp;nbsp;is beautiful and vibrant, wavering between endearingly naive and confused&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Menon, Sita|title=Trip on Dil Chahta Hai|date=2001-08-10|url=http://www.rediff.com/entertai/2001/aug/10dil.htm|publisher=[[Rediff.com]]|accessdate=2007-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three more 2001 releases featured Zinta, including [[Abbas-Mustan]]'s romantic drama ''[[Chori Chori Chupke Chupke]]'', which was released after a one-year delay due to [[#Personal life|the trial of producer Bharat Shah]]. This film was one of the first Bollywood movies to address the controversial issue of [[Surrogate mother|surrogate childbirth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Prasad, Meghna|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/5699357.cms|date=2002-04-02|title=Experts back 'rent-a-womb' bill|newspaper=The Times of India|accessdate=2008-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zinta essayed the role of Madhubala, a [[Hooker with a heart of gold|golden-hearted prostitute]] hired as a surrogate mother. Initially reluctant to play the part, she eventually accepted it at the directors' persuasion and, to prepare for it, visited several bars and nightclubs at Mumbai's [[Red-light district|red-light areas]] to study the lingo and mannerisms of sex-workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why Preity refused to play a prostitute…|publisher=Sify|date=2005-04-29|accessdate=2011-12-16|url=http://www.sify.com/movies/why-preity-refused-to-play-a-prostitute-news-bollywood-kkfv5gbagdf.html|agency=IndiaFM}}&lt;/ref&gt; She received a second [[Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] nomination at the Filmfare Awards for her performance, of which reviewer Sukanya Verma wrote, &quot;Preity Zinta, who clearly has the meatiest part of all, makes the best of it. Her transformation from the cocky and unabashed prostitute to a sensitive and warm person is amazingly believable.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Verma, Sukanya|title=Preity Trite|date=2001-03-09|url=http://www.rediff.com/movies/2001/mar/09cccc.htm|publisher=Rediff.com|accessdate=2007-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2002, Zinta collaborated once again with director Kundan Shah, as the protagonist in the family drama ''[[Dil Hai Tumhaara]]'', alongside [[Rekha]], [[Mahima Chaudhry]] and [[Arjun Rampal]]. Although the film did not succeed at the box office, her portrayal of Shalu, an adopted daughter craving love, was critically acclaimed. [[Taran Adarsh]] from [[Bollywood Hungama]] noted, &quot;...&amp;nbsp;Preity Zinta, in an author-backed role&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;steals the show with a sterling performance. Her scenes with Rekha (second half) and [[Alok Nath]] (pre-climax) are simply outstanding. Here's a performance that is sure to win accolades from the junta and critics whole-heartedly.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Adarsh, Taran|title=Dil Hai Tumhara|url=http://www.bollywoodhungama.com/moviemicro/criticreview/id/201710|publisher=Bollywood Hungama|date=2002-09-06|accessdate=2007-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Success (2003–07)===
Zinta was the female lead in India's three highest-grossing films of 2003: ''[[The Hero: Love Story of a Spy]]'', ''[[Koi... Mil Gaya]]'' and ''[[Kal Ho Naa Ho]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;2003 BO&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Box Office 2003|url=http://boxofficeindia.com/showProd.php?itemCat=209&amp;catName=MjAwMw==|publisher=BoxOfficeIndia.Com|accessdate=2008-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Hero'', co-starring [[Sunny Deol]] and [[Priyanka Chopra]], is a patriotic drama about a spy network involving terrorists and an Indian army officer. Zinta played the part of Reshma, a villager who falls in love with the officer and becomes part of this network. The film, involving stunts never seen before in the cinematic history of Bollywood, became the most expensive Hindi film ever produced at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Hero: Love Story of a Spy|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/shropshire/films/2003/04/the_hero_index.shtml|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2008-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Gangadhar, V|title=A dauntless hero|date=2003-05-16|url=http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/fr/2003/05/16/stories/2003051601120200.htm|newspaper=[[The Hindu]]|accessdate=2008-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being the third highest-grossing film of that year, it failed to recover its production costs at the box office.&lt;ref name=&quot;2003 BO&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bold themes and pretty faces|date=2003-12-28|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2003/20031228/spectrum/main5.htm|newspaper=[[The Tribune]]|accessdate=2008-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; She next starred in [[Honey Irani]]'s directorial debut, ''[[Armaan (2003 film)|Armaan]]'', alongside [[Amitabh Bachchan]] and [[Anil Kapoor]]. This drama is set in a hospital and follows the travails of its personnel and its principal, Dr. Akash, who struggles arduously to sustain the institution financially. Zinta played Akash's [[schizophrenia|schizophrenic]] wife Sonia Kapoor, a role written specially for her and which she liked because it let her &quot;give vent to all [her] frustrations&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|magazine=[[Filmfare]]|page=34|publisher=[[The Times Group]]|year=2003|month=September|author=Pillai, Jitesh}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film received predominantly positive reviews, and Zinta was particularly praised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Bariana, Sanjeev Singh|title=Preity Zinta all the way|date=2003-05-18|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2003/20030518/cth2.htm#7|newspaper=[[The Tribune]]|accessdate=2008-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Khalid Mohamed]] called her a &quot;peppy scene-stealer, achieving her manic mood swings dexterously.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Mohamed, Khalid|url=http://www.mid-day.com/columns/2003/may/53213.htm|date=2003-05-18|title=What's up doc?|newspaper=[[Mid Day]]|accessdate=2011-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; For her performance, she received nominations for Best Performance in a Negative Role at different award ceremonies, including Filmfare.

[[Rakesh Roshan]]'s science-fiction film ''Koi... Mil Gaya'', about a [[Developmental disability|developmentally disabled]] young man, followed. Co-starring with [[Rekha]] and Hrithik Roshan, Zinta played the role of Nisha, a young woman whom Roshan befriends. She received another Best Actress nomination at the Filmfare for the role. The movie was a financial and critical success and became the most popular film of the year, as well as Zinta's highest-grossing movie, with a domestic total of [[Indian rupee|Rs]]&amp;nbsp;425&amp;nbsp;million;&lt;ref name=&quot;2003 BO&quot;/&gt; it won the [[Filmfare Award for Best Movie]], among others.

Zinta's final release of 2003 was ''Kal Ho Naa Ho'', a drama set in New York City. It was directed by [[Nikhil Advani]] and written by [[Karan Johar]], co-starring [[Jaya Bachchan]], [[Shahrukh Khan]] and [[Saif Ali Khan]]. The film was received favourably by critics and became India's second-biggest hit of the year after ''Koi... Mil Gaya''. It also did well internationally and became India's top-grossing film of the year overseas, earning over Rs&amp;nbsp;750&amp;nbsp;million worldwide.&lt;ref name=&quot;Worldwide gross&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Top Lifetime Grossers Worldwide (IND Rs)|url=http://boxofficeindia.com/showProd.php?itemCat=312&amp;catName=TGlmZXRpbWU= |publisher=BoxOfficeIndia.Com|accessdate=2010-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=J Pais, Arthur|date=2003-12-03|url=http://www.rediff.com/movies/2003/dec/03kal.htm|title=KHNH makes waves in UK too!|publisher=Rediff.com|accessdate=2007-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zinta played the role of Naina Catherine Kapur, an insecure and angry young [[Indian-American]] woman who falls in love with a man who has a fatal [[heart disease]]. She won several awards for her performance, including the [[Filmfare Award for Best Actress]]. Derek Elley of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' wrote, &quot;Zinta, who's been carving a growing following the past three years or so, has never been better, definitively moving from juve roles to a charismatic young woman with her sexy, assured Naina.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Elley, Derek |date=2003-12-10|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117922631?refcatid=31|title=New international release Kal Ho Naa Ho|journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|accessdate=2007-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004 she starred as TV journalist Romila Dutta in Farhan Akhtar's war drama ''[[Lakshya (film)|Lakshya]]'', alongside Hrithik Roshan. The film was based on the historical events of the [[1999 Kargil Conflict]]; Zinta's character was modelled after TV journalist [[Barkha Dutt]], the only female reporter assigned to the story. The film was a critical success, yet her performance received mixed reviews; Namarata Joshi of ''[[Outlook (magazine)|Outlook]]'' likened her to &quot;a teenybopper trying to do a TV newsreading skit for her college fest&quot; and [[Rediff.com]] concluded, &quot;Zinta has quite a good role and a good deal of footage in the film, and she does a fairly decent job of it without ever being spectacular.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Outlook (magazine)|Outlook]]|author=Joshi, Namrata|title=Lakshya|date=2004-07-05|accessdate=2011-12-06|url=http://www.outlookindia.com/article.aspx?224392}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Pai, Rajeev|title=Watch Lakshya.

In 2005, Zinta appeared in two movies. Her first release was the folk comedy ''[[Khullam Khulla Pyaar Karen]]'', co-starring [[Govinda (actor)|Govinda]], a production that had been delayed since 2002. The film garnered negative reviews and poor box office returns. Zinta's role was small, and was not well received.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Adarsh, Taran|title=Khullam Khulla Pyar Karen|date=2005-04-29|url=http://www.bollywoodhungama.com/movies/review/7283/index.html|publisher=Bollywood Hungama|accessdate=2007-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; She next starred opposite Saif Ali Khan in [[Siddharth Anand]]'s comedy-drama ''[[Salaam Namaste]]''. Produced by Yash Raj Films, it was the first Indian feature to be filmed entirely in Australia and went on to become the year's highest-grossing Bollywood production outside of India, earning Rs&amp;nbsp;570&amp;nbsp;million internationally.&lt;ref name=&quot;Worldwide gross&quot;/&gt; The film tells the story of a contemporary [[cohabitation|cohabiting]] Indian couple and their subsequent struggle with an unexpected pregnancy. Zinta played the female protagonist Ambar Malhotra, a single modern young woman who leaves India to make her own life in Melbourne. ''Salaam Namaste'' received mostly positive reviews, and Zinta's performance earned her nominations for Best Actress at a number of award ceremonies. Taran Adarsh referred to her as &quot;terrific&quot; and argued that she gave &quot;her most accomplished performance to date&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Adarsh, Taran|title=Salaam Namaste|date=2005-09-09|url=http://www.bollywoodhungama.com/moviemicro/criticreview/id/65071|publisher=Bollywood Hungama|accessdate=2007-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'' noted, &quot;She is cheerleader-homecoming queen-fraternity sweetheart pretty, so even when her characters are being unkind it's hard not to like her.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Gates, Anita|title=True to the Bollywood Look, While Defying Traditions|date=2005-09-10|url=http://movies.nytimes.com/2005/09/10/movies/10nama.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2008-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:PreityZinta.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Zinta at the ''[[Jaan-E-Mann]]'' and UFO tie-up party (2006).]]

Zinta received further success in 2006, starring in Karan Johar's drama ''[[Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna]]'' with an ensemble cast including Amitabh Bachchan, Shahrukh Khan, [[Abhishek Bachchan]], [[Rani Mukerji]] and [[Kirron Kher]]. The film became one of the biggest box-office hits in India, earning Rs&amp;nbsp;458&amp;nbsp;million, and grossed over Rs&amp;nbsp;480&amp;nbsp;million abroad, the biggest Bollywood success of all-time in the overseas market up until then. It was her fourth overseas top-earner in four consecutive years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Overseas market&quot;/&gt; The film tells the story of two unhappily married couples in New York, and an ensuing extramarital affair. Zinta played the role of Rhea Saran, an ambitious fashion magazine editor. She described the role as an attempt to shed her vivacious public image.&lt;ref name=&quot;bubbly image&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=I'm sick of my bubbly image: Preity Zinta|date=2006-03-17|url=http://www.sify.com/movies/i-m-sick-of-my-bubbly-image-preity-zinta-news-bollywood-kkfvpnghabj.html|publisher=[[Sify]]|accessdate=2007-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Indian Express]]'' concurred that this was successful: &quot;The lady has not just looked glamorous but she has walked with poise, sat with grace, smiled with composure and spoke with calmness. Who would have thought that the bubbly girl could so skilfully shed her age-old tag and walk away as the don't-mess-with-me lass.

She then starred in [[Shirish Kunder]]'s romantic musical ''[[Jaan-E-Mann]]'', a story set in the United States about two men, played by [[Salman Khan]] and [[Akshay Kumar]], who love the same woman. The film opened to mixed reviews from critics and its eventual box-office profit was poor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Don beats Jaan-E-Mann at the box office|date=2006-10-23|url=http://specials.rediff.com/movies/2006/oct/23box.htm|publisher=Rediff.com|accessdate=2008-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zinta played the role of Piya, the cynosure of two men.

In 2007 Zinta portrayed a [[British Pakistanis|British Pakistani]] woman, Alvira Khan, in her third project with Yash Raj Films, [[Shaad Ali]]'s comedy ''[[Jhoom Barabar Jhoom]]'', alongside Abhishek Bachchan, [[Bobby Deol]] and [[Lara Dutta]]. The film was a critical and commercial failure in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jhoom Barabar Jhoom flops; Sivaji is box office boss|author=Krishna, Sonali|coauthors=Govardhan D|date=2007-06-21|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2007-06-21/news/28469135_1_sivaji-chennai-box-office|work=The Economic Times|publisher=Times Internet Limited|accessdate=2008-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2007/06/17/stories/2007061750150200.htm|title='Jhoom Barabar Jhoom' goes bust film reviews|author=Us Salam, Ziya|newspaper=The Hindu|date=2007-06-17|accessdate=2008-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several critics panned her performance; ''[[The Times of India]]'' described her as &quot;too plastic&quot; and Rediff.com concluded, &quot;From accent to emotion, Preity is plain and simple insufferable in this film.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Kazmi, Nikhat|title=Jhoom Barabar Jhoom|date=2007-06-16|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/movie-reviews/hindi/Jhoom-Barabar-Jhoom/moviereview/2127129.cms|newspaper=[[The Times of India]]|accessdate=2007-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sen, Raja|title=Jhoom Bore-abar Jhoom|date=2007-06-15|url=http://in.rediff.com/movies/2007/jun/15jhoom1.htm|publisher=Rediff.com|accessdate=2009-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New career prospects (2007–present)===
In 2007, following the failure of two of her commercial releases, Zinta began working with [[art film]] directors, and turned towards neo-realistic movies, known in India as [[Parallel Cinema|parallel cinema]].&lt;ref name=&quot;art film&quot;&gt;{{cite news|author=K Jha, Subhash|title=Deepa Mehta signs Preity Zinta for Heaven on Earth|date=2007-09-27|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/News-Feed/dresscircle/Deepa-Mehta-signs-Preity-Zinta-for-Heaven-on-Earth/Article1-249879.aspx|newspaper=[[Hindustan Times]]|accessdate=2007-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; She acted in her first English film, [[Rituparno Ghosh]]'s ''[[The Last Lear]]'', as a struggling film actress opposite Amitabh Bachchan. The film premiered at the [[2007 Toronto International Film Festival]], and was received well. Later reviews in India were approving, with [[Rajeev Masand]] writing, &quot;Preity Zinta gets through her scenes competently, never allowing her cute-as-a-button image to take away from the impact she makes here as a conflicted, mature woman.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Masand, Rajeev|publisher=[[CNN-IBN]]|title=Masand's Verdict: The Last Lear is slyly over the top|date=2008-09-13|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/masands-verdict-the-last-lear-is-slyly-over-the-top/73463-8-p1.html|accessdate=2009-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zinta said about her first art film, &quot;I did think with art films that they don't pay you, they don't feed you, but I was wrong, and I'm so happy to be here.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Yelajam, Prithi|title=India's top stars not afraid to take risks|date=2007-09-10|url=http://www.thestar.com/entertainment/article/254778|work=Toronto Star|accessdate=2007-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zinta next starred in Samir Karnik's ''[[Heroes (2008 film)|Heroes]]'' (2008), a [[road movie]] about two final-year film students who, as a part of their assignment, travel a thousand miles across North India to deliver three un-posted letters written by army personnel who lost their lives during the 1999 Kargil war to their families. The story unfolds the journey of these students in three chapters and follows how they meet and are inspired by the families of the soldiers. Zinta is featured in the first chapter as Salman Khan's war widow, Kuljeet Kaur, a woman who becomes the sole breadwinner of the family and single-handedly raises her son. In preparation for the role, Zinta attended [[Anupam Kher]]'s acting school, &quot;Actor Prepares&quot;, to learn the dialect and mannerisms of a Punjabi woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Preity has no marriage plans right now|date=2008-10-26|url=http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/holnus/009200810261561.htm|newspaper=[[The Hindu]]|agency=IANS|accessdate=2008-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was released to a mixed critical reaction, but her performance received rave reviews; Anand Singh of ''[[Hindustan Times]]'' wrote, &quot;Karnik is merely interested in wringing tears the old-fashioned way, and not in starting a debate. He succeeds—mainly because Preity Zinta brings to a role a gravitas and dignity that is seen on the faces of ordinary women—this may be her coming of age as an actress.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Singh, Anand|title=Rang de motorcycling|date=2008-10-24|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/Entertainment/Reviews/Review-Heroes/Article1-346983.aspx|newspaper=Hindustan Times|accessdate=2009-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By April 2008, Zinta had completed shooting for [[Jahnu Barua]]'s drama ''[[Har Pal]]''. In the same year she played the leading role of Chand in [[Deepa Mehta]]'s Canadian film ''[[Heaven on Earth (film)|Heaven on Earth]]'', a [[Punjabi language]] mystical drama based on the true story of a young Indian woman who, post an arranged marriage to a [[Non-resident Indian and Person of Indian Origin|non-resident Indian]] man from Canada, migrates to Toronto and becomes a victim of severe domestic abuse. Expressing her desire for &quot;a new kind of acting challenge&quot;, Zinta described Mehta as one director she was longing to work with in order to fulfill it.&lt;ref name=&quot;art film&quot;/&gt; To prepare for the part, she read and watched several books and documentaries on domestic violence. As the film was to be shot entirely in Punjabi, a language that was totally alien to her, she learnt it in a crash course of fifty days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=K Jha, Subhash|title=Punjabi was alien to me: Preity|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2008-07-15/news-interviews/27921262_1_preity-zinta-punjabi-deepa-mehta|date=2008-07-15|accessdate=2011-08-10|newspaper=The Times of India|agency=TNN}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was emotional during the making of the film: &quot;I never knew a character would effect me so deeply.

In 2004, Zinta joined a group of South Asian commentators for [[BBC News Online]].

===Stage performances and television presenting===
[[File:Zinta Temptation04.jpg|thumb|Zinta performing at the ''Temptation 2004''.]]

Zinta has taken part in several stage shows and world tours since 2001. Her first world tour, a series of concerts called ''Craze 2001'', was performed across the U.S. alongside Anil Kapoor, Aamir Khan, [[Aishwarya Rai]] and [[Gracy Singh]]. The show faced early cancellation due to the [[11 September 2001 attacks]], and the team prepared to return to India as soon as possible. However, the shows continued successfully in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Tour stop|month=November|year=2001|url=http://downloads.movies.indiatimes.com/site/nov2001/whisper.html|journal=[[Filmfare]]|accessdate=2007-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with ''The Times of India'', she comments, &quot;I believe in good deeds, in [[karma]], I don't believe in going to temples. For me, religion is very personal.

No evidence was found and the rumour has subsequently been regarded as false.&lt;ref name=&quot;1 crore&quot;/&gt;

In March 2007, Zinta was involved in a scandal when actress and singer [[Suchitra Krishnamurthy]] cited her as the cause of her divorce from [[Shekhar Kapur]], alleging that Zinta was having an affair with him.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alleged affair&quot;&gt;{{cite news|author=TNN|title='Suchitra is unstable'|date=2007-03-30|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/1835376.cms|newspaper=[[The Times of India]]|accessdate=2007-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although initially silent on the issue, after another accusation by Krishnamurthy, Zinta retorted, &quot;It is unfortunate that I am bearing the brunt of someone else's paranoia.

==In the media==
Zinta is particularly known in the Indian media for her straightforwardness and for honestly expressing her forthright opinions in public, be it about her on-screen or off-screen life or raising a voice against any social injustice.&lt;ref name=&quot;brave2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;brave3&quot;/&gt; These features were noted during the Bharat Shah Case, when she testified against the underworld; following this incident she was described by journalists as &quot;The only man in Bollywood&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;The only man in Bollywood&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Now showing Chakde!&amp;nbsp;– Fiesty{{Sic|nolink=y}} foot forward|date=2007-08-14|url=http://cities.expressindia.com/local-news/fullstory.php?newsid=250929|newspaper=[[The Indian Express]]|accessdate=2007-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;charities&quot;/&gt; Her characteristic dimple has been cited by the media as her trademark.

[[File:Zinta IIFA 04.jpg|thumb|left|Zinta at the 2004 IIFA Awards.]]

According to film critic Sukanya Verma, Zinta's energetic nature extends from her real-life into her appearances in films and is an integral part of her technique. In an article discussing Hindi film actresses and their flair for comedy, Verma wrote, &quot;What can you say about an actress who giggles non-stop in a tone that is anything but prim and propah? She is carefree. She is animated. She talks non-stop. She laughs all the time. She has a chilled out sense of humour. And a tomboyish streak too. Preity Zinta is all that and more.

Following her portrayal of such characters as those in ''Sangharsh'', ''Kya Kehna'', ''Chori Chori Chupke Chupke'' and ''Salaam Namaste'', Zinta gained a reputation for playing roles that go against Indian traditional mores and was often recognised for her versatility.&lt;ref name=&quot;Early life&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bubbly image&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Nair, Nandini|title=Time to play a woman&amp;nbsp;— Preity Zinta|url=http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/holnus/009200803200921.htm|date=2008-03-20|newspaper=The Hindu|accessdate=2009-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics attributed her roles in these films as to establishing a new image for leading actresses in Bollywood.&lt;ref name=&quot;The only man in Bollywood&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;changing&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/mag/2005/06/19/stories/2005061900110500.htm|title=On the verge of extinction|author=Duara, Ajit|newspaper=[[The Hindu]]|date=2005-06-19|accessdate=2008-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Omar, Fuad|title=Bollywood: An Insider's Guide|year=2006|publisher=Mayhem Pub|isbn=1847280099|pages=161–162}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the book ''Once Upon a Time in Bollywood'', it is stated that Zinta &quot;resists patriarchal constraints through her modern lifestyle and the controversial roles she chooses.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Once Upon a Time in Bollywood: The Global Swing in Hindi Cinema|author=Singh Jolly, Gurbir; B. Wadhwani, Zenia; Barretto Baretto|publisher=[[TSAR Publications]]|year=2007|page=191|isbn=1894770404}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Zinta appeared in the number one spot on [[Rediff.com|Rediff's]] &quot;Top Bollywood Female Stars&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;rediff2003&quot;/&gt; She was ranked second for the following three years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sen, Raja|year=2004|url=http://specials.rediff.com/movies/2004/dec/29sld4.htm|title=Best Actress 2004|publisher=Rediff.com|accessdate=2007-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kulkarni, Ronjita|year=2005|url=http://specials.rediff.com/yearend/2005/dec/23yend2.htm|title=Ten best Bollywood actresses of 2005|publisher=Rediff.com|accessdate=2007-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sen, Raja|date=2006-09-05|url=http://specials.rediff.com/movies/2006/sep/05sld9.htm|title=Readers' Pick: Top Bollywood Actresses|publisher=Rediff.com|accessdate=2007-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has been featured frequently on other Rediff lists, including &quot;Bollywood's Most Beautiful Actresses&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bollywood's Most Beautiful Actresses|url=http://inhome.rediff.com/movies/2004/mar/24sld7.htm|publisher=Rediff.com|year=2004|accessdate=2007-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Bollywood's Best Dressed Women&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Verma, Sukanya|title=Bollywood's best dressed women|date=2007-05-09|url=http://www.rediff.com/movies/2007/may/02sld5.htm|publisher=Rediff.com|accessdate=2007-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;Woman of Many Faces&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Verma, Sukanya|title=Women of many faces|url=http://specials.rediff.com/movies/2007/mar/08sld5.htm|publisher=Rediff.com|accessdate=2007-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2006, the UK magazine ''[[Eastern Eye (newspaper)|Eastern Eye]]'' ranked her at 41 in the list of &quot;Asia's Sexiest Women&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Asia's sexiest women|date=2006-09-20|url=http://specials.rediff.com/movies/2006/sep/20sld1.htm|publisher=Rediff.com|accessdate=2007-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine selected her as one of the candidates for its list of [[Time 100|the world's 100 most influential people]]. She was the only Indian actress nominated for the poll and eventually did not make it to the final list, ranked at 144.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Time Staff|title=The 2010 TIME 100 Poll|url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1972075_1972078_1972573,00.html|date=2011-04-01|magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|accessdate=2011-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 July 2005, Zinta filed a defamation suit against leading Mumbai tabloid ''[[MiD DAY|Mid-Day]]'' after tapes emerged alleging that Salman Khan had made derogatory comments about her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=PTI|title=Preity Zinta files complaint against Mid-Day|date=2005-11-25|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2005-11-25/india/27865170_1_defamation-suit-salman-and-aishwarya-preity-zinta|newspaper=The Times of India|accessdate=2010-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tabloid published transcripts indicating that she had a sexual relationship with Khan, and she was [[Cross-examination|cross-examined]] as a chief witness in January 2007. She said about the case, &quot;I felt humiliated as it spoiled my reputation and character in public.&quot; She told of disparaging phone calls she received from individuals pretending to be Salman Khan, and that she had been repeatedly questioned in a derogatory fashion by the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kelkar, Reshma|publisher=Bollywood Hungama|title='Sach ki hamesha anth main jeet hoti hai' feels Preity|date=2007-03-23|url=http://oldbh.bollywoodhungama.com/news/2007/03/23/9154/index.html|accessdate=2007-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zinta further stated that the events affected her professionally as well; a planned film with Khan was abandoned. The tape was examined by the [[Government of India|Government's]] forensic laboratory in [[Chandigarh]] which concluded that it was a fake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dawn.com/2005/09/17/int6.htm|title=Salman cleared in Aishwarya tape case|newspaper=[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]]|date=2005-09-17|accessdate=2007-11-09|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071012152040/http://dawn.com/2005/09/17/int6.htm|archivedate=2007-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 2006 and 2008 Zinta made three consecutive appearances at the [[Cannes Film Festival]]. At first she attended the [[2006 Cannes Film Festival|2006 Film Festival]] along with filmmaker [[Karan Johar]] to represent the Hindi film industry and promote Johar's then-forthcoming ''Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna'', which featured Zinta in a leading role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |agency=Associated Press|title=Bollywood Actress Heads To Cannes|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/05/12/entertainment/cannes/main1614686.shtml|publisher=CBS Interactive Inc|date=2006-05-12|accessdate=2007-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the next two years, she returned to Cannes as the brand ambassador of [[Chopard]], the maker of luxury watches and jewellery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Indo-Asian News Service|title=Exhausted Preity Zinta flies off to Cannes|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/News-Feed/dresscircle/Exhausted-Preity-Zinta-flies-off-to-Cannes/Article1-311247.aspx|newspaper=Hindustan Times|date=2008-05-16|accessdate=2008-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
