'''James Nesbitt ''' (born 15 January 1965) is a Northern Irish actor. Born in [[Ballymena]], [[County Antrim]], Nesbitt grew up in the nearby village of [[Broughshane]], before moving to [[Coleraine]], [[County Londonderry]]. He wanted to become a teacher like his father, so he began a degree in French at the [[University of Ulster]]. He dropped out after a year when he decided to become an actor, and transferred to the [[Central School of Speech and Drama]] in London. After graduating in 1987, he spent seven years performing in plays that varied from the musical ''[[Up on the Roof (musical)|Up on the Roof]]'' (1987, 1989) to the political drama ''Paddywack'' (1994). He made his feature film debut playing [[talent agent]] Fintan O'Donnell in ''[[Hear My Song]]'' (1991).

Nesbitt got his breakthrough television role playing Adam Williams in the romantic comedy-drama ''[[Cold Feet]]'' (1998–2003), which won him a [[British Comedy Awards|British Comedy Award]], a [[Television and Radio Industries Club|Television and Radio Industries Club Award]], and a [[National Television Awards|National Television Award]]. His first significant film role came when he appeared as pig farmer &quot;Pig&quot; Finn in ''[[Waking Ned]]'' (1998). With the rest of the starring cast, Nesbitt was nominated for a [[Screen Actors Guild Awards|Screen Actors Guild Award]]. In ''[[Lucky Break]]'' (2001), he made his debut as a film lead, playing prisoner Jimmy Hands. The next year, he played [[Ivan Cooper]] in the television film ''[[Bloody Sunday (TV film)|Bloody Sunday]]'', about the [[Bloody Sunday (1972)|1972 shootings in Derry]]. A departure from his previous &quot;cheeky chappie&quot; roles, the film was a turning point in his career. He won a [[British Independent Film Awards|British Independent Film Award]] and was nominated for the [[British Academy Television Award for Best Actor]].

Nesbitt has also starred in ''[[Murphy's Law (TV series)|Murphy's Law]]'' (2001–2007) as undercover detective Tommy Murphy, in a role that was created for him by writer [[Colin Bateman]]. The role twice gained Nesbitt Best Actor nominations at the [[Irish Film and Television Awards|Irish Film &amp; Television Awards]] (IFTA). In 2007, he starred in the dual role of Tom Jackman and Mr Hyde in [[Steven Moffat]]'s ''[[Jekyll (TV series)|Jekyll]]'', which earned him a [[Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globe Award]] nomination in 2008. Nesbitt has since appeared in several more dramatic roles; he starred alongside [[Liam Neeson]] in ''[[Five Minutes of Heaven]]'' (2009), and was one of three lead actors in the television miniseries ''[[Occupation (TV serial)|Occupation]]'' (2009). He also starred in the movies ''[[Outcast (2010 film)|Outcast]]'' (2010) and ''[[The Way (film)|The Way]]'' (2011), and has a role in [[Peter Jackson]]'s ''[[The Hobbit (2012 film)|The Hobbit]]'' (2012/13).

Nesbitt is married to former actress Sonia Forbes-Adam, with whom he has two daughters. He is an advocate of numerous charities, and in 2010 he accepted the ceremonial position of [[Chancellor (education)|Chancellor]] of the [[University of Ulster]].

== Acting career ==
=== Theatre and ''Hear My Song'' ===
The day after leaving CSSD in 1987, Nesbitt got a bit part in ''Virtuoso'', a [[BBC Two]] ''Screen Two'' television play about the life of [[John Ogdon]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Swann&quot;/&gt; He worked for two days on the play, earning £250 per day.&lt;ref name=&quot;Walker&quot;/&gt; His first professional stage appearance came in the same year, when he played Keith in ''[[Up on the Roof (musical)|Up on the Roof]]''. The musical ran at the [[Theatre Royal, Plymouth]], before transferring to the [[London West End]]. Nesbitt reprised the role when the production returned to Plymouth in early 1989. Roger Malone in ''[[The Stage|The Stage and Television Today]]'' wrote that Nesbitt &quot;steals the show with the best lines and best delivery as he laconically squares up to life with an easy contentment&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Staff (2 February 1989). &quot;Plymouth: Up on the Roof&quot;. ''The Stage and Television Today'': p.&amp;nbsp;14.&lt;/ref&gt; Nesbitt appeared in two other plays in 1989; in June, he played Dukes Frederick and Senior in Paul Jepson's ''[[As You Like It]]'' at the Rose Theatre Club,&lt;ref&gt;Staff (15 June 1989). &quot;Rose: As You Like It&quot;.

In an analysis of the film in the ''History &amp; Memory'' journal, Aileen Blaney&lt;ref&gt;Independent scholar of docudramas produced during the Northern Ireland Peace Process.&lt;/ref&gt; wrote that it is Nesbitt's real-life household name status that made his portrayal of Cooper such a success. She reasoned that Nesbitt's celebrity status mirrors that of Cooper's in the 1970s: &quot;A household name across Great Britain, Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic, Nesbitt's widespread popular appeal is emphatically not contingent upon his Protestant Ulster identity, and consequently the double-voicing of the character he plays does not alienate viewers of an alternative, or no, sectarian persuasion.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Blaney, Aileen (Fall/Winter 2007). &quot;Remembering Historical Trauma in Paul Greengrass's Bloody Sunday&quot;. ''History &amp; Memory'' (Indiana University Press) '''19''' (2): pp.&amp;nbsp;126–127. ISSN 0935560X.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Guardian'' journalist Susie Steiner suggested that his appearance in ''Bloody Sunday'' was an attempt to resolve the expression of his &quot;Irishness&quot; on screen: &quot;Where he has taken part in a sectarian theme, his intelligence as an actor has often been masked by an excessive, cartoon-style comedy. Yet in his more successful, high-profile roles, (notably in ''Cold Feet'', and as Pig Finn in the gently pastoral film ''Waking Ned''), Nesbitt's Irishness has been exploited for its romantic charm. It has been sugared and, in the process, de-politicised.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Steiner&quot;/&gt; A critic identified ''Bloody Sunday'' as Nesbitt's &quot;coming of age&quot; film, and Nesbitt called it a turning point in his career.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rees&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Raphael&quot;/&gt; He refers to his career since the film was released as &quot;post-''Bloody Sunday''&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Billen&quot;/&gt;

=== ''Murphy's Law'' ===
In 2003, Nesbitt played undercover police detective Tommy Murphy in the first series of ''[[Murphy's Law (TV series)|Murphy's Law]]'', after starring in a successful pilot episode in 2001. The series was conceived when Nesbitt was working on ''Playing the Field''; he and producer Greg Brenman approached author [[Colin Bateman]] about creating a television series for Nesbitt in a similar vein to Bateman's Dan Starkey novels.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas2&quot;&gt;Thomas, Liz (27 September 2007). &quot;[http://www2.broadcastnow.co.uk/broadcastnowArticle.aspx?intStoryID=171409 From wise guy to tough guy]&quot;.

By 2005, Nesbitt had become tired of the formula and threatened to quit unless the structure of the series was changed. He was made a creative consultant and suggested that Murphy keep one undercover role for a full series, instead of changing into a new guise every episode.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas&quot;/&gt; This new dramatic element to the series was intended to make it a closer representation of real-life undercover work.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas2&quot;/&gt; Alongside his research with former undercover officer Peter Bleksley, Nesbitt hired a personal trainer and grew a [[handlebar moustache]] to change Murphy's physical characteristics and tone down the &quot;cheeky chappie&quot; persona that the audience had become accustomed to from his roles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wylie&quot;&gt;Wylie, Ian (26 September 2007). &quot;[http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/entertainment/film_and_tv/s/1017631_nesbitts_undercover_and_in_trouble Nesbitt's undercover and in trouble]&quot;.

=== Dramatic roles in 2004–2005 ===
In 2004, Nesbitt appeared in ''[[Wall of Silence]]'', a fact-based drama about the aftermath of the murder of schoolboy Jamie Robe. Nesbitt played Stuart Robe, the boy's father, who tries to break down the wall of silence in the local community to discover exactly what happened to his son. He had only just completed ''Bloody Sunday'' when he was offered the part and was unsure whether he wanted to take on such a demanding role so soon after playing Ivan Cooper. He decided to accept the part because he found it interesting. To prepare for the role, Nesbitt met with Robe and spent weeks talking to him in his South London flat, learning about Jamie, and of Robe's fight for his justice. Nesbitt spoke with his natural accent instead of affecting Robe's South London speech, as he did not want the audience to be distracted from the drama. The single-drama was filmed over four weeks and broadcast in January 2004.&lt;ref&gt;Barr, Gordon (10 January 2004). &quot;Re-telling a tragedy&quot;. ''Evening Chronicle'' (Newcastle: MGN): p.&amp;nbsp;9.&lt;/ref&gt; The role gained Nesbitt an IFTA nomination for Best Actor in a TV Drama later that year.&lt;ref name=&quot;IFTA 2004&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://www.ifta.ie/awards/winnersdocs/IFTA2004_winners.pdf IFTA Winners 2004]&quot; (PDF).

In March 2004, he appeared in [[Tony Marchant (playwright)|Tony Marchant]]'s ''[[Passer By (TV film)|Passer By]]'', playing Joe Keyes, a man who witnesses a woman being accosted by some men on a train and chooses not to help. Keyes later discovers that the woman was raped but cannot bring himself to admit in court that he did nothing to help her. Nesbitt described Keyes as &quot;like a better man than me: a good father and husband. But, once he has made a wrong decision, he can't control everything in his life, as he thinks he is weak. He loses the respect of his wife, his son and at work, and has to reach the lowest possible point before finding redemption.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Jardine&quot;&gt;Jardine, Cassandra (9 March 2004). &quot;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/3613538/%27I-have-made-catastrophic-choices...%27.html 'I have made catastrophic choices...']&quot;.

He was considering taking time off from acting and did not really want the role in ''Match Point''. He sent in an audition tape and was accepted for the part. Nesbitt's character appears at the end of the film and he read only that part of the script, so did not know the full circumstances of the crime Banner investigates.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rees&quot;/&gt; Despite his initial reluctance, Nesbitt enjoyed working with Allen, and complimented him on his directing style.&lt;ref name=&quot;Parkinson&quot;&gt;Nesbitt, James.

Nesbitt returned to theatre acting in June 2005 when he appeared in [[David Nicholls (writer)|David Nicholls]]' ''After Sun'', a ten-minute-play performed as part of the [[Old Vic]]'s 24-Hour Play season.

At the end of 2005, Nesbitt and his agent met with BBC Controller of Fiction [[Jane Tranter]] to discuss a new series of ''Murphy's Law''. At the meeting's conclusion, Tranter offered Nesbitt the first episode script of ''[[Jekyll (TV series)|Jekyll]]'', a television series by [[Steven Moffat]] that updated ''[[Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde]]''. Nesbitt spent three hours reading the script before accepting the role of Tom Jackman—and his alter-ego Mr Hyde. After signing on for the role, he met with Moffat and [[Hartswood Films]] executive producer [[Beryl Vertue]] to discuss the character, and had several make-up tests.

I hope to be a voice that can be heard, not just at the university, but also outside promoting the importance of the funding of education. If that involves me being at Stormont, then I'd be very happy to do that.
