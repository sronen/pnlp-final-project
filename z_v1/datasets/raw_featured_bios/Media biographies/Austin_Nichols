In his first critically successful film role, Nichols starred as a stereotypical, basketball-playing [[Fraternities and sororities|&quot;frat boy&quot;]] in  ''[[The Utopian Society]]'', a 2003 independent film directed by John P. Aguirre, which won several awards and some critical acclaim.&lt;ref&gt;[http://theutopiansocietymovie.com//press.html Recent press.] The Utopian Society.

===Box office and critical success===
In 2004, Nichols was cast as J.D., an intelligent rich kid and romantic rival to [[Jake Gyllenhaal]]'s main character in the environmental blockbuster, ''[[The Day After Tomorrow]]''. The science and script were generally panned by critics, and cast performances criticized.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oneguysopinion.com/Guys/fswietek.htm Swietek, Frank.] [http://www.oneguysopinion.com/Review.php?ID=1291 Day After Tomorrow, The.] oneguysopinion.com.

After this success, Nichols co-starred in a pilot for ''1/4 life'', a TV series about [[Twentysomething (term)|20 somethings]] living in New York which was not developed by a television network.

''Glory Road'', directed by James Gartner and starring [[Josh Lucas]], is a film based on the true story of the [[1966 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1966 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship]], in which Coach [[Don Haskins]] led a team with an all-black starting lineup, a first in NCAA history.
