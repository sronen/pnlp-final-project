A native of [[Cork (city)|Cork]], Murphy began his performing career as a rock musician. After turning down a record deal, he made his professional acting debut in the play ''Disco Pigs'' in 1996. He went on to star in Irish and British film and stage productions throughout the late 1990s and early 2000s, first coming to international attention in 2003 as the hero in the [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic]] film ''[[28 Days Later]]''. Murphy's best-known roles are as villains in two 2005 blockbusters: [[Scarecrow (comics)|Scarecrow]] in the [[superhero film]] ''[[Batman Begins]]'' (a role later reprised as a [[cameo appearance|cameo]] in ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]''), and Jackson Rippner in the [[Thriller (genre)|thriller]] ''[[Red Eye (film)|Red Eye]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Batman Begins'' and ''Red Eye'' are the highest grossing films in which Murphy had a lead role: [http://www.the-numbers.com/people/CMURP.php &quot;Cillian Murphy – Box Office Data&quot;], The-Numbers.com.

Murphy was raised Roman Catholic&lt;ref name=&quot;Daily Record Golden Boy&quot;/&gt; and attended the Catholic school [[Presentation Brothers College, Cork|Presentation Brothers College]], where he did well academically&lt;ref name=&quot;Independent action hero&quot; /&gt; but got into trouble often, sometimes getting suspended, until he decided in his fourth year that misbehaving was not worth the hassle. Not keen on sport, a major part of life at PBC, Murphy found that creative pursuits were not fully nurtured at the school.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sun Times 2004&quot; /&gt; Still, it was there that he got his first taste of performing, when he participated in a drama module presented by Pat Kiernan, the director of the [[Corcadorca Theatre Company]]. Murphy later described the experience as a &quot;huge high&quot; and a &quot;fully alive&quot; feeling that he set out to chase.&lt;ref name=&quot;From Cork to Gotham&quot;&gt;Jackson, Joe. &quot;From Cork to Gotham&quot;, ''Sunday Independent Life Magazine'', 8 February 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; His English teacher, the poet and novelist [[William Wall]], encouraged him to pursue acting,&lt;ref name=&quot;Sun Times 2004&quot; /&gt; but at this stage, to Murphy, performing meant dreams of becoming a rock star.&lt;ref name=&quot;RTE Guide 2004&quot; /&gt;

Because Murphy's brother was still in secondary school, their parents disapproved. Additionally, the contract offered little money and would have ceded the rights to Murphy's compositions to the record label.&lt;ref name=&quot;From Cork to Gotham&quot; /&gt;

Also in 1996, Murphy began studying law at [[University College Cork]] (UCC), but he failed his first year exams because, as he put it, he had &quot;no ambitions to do it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;From Cork to Gotham&quot; /&gt; Not only was he busy with his band,&lt;ref name=&quot;RTE Guide 2004&quot; /&gt; but he has admitted that he knew within days after starting at UCC that law was the wrong fit for him.&lt;ref name=&quot;Electric Mail&quot; /&gt; Furthermore, after seeing Corcadorca's stage production of ''[[A Clockwork Orange]]'', directed by Kiernan, acting had begun to pique his interest.&lt;ref name=&quot;From Cork to Gotham&quot; /&gt; His first major role was in the UCC Drama Society's amateur production of ''[[Observe the Sons of Ulster Marching Towards the Somme]]'', also starring Irish American comedian, [[Des Bishop]]. Murphy also played the lead in a UCC Dramat production of [[Little Shop of Horrors (musical) |Little Shop of Horrors]], which was performed in the [[Cork Opera House]]. However, according to Murphy, his primary motivation then was to party and meet women, not to begin an acting career.&lt;ref name=&quot;RTE Guide 2004&quot; /&gt; Nonetheless, he began to transition away from working as a rock musician, about which he later remarked, &quot;I think there's such a thing as a performance gene. If it's in your DNA it needs to come out. For me it originally came out through music, then segued into acting and came out through there. I always needed to get up and perform.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Independent action hero&quot; /&gt;

2005 was the year that Cillian Murphy won wider recognition, first for two high-profile villain roles: [[Dr. Jonathan Crane]] in ''[[Batman Begins]]'', and Jackson Rippner in the thriller ''[[Red Eye (film)|Red Eye]]''. Originally asked to audition for the role of [[Batman|Bruce Wayne/Batman]] in ''Batman Begins'', Murphy never saw himself as having the right physique for the superhero, but leapt at the chance to connect with director [[Christopher Nolan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Boston Globe 2006&quot; /&gt; Though the lead went to [[Christian Bale]], Nolan was so impressed with Murphy that he gave him the supporting role of Dr. Crane, whose alter ego is [[supervillain]] [[Scarecrow (comics)|Scarecrow]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Back Stage 2005&quot; /&gt; Nolan told ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'', &quot;He has the most extraordinary eyes, and I kept trying to invent excuses for him to take his glasses off in close-ups.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Spin 2005&quot;&gt;Itzkoff, Dave. &quot;Cillian's Irish Dread&quot;, ''Spin'', June 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Wes Craven]]'s ''Red Eye'', Murphy starred as an operative in an assassination plot who terrorises [[Rachel McAdams]] on an overnight flight. ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' film critic [[Manohla Dargis]] asserted that Murphy made &quot;a picture-perfect villain&quot; and that his &quot;baby blues look cold enough to freeze water and his wolfish leer suggests its own terrors.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dargis&quot;&gt;Dargis, Manohla.

In late 2005 (early 2006 in Europe), Murphy starred as Patrick/&quot;Kitten&quot; Braden, a [[transgender]] Irish orphan in search of her mother, in [[Neil Jordan]]'s dramedy ''[[Breakfast on Pluto (film)|Breakfast on Pluto]]'', based on the novel of the same title by [[Patrick McCabe (novelist)|Patrick McCabe]]. Murphy had auditioned for the role in 2001, and though Jordan liked him for the part, ''[[The Crying Game]]'' director was hesitant to revisit transgender and [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|I.R.A.]] issues. For several years, Murphy lobbied Jordan to make the film before the actor became too old to play the part. In 2004, Murphy prepared for the role by meeting with a [[transvestite]] who dressed him and took him clubbing with other transvestites. Taking notice of the group's quick wit, Murphy attributed it to their constantly having to respond to insults from prejudiced people around them.&lt;ref name=&quot;TONY 2005&quot; /&gt;

Against ''Breakfast on Pluto''’s kaleidoscopic backdrop of 1970s [[glitter rock]] fashion, magic shows, red light districts and I.R.A. violence, Murphy transforms from [[androgynous]] teen to high [[drag (clothing)|drag]] blond bombshell. ''[[The San Francisco Chronicle]]'''s Ruthe Stein said of his performance, &quot;Murphy projects enormous energy onscreen, as he's already shown in ''28 Days Later...'' and ''Red Eye''.

In 2006 (2007 in North America), he starred in [[Ken Loach]]'s film about the [[Irish War of Independence]] and [[Irish Civil War|Civil War]], ''[[The Wind That Shakes the Barley (film)|The Wind That Shakes the Barley]]'', which won the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[2006 Cannes Film Festival]]&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC d'Or&quot;&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/5025812.stm &quot;Loach film wins top Cannes prize&quot;], ''BBC News'', 29 May 2006.

Because the film was set in Cork, Murphy was given a chance at the role of Damien O'Donovan, a young doctor turned revolutionary, but he had to audition six times before winning the part. Murphy's family goes back in Cork for many generations; during the time period in which ''The Wind That Shakes the Barley'' is set, his grandfather was shot at by British soldiers for playing Irish music.&lt;ref name=&quot;LAT pale blue eyes&quot; /&gt;

Critic Denby described Murphy's approach to the part of Damien: &quot;Murphy is normally very quiet in movies; he has attained his mystique as an actor by staring at people with baby-blue eyes. In this film, too, he has, at times, a deep stillness, but he has idiosyncratic moments as well, such as when Damien has to execute a teen-ager who has ratted on the I.R.A. Murphy, writhing, shoots the boy and stumbles away, nausea struggling against duty.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Denby Barley&quot; /&gt; [[Kenneth Turan]] of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote, &quot;Murphy is especially good at playing the zealotry as well as the soul-searching and the regret, at showing us a man who is eaten up alive because he's forced to act in ways that are contrary to his background and his training.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Turan on Barley&quot;&gt;Turan, Kenneth.
