== Acting career ==
=== Early work (1990–1998) ===
In 1990, Witherspoon attended an open casting call for ''[[The Man in the Moon]]'' with some friends, intending to audition as a bit player.&lt;ref name=&quot;talent&quot; /&gt; She was instead cast in the lead role of Dani Trant, a 14-year-old country girl who falls in love for the first time with her 17-year-old neighbor.

In 1996, Witherspoon was offered parts in two major movies. She appeared in the thriller ''[[Fear (1996 film)|Fear]]'' alongside [[Mark Wahlberg]] (whom she dated&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1655037/reese-witherspoons-love-life-from-ryan-phillippe-jim-toth.jhtml|title=Reese Witherspoon's Love Life: From Ryan Phillippe To Jim Toth|author=Vena, Jocelyn|date=2010-12-29|accessdate=2012-02-01|publisher=MTV}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and [[Alyssa Milano]], playing the role of Nicole Walker, a teenage girl with a handsome boyfriend who turns out to be a violent psychopath.

She returned to the screen in 1998 with major roles in three movies, ''[[Overnight Delivery]]'', ''[[Pleasantville (film)|Pleasantville]]'' and ''[[Twilight (1998 film)|Twilight]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;newsindependent&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;spoonful&quot; /&gt; In ''Pleasantville'', Witherspoon starred alongside [[Tobey Maguire]] in a tale about a pair of 1990s teenage siblings who are magically transported into the setting of a 1950s television series.

=== Early critical success (1999–2000) ===

Her performance as Annette Hargrove was praised by the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'': &quot;Witherspoon is especially good in the least flashy role, and even when called upon to make a series of cute devilish faces, she pulls it off.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=``Dangerous Liaisons' Junior|date= 1999-03-05|author=Graham, Bob |work=San Francisco Chronicle| url= http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/1999/03/05/DD31451.DTL|accessdate=2007-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coincidentally, she appeared in a music video by [[Marcy Playground]] for the film's soundtrack.

But that's just the foundation. Nobody else is as funny or brings such charm to things. She can do anything.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;sweethome&quot; /&gt; In spite of her successful performance, Witherspoon noted in an interview that she struggled to find work after completing the film, due to [[Typecasting (acting)|typecasting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Playing It Straight (page 3)|author=Booth, William | date =2005-11-13|work=The Washington Post |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/11/AR2005111100442_3.html|accessdate=2007-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; When analyzing the reasons behind her difficulty to find work, Witherspoon commented &quot;I think because the character I played was so extreme and sort of shrewish&amp;nbsp;– people thought that was who I was, rather than me going in and creating a part. I would audition for things and I'd always be the second choice&amp;nbsp;– studios never wanted to hire me and I wasn't losing the parts to big box office actresses but to ones who I guess people felt differently about.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;findarticles&quot; /&gt;

=== Worldwide recognition (2001–2004) ===
2001 marked a significant turning point in Witherspoon's career, when she starred in the feature film ''[[Legally Blonde]]''. She portrayed Elle Woods, a fashion merchandising major who decides to become a law student in order to follow her ex-boyfriend to [[Harvard University]]. Speaking about Woods' character, Witherspoon said &quot;When I read ''Legally Blonde'', I was like, 'She's from Beverly Hills, she's rich, she's in a sorority. She has a great boyfriend. Oh yeah, she gets dumped. Who cares? I still hate her.' So we had to make sure she was the kind of person you just can't hate.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;sweethome&quot; /&gt; ''Legally Blonde'' was a box office hit, grossing US$96 million domestically.&lt;ref name=&quot;mojo&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Reese Witherspoon|publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]]|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/people/chart/?id=reesewitherspoon.htm|accessdate=2007-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Witherspoon's performance earned her praise from critics, as the press began referring to her as &quot;the new [[Meg Ryan]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Classic Crawford|author=Harkness, John| date = 2003-02-06| publisher=[[NOW (magazine)|NOW]]|url=http://www.nowtoronto.com/movies/dvdreviews.cfm?content=135400&amp;archive=22,23,2003|accessdate=2012-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Ebert]] commented, &quot;Witherspoon effortlessly animated this material with sunshine and quick wit&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Reviews: Legally Blonde|author=Ebert, Roger|work=Chicago Sun-Times| url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20010713/REVIEWS/107130303/1023|date=2001-07-13|accessdate=2007-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Salon.com]]'' noted that &quot;she [Witherspoon] delineates Elle's character beautifully&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Legally blone|author=Zacharek, Stephanie|date=2001-07-13|publisher=[[Salon.com]]|url=http://archive.salon.com/ent/movies/review/2001/07/13/legally_blonde/index.html|accessdate=2007-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the ''[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]'' concluded, &quot;Witherspoon is a talented comedian who can perk up a scene just by marching in full of pep and drive and she powers this modest little comedy almost single-handedly.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Enough energy in this 'Blonde' to perk up limp comedy|publisher=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]|author=Axmaker, Sean|date=2001-07-13|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/movies/31039_blonde13q.shtml|accessdate=2007-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; For her work, Witherspoon garnered her second [[Golden Globe]] Best Actress nomination and an [[2002 MTV Movie Awards|MTV Movie Award]] for Best Comedic Performance.

Following the success of ''Legally Blonde'', Witherspoon starred in several roles. In 2002, Witherspoon provided the voice of the animated character Greta Wolfcastle in ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode [[The Bart Wants What It Wants]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Reese Witherspoon|publisher=IMDB| url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000702/|accessdate=2011-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, she portrayed Cecily in the comedy ''[[The Importance of Being Earnest (2002 film)|The Importance of Being Earnest]]'', a movie adaptation of the play by [[Oscar Wilde]]; she received a [[Teen Choice Award]] nomination for her performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Clark, John |date=2002-05-12|title=Young and talented, headstrong and 'Earnest' Reese Witherspoon gets what she wants|work=San Francisco Chronicle| url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/chronicle/archive/2002/05/12/PK236774.DTL&amp;type=movies|accessdate=2007-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Announces the 4th Annual 2002 Teen Choice Awards Nominees|publisher=[[PR Newswire]] |url=http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&amp;STORY=/www/story/06-03-2002/0001739538&amp;EDATE=|accessdate=2007-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Her next feature film in 2002 was ''[[Sweet Home Alabama (film)|Sweet Home Alabama]]'', a movie directed by [[Andy Tennant]]. Alongside [[Josh Lucas]] and [[Patrick Dempsey]], Witherspoon played Melanie Carmichael, a young fashion designer who intends to marry a New York politician but must return to [[Alabama]] to divorce her childhood sweetheart, from whom she has been separated for seven years. Witherspoon regarded this as a &quot;personal role&quot; in that the role reminded her of experiences she had when she moved from her hometown Nashville to Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=IGN|url=http://au.movies.ign.com/articles/371/371856p1.html|title=Interview with Reese Witherspoon|accessdate=2007-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movie became Witherspoon's biggest box office hit to date, earning over $35 million in the opening weekend and grossing over $127 million domestically in the US.&lt;ref name=&quot;mojo&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reese Witherspoon biography (page 6)|author=Wills, Dominic|publisher=[[Tiscali]]| url=http://www.tiscali.co.uk/entertainment/film/biographies/reese_witherspoon_biog/6|accessdate=2007-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the commercial success, ''Sweet Home Alabama'' was given negative reviews by critics.

In 2003, Witherspoon followed up the success of ''Legally Blonde'' by starring in the sequel ''[[Legally Blonde 2: Red, White &amp; Blonde]]''. Her character, Elle Woods, has become a Harvard-educated lawyer who is determined to protect animals from cosmetics-industry science tests. The sequel was not as financially successful as the first movie and it generated mostly critical reviews. ''[[USA Today]]'' considered the movie &quot;plodding, unfunny and almost cringe-worthy&quot;, but also noted that &quot;Reese Witherspoon still does a fine job portraying the fair-haired lovable brainiac, but her top-notch comic timing is wasted on the humorless dialogue.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Legally Blonde 2 Review|author=Puig, Claudia | date=2003-07-02|work=USA Today|url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/reviews/2003-07-01-blonde_x.htm|accessdate=2007-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, ''Salon.com'' concluded that the sequel &quot;calcifies everything that was enjoyable about the first movie&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Legally Blonde 2|publisher=[[Salon.com]]|url=http://dir.salon.com/story/ent/movies/review/2003/07/02/blonde/|author=Taylor, Charles|date=2003-07-02|accessdate=2007-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being panned by critics, the sequel took over $39 million in its first five days in the U.S. box office charts and went on to gross $90 million in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=July 23, 2003|title=Witherspoon leads UK première|publisher=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/3089425.stm|accessdate=2007-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Witherspoon received a $15 million paycheck for the role&amp;nbsp;– a starting point to make her consistently one of Hollywood's highest paid actresses from 2002 onwards.&lt;ref name=&quot;sweethome&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Witherspoon's 'Sweet Home'|work=USA Today|author=Puig, Claudia |date=2002-09-18|url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/2002-09-18-reese-witherspoon_x.htm|accessdate=2007-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Julia Roberts Tops Actress Power List|publisher=[[People magazine]] |url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,625295,00.html|accessdate=2008-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Roberts and Kidman head list of top-earning actresses|date=2005-12-02|publisher=[[Daily Times (Pakistan)]] |url=http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2005%5C12%5C02%5Cstory_2-12-2005_pg9_1|accessdate=2007-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Angelina Jolie Surpasses Reese Witherspoon as Highest-Paid Actress |date=2008-12-05|publisher=[[US Magazine]] |url=http://www.usmagazine.com/news/angelina-jolie-surpasses-reese-witherspoon-as-highest-paid-actress|accessdate=2007-12-08|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20081208074755/http://www.usmagazine.com/news/angelina-jolie-surpasses-reese-witherspoon-as-highest-paid-actress|archivedate=2008-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Witherspoon starred in ''[[Vanity Fair (2004 film)|Vanity Fair]]'', adapted from the 19th-century classic novel ''[[Vanity Fair (novel)|Vanity Fair]]'' and directed by [[Mira Nair]]. Witherspoon's character&amp;nbsp;– Becky Sharp&amp;nbsp;– is a woman whose impoverished childhood turns her into an ambitious person with a ruthless determination to find fortune and establish herself a position in society. Witherspoon was pregnant during the filmmaking of this movie and was therefore carefully costumed to conceal her pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Witherspoon Walks The Line| date=2005-11-13|author=Edelstein, David|publisher=[[CBS News]]|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/11/12/sunday/main1041397.shtml|accessdate=2007-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; This pregnancy was not a hindrance to her work, as Witherspoon believed the gestation had in fact helped her portrayal of Sharp's character: &quot;I love the luminosity that pregnancy brings, I love the fleshiness, I love the ample bosom—it gave me much more to play with&quot;, she said.&lt;ref name=&quot;telegraphindia&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Mira's early feminist|date= 2004-09-06|work=The Telegraph |location=Kolkota, India  |url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1040906/asp/atleisure/story_3722983.asp|accessdate=2007-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Director Nair's Vanity project|publisher=BBC News |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/4056147.stm|accessdate=2007-11-04 | date=2004-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film and Witherspoon's portrayal of Sharp received good reviews, as ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' wrote, &quot;Nair's cast is splendid.

=== ''Walk the Line'' and post-Oscar work (2005–2009) ===
In late 2004, Witherspoon began working alongside [[Mark Ruffalo]] on the romantic comedy ''[[Just Like Heaven (film)|Just Like Heaven]]''. Her character, Elizabeth Masterson, is an ambitious young doctor. On her way to a blind date she gets into a car accident, and is left in a coma. Her spirit returns to her old apartment where she later finds true love.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Just Like Heaven (PG)|date=2005-12-29|author=Moten, Katie|publisher=[[Radio Telefís Éireann]]|url=http://www.rte.ie/arts/2005/1229/justlikeheaven.html|accessdate=2007-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Reese Witherspoon2 2005.jpg|thumb|right|Witherspoon at a promotional event for ''Walk the Line'' in 2005]]

Earlier that year Witherspoon was chosen to portray [[June Carter Cash]], the second wife of country music singer and songwriter [[Johnny Cash]], in ''[[Walk the Line]]''. She never had the chance to meet Carter Cash, as Witherspoon was filming ''Vanity Fair'' at the time Carter Cash died.&lt;ref name=&quot;findarticles&quot; /&gt; Witherspoon performed her own vocals in the movie, and her songs had to be performed in front of a live audience. When she learned that she had to perform live, Witherspoon was so worried that she asked her lawyer to terminate the film contract.&lt;ref name=&quot;faces&quot; /&gt; &quot;That was the most challenging part of the role,&quot; she later recalled in an interview, &quot;I'd never sung professionally.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Reese Witherspoon, live on Breakfast|publisher=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/breakfast/4666180.stm|accessdate=2007-11-07 | date=2006-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, she had to spend six months learning how to sing for the role.&lt;ref name=&quot;faces&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Faces of the week|publisher=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/6113620.stm|accessdate=2007-11-05 | date=2006-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Stars Learn to Sing for Roles ... or Do They?|date=2006-02-08| author=Donaldson-Evans, Catherine |publisher=Fox News Channel|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,184170,00.html|accessdate=2007-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Witherspoon's portrayal of Carter Cash was well received by critics, and Roger Ebert wrote that her performance added &quot;boundless energy&quot; to the movie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20051117/REVIEWS/51107006/1023 |title=Walk the Line|first=Roger |last=Ebert |date=2002-09-27 |accessdate=2007-12-01 | work=Chicago Sun-Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; She won several awards for her performance, including the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|Golden Globe Award]], the [[Screen Actors Guild]], the [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]] and the [[Academy Award]] for Best Actress in a Lead Role. 

Besides critical success in the movie industry, Witherspoon and her co-star in ''Walk the Line'', [[Joaquin Phoenix]], received a nomination for &quot;collaborative video of the year&quot; from the [[CMT Music Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4824306.stm|title=Movie stars up for country award|publisher=BBC |accessdate=2008-07-17 | date=2006-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cmt.com/microsites/cmt-music-awards/2006/nominees.jhtml|title=2006 Nominees|publisher=[[Country Music Television]]|accessdate=2008-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Witherspoon expressed her passion for the movie: &quot;I really like in this film that it is realistic and portrays sort of a real marriage, a real relationship where there are forbidden thoughts and fallibility. And it is about compassion in the long haul, not just the short easy solutions to problems.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;about.interview&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Murray, Rebecca |title=Reese Witherspoon Interview|url=http://movies.about.com/od/walktheline/a/walklinrw111405_2.htm|publisher=[[About.com]]|accessdate=2007-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also spoke about June Carter Cash, stating that she believed Carter Cash was a woman ahead of her time: &quot;I think the really remarkable thing about her character is that she did all of these things that we sort of see as normal things in the 1950s when it wasn't really acceptable for a woman to be married and divorced twice and have two different children by two different husbands and travel around in a car full of very famous musicians all by herself. She didn't try to comply to social convention, so I think that makes her a very modern woman.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;about.interview&quot; /&gt;

Witherspoon's first post-Oscar role came in the modern-day fairy tale ''[[Penelope (2006 film)|Penelope]]'', co-starring [[Christina Ricci]]. Witherspoon played the supporting role of Annie, the best friend of Penelope, a girl who has a curse in her family. The film was produced by Witherspoon's company Type A Films and premiered at the [[2006 Toronto International Film Festival]].&lt;ref name=&quot;faces&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Macdonald, Moira |title=From Toronto: Let the film festival begin!|date= 2006-09-06|publisher=The Seattle Times|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/television/2003244619_toronto06.html|accessdate=2007-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the final release date of ''Penelope'' was delayed twice, the movie eventually had a February 2008 release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/biz/2007/08/at_ifc_films_pe.html|title=At IFC Films, &quot;Penelope&quot; Shift Points To A Change in Focus; Company Emphasizing First Take Slate|publisher=indiewire.com|author=Hernandez, Eugene |accessdate=2007-12-12 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070929120600/http://www.indiewire.com/biz/2007/08/at_ifc_films_pe.html |archivedate = September 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Penelope' slides to Summit|author=Goldstein, Gregg | date= 2007-09-06| publisher=[[Hollywood Reporter]]|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/penelope-slides-summit-149560|accessdate=2012-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Witherspoon was back in front of the camera again in November 2006, as shooting began for the political thriller ''[[Rendition (film)|Rendition]]''. She starred alongside [[Meryl Streep]], [[Alan Arkin]], [[Peter Sarsgaard]] and [[Jake Gyllenhaal]], playing Isabella El-Ibrahim, the pregnant wife of a bombing suspect. ''Rendition'' was released in October 2007 and marked Witherspoon's first appearance in theaters in two years, since the 2005 release of ''Walk the Line''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Witherspoon Gives a Dramatic `Rendition'|author=Germain, David|date=2007-10-16|work=The Washington Post| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/16/AR2007101601378.html?nav=rss_artsandliving/entertainmentnews| accessdate=2007-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movie received mostly negative reviews and was generally considered a disappointment at the [[Toronto Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= 'Rendition' is story of torture|author=Mathews, Jack|date=2007-10-19|work=New York Daily News|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/movies/2007/10/19/2007-10-19_rendition_is_story_of_torture.html|
accessdate=2007-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Witherspoon's performance was also criticized: &quot;Reese Witherspoon is surprisingly lifeless&quot;, ''[[USA Today]]'' wrote, &quot;She customarily injects energy and spirit into her parts, but here, her performance feels tamped down.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Rendition' fails to turn over interest|author=Puig, Claudia | date=2007-10-18|work=USA Today|url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/reviews/2007-10-18-rendition_N.htm|accessdate=2007-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the exception of her animated role in ''Monsters vs. Aliens'', Witherspoon did not appear in a live action film for two years following the release of ''Four Christmases''. Witherspoon told ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' that the &quot;break&quot; was unplanned, stating that, &quot;I just didn’t read anything I liked...There are a lot of really, really, really big movies about robots and things- and there’s not a part for a 34-year-old woman in a robot movie.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2010/12/09/this-weeks-cover-reese-witherspoon/| title=This Week's Cover: The return of Reese Witherspoon|work=Entertainment Weekly | accessdate=2010-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Witherspoon returned with three films in 2010, 2011, and 2012, all centered around Witherspoon as a woman caught in a love triangle between two men.

The movie was both a critical and box office failure. Despite an over $100 million budget, the film earned only $7.6 million in its opening weekend, leading the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' to call it &quot;one of the year's biggest flops&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title =Box office: 'How Do You Know' flops; 'Tron' doesn't; and like the bear himself, 'Yogi' is soft [Updated]|work=Los Angeles Times| date = 2010-12-19| url =http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/entertainmentnewsbuzz/2010/12/box-office-tron-good-but-not-great-how-do-you-know-flops-yogi-bear-soft.html| accessdate = 2010-12-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The movie earned mainly negative reviews from critics, scoring 35% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] with 111 reviews as of late December 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title =Rotten Tomatoes: How Do You Know | publisher=Rotten Tomatoes|url = http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/everything_youve_got/ | accessdate = 2010-12-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Next up for Witherspoon was a second movie based on a love triangle, the film adaptation of the 1930s circus drama ''[[Water for Elephants (film)|Water for Elephants]]''. Witherspoon began circus training in March 2010 for her role as Marlena, a  glamorous performer stuck in a marriage to a volatile husband ([[Christoph Waltz]]) but intrigued by the circus's new veterinarian ([[Robert Pattinson]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Reese Witherspoon Goes to Washington | publisher=Entertainment Tonight| date = 2010-03-10| url =http://www.etonline.com/news/84864_Reese_Witherspoon_Goes_to_Washington/| accessdate = 2011-02-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Filming for the movie took place between late May and early August 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Robert Pattinson begins shooting for &quot;Water for Elephants | publisher=Hollywood News| date = 2010-05-20| url = http://www.hollywoodnews.com/2010/05/20/robert-pattinson-begins-shooting-for-%E2%80%9Cwater-for-elephants%E2%80%9D/| accessdate = 2010-05-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Lawrence| first = Francis| title = Twitter| url=http://twitter.com/Hibbits/status/20362637500| accessdate = Sep 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; in various locations in [[Tennessee]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and [[California]].

In September 2010, Witherspoon began principal photography in [[Vancouver]] for the third film, ''[[This Means War (film)|This Means War]]'', a [[20th Century Fox]] spy comedy directed by [[McG]]. In the film, Witherspoon stars as a woman at the center of a battle between two best friends (played by [[Chris Pine]] and [[Tom Hardy]]) who are both in love with her. The film had a &quot;sneak-peak&quot; release on [[Valentine's Day]], before fully opening on February 17, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Chris Pine in early negotiations for spy comedy 'This Means War' at Fox|work=Entertainment Weekly |date=2010-05-06|url=http://hollywoodinsider.ew.com/2010/05/06/chris-pine-in-early-negotiations-for-spy-comedy-this-means-war-at-fox/|accessdate=2012-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Chris Pine preps for &quot;War&quot;|publisher=[[Hollywood News]] |date=2010-05-08|url=http://www.hollywoodnews.com/2010/05/08/chris-pine-preps-for-war/|accessdate=2010-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = This Means War to start filming|work=Vancouver Sun| date = 2010-09-03| url =http://www.vancouversun.com/entertainment/movie-guide/This+Means+start+filming/3477453/story.html| accessdate = 2010-09-19|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100907072205/http://www.vancouversun.com/entertainment/movie-guide/This+Means+start+filming/3477453/story.html|archivedate=2010-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = This Means War Gets Romantic Release Date|work=Movieline| date = 2011-04-12| url =http://www.movieline.com/2011/04/this-means-war-gets-romantic-release-date.php| accessdate = 2011-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fox to Release McG's 'This Means War' on Valentine's Day|work=Reuters|date=2012-01-08|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/01/18/idUS332453756520120118|accessdate=2012-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was panned by critics (with a 25% [[Rotten Tomatoes]] rating),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title =This Means War - Rotten Tomatoes | publisher=Rotten Tomatoes|url = http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/this_means_war/ | accessdate = 2012-02-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and fared poorly at the box office, taking fifth place on its opening weekend with sales of $17.6 million. The ''[[New York Times]]'' remarked that this &quot;extended the box office cold streak for the Oscar-winning Ms. Witherspoon&quot;, and that while &quot;Hollywood keeps trying to turn Reese Witherspoon into a [[Sandra Bullock]] or [[Julia Roberts]] for a new generation,&quot; the &quot;new generation keeps refusing to take the memo.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author = Brooks Barnes|title=This Means Box Office Dud|work=New York Times|date=2012-01-08|url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/19/this-means-box-office-dud/|date = 2012-02-19|accessdate=2012-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Witherspoon's upcoming films signal a departure from the love triangle theme. In September 2011, nearly a year after beginning work on ''This Means War'', Witherspoon began filming [[Jeff Nichols]]'s [[coming-of-age film|coming-of-age]] drama ''[[Mud (2013 film)|Mud]]'' in [[Arkansas]]. Witherspoon will star as Juniper, the former girlfriend of a fugitive, played by [[Matthew McConaughey]], who enlists two teenage boys to help him escape capture and rekindle his romance with Witherspoon's character. It is slated for a 2013 release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title =Everything We Know About Reese Witherspoon's Film 'Mud,' Filming in Arkansas|work=InArkansas| date = 2011-09-28| url =http://www.inarkansas.com/26908/everything-we-know-about-reese-witherspoons-film-mud-filming-in-arkansas| accessdate = 2011-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title ='Mud' banks trio of thesps|work=Variety| date = 2011-09-26| url =http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118043478| accessdate = 2011-10-03| first=Dave| last=McNary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Witherspoon's next film will be ''[[Big Eyes (film)|Big Eyes]]'', written and directed by [[Scott Alexander]] and [[Larry Karaszewski]] and produced by [[Tim Burton]]. Witherspoon will play [[Margaret Keane]], an artist who produces wide-eyed portraits that became a sensation in the 1960s but were sold under the name of her husband [[Walter Keane]] (played by [[Ryan Reynolds]]), creating conflict between them. Filming is set to begin in the spring of 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title =Witherspoon, Reynolds land 'Big Eyes'|work=Variety| date = 2012-01-22| url =http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118048991.html?cmpid=RSS%257CNews%257CLatestNews| accessdate = 2012-02-20| first=Jeff| last=Sneider}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following ''Big Eyes'', Witherspoon will begin work on [[Atom Egoyan]]'s adaptation of the [[true crime]] book ''[[Devil's Knot]]'', which examines the controversial case of the [[West Memphis Three]]. Like ''Mud'', the story is set in Arkansas. Witherspoon will play Pam Hobbs, the mother of one of three young murder victims. The movie will begin filming in the Southern states in the summer of 2012. Egoyan has noted that although the role requires &quot;an emotionally loaded journey&quot;, he &quot;met with Reese, and...talked at length about the project, and she's eager to take on the challenge&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title =Egoyan signs Reese Witherspoon for new film |work=Globe and Mail| date = 2011-12-16| url =http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/arts/movies/egoyan-signs-reese-witherspoon-for-new-film/article2274510/| accessdate = 2011-12-30| first=Gayle| last=Macdonald| location=Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

It has also been rumoured that Witherspoon will produce (under the Type A banner) and star in both ''[[Pharm Girl]]'', a film about a woman who takes on the pharmaceutical industry,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Reese Witherspoon proves a &quot;Pharm Girl'&quot; at heart |agency=Reuters  | date = 2009-06-18| url =http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE55H0N720090618| accessdate = 2010-03-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[Peggy Lee]] biopic to be directed by [[Nora Ephron]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hudson |first=Alex |url=http://exclaim.ca/News/Reese_Witherspoon_to_Star_as_Peggy_Lee_in_Biopic |title=Reese Witherspoon to Star as Peggy Lee in Biopic |publisher=Exclaim.ca |date=2010-08-10 |accessdate=2012-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Witherspoon's name has also been attached to a number of other possible future films, including the upcoming [[Sony Pictures]] film ''[[Sex Tape (film)|Sex Tape]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/pagesix/reese_witherspoon_jason_segel_to_4OOZ1IQDhdMKiHyqYEQJwJ?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME= |title=Reese Witherspoon, Jason Segel to star in 'Sex Tape'? |publisher=NYPOST.com |date=2011-10-27 |accessdate=2011-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Universal Pictures]] remake of the 1939 comedy ''[[Midnight (1939 film)|Midnight]]'', scripted by [[Michael Arndt]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Fleming, Michael|date=2007-05-30 |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117966009.html?categoryid=10&amp;cs=1|title=Witherspoon to star in 'Midnight'|work=Variety |accessdate=2007-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the horror film ''Our Family Troubles'', which she would produce through Type A with Jennifer Simpson, co-producer of ''Legally Blonde 2''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117934739.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1|author=Fleming, Michael| date=2005-12-15|title=Reese might find 'Family'|work=Variety |accessdate=2007-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Witherspoon received a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] on December 1, 2010, at 6262 Hollywood Blvd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodchamber.net/index.php?module=blogs&amp;blog_id=29 |title=Welcome – Hollywood Chamber of Commerce |publisher=Hollywoodchamber.net |accessdate=2011-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other projects ==
Witherspoon owns a production company called Type A Films. The company was at first believed by the media to have been named after her childhood nickname &quot;Little Miss Type A.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ambition&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| date=2006-02-13|author=Hancock, Tiffany |title=Fashion victim: Reece Witherspoon|work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK | url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/fashion/main.jhtml?xml=/fashion/2006/02/13/efvictim11.xml| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071203034324/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/fashion/main.jhtml?xml=/fashion/2006/02/13/efvictim11.xml| archivedate=2007-12-03|accessdate=2007-11-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, when asked about the company by ''[[Interview (magazine)|Interview]]'' magazine, she clarified the name's origin: &quot;... people think I named it after myself ... It was actually an [[in-joke]] with my family because at [age] 7 I understood complicated medical terms, such as the difference between [[Type A and Type B personality theory|type A and type B personalities]]. But I just wished I'd named the company Dogfood Films or Fork or something. You carry that baggage all your life.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;findarticles&quot; /&gt;

== Charitable work ==
Witherspoon is actively involved in children's and women's advocacy organizations. She is a long-time supporter of [[Save the Children]], an organization that helps children around the world through education, health care and emergency aid.&lt;ref name=&quot;chldrn&quot; /&gt; She also serves on the board of the [[Children's Defense Fund]], a child advocacy and research group.&lt;ref name=&quot;chldrn&quot; /&gt; In 2006, Witherspoon was among a group of actresses who went to New Orleans, Louisiana in a CDF project to bring to light the needs of [[Hurricane Katrina]] victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Witherspoon, Garner Tour New Orleans|author=Plaisance, Stacey|date=2006-05-08|work=The Washington Post|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/08/AR2006050801206.html|accessdate=2007-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this trip, she helped open the city's first Freedom School, as she met and talked with the children.&lt;ref name=&quot;trip&quot; /&gt; Witherspoon later called this an experience that she would never forget.&lt;ref name=&quot;trip&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Reese Witherspoon Speaks About Children of Katrina| publisher=[[ABC News]]|url=http://abcnews.go.com/ThisWeek/MothersDay/story?id=1960165|date=2006-05-14|accessdate=2007-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
