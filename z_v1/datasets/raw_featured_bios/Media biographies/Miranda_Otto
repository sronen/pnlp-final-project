Her first major film appearance was in the 1986 film ''[[Emma's War]]'', in which she played a teenager who moves to Australia's bush country during World War II. After a decade of critically acclaimed roles in Australian films, she gained Hollywood's attention after appearing in supporting roles in ''[[The Thin Red Line (1998 film)|The Thin Red Line]]'' (1998) and ''[[What Lies Beneath]]'' (2000). Her breakthrough role came in 2002, when she portrayed [[Éowyn]] in ''[[The Lord of the Rings film trilogy|The Lord of the Rings]]'' trilogy. More recent work includes a starring role in the 2008 now-cancelled American television series ''[[Cashmere Mafia]]'', and Australian films such as ''[[In Her Skin]]'' and ''[[Blessed (2009 film)|Blessed]]'' (2009).

== Career ==
=== Early career ===
Otto's first post-graduation film role in 1991, as Nell Tiscowitz in ''[[The Girl Who Came Late]]'', was her breakthrough role, which brought her to the attention of the Australian film industry and the general public. In the film, directed by Kathy Mueller, she starred as a young woman who could communicate with horses. Her appearance garnered Otto her first [[Australian Film Institute]] nomination for &quot;Best Actress&quot; the following year.&lt;ref name=&quot;yahoo&quot; /&gt;

Otto's next role was in the film ''[[The Last Days of Chez Nous]]'', which portrayed the complex relationships between the members of an Australian family. The film earned Otto her second Australian Film Institute nomination, this time for &quot;Best Supporting Actress&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;yahoo&quot; /&gt; In 1993, Otto co-starred with [[Noah Taylor]] in the sexually provocative comedy film ''[[The Nostradamus Kid]]'', which was based on the memories of author [[Bob Ellis]] during the 1960s. Otto was drawn to the film because she was &quot;fascinated by the period and the people who came out of it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Interview&quot;&gt;Bass, Matthew.

Retrieved 7 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; A small role in the independent film ''Sex Is a Four Letter Word'' followed in 1995.&lt;ref name=&quot;Filmography&quot; /&gt;

In 1995, Otto began to doubt her career choice as she failed to get the parts for which she auditioned.&lt;ref name=&quot;GoesOff&quot; /&gt; She fled to her home in Newcastle for almost a year, during which she painted her mother's house.&lt;ref name=&quot;GoesOff&quot; /&gt; In 1996, director Shirley Barrett cast Otto as a shy waitress in the film ''[[Love Serenade]]''. She played Dimity Hurley, a lonely young woman, who competes with her older sister Vicki-Ann for the attention of a famous DJ from [[Brisbane]]. The film was met with positive reviews and Otto's performance was praised: Steve Rhodes of Internet Reviews felt that Otto's performance was &quot;the most interesting and funniest&quot; of the film.&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes, Steve (1996), [http://reviews.imdb.com/Reviews/79/7981 &quot;Love Serenade Review&quot;], Internet Reviews. Retrieved 7 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Otto's first starring roles were in the 1997 films ''[[The Well (1997 film)|The Well]]'' and ''[[Doing Time for Patsy Cline]]''. When Otto received the film script for ''The Well'', she refused to read it, fearing that she would not get the part. Otto believed that she could not convincingly play the role of Katherine, who is supposed to be eighteen, as she was thirty years old at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;GoesOff&quot; /&gt; The film, directed by Samantha Lang, starred Otto as a teenager involved in a claustrophobic relationship with a lonely older woman. ''The Well'' received mixed reviews; critic Paul Fisher wrote that Otto's performance was not &quot;convincing&quot; as she was &quot;playing another repetitious character about whom little is revealed&quot;, while Louise Keller stated that Otto had delivered &quot;her best screen performance yet.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, Paul and Louise Keller.

The low-budget Australian film required Otto to perform [[country music]] standards and also received mixed reviews from film critics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/10001629-doing_time_for_patsy_cline/ &quot;&quot;Doing Time for Patsy Cline&quot; Reviews&quot;]. ''[[Rotten Tomatoes]]''. Retrieved 29 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after the release of ''The Well'' and ''Doing Time for Patsy Cline'', magazines and other media outlets were eager to profile the actress. In 1997, Otto began dating her ''Doing Time for Patsy Cline'' co-star Richard Roxburgh. Her involvement with Roxburgh made her a regular subject of Australian [[tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] magazines and media at the time, a role to which she was unaccustomed.&lt;ref name=&quot;serene&quot;&gt;Scobie, Claire.

Otto's next project was the romantic comedy ''Dead Letter Office'' (1998). The film was Otto's first with her father, [[Barry Otto|Barry]], who makes a brief appearance.

The film is a drama that portrays the story of [[Lindy Chamberlain]], who was convicted (in 1982) of killing her baby daughter, Azaria, in one of Australia's most publicized murder trials. Otto was cast as Chamberlain after her husband, [[Peter O'Brien (actor)|Peter O'Brien]], had been cast as prosecutor Ian Barker. She was drawn to the role because it provided her with the &quot;prospect of exploring an unconventional character.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Enker, Debi.
