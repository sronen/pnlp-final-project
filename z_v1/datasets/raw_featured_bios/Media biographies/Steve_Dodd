'''Steve Dodd''' (born 1 June 1928), is an [[Indigenous Australian]] actor, notable for playing indigenous characters across seven decades of Australian film. After beginning his working life as a stockman and rodeo rider, Dodd was given his first film roles by prominent Australian actor [[Chips Rafferty]]. His career was interrupted by six years in the [[Australian Army]] during the [[Korean War]], and limited by discrimination and [[Typecasting (acting)|typecasting]].

Dodd has performed in some of Australia's most prominent movies, including ''[[Gallipoli]]'' and ''[[The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith]]'', in which he played Tabidgi, the murdering uncle of the lead character. He has also held minor parts in Australia-based international film productions including ''[[The Coca-Cola Kid]]'', ''[[Quigley Down Under]]'' and ''[[The Matrix]]''. He has appeared in minor roles in early Australian television series, such as ''[[Homicide (Australian TV series)|Homicide]]'' and ''[[Rush (1970s TV series)|Rush]]'', as well as more recent series including ''[[The Flying Doctors]]''.

In the 19th and 20th centuries, Indigenous Australian men played significant roles as [[Stockman (Australia)|stockmen]] in the Australian pastoral industry, and as entertainers participating in competitive demonstrations of stockmen's skills, referred to as rough riding.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hunter&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hunter|first=Kathryn M|year=2008|title=Rough Riding: Aboriginal Participation in Rodeos and Travelling Shows to the 1950s|journal=Aboriginal History|volume=32|pages=82–96}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dodd worked as a stockman, horse breaker and [[rodeo]] rider prior to and during his acting career,&lt;ref name=&quot;Dawn&quot; /&gt; including a period working for rider and entertainer [[Smoky Dawson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=February 1967|volume=16|title=Many familiar faces at this year's summer camp|journal=Dawn|pages=1–4|url=http://www1.aiatsis.gov.au/dawn/docs/v16/s02/3.pdf|format=PDF |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww1.aiatsis.gov.au%2Fdawn%2Fdocs%2Fv16%2Fs02%2F3.pdf&amp;date=2010-10-11 |archivedate=12 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a member of the Rough Riders Association, and gave exhibition rides at the [[Calgary Stampede]] in 1964.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dawn&quot; /&gt;

== Acting career ==
=== Early career ===

Dodd's first opportunity to act in [[Cinema of Australia|Australian film]] came in 1946, when actor Chips Rafferty noticed Dodd on the set of ''The Overlanders'' and gave him a small role.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dawn&quot; /&gt; It was the first of three Rafferty movies in which Dodd secured a part, the second being ''[[Bitter Springs (film)|Bitter Springs]]'' in 1950. This film was notable for being &quot;a serious study of the relations of white settlers and Aborigines&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Monthly Film Bulletin'', 1950, cited in {{cite web|url=http://svc017.wic796dp.server-web.com/educationtext.aspx?xcid=202  |work=National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Educational Website|title=Aboriginal people in Australian feature film Part 1| publisher=Department for Education, Training and Employment (South Australia)| accessdate=26 February 2009 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fsvc017.wic796dp.server-web.com%2Feducationtext.aspx%3Fxcid%3D202&amp;date=2010-10-11 |archivedate=12 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;more honest than most Australian film-makers ventured to be at that time&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pike|first=Andrew|coauthors=Ross Cooper|title=Australian film 1900–1977: a guide to feature film production |publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Melbourne|year=1980|pages=275–276|chapter=Bitter Springs|isbn=0-19-550784-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bruce Molloy described the film as a &quot;lucid and dramatically effective representation&quot; of black–white conflict in [[Colonialism|colonial]] Australia, giving Indigenous Australians &quot;a degree of justice long denied them in cinematic representation&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Molloy&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Molloy|first=Bruce|title=Before the interval: Australian mythology and feature films, 1930–1960|publisher=University of Queensland Press|location=St Lucia, Qld|year=1990|page=194|isbn=0-7022-2269-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dodd was working on ''Bitter Springs'' as a tracker and interpreter for actor [[Michael Pate]] when Rafferty arranged for him to have an on-screen role.&lt;ref name=&quot;Canberra&quot; /&gt; There was a positive relationship between the Indigenous Arrente people and the cast and crew, particularly Rafferty, involved in the location filming for ''Bitter Springs'' in the area of [[Quorn, South Australia|Quorn]] in northern South Australia. Michael Pate said that Rafferty &quot;wasn't a prejudiced person&amp;nbsp;... Chips was a person who appreciated the Aborigine [sic] very much&amp;nbsp;... he got on very well with the people&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Larkins&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Larkins|first=Bob|title=Chips: the life and films of Chips Rafferty|publisher=Macmillan|location=Melbourne|year=1986|page=69|isbn=0-333-41510-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dodd, meanwhile, appreciated Rafferty's vision for an Australian film industry and its potential to provide opportunities for Indigenous Australians.&lt;ref name=&quot;Canberra&quot; /&gt;

Rafferty was the star of the film that gave Dodd his third minor screen role, ''Kangaroo'' (1952).&lt;ref name=&quot;Pike&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Pike|first=A.F.|title=Australian Dictionary of Biography|publisher=Melbourne University Press|location=Melbourne|year=1996|volume=14|pages=284–285|chapter=Goffage, John William Pilbean (Chips Rafferty) (1909–1971)|isbn=0-522-84717-X|url=http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A140322b.htm?hilite=goffage}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1957, the [[Rank Organisation|J Arthur Rank Organisation]], an English company, came to Australia to make a film adaptation of ''[[Robbery Under Arms]]'', an Australian colonial novel by [[Thomas Alexander Browne|Rolf Boldrewood]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Webby&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Webby|first=Elizabeth|year=2002|title=Killing the Narrator: National Differences in Adaptations of ''Robbery Under Arms''|journal=Journal of the Association for the Study of Australian Literature|volume=1|pages=45–50|url=http://www.nla.gov.au/openpublish/index.php/jasal/article/viewFile/4/4|accessdate=9 December 2009 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060909095651/http://www.nla.gov.au/openpublish/index.php/jasal/article/viewFile/4/4 |archivedate=9 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dodd travelled to Britain and the United States with the company for six months; in what role is unknown.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dawn&quot; /&gt; He said he worked with Rafferty on a fourth film, ''[[Wake in Fright]]'', in 1971,&lt;ref name=&quot;Canberra&quot; /&gt; but Dodd's name does not appear in published cast lists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Australian film 1900–1977: a guide to feature film production |last=Pike|first=Andrew|coauthors=Ross Cooper|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Melbourne|year=1980|page=333|chapter=Wake in Fright|isbn=0-19-550784-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://colsearch.nfsa.afc.gov.au/nfsa/search/display/display.w3p;adv=yes;group=;groupequals=;holdingType=;page=0;parentid=;query=Number%3A4463;querytype=;rec=0;resCount=10|title=Title details: Wake in Fright|publisher=National Film and Sound Archive|accessdate=10 November 2009 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5tcMOCWhI |archivedate=20 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067541/fullcredits#cast|title=Full cast and crew for Wake in Fright (1971)|work=Internet Movie Database (IMDb)|accessdate=10 November 2009 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.imdb.com%2Ftitle%2Ftt0067541%2Ffullcredits&amp;date=2010-10-20 |archivedate=20 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, he was cast in the role of an Aboriginal caretaker for a film he said was called ''Sacrifice''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Canberra&quot; /&gt;

Although Dodd obtained small parts in several television series, for many years he and his fellow Aboriginal actors found themselves included in only minor and typecast roles in television productions. According to Indigenous actor, historian and activist [[Gary Foley]],&lt;ref name=&quot;EAAFoley&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopaedia of Aboriginal Australia]]|editor=David Horton|publisher=Aboriginal Studies Press for the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies|location=Canberra|year=1994|volume=1|page=374|chapter=Foley, G.|isbn=978-0-85575-234-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dodd joked that &quot;he was sick of roles where his total dialogue was, 'he went that way, Boss!'&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Foley&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kooriweb.org/foley/essays/essay_17.html|title=Koori Engagement with Television|last=Foley|first=Gary|work=Kooriweb|accessdate=11 November 2009|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.kooriweb.org%2Ffoley%2Fessays%2Fessay_17.html&amp;date=2010-10-11 |archivedate=12 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reflecting on this issue, a commentator remarked on the 1978 film ''Little Boy Lost'': &quot;There are many irrelevant scenes, the most obvious one being where Tracker Bindi (Steve Dodd), an Aboriginal, is introduced&amp;nbsp;– yet another tired reinforcement of a false stereotype.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lost&quot;&gt;Brown, Suzanne, 'Little Boy Lost', in Murray, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Later career ===

Dodd contributed to several films in which issues facing Indigenous Australians, such as [[Land rights#Indigenous land rights|land rights]] and race relations, were the central subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://svc017.wic796dp.server-web.com/educationtext.aspx?xcid=245|title=Aboriginal people in Australian feature film Part 2|work=National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Educational Website|publisher=Department for Education, Training and Employment (South Australia)|accessdate=25 February 2009 | archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fsvc017.wic796dp.server-web.com%2Feducationtext.aspx%3Fxcid%3D245&amp;date=2010-10-11 |archivedate=12 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; These appearances included ''Bitter Springs'' (mentioned above) and ''The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith'' (1978), the first of two films in which he appeared alongside [[Jack Thompson (actor)|Jack Thompson]]. Dodd played the character of Tabidgi, the uncle of the lead character, Aboriginal man Jimmie Blacksmith. In the film, Jimmie Blacksmith marries a white woman named Gilda Marshall (played by [[Angela Punch McGregor]]). When they have a baby, Dodd's character, &quot;a tribal elder, ... is worried about Jimmie's marriage to a white woman and has brought him a talisman to keep him safe&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kael&quot; /&gt; Pauline Kael, writing in ''[[The New Yorker]]'', described the performances of the two black professional actors (Jack Charles and Dodd) as &quot;wonderful as sots: ... Steve Dodds [sic], who is tried for murder and simply says, 'You'd think it would take a good while to make up your mind to kill someone and then to kill them, but take my word for it, it only takes a second'&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kael&quot; /&gt;

Dodd's career was busiest in the 1980s. In 1981 he played Billy Snakeskin in the film ''Gallipoli'', about the fate of young men who participated in the World War I [[Gallipoli Campaign]] of 1915.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallipoli&quot;&gt;MacFarlane, Brian, 'Gallipoli', in Murray, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by parts in ''Chase Through the Night'' and ''Essington'', both in 1984. In 1985 he played the role of Mr Joe in ''The Coca-Cola Kid'', an Australian romantic comedy with an international cast including [[Eric Roberts]] and [[Greta Scacchi]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Martin&quot;&gt;Martin, Adrian, 'The Coca-Cola Kid', in Murray, p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986 he appeared in the film ''Short Changed'', while through the mid 1980s he had minor parts in the popular television series ''[[The Flying Doctors]]'' (1985–1988).&lt;ref name=&quot;IMDbDodd&quot; /&gt;

''The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith'' was not the only film in which Dodd appeared that addressed topical Indigenous issues of the day. A decade after ''Jimmie Blacksmith'', Dodd performed in ''[[Ground Zero (1987 film)|Ground Zero]]'', again with Jack Thompson in one of the lead roles.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, Fred and Nolen, Ronald (2001). ''The Macmillan International Film Encyclopedia'' (4th edition). London: Macmillan. p. 1352. ISBN 0-333-90690-X.&lt;/ref&gt; This film is a thriller based on claims that Indigenous Australians were used as human guinea pigs in the [[British nuclear tests at Maralinga]].&lt;ref&gt;See for example, Parkinson, Alan (2007). ''Maralinga&amp;nbsp;– Australia's Nuclear Waste Cover-up''. Sydney: ABC Books. ISBN 978-0-7333-2108-5.&lt;/ref&gt; The film uses as its context the [[McClelland Royal Commission]], which was investigating radioactive contamination at the site. In the film, Dodd plays a minor character named Freddy Tjapaljarri.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zero&quot;&gt;Gardner, Geoff, 'Ground Zero', in Murray, p. 220.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sources differ on whether Dodd had a part in ''Evil Angels'', the 1988 film about the [[Azaria Chamberlain disappearance]], with Dodd's name not included in the cast list published by ''Australian Film 1978–1994'',&lt;ref name=&quot;Angels&quot;&gt;Collins, Felicity, 'Evil Angels', in Murray, p. 250.&lt;/ref&gt; but appearing in the longer cast listing provided by IMDb.&lt;ref name=&quot;EvilAngelsIMDb&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0094924/fullcredits#cast|title=''Evil Angels'' cast list|publisher=Internet Movie Database (IMDb)|accessdate=9 December 2009 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.imdb.com%2Ftitle%2Ftt0094924%2Ffullcredits%23cast&amp;date=2010-10-20 |archivedate=20 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988 he also played a minor role in ''Kadaicha'', an unreleased [[horror film]] about a series of unexplained murders.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kadaicha&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://colsearch.nfsa.gov.au/nfsa/search/display/display.w3p;adv=;group=;groupequals=;holdingType=;page=0;parentid=;query=Person%3A%22%2FPerson%2Fkey%2F30964-1%22;querytype=;rec=8;resCount=10|title=Title details: Kadaicha|work=Search the collection|publisher=National Film and Sound Archive|accessdate=9 December 2009 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5tcN9IsT7 |archivedate=20 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990 Dodd appeared in two films: ''Quigley Down Under'', a [[western (genre)|western]] made in Australia but starring American [[Tom Selleck]] and Briton [[Alan Rickman]];&lt;ref name=&quot;Kerr&quot;&gt;Kerr, Greg, 'Quigley', in Murray, p. 323&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Crossing'', an Australian drama set in a country town.&lt;ref name=&quot;Crossing&quot;&gt;Caputo, Raffaele, 'The Crossing', in Murray, p. 296.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dodd's career returned to politically contentious Indigenous issues when he played a minor role, of Kummengu, in the 1991 film ''Deadly''. This film is a police drama based around the death of an Indigenous man in police custody.&lt;ref name=&quot;Deadly&quot;&gt;Quinn, Karl, 'Deadly', in Murray, p. 336.&lt;/ref&gt; As in ''Ground Zero'', the subject was very topical: the movie was released at the same time as the report of the [[Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody]], which had for four years been examining why so many Indigenous Australians [[Aboriginal deaths in custody|died in police detention]].

In 1999, Dodd was one of three actors in ''Wind'', a short film portraying the pursuit of an old Aboriginal man (Dodd) by a young black tracker and a white police sergeant.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wind&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aso.gov.au/titles/shorts/wind/clip3/|title=Wind (1999)&amp;nbsp;– clip 3|year=1999|work=Australian Screen|publisher=National Film and Sound Archive|accessdate=9 December 2009 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Faso.gov.au%2Ftitles%2Fshorts%2Fwind%2Fclip3%2F&amp;date=2010-10-20 |archivedate=20 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year was marked by the most successful film of his career, ''[[The Matrix]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Matrix&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://au.movies.yahoo.com/movie/2013/the-matrix/cast/ |title=The Matrix cast list |publisher=Au.movies.yahoo.com |date= |accessdate=9 August 2010 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fau.movies.yahoo.com%2Fmovie%2F2013%2Fthe-matrix%2Fcast%2F&amp;date=2012-01-12 |archivedate= 12 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Dodd played a minor role in an episode of television series ''[[The Alice]]'' (2006), and in the movies ''My Country'' (2007) and ''Broken Sun'' (2008).&lt;ref name=&quot;IMDbDodd&quot; /&gt;
