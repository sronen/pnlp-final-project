'''Ernest Lee &quot;Ernie&quot; Fletcher''' (born November 12, 1952) is a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] politician from the [[U.S. state]] of [[Kentucky]]. In 1999, he was elected to the first of three consecutive terms in the [[United States House of Representatives]]; he resigned in 2003 after being elected the [[List of Governors of Kentucky|60th]] [[governor of Kentucky]] and served in that office until 2007. Prior to his entry into politics, Fletcher was a family practice physician and a [[Baptist]] lay minister. He is only the second physician to be elected governor of Kentucky; the first was [[Luke P. Blackburn]] in 1879.

Fletcher graduated from the [[University of Kentucky]] and joined the [[United States Air Force]] to pursue his dream of becoming an [[astronaut]]. He left the Air Force after budget cuts reduced his squadron's flying time and earned a degree in medicine, hoping to earn a spot as a civilian on a space mission. Deteriorating eyesight eventually ended those hopes, and he entered private practice as a physician and conducted services as a Baptist lay minister. He became active in politics and was elected to the [[Kentucky House of Representatives]] in 1994. Two years later he ran for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives, but lost to incumbent [[Scotty Baesler]]. When Baesler retired to run for a seat in the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]], Fletcher again ran for the congressional seat and defeated [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[Kentucky Senate|state Senator]] [[Ernesto Scorsone]]. He soon became one of the House Republican caucus' top advisors regarding health care legislation, particularly the [[U.S. Patients' Bill of Rights|Patients' Bill of Rights]].

Fletcher was elected governor in 2003 over [[Kentucky Attorney General|state Attorney General]] [[Ben Chandler]]. Early in his term, Fletcher achieved some savings to the state by reorganizing the [[executive branch]]. He proposed an overhaul to the state tax code in 2004, but was unable to get it passed through the [[Kentucky General Assembly|General Assembly]]. When Republicans in the [[Kentucky Senate|state senate]] insisted on tying the reforms to the state budget, the legislature adjourned without passing either, and the state operated under an executive spending plan drafted by Fletcher until 2005, when both the budget and the reforms were passed. Later in 2005, Attorney General [[Greg Stumbo]], the state's highest-ranking Democrat, launched an investigation into whether the Fletcher administration's hiring practices violated the state's [[merit system]]. A [[grand jury]] returned several [[indictment]]s against members of Fletcher's staff, and eventually against Fletcher himself. Fletcher issued [[clemency|pardons]] for anyone on his staff implicated in the investigation, but did not pardon himself. Though the investigation was ended by an agreement between Fletcher and Stumbo in late 2006, it continued to overshadow Fletcher's [[Kentucky gubernatorial election, 2007|re-election bid]] in 2007. After turning back a challenge in the Republican [[primary election|primary]] by former Congresswoman [[Anne Northup]], Fletcher lost the [[general election]] to Democrat [[Steve Beshear]]. After his term as governor, he returned to the medical field as founder and CEO of Alton Heathcare. He is married and has two grown children.

==Early life==
Ernie Fletcher was born in [[Mount Sterling, Kentucky]], on November 12, 1952.&lt;ref name=congbio&gt;&quot;Fletcher, Ernest L.&quot;. ''Biographical Directory of the United States Congress''&lt;/ref&gt; He was the third of four children born to Harold Fletcher, Sr. and his wife, Marie.&lt;ref name=mead&gt;Mead, &quot;Fletcher's Vision is Reaganesque&quot;, p. B1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=estep&gt;Estep, &quot;Ernie Fletcher&quot;, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; The family owned a farm and operated a [[general store]] near the community of [[Means, Kentucky|Means]].&lt;ref name=mead /&gt; Harold Fletcher also worked for [[NiSource|Columbia Gas]].&lt;ref name=kinney2&gt;Kinney, &quot;Dr., Preacher, Pilot...Gov?&quot;, p. K1&lt;/ref&gt; When Ernie was three weeks old, Harold was transferred to [[Huntington, West Virginia]].&lt;ref name=kinney /&gt; Two years later, the Fletchers returned to [[Robertson County, Kentucky]], where they lived until Ernie Fletcher began the [[first grade]].&lt;ref name=kinney2 /&gt; The family moved once more and finally settled in [[Lexington, Kentucky|Lexington]].&lt;ref name=estep /&gt;

Fletcher attended [[Lafayette High School (Lexington, Kentucky)|Lafayette High School]] in Lexington where he was a member of the [[National Beta Club]].&lt;ref name=mead /&gt; During his senior year, he was an all-state [[saxophone]] player and was elected [[prom]] king.&lt;ref name=mead /&gt;&lt;ref name=cross264&gt;Cross, p. 264&lt;/ref&gt; After graduating in 1970, he enrolled at the [[University of Kentucky]].&lt;ref name=congbio /&gt; He pledged and became a member of the [[Delta Tau Delta]] fraternity.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Famous Delts&quot;. Delta Tau Delta&lt;/ref&gt; After his freshman year, he married his high school sweetheart, Glenna Foster.&lt;ref name=cross264 /&gt; The couple had two children, Rachel and Ben, and four grandchildren.&lt;ref name=estep /&gt;&lt;ref name=nga /&gt; 

Fletcher aspired to become an [[astronaut]], and joined the [[Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps]].&lt;ref name=cross265&gt;Cross, p. 265&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, he earned a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in mechanical engineering, graduating with top honors.&lt;ref name=mead /&gt; After graduation, he joined the [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]].&lt;ref name=congbio /&gt; After flight training in [[Oklahoma]], he was stationed in [[Alaska]] where he served as a [[F-4 Phantom II|F-4E Aircraft]] Commander and [[North American Aerospace Defense Command|NORAD]] Alert Force Commander.&lt;ref name=kinney2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=nga&gt;&quot;Kentucky Governor Ernie Fletcher&quot;. National Governors Association&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Cold War]], his duties included commanding squadrons to intercept [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] military aircraft.&lt;ref name=cross265 /&gt; In 1980, as budget cutbacks were reducing his squadron's flying time, Fletcher turned down a regular commission in the Air Force.&lt;ref name=cross265 /&gt; He left the Air Force with the rank of [[Captain (United States)|captain]], having received the [[Air Force Commendation Medal]] and the [[Outstanding Unit Award]].&lt;ref name=kmg&gt;Trowbridge, &quot;Kentucky's Military Governors&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Fletcher enrolled in the [[University of Kentucky College of Medicine]], hoping that a medical degree, along with a military background, would earn him a civilian spot on a space mission.&lt;ref name=mead /&gt;&lt;ref name=cross265 /&gt; In 1984, he graduated medical school with a [[Doctor of Medicine]] degree, but his deteriorating eyesight forced him to abandon his dreams of becoming an astronaut.&lt;ref name=congbio /&gt;&lt;ref name=cross265 /&gt; 

In 1983, the Lexington [[Primitive Baptist]] church that Fletcher attended ordained him as a [[laity|lay minister]].&lt;ref name=cross265 /&gt; In 1984, he opened a [[Family medicine|family medical practice]] in Lexington.&lt;ref name=cross265 /&gt;  Along with former classmate Dr. James D. B. George, he co-founded the South Lexington Family Physicians in 1987.&lt;ref name=mead /&gt; For two years, he concurrently held the title of [[Chief Executive Officer]] of the Saint Joseph Medical Foundation, an organization that solicits private gifts to Saint Joseph Regional Medical Center in Lexington.&lt;ref name=nga /&gt; In 1989, Fletcher's church called him to become its unpaid pastor, but over the years, he grew to question some of the church's doctrines, desiring it to become more evangelistic.&lt;ref name=cross265 /&gt; Consequently, he left the Primitive Baptist denomination in 1994 and joined the Porter Memorial Baptist Church, a [[Southern Baptist]] congregation.&lt;ref name=cross265 /&gt;

==Legislative career==
Through his church ministry, Fletcher became acquainted with a group of [[Social conservatism|social conservatives]] that gained control of the [[Fayette County, Kentucky|Fayette County]] [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] in 1990.&lt;ref name=cross265 /&gt; (Fayette County and the city of Lexington operate under the merged Lexington-Fayette Urban County Government). Fletcher accepted an invitation to become a member of the county Republican committee.&lt;ref name=cross265 /&gt; In 1994, he was elected to the [[Kentucky House of Representatives]], defeating incumbent Democrat Leslie Trapp.&lt;ref name=mead /&gt; He represented Kentucky’s 78th District and served on the Kentucky Commission on Poverty and the Task Force on Higher Education.&lt;ref name=nga /&gt; He was also chosen by Governor [[Paul E. Patton]] to assist with reforming the state's health-care system.&lt;ref name=nga /&gt;

[[File:Baesler.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=A dark-haired man in his fifties, wearing glasses and a suit, facing straight ahead|Scotty Baesler defeated Fletcher for a congressional seat in 1996.]]
As a result of legislative redistricting in 1996, Fletcher's district was consolidated with the one represented by fellow Republican Stan Cave.&lt;ref name=cross265 /&gt; Rather than challenge a member of his own party, Fletcher decided to run for a seat representing [[Kentucky's 6th congressional district|Kentucky's 6th District]] in the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] later that year.&lt;ref name=cross265 /&gt; After winning a three-way Republican [[primary election|primary]] by 4 votes over his closest opponent, he was defeated by incumbent Democrat [[Scotty Baesler]] by just over 25,000 votes.&lt;ref name=cross265 /&gt; In 1998, Baesler resigned his seat to run for the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] seat vacated due to the retirement of Senator [[Wendell H. Ford]].&lt;ref name=cross265 /&gt; Fletcher won the Republican primary for Baesler's seat by a wide margin.&lt;ref name=cross265 /&gt; In the general election, Fletcher faced Democrat [[Ernesto Scorsone]].&lt;ref name=cross265 /&gt; The ''[[Lexington Herald-Leader]]'' billed the race as &quot;a classic joust between the [[Left-wing politics|left]] and the [[Right-wing politics|right]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=baniak&gt;Baniak, &quot;6th District Race a Classic Contest Between Left, Right&quot;, p. D3&lt;/ref&gt; Fletcher was strongly [[Pro-life movement|opposed to abortion]], advocated a &quot;[[Flat tax|flatter]], fairer, simpler&quot; tax system, and called for returning most federal education funding to local communities.&lt;ref name=baniak /&gt; Scorsone supported [[Pro-choice|abortion rights]], called a flat tax &quot;too regressive&quot;, and favored national educational testing and standards.&lt;ref name=baniak /&gt; Fletcher defeated Scorsone by a vote of 104,046 to 90,033, with third-party candidate W. S. Krogdahl garnering 1,839 votes.&lt;ref name=cross265 /&gt;

Within months of arriving in [[Washington, D.C.]], Fletcher was selected as the leadership liaison for the 17-member freshman class of Republican legislators.&lt;ref name=gibson&gt;Gibson, &quot;Ernie Fletcher&quot;, p. A1&lt;/ref&gt; He was appointed to the [[United States House Committee on Education and Labor|Committee on Education and Workforce]], and [[John Boehner]], chair of the committee's employer/employee relations subcommittee, chose Fletcher as his vice-chair.&lt;ref name=gibson /&gt; The committee's purpose is to oversee the rules for employer-paid health plans, among other issues, and although it is rare for a freshman legislator to attain a committee leadership post, Boehner cited Fletcher's experience in the medical field and work on reforming the Kentucky health care system as reasons for the appointment.&lt;ref name=gibson /&gt; Fletcher also served as a member of the House Committees on [[United States House Committee on the Budget|the Budget]] and [[United States House Committee on Agriculture|Agriculture]].&lt;ref name=nga /&gt; In June 1999, he sponsored an amendment to a youth violence bill that allowed school districts to use federal funds to develop curricula which included elements designed to promote and enhance students' [[moral character]]; the amendment passed 422—1.&lt;ref name=gibson /&gt; Later, Fletcher was assigned to the [[United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce|Committee on Energy and Commerce]] and was selected as chairman of the Policy Subcommittee on Health.&lt;ref name=nga /&gt;

During the debate over the proposed [[U.S. Patients' Bill of Rights|Patients' Bill of Rights]] legislation, Fletcher opposed a Democratic proposal that would have allowed individuals to sue their [[health maintenance organization]]s (HMOs), favoring instead a more limited bill drafted by Republican leadership that expanded the patient's ability to appeal HMO decisions.&lt;ref name=grunwald&gt;Grunwald, &quot;GOP Doctors in the House Put Patients Before Party&quot;, p. A1&lt;/ref&gt; Many doctors in the Republican legislative caucus felt their party's bill did not go far enough; Fletcher and [[Tennessee]] Senator [[Bill Frist]] were notable exceptions.&lt;ref name=grunwald /&gt; Fletcher's position cost him the support of the Kentucky Medical Association (KMA).&lt;ref name=kma&gt;&quot;Fletcher loses doctors' backing&quot;. ''The Kentucky Post'', p. 16A&lt;/ref&gt; After contributing to his campaign against Scorsone in 1998, KMA backed Scotty Baesler's bid to regain his old seat from Fletcher in 2000.&lt;ref name=kma /&gt; However, Baesler only captured 35 percent of the vote to Fletcher's 53 percent.&lt;ref name=cross265 /&gt; The remaining 12 percent went to third-party candidate [[Gatewood Galbraith]].&lt;ref name=cross265 /&gt;

After the 2000 election, Fletcher crafted a compromise bill that allowed patients to sue their HMOs in federal court, capped [[pain and suffering]] awards at $500,000, and eliminated punitive damage awards.&lt;ref name=lockwood&gt;Lockwood, &quot;Fletcher's Patients' Rights Bill in Trouble&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Despite an eventual compromise allowing patient lawsuits to go to state courts under certain circumstances and heavy lobbying in favor of Fletcher's bill by [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush]], the House refused to pass it, favoring an alternative proposal by [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]'s [[Charlie Norwood]] that was less restrictive on patient lawsuits.&lt;ref name=lockwood /&gt;

Fletcher faced no major-party opposition in his re-election bid in 2002 after the only Democrat in the race, 24-year-old Roy Miller Cornett Jr., withdrew his candidacy.&lt;ref name=lockwood2&gt;Lockwood, &quot;Fletcher's Opponent Drops Out of Race&quot;, p. C3&lt;/ref&gt; [[Independent (politician)|Independent]] Gatewood Galbraith again made the race; [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]] Mark Gailey also mounted a challenge.&lt;ref name=wolfe&gt;Wolfe, &quot;Bates Can't Run in May Primary&quot;, p. K10&lt;/ref&gt; In the final vote tally, Fletcher received 115,522 votes to Galbraith's 41,853 and Gailey's 3,313.&lt;ref name=wolfe /&gt;

==2003 gubernatorial election==

[[File:A.B. Chandler.jpg|thumb|right|200px|alt=A brown-haired man in his mid forties wearing a black suit and red tie|Ben Chandler, Fletcher's Democratic opponent in the 2003 gubernatorial race]]
In 2002, Fletcher was encouraged by Senator [[Mitch McConnell]], the leader of Kentucky's Republican Party, to run for governor and formed an exploratory committee the same year.&lt;ref name=cross266&gt;Cross, p. 266&lt;/ref&gt; On December 2, 2002, he announced that he would run on a ticket with McConnell aide Hunter Bates.&lt;ref name=cross266 /&gt; Early in 2003, a Republican college student named Curtis Shain challenged Bates' candidacy on grounds that he did not meet the residency requirements set forth for the [[Lieutenant Governor of Kentucky|lieutenant governor]] in the [[Kentucky Constitution|state constitution]].&lt;ref name=wolfe&gt;Wolfe, p. K1&lt;/ref&gt; Under the constitution, candidates for both governor and lieutenant governor must be citizens of the state for at least six years prior to the election.&lt;ref name=wolfe /&gt; From August 1995 to February 2002, Bates and his wife rented an apartment in [[Alexandria, Virginia]] while Bates was working for a law firm in [[Washington, D. C.]], and later, as McConnell's chief of staff.&lt;ref name=ba&gt;Brammer and Alessi, &quot;Judge: Bates Can't be on Ballot&quot;, p. A1&lt;/ref&gt; Bob Heleringer, running mate of Republican gubernatorial candidate [[Steve Nunn]], joined the suit as a plaintiff.&lt;ref name=ba /&gt; In March 2003, an [[Oldham County, Kentucky]], judge ruled that Bates had not established residency in Kentucky, citing the fact that from 1995 to 2002, he held a Virginia [[driver's license]], paid Virginia [[income tax]]es, and &quot;regularly&quot; slept in his apartment in Virginia.&lt;ref name=ba /&gt; Bates did not appeal the ruling because by allowing the judge to declare a vacancy on the ballot, Fletcher was able to name a replacement running mate, an option that would not have been afforded him had Bates withdrawn.&lt;ref name=kinney&gt;Kinney, &quot;Bates Won't Contest Ruling&quot;, K1&lt;/ref&gt;

Fletcher chose [[Steve Pence]], [[United States Attorney]] for the [[United States District Court for the Western District of Kentucky|Western District of Kentucky]], as his new running mate.&lt;ref name=cross266 /&gt; Heleringer continued his legal challenge, first claiming that Bates' ineligibility should have invalidated the entire Fletcher/Bates ticket and then that Fletcher should not have been allowed to name a replacement for an unqualified candidate.&lt;ref name=ab&gt;Alessi and Brammer, &quot;Fletcher Stays on the Ballot&quot;, p. A1&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Kentucky Supreme Court]] rejected that argument on May 7, 2003, though the justices' reasons for doing so varied and the final opinion conceded that &quot;[t]his is a close case on the law, and Heleringer has presented legal issues worthy of this court's time and attention&quot;.&lt;ref name=ab /&gt; The state Board of Elections instructed all county clerks to count absentee ballots cast for Fletcher and Bates as votes for Fletcher and Pence.&lt;ref name=ab /&gt;

In the Republican primary, Fletcher received 53 percent of the vote, besting Nunn, [[Jefferson County, Kentucky|Jefferson County]] [[County Judge/Executive|judge/executive]] [[Rebecca Jackson]], and state senator Virgil Moore.&lt;ref name=cross266 /&gt; In the Democratic primary, [[Kentucky Attorney General|Attorney General]] [[Ben Chandler]] defeated [[Speaker of the Kentucky House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] [[Jody Richards]].&lt;ref name=cross266 /&gt; Chandler, the grandson of former governor [[Happy Chandler|A. B. &quot;Happy&quot; Chandler]], was hurt in the closing days of the campaign when a third challenger, businessman [[Bruce Lunsford]] dropped out of the race and endorsed Richards.&lt;ref name=cross266 /&gt; Chandler won the Democratic primary by just 3.7 percentage points and was forced to reorganize his campaign.&lt;ref name=cross266 /&gt; Consequently, Fletcher entered the [[Kentucky gubernatorial election, 2003|general election]] as the favorite.&lt;ref name=cross266 /&gt;

Due to the funding from the [[Republican Governors Association]], Fletcher held a two-to-one fundraising advantage over Chandler.&lt;ref name=cross266 /&gt; A sex-for-favors scandal that ensnared sitting Democratic governor Paul Patton, as well as a predicted $710 million shortfall in the upcoming budget, damaged the entire Democratic slate of candidates' chances for election.&lt;ref name=cross267&gt;Cross, p. 267&lt;/ref&gt; Fletcher capitalized on these issues, promising to &quot;clean up the mess&quot; in [[Frankfort, Kentucky|Frankfort]], and won the election by a vote of 596,284 to 487,159.&lt;ref name=cross267 /&gt; In all, Republicans captured four of the seven statewide constitutional offices in 2003; [[Trey Grayson]] was elected [[Secretary of State of Kentucky|Secretary of State]] and [[Richie Farmer]] was elected Commissioner of Agriculture.&lt;ref name=cross267 /&gt; Fletcher resigned his seat in the House on December 8, 2003 and assumed the governorship the following day.&lt;ref name=congbio /&gt; Fletcher's victory made him the first Republican elected governor of Kentucky since 1971, and his margin of victory was the largest ever for a Republican in a Kentucky gubernatorial election.&lt;ref name=nga /&gt;

==Governor of Kentucky==
Fletcher made economic development a priority, and Kentucky ranked fourth among all U.S. states in number of jobs created during his administration.&lt;ref name=nga /&gt; One of his first actions as governor was to reorganize the executive branch, condensing the number of cabinet positions from fourteen to nine.&lt;ref name=nga /&gt; He dissolved the former Kentucky Horse Racing Commission and instead created the Kentucky Horse Racing Authority to promote and regulate the state's horse racing industry.&lt;ref name=nga /&gt; To improve the state's management of [[Medicaid]], he rolled back some of the program's requirements and unveiled a plan to focus on improvements in care, benefit management, and technology.&lt;ref name=nga /&gt; Fletcher also launched &quot;Get Healthy Kentucky!,&quot; an initiative to promote healthier lifestyles for Kentuckians.&lt;ref name=nga /&gt;

===2004 state budget dispute===
Throughout Fletcher's term, the Kentucky Senate was controlled by Republicans, while Democrats held a majority in the state House of Representatives. Consequently, Fletcher had difficulty getting legislation enacted in the General Assembly. Early in the 2004 legislative session, he presented a plan for tax reform that he claimed was &quot;revenue neutral&quot; and would &quot;modernize&quot; the state tax code.&lt;ref name=nobudget&gt;Brammer and Alessi, &quot;Legislators Fail to Pass a Budget&quot;, p. A1&lt;/ref&gt; The plan was drafted with input from seven Democratic legislators in the House, none of them in leadership roles, leading to claims that Fletcher was trying to circumvent House leadership.&lt;ref name=first100&gt;York and Kinney, &quot;His First 100 Days&quot;, p. K1&lt;/ref&gt; As the session wore on, Republicans insisted on tying the tax reform package to the proposed state budget, while Democrats wanted to vote on the measures separately.&lt;ref name=nobudget /&gt; Despite last minute attempts at a compromise as the session drew to a close, the Assembly passed neither the tax reform package nor a state budget.&lt;ref name=nobudget /&gt; The contentious session ended with only a few accomplishments, including passage of a fetal homicide law, an anti-[[price gouging]] measure, and a law barring the [[Kentucky Public Service Commission|state public service commission]] from regulating [[broadband]] Internet providers beyond what restrictions were put in place by the [[Federal Communications Commission]].&lt;ref name=winlose&gt;Alessi, et al., &quot;Who Won, Who Lost in Fractious Session&quot;, p. A1&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2004 session marked the second consecutive session in which the General Assembly had failed to pass a biennial budget; the first occurred in 2002 under Governor Patton.&lt;ref name=nobudget /&gt; When the fiscal year ended without a budget in place, responsibility for state expenditures fell to Fletcher.&lt;ref name=planproceed&gt;York, &quot;Ruling Allows Fletcher Plan to Proceed&quot;, p. K1&lt;/ref&gt; As it had been in 2002, spending was governed by an executive spending plan created by the governor.&lt;ref name=planproceed /&gt; Democratic [[Attorney General of Kentucky|Attorney General]] [[Greg Stumbo]] filed suit asking for a determination on the extent of Fletcher's ability to spend without legislative approval.&lt;ref name=planproceed /&gt; A similar suit, filed after the 2002 session ended in deadlock, was rendered moot when the legislature passed a budget in a special session prior to the conclusion of the lawsuit.&lt;ref name=planproceed /&gt; A judicial review by a Franklin County circuit court judge approved Fletcher's spending plan but forbade spending on new capital projects and programs.&lt;ref name=planproceed /&gt; In late December 2004, a judge ruled that Fletcher's plan could continue to govern spending until the end of the fiscal year on June 30, 2005, but &quot;thereafter&quot; executive spending was to be limited to &quot;funds demonstrated to be for limited and specific essential services.&quot;&lt;ref name=deadline&gt;Biesk, &quot;Judge Sets Budget Deadline&quot;, p. K1&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 19, 2005, the [[Kentucky Supreme Court]] issued a 4–3 decision stating that the General Assembly had acted unconstitutionally by not passing a budget and that Fletcher had acted outside his constitutional authority by spending money not specifically appropriated by the legislature. The majority opinion rejected the lower court's exception for &quot;specific essential services&quot;, saying &quot;If the legislative department fails to appropriate funds deemed sufficient to operate the executive department at a desired level of services, the executive department must serve the citizenry as best it can with what it is given. If the citizenry deems those services insufficient, it will exercise its own constitutional power — the ballot.&quot;&lt;ref name=ksc-budget /&gt; Chief Justice Joseph Lambert dissented, claiming the executive spending plan was necessary. Two other justices, in a separate opinion, disagreed with the majority that federal and state constitutional mandates should still be funded in the absence of a budget. In their dissent, they argued that the threat of a government shutdown would act as an impetus for the General Assembly to engage in timely budget-making. The decision took no retroactive steps to change the actions it ruled unconstitutional, but it served as a precedent for any future cases of budgetary gridlock.&lt;ref name=ksc-budget&gt;York, &quot;High Court Rules Budgetary Actions Violate Constitution&quot;, p. A12&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legislative interim and 2005 legislative session===
In June 2004, Fletcher's aircraft caused a security scare that triggered a brief evacuation of the [[United States Capitol|U.S. Capitol]] and [[United States Supreme Court Building|Supreme Court building]].&lt;ref name=panic&gt;Alessi, &quot;Fletcher's Plane Stirs a Panic&quot;, p. A1&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after takeoff en route to [[State funeral of Ronald Reagan|memorial services for former president Ronald Reagan]], the [[Transponder (aviation)|transponder]] on Fletcher's plane malfunctioned, leading officials at [[Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport|Reagan National Airport]] to report an unauthorized aircraft entering restricted airspace.&lt;ref name=panic /&gt; Two [[McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle|F-15 fighters]] were dispatched to investigate, and Fletcher's plane was escorted to its destination by two [[Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk|Blackhawk helicopters]].&lt;ref name=panic /&gt; The plane, a 33-year-old [[Beechcraft King Air]], was the oldest of its model still in operation.&lt;ref name=panic /&gt; An investigation by the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) found that the crew of Fletcher's plane maintained radio contact with air traffic officials and received clearance to enter the restricted air space.&lt;ref name=faa&gt;Alessi, &quot;Air Controller Error Blamed For D.C. Panic&quot;, p. B1&lt;/ref&gt; The investigation determined that miscommunication by air traffic controllers sparked the panic, and in the aftermath of the incident, the FAA adopted policies to prevent future errors of a similar nature.&lt;ref name=faa /&gt;

[[File:JayLenoJul08.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=A gray-haired man with a prominent chin wearing a blue shirt and smiling|Jay Leno's jokes about Fletcher's effort to create a brand for Kentucky prompted an appearance by Fletcher on ''The Tonight Show'']]
In July 2004, Fletcher announced a plan to unify the state's branding to improve its public perception.&lt;ref name=image&gt;Biesk, &quot;Leno Spot to Boost Image&quot;, p. K1&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after the announcement, late-night comedians [[Craig Kilborn]] and [[Jay Leno]] made some tongue-in-cheek suggestions for the new slogan on ''[[The Late Late Show (CBS TV series)|The Late Late Show]]'' and ''[[The Tonight Show]]'', respectively.&lt;ref name=image /&gt; In response, Fletcher wrote a letter to both comedians taking exception to the jokes and was invited to appear on both programs.&lt;ref name=image /&gt; Citing Leno's larger audience and earlier time slot, Fletcher agreed to appear on ''The Tonight Show'', where he presented Leno with a [[Hillerich &amp; Bradsby|Louisville Slugger]] baseball bat and traded jocular barbs about the relative advantages of Kentucky and [[Los Angeles]] where ''The Tonight Show'' is filmed.&lt;ref name=leno&gt;&quot;Fletcher, Leno Spar&quot;. ''The Kentucky Post'', p. K1&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, four slogans were chosen to be voted on online as well as at interstate travel centers.&lt;ref name=brand&gt;Alessi, &quot;State's New Brand Hits Road&quot;, p. A1&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2004, &quot;Kentucky: Unbridled Spirit&quot; was chosen as the winning slogan and was printed on road signs, state documents, and souvenirs.&lt;ref name=brand /&gt; A 2007 study determined that 88.9% of Kentuckians could correctly identify the slogan and its logo.&lt;ref name=unbridled&gt;&quot;Kentucky Unbridled Spirit&quot;. Commonwealth of Kentucky&lt;/ref&gt; Further, 64% of those surveyed across a ten-state region recognized the slogan and logo, higher than any other brand tested in the study.&lt;ref name=unbridled /&gt;

In the second half of 2004, Fletcher proposed changes to the health benefits of state workers and retirees. Fletcher's plan provided discounts for members who engaged in healthier behavior, which he called a transition from a sickness initiative to a wellness initiative.&lt;ref name=session2004&gt;York, &quot;Fletcher Calls a Special Session&quot;, p. K1&lt;/ref&gt; Acknowledging that out-of-pocket expenses would rise, Fletcher proposed a 1% salary increase to offset the additional costs.&lt;ref name=session2004 /&gt; State employees, particularly public school teachers, broadly opposed Fletcher's plan, and the Kentucky Educators Association called for an indefinite [[Strike action|strike]], to begin October 27, 2004.&lt;ref name=session2004 /&gt; To address the opposition, Fletcher called a special session of the legislature to begin October 5, 2004.&lt;ref name=session2004 /&gt; Although the state was still operating under an executive spending plan, Fletcher did not include the budget or his tax reform proposal in the session's agenda, a move praised by both parties, allowing them to focus only on concerns over the health plan.&lt;ref name=session2004 /&gt; In a fifteen-day session, the General Assembly passed a plan that allocated $190 million more to health insurance for state workers and restored many of the most popular benefits in the previous insurance plan.&lt;ref name=nostrike&gt;Brammer and Alessi, &quot;Health Plan Passes&quot;, p. A1&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately after the session adjourned, the Kentucky Educators Association voted to cancel their proposed strike.&lt;ref name=nostrike /&gt;

On November 8, 2004, Fletcher signed a [[execution warrant|death warrant]] for Thomas Clyde Bowling, who was convicted of a double murder in 1990 and sentenced to death by [[lethal injection]].&lt;ref name=barrouquere&gt;Barrouquere, &quot;Did Fletcher Risk License By Signing Death Warrant?&quot;, p. A12&lt;/ref&gt; A group of doctors requested an investigation by the Kentucky Board of Medical Licensure to determine whether Fletcher's medical license should be revoked for that action.&lt;ref name=barrouquere /&gt; Kentucky requires doctors to follow the guidelines of the [[American Medical Association]], which forbid doctors from participating in an execution.&lt;ref name=barrouquere /&gt; On January 13, 2005, the Board of Medical Licensure found that Fletcher was acting in his capacity as governor, not as a doctor, when he signed the warrant and ruled that his license was not forfeit by that action.&lt;ref name=musgrave&gt;Musgrave, &quot;Medical Board Sides With Governor&quot;, p. C1&lt;/ref&gt;

During the General Assembly's 2005 session, Fletcher again proposed his tax reform plan, and late in the session, both houses passed it.&lt;ref name=mayse&gt;Mayse, &quot;Legislators pass flurry of bills on session's last day&quot;, p. B5&lt;/ref&gt; The plan raised [[sin tax]]es on [[cigarette]]s and alcohol, as well as upping taxes on satellite television service and motel rooms.&lt;ref name=overhaul&gt;Brammer, &quot;Tax Overhaul Passed 96–4 By House&quot;, p. A1&lt;/ref&gt; Businesses were also subjected to a [[gross receipts tax]].&lt;ref name=overhaul /&gt; In exchange, corporate taxes were lowered, as were income taxes for individuals who earned less than $75,000 annually; 300,000 low-wage earners were dropped from the income tax rolls altogether.&lt;ref name=overhaul /&gt; The Assembly also passed a budget for the remainder of the biennium, abolished the state's public [[campaign finance]] laws, and passed new school nutrition guidelines.&lt;ref name=mayse /&gt;

===Merit system investigation===
In May 2005, Attorney General Stumbo began an investigation of allegations that the Fletcher administration circumvented the state [[merit system]] for hiring, promoting, demoting and firing state employees by basing decisions on employees' political loyalties.&lt;ref name=investigation1&gt;Alessi and Brammer, &quot;Cabinet Hirings Are Under Investigation&quot;, p. A1&lt;/ref&gt; The investigation was prompted by a 276-page complaint filed by Douglas W. Doerting, the assistant personnel director for the [[Kentucky Transportation Cabinet]].&lt;ref name=investigation1 /&gt; Fletcher, who was on a [[trade mission]] in [[Japan]] when news of the investigation broke, conceded via telephone news conference that his office may have made &quot;mistakes&quot; with regard to hiring that stemmed from not having a formal process for handling employment recommendations.&lt;ref name=defiant&gt;Brammer and Alessi, &quot;Defiant Fletcher Blames Politics&quot;, p. A1&lt;/ref&gt; Upon his return from Japan, Fletcher denied that the &quot;mistakes&quot; by his administration were illegal and called the investigation by Stumbo &quot;the beginning of the 2007 governor's race&quot;, an allusion to Stumbo's potential candidacy in 2007.&lt;ref name=defiant /&gt; Stumbo denied any plans to run for governor in 2007, although he eventually became gubernatorial candidate [[Bruce Lunsford]]'s running mate in the election, losing in the Democratic primary.&lt;ref name=defiant /&gt;

A [[grand jury]] was empaneled in June 2005 to investigate the charges against Fletcher's administration. By August, the jury had returned [[indictment]]s against nine administration officials, including state Republican Party chairman [[Darrell Brock Jr.]] and acting Transportation Secretary [[Bill Nighbert]].&lt;ref name=felonies&gt;Brammer and Alessi, &quot;Druen Accused of 21 New Felonies&quot;, p. A1&lt;/ref&gt; All of the indictments were for [[misdemeanor]]s such as [[conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] except those against Administrative Services Commissioner [[Dan Druen]], who was charged with 22 [[Felony|felonies]] (20 counts of [[Falsified evidence|physical evidence tampering]] and 2 counts of [[witness tampering]]) in addition to 13 misdemeanors.&lt;ref name=felonies /&gt; On August 29, Fletcher granted [[clemency|pardons]] to the nine indicted administration officials and issued a blanket pardon for &quot;any and all persons who have committed, or may be accused of committing, any offense&quot; with regard to the investigation.&lt;ref name=pardons&gt;Chellgren, &quot;Fletcher Signs Blanket Pardons&quot;, p. K1&lt;/ref&gt; Fletcher exempted himself from the blanket pardon.&lt;ref name=pardons /&gt; The next day, Fletcher was called to testify before the grand jury, but refused to answer any questions, invoking his [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] right against self-incrimination.&lt;ref name=5th&gt;Chellgren, &quot;Fletcher Pleads the 5th&quot;, p. K1&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-September, after Fletcher issued the pardons, a ''[[Louisville Courier-Journal|Courier-Journal]]'' poll found Fletcher's approval rating at 38 percent, tying the lowest rating reached by his predecessor, Paul E. Patton, during the sex scandal that tarnished his administration.&lt;ref name=septemberpoll&gt;Loftus, &quot;Fletcher's approval rating sinks to 38%&quot;, p. B1&lt;/ref&gt; On September 14, 2005, Fletcher fired nine employees, including four of the nine he pardoned two weeks earlier.&lt;ref name=fires9&gt;Alessi, &quot;Fletcher Fires 9 for 'Mistakes'&quot;, p. A1&lt;/ref&gt; The firings were praised by Fletcher critic Charles Wells of the Kentucky Association of State Employees, who said: &quot;When all else fails, the governor did the right thing.&quot;&lt;ref name=fires9 /&gt; However, Democratic state senator and former governor [[Julian Carroll]] criticized Fletcher for not firing the indicted officials when he issued the pardons.&lt;ref name=fires9 /&gt; Fletcher also called for the firing of state Republican Party chair Darrell Brock, Jr. due to Brock's role in the merit scandal.&lt;ref name=fires9 /&gt; The state Republican executive committee met on September 17, but did not act on Fletcher's call to fire Brock.&lt;ref name=firebrock&gt;Biesk, &quot;Fletcher Calls for GOP Chairman to Resign&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

The grand jury continued its investigation, issuing five more indictments after Fletcher issued his blanket pardon.&lt;ref name=gj-continue&gt;Alessi, &quot;Grand Jury Can Continue to Indict&quot;, p. A1&lt;/ref&gt; Two were returned against members of Fletcher's staff, and two were against unpaid advisors to Fletcher.&lt;ref name=gj-continue /&gt; The fifth was issued against Acting Secretary Nighbert for retaliation against a [[whistleblower]].&lt;ref name=gj-continue /&gt; Only the additional charge against Nighbert was alleged to have occurred after Fletcher issued the pardon.&lt;ref name=gj-continue /&gt; On October 24, 2005, Fletcher filed a motion asking Franklin Circuit Court Judge William Graham to order the grand jury to stop issuing indictments for offenses that occurred prior to the blanket pardon; only the names of indicted officials could be included in the jury's final report.&lt;ref name=gj-continue /&gt; On November 16, Graham ruled that the grand jury could continue issuing indictments, but in a separate ruling, dismissed the indictments against Fletcher's staff and volunteer advisors on grounds that they were covered by the pardon.&lt;ref name=gj-continue /&gt; Graham did not rule on the latest indictment against Nighbert.&lt;ref name=gj-continue /&gt; The [[Kentucky Court of Appeals]] affirmed Graham's ruling on December 16.&lt;ref name=coa-continue&gt;Alessi, &quot;Pardons Do Not Preclude Inquiry&quot;, p. A1&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately after the Court of Appeals' ruling, Fletcher announced his intent to appeal the ruling to the [[Kentucky Supreme Court]].&lt;ref name=coa-continue /&gt;

===2006 legislative session===
On February 12, 2006, shortly after the beginning of the General Assembly's legislative session, Fletcher was hospitalized with abdominal pain.&lt;ref name=leaves1&gt;Warren, &quot;Fletcher Leaves Hospital for Home&quot;, p. A1&lt;/ref&gt; Doctors at St. Joseph East hospital in Lexington found a [[gallstone]] in his [[common bile duct]] and also diagnosed him with an inflamed [[pancreas]] and gallbladder disease.&lt;ref name=leaves1 /&gt; After surgery to remove the gallbladder, Fletcher developed a blood infection that slowed his recovery, but was discharged from the hospital on March 1.&lt;ref name=leaves1 /&gt; Days later, he returned to St. Joseph's with a blood clot which had to be dissolved, resulting in another five-day stay in the hospital.&lt;ref name=leaves2&gt;Warren, &quot;Fletcher Leaves Hospital&quot;, p. C1&lt;/ref&gt; Fletcher staffers insisted that his absence did not have a negative impact on his ability to get legislation passed during the session.&lt;ref name=impact&gt;Steitzer, &quot;Fletcher Illness Has Little Impact on Political Work&quot;, p. A1&lt;/ref&gt; A [[right-to-work law]] and a repeal of the state's [[prevailing wage]] law – both advocated by Fletcher – failed early in the session, but both had been considered unlikely to pass before the session started.&lt;ref name=impact /&gt; Among the bills that did pass the session were a mandatory [[Seat belt legislation in the United States|seat belt law]], a law requiring children under 16 years old to wear a helmet when operating an [[all-terrain vehicle]], and legislation allowing the [[Ten Commandments]] to be posted on Capitol grounds in a historical context.&lt;ref name=doa&gt;Brammer and Alessi, &quot;Several Bills Dead on Arrival This Year&quot;, p. B1&lt;/ref&gt;

The Assembly passed a biennial budget, but did not allow enough time in the session to reconvene and potentially override any of Fletcher's [[veto]]es.&lt;ref name=budgetveto&gt;Alessi, et al., &quot;Money For Baptist College Stays In&quot;, p. A1&lt;/ref&gt; In an attempt to avoid &quot;excessive debt&quot;, Fletcher used his [[line-item veto]] to trim $370 million in projects from the budget passed by the Assembly.&lt;ref name=budgetveto /&gt; Although falling far short of his initial prediction of vetoing $938 million, Fletcher used the line-item veto more than any other governor in state history.&lt;ref name=budgetveto /&gt; One project not vetoed by Fletcher was $11 million for the [[University of the Cumberlands]] to build a [[pharmacy school]].&lt;ref name=budgetveto /&gt; [[LGBT]] rights groups had asked Fletcher to veto the funds because the university, a private Baptist school, had [[University of the Cumberlands#Jason Johnson|expelled a student for being openly gay]].&lt;ref name=uclawsuit&gt;Beisk, &quot;$11M For College Triggers Lawsuit&quot;, p. A1&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Fletcher's priorities that was not resolved during the session was the correction of unintended tax increases on businesses that resulted from the tax reform plan passed in 2005. Fletcher called a special legislative session for mid-June so that the legislature could amend the plan and also authorize tax breaks designed to lure a proposed [[FutureGen]] power plant to [[Henderson, Kentucky|Henderson]]. Republican [[President of the Kentucky Senate|Senate President]] [[David L. Williams]] asked Fletcher to include tax breaks for other businesses as well, but Fletcher insisted on a sparse legislative agenda. The session convened for five days and passed the tax breaks and amended tax reform plan unanimously in both houses. Fletcher applauded the legislature's efficiency.&lt;ref name=ss2006&gt;Jordan and Fontana, &quot;Fletcher Signs Tax Relief Bill&quot;, p. B1&lt;/ref&gt;

===Investigation concludes===
As the Kentucky Supreme Court prepared to hear Fletcher's appeal on whether the grand jury could continue to indict people covered by his blanket pardon, two of the court's seven justices recused themselves from the case, citing [[conflict of interest|conflicts of interest]].&lt;ref name=stepdown&gt;Alessi, &quot;Judge Steps Down in Hiring Case&quot;, p. B1&lt;/ref&gt; Kentucky's constitution provides that, in the case of more than one recusal on the court, the governor is to appoint special justices to replace them.&lt;ref name=stepdown /&gt; Accordingly, Fletcher named two replacements, but one of those – Circuit Judge Jeffrey Burdette – declined to serve on grounds that he had contributed to Fletcher's 2003 gubernatorial campaign.&lt;ref name=stepdown /&gt; Fletcher then named another special justice to replace Burdette, consistent with a precedent set by former Democratic Governor [[Brereton Jones]].&lt;ref name=stepdown /&gt; Stumbo challenged this third appointment, claiming that Burdette's refusal to serve created only one vacancy on the court, and that the case could be tried with six justices.&lt;ref name=kscreject&gt;Brammer, &quot;High Court Rejects Special Justice Named by Fletcher&quot;, p. B1&lt;/ref&gt; The Kentucky Supreme Court sustained Stumbo's complaint.&lt;ref name=kscreject /&gt; In a 4–2 ruling issued May 18, 2006, the Kentucky Supreme Court barred the grand jury from issuing further indictments against individuals covered by Fletcher's blanket pardon, reversing the Court of Appeals.&lt;ref name=reverse&gt;Brammer and Alessi, &quot;Court: Pardons Bar Later Charges&quot;, p. A1&lt;/ref&gt; The ruling did not affect indictments for crimes allegedly committed after the pardon was issued.&lt;ref name=reverse /&gt; The Supreme Court also held that the grand jury could issue a general report of its findings at the conclusion of its investigation, but left open the question of whether the names of unindicted individuals could appear in the report.&lt;ref name=reverse /&gt; A later decision by the Court of Appeals found that unindicted individuals could not be named in the report.&lt;ref&gt;Brammer, &quot;Grand Jury Can't Indict Those Pardoned&quot;, p. A1&lt;/ref&gt;

Just prior to the Supreme Court's ruling, the grand jury handed down indictments against Fletcher for three misdemeanors – conspiracy, official misconduct, and political discrimination.&lt;ref name=arraignment&gt;Beisk, &quot;Judge Sets November Trial Date for Fletcher&quot;, p. A1&lt;/ref&gt; Fletcher did not appear at his arraignment on June 9 because he was on vacation in [[Florida]]; his attorney entered &quot;not guilty&quot; pleas to all three charges on his behalf.&lt;ref name=arraignment /&gt; On August 11, 2006, Special Judge David E. Melcher ruled that because the personnel violations were allegedly committed while Fletcher was acting in his official capacity as governor, he was protected by [[executive immunity]] and could not be prosecuted until he left office.&lt;ref name=immune&gt;Kreimer and Steitzer, &quot;Fletcher Off the Hook, for Now&quot;, p. A1&lt;/ref&gt; Melcher asked that the two sides work together to reach a settlement in the case.&lt;ref name=settlement&gt;Alford, &quot;Deal Struck to End Case Against Fletcher&quot;, p. A1&lt;/ref&gt; On August 24, Fletcher and Stumbo announced such an agreement.&lt;ref name=settlement /&gt; Under the settlement, Fletcher acknowledged that evidence &quot;strongly indicate[d] wrongdoing by his administration&quot; but did not admit any wrongdoing personally.&lt;ref name=settlement /&gt; Fletcher also acknowledged that Stumbo's prosecution of the case &quot;[was a] necessary and proper [exercise] of his constitutional duty&quot; and ensured that abuses of the merit system would be ended.&lt;ref name=settlement /&gt; In addition to dropping the charges against Fletcher, Stumbo conceded that any violations by Fletcher's administration were &quot;without malice&quot;.&lt;ref name=settlement /&gt; Four members of the state Personnel Board who were appointed by Fletcher were required to step down.&lt;ref name=settlement /&gt; Their replacements would be chosen by Fletcher from a list provided by Stumbo.&lt;ref name=settlement /&gt;

The grand jury issued its report on the investigation in October 2006, and a judge ordered it released to the public on November 16. The report categorized the Fletcher administration's actions as &quot;a widespread and coordinated plan to violate merit hiring laws.&quot; It charged that &quot;This investigation was not about a few people here and there who made some mistakes as Governor Ernie Fletcher had claimed,&quot; and lamented that the blanket pardon issued by Fletcher, coupled with Fletcher taking the Fifth, made it &quot;difficult to get to the bottom of the facts of this case....As a result, [the grand jury was] in part forced to rely on documentary evidence to piece together the facts of the case.&quot; Fletcher opined that the allegations in the report were inconsistent with his settlement with Stumbo, which acknowledged that Fletcher's administration acted &quot;without malice.&quot;&lt;ref name=report&gt;Brammer and Stamper, &quot;Grand Jury Blasts Fletcher&quot;, p. A1&lt;/ref&gt;

==2007 gubernatorial election==
[[File:Anne Northup, official 109th Congress photo.jpg|thumb|right|upright|alt=A brown-haired woman in her early fifties wearing a white blouse, black jacket, and pearl earrings|Anne Northup challenged Fletcher in the 2007 Republican gubernatorial primary.]]
{{Main|Kentucky gubernatorial election, 2007}}

In early 2005, Fletcher announced his intent to run for re-election.&lt;ref name=doagain&gt;York, &quot;Fletcher: Let's Do This Again&quot;, p. A12&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after Fletcher was indicted by the grand jury in 2006, Lieutenant Governor Pence announced that he would not be Fletcher's running mate during his re-election bid.&lt;ref name=arraignment /&gt; Fletcher asked for Pence's immediate resignation as lieutenant governor. Pence declined, but did tender his resignation as head of the Justice Cabinet.&lt;ref name=arraignment /&gt; Fletcher named his executive secretary, [[Robbie Rudolph]], as his new running mate.&lt;ref name=arraignment /&gt;

Although Fletcher's agreement with Stumbo to end the investigation was announced in late 2006, the scandal continued to plague his re-election bid, and he drew two challengers in the Republican primary – former [[Kentucky's 3rd congressional district|Third District Congresswoman]] [[Anne Northup]] and multi-millionaire [[Paducah, Kentucky|Paducah]] businessman Billy Harper.&lt;ref name=recognition&gt;Biesk, &quot;Name recognition&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Senator [[Mitch McConnell]], the consensus leader of the Kentucky Republican Party, declined to make an endorsement in the primary, but conceded that Northup was &quot;a formidable opponent&quot;.&lt;ref name=recognition /&gt; Northup campaigned on the idea that Fletcher's involvement in the hiring scandal had made him &quot;unelectable&quot;.&lt;ref name=tone&gt;Alessi, &quot;Northup Sets Tone of GOP Primary Race&quot;, p. A1&lt;/ref&gt; Northup secured the endorsements of [[Jim Bunning]], Kentucky's other Republican senator, and Lieutenant Governor Pence.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, &quot;Bunning Backs Northup for Gov&quot;, p. A1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alessi and Brammer, &quot;Pence Endorses Northup&quot;, p. A1&lt;/ref&gt; In the primary, Fletcher garnered over 50% of the vote and secured the party's nomination.&lt;ref name=primaryresult&gt;Alessi and Estep, &quot;It's Fletcher Vs. Beshear&quot;, p. A1&lt;/ref&gt; His rival Northup struggled with name recognition and found few areas of support outside the Louisville district she represented in Congress.&lt;ref name=primaryresult /&gt; She garnered 36.5% of the vote, with the remaining 13.4% going to Billy Harper.&lt;ref name=statewide&gt;&quot;Statewide Results&quot;. ''The Kentucky Post'', p. A7&lt;/ref&gt; Democrats nominated former Lieutenant Governor [[Steve Beshear]] to challenge Fletcher.&lt;ref name=primaryresult /&gt;

In the midst of the primary campaign, the 2007 General Assembly convened. Among the accomplishments of the session were raising the state's [[Minimum wage in the United States|minimum wage]] to $7.25 per hour, increasing the [[speed limit]] on major state highways to {{convert|70|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, and implementing new safety requirements for social workers and coal miners.&lt;ref name=2007session&gt;Alessi, &quot;Neither Chamber Gets Satisfaction&quot;, p. A1&lt;/ref&gt; Additional legislation stalled after negotiations over how to make the state's retirement system solvent reached an impasse.&lt;ref name=2007session /&gt; Fletcher indicated that he would consider calling the Assembly into special session later in the year.&lt;ref&gt;Covington, &quot;Priorities changed late in session&quot;, p. A1&lt;/ref&gt; In July, Fletcher called the session and included 67 items on its agenda.&lt;ref name=j07ss&gt;Covington, &quot;House adjourns, Senate to keep working in special session&quot;, p. A1&lt;/ref&gt; Democrats in the state House of Representatives maintained that none of the items were urgent enough to warrant a special session.&lt;ref name=j07ss /&gt; They claimed the call was an attempt by Fletcher to boost his sagging poll numbers against Beshear, and the House adjourned after only 90 minutes without acting on any of Fletcher's agenda.&lt;ref name=j07ss /&gt; Fletcher denied the claims and insisted that a tax incentive program was needed immediately to keep the state in the running for a proposed [[coal gasification]] plant to be built by [[Peabody Energy]].&lt;ref name=j07ss /&gt; After negotiating with legislators, Fletcher called another session for August; the session included only the tax incentive program, which the Assembly passed.&lt;ref&gt;Brammer, &quot;Senate Passes Energy Measure&quot;, p. B1&lt;/ref&gt;

In the general election campaign, Fletcher attempted to make the expansion of [[casino]] gambling, rather than the merit system investigation, the central issue.&lt;ref name=campaign&gt;Alford, &quot;Beshear Coasts to Win&quot;, p. A1&lt;/ref&gt; Beshear favored holding a referendum on a constitutional amendment to allow expanded casino gambling in the state, while Fletcher maintained that expanded gambling would bring an increase in crime and societal ills.&lt;ref name=campaign /&gt; The gambling issue failed to gain as much traction as the hiring scandal, however, and Beshear defeated Fletcher by a vote of 619,686 to 435,895.&lt;ref name=campaign /&gt; 

After the election, Fletcher founded Alton Heathcare, a consulting firm that helps healthcare providers make efficient use of technology in their practice.&lt;ref name=aboutalton&gt;&quot;About Alton Healthcare&quot;. Alton Healthcare&lt;/ref&gt; He has served as CEO of the company, which is based in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]], since 2008.&lt;ref name=aboutalton /&gt;
