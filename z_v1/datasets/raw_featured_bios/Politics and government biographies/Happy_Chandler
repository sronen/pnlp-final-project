'''Albert Benjamin &quot;Happy&quot; Chandler, Sr.''' (July 14, 1898{{spaced ndash}}June 15, 1991) was a politician from the US state of [[Kentucky]]. He represented the state in the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] and served as its [[List of Governors of Kentucky|44th and 49th]] [[Governor of Kentucky|governor]]. Aside from his political positions, he also served as the second [[Commissioner of Baseball|Commissioner of Major League Baseball]] from 1945 to 1951 and was inducted into the [[Baseball Hall of Fame]] in 1982. His grandson, [[Ben Chandler]], is currently a [[United States House of Representatives|congressman]] from [[Kentucky's 6th congressional district|Kentucky's Sixth District]].

A multi-sport athlete during his college days at [[Transylvania University|Transylvania College]], Chandler briefly considered a career in professional baseball before deciding to pursue a law degree. After graduation, he entered politics and was elected as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] to the [[Kentucky Senate]] in 1928. Two years, later, he was elected [[Lieutenant Governor of Kentucky|lieutenant governor]], serving under Governor [[Ruby Laffoon]]. Chandler and Laffoon disagreed on the issue of instituting a state [[sales tax]] and when Chandler, the presiding officer in the state senate, worked to block the legislation, Laffoon's allies in the [[Kentucky General Assembly|General Assembly]] stripped him of many of his statutory powers. The tax then passed by a narrow margin. Knowing that Laffoon would try to select his own successor at the Democratic nominating convention, Chandler waited until Laffoon left the state &amp;ndash; leaving Chandler as acting governor &amp;ndash; and called the legislature into session to enact a mandatory [[primary election]] bill. The bill passed, and in the ensuing primary, Chandler defeated Laffoon's choice, [[Thomas Rhea]]. He then went on to defeat [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[King Swope]] by the largest margin of victory for a Kentucky gubernatorial race to that time. As governor, Chandler oversaw the repeal of the sales tax, replacing the lost revenue with new [[excise tax]]es and the state's first [[income tax]]. He also enacted a major reorganization of state government, realizing significant savings for the state. He used these savings to pay off the state debt and improve the state's education and transportation systems.

Convinced that he was destined to become President of the United States, Chandler challenged [[Party leaders of the United States Senate|Senate Majority Leader]] [[Alben Barkley]] for his U.S. Senate seat in 1938. During the campaign, President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] came to the state to campaign for Barkley, and Chandler lost a close race. The following year, Kentucky's other senator, [[Marvel Mills Logan]], died in office, and Chandler resigned as governor so his successor could appoint him to the vacant seat. A [[Fiscal conservatism|fiscal conservative]] and disciple of [[Virginia]]'s [[Harry F. Byrd]], Chandler opposed parts of Roosevelt's [[New Deal]] and openly disagreed with the president's decision to prioritize [[European Theatre of World War II|European operations]] in World War II over [[Pacific Theater of Operations|the war in the Pacific]]. In 1945, Chandler resigned his senate seat to succeed the late [[Kennesaw Mountain Landis]] as commissioner of baseball. His most significant action as commissioner was the approval of [[Jackie Robinson]]'s contract with the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]], effectively integrating [[Major League Baseball]]. He also established the first pension fund for Major League players, earning him the title &quot;the players' commissioner&quot;. Baseball owners were upset with Chandler's governance, however, and did not renew his contract in 1951.

Following his term as commissioner, Chandler returned to Kentucky and won a second term as governor in 1955. The major accomplishments of his second term were enforcing the integration of the state's public schools and establishing a medical school at the [[University of Kentucky]] which was later named the [[Chandler Medical Center]] in his honor. Following his second term as governor, his political influence began to wane as he made three more unsuccessful runs for governor in 1963, 1967, and 1971. His endorsement of dark-horse candidate [[Wallace G. Wilkinson]] was seen as critical to Wilkinson's successful gubernatorial campaign in 1988. Wilkinson later resisted calls to remove Chandler from the University of Kentucky board of trustees following Chandler's use of a racial epithet during a board meeting in 1988. Chandler died June 15, 1991, a month before his ninety-third birthday. At the time of his death, he was the oldest living former U.S. governor. He was also the oldest person ever inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame.

==Early life==
Albert Benjamin Chandler was born in the farming community of [[Corydon, Kentucky]] in 1898.&lt;ref name=congbio&gt;&quot;Chandler, Albert Benjamin (Happy)&quot;. ''Biographical Directory of the United States Congress''&lt;/ref&gt; He was the eldest child of Joseph Sephus and Callie (Saunders) Chandler.&lt;ref name=kye179&gt;Harrison, p. 179&lt;/ref&gt; Chandler's father allegedly rescued his mother from an orphanage and married her when she was fifteen, though no record of their marriage has ever been found.&lt;ref name=boyett&gt;Boyett, &quot;Yesterday's News: Happy reunion&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; In 1899, Chandler's brother Robert was born. Two years later, their mother, still in her teens and unable to cope with raising two young children, abandoned the family. She fled the state and left her sons with their father.&lt;ref name=boyett /&gt; In his autobiography, Chandler said his mother leaving when them was his earliest memory.&lt;ref name=boyett /&gt; Years later, he sought his mother and found her living in [[Jacksonville, Florida]]. She had married again and he had three half-siblings.&lt;ref name=boyett /&gt; His full brother, Robert Chandler, died when he fell from a cherry tree when he was 13 years old.&lt;ref name=flaherty113&gt;Flaherty, p. 113&lt;/ref&gt;

Chandler was raised by his father and relatives, and by age eight virtually supported himself financially from his paper route and doing odd jobs in his community.&lt;ref name=roland168&gt;Roland, p. 168&lt;/ref&gt; In 1917 he graduated from Corydon High School,&lt;ref name=kye179 /&gt; While he had been [[Captain (sports)|captain]] of the baseball and [[American football|football]] teams.&lt;ref name=mlb&gt;&quot;Albert Benjamin 'Happy' Chandler&quot;. Major League Baseball&lt;/ref&gt; His father wanted him to study for the ministry, but Chandler instead entered Transylvania College (now [[Transylvania University]]) in [[Lexington, Kentucky]].&lt;ref name=congbio /&gt;&lt;ref name=shannon176&gt;Shannon, p. 176&lt;/ref&gt; It was there that he received his life-long nickname &quot;Happy&quot; because of his jovial nature.&lt;ref name=mlb /&gt; He paid for his education by doing chores for the local citizens.&lt;ref name=roland169 /&gt; Chander was captain of Transylvania's basketball and baseball teams and the [[quarterback]] of the football team. He was a teammate of [[Dutch Meyer]], a future member of the [[College Football Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref name=roland169&gt;Roland, p. 169&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=flaherty117&gt;Flaherty, p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; He also joined the [[Pi Kappa Alpha]] fraternity and the [[Omicron Delta Kappa]] honor society.&lt;ref name=ukaa /&gt; In 1918, during [[World War I]], the [[United States Army]] started a [[Reserve Officers' Training Corps|Student Officers' Training Corps]] at Transylvania, and Chandler began training to be an officer; the war ended before he was called to active duty.&lt;ref name=flaherty117 /&gt;

In 1920, Chandler pitched a [[no-hitter]] for [[Grafton, North Dakota]]'s team in the Red River Valley League.&lt;ref name=deford57&gt;Deford, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; He attended a professional baseball tryout in [[Saskatoon]], but did not make the team.&lt;ref name=deford57 /&gt; He returned to Transylvania and received a Bachelor of Arts degree in June 1921.&lt;ref name=ukaa /&gt; He then signed with the Class D baseball team the [[Lexington Reos]], where he was a teammate of future [[Baseball Hall of Fame|Hall of Famer]] [[Earle Combs]].&lt;ref name=flaherty119&gt;Flaherty, p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; Briefly considering a career in baseball, he finally decided to study law.&lt;ref name=flaherty120&gt;Flaherty, p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; He entered [[Harvard Law School]] that same year,&lt;ref name=kye179 /&gt; paying his way by coaching high school sports in [[Wellesley, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name=mead&gt;Mead and Warren, &quot;Kentucky's 'Happy' Chandler Dies&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; His former teammate [[Charlie Moran]], then coaching the [[Centre Praying Colonels football|Centre College Praying Colonels football team]] in [[Danville, Kentucky]], asked him to scout the national powerhouse [[Harvard Crimson football|Harvard Crimson]], an upcoming opponent for Centre.&lt;ref name=flaherty120 /&gt; Chandler took copious notes for Moran, and [[1921 Centre vs. Harvard football game|Centre defeated Harvard 6&amp;ndash;0]] in what is considered one of the greatest college football upsets of all time.&lt;ref name=flaherty121&gt;Flaherty, p. 121&lt;/ref&gt;

After a year, Chandler was no able to afford Harvard.&lt;ref name=mead /&gt; He returned to Kentucky and continued at the [[University of Kentucky College of Law]],&lt;ref name=kye179 /&gt;  coaching high school sports in [[Versailles, Kentucky|Versailles]] and women's basketball at the University of Kentucky.&lt;ref name=deford57 /&gt; He was an assistant coach and scout for Charlie Moran at Centre, and coached the freshman football team there.&lt;ref name=flaherty121 /&gt; A member of the [[Order of the Coif]], he received [[Bachelor of Laws]] degree in 1924.&lt;ref name=ukaa /&gt; He was admitted to the [[Bar (law)|bar]] the following year and opened his law practice in Versailles.&lt;ref name=congbio /&gt;&lt;ref name=ukaa /&gt;

On November 12, 1925, Chandler married Mildred Watkins, a teacher at the Margaret Hall School for Girls.&lt;ref&gt;Flaherty, pp. 121&amp;ndash;122&lt;/ref&gt; They would have four children: Marcella, Mildred (&quot;Mimi&quot;), Albert, Jr., and Joseph Daniel.&lt;ref name=flaherty122&gt;Flaherty, p. 122&lt;/ref&gt; Mimi Chandler played one of the four singing sisters in the 1944 film ''[[And the Angels Sing]]'', appearing with [[Dorothy Lamour]], [[Betty Hutton]], and [[Diana Lynn]] before abandoning acting and working for the Kentucky Department of Tourism.&lt;ref name=mimi&gt;Edwards, &quot;'Happy's' Daughter has Found her Niche&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

For the next five years, Chandler simultaneously practiced law, coached high school sports, and served as a scout for Centre.&lt;ref name=roland169 /&gt; He joined numerous fraternal organizations including the [[Freemasonry|Freemasons]], [[Shriners]], [[Knights Templar (Freemasonry)|Knights Templar]], [[Forty and Eight veterans organization|Forty and Eight]], and [[Optimist International]].&lt;ref name=shannon176 /&gt;

==Early political career==
Chandler entered politics when he was named chairman of the [[Woodford County, Kentucky|Woodford County]] Democratic Committee.&lt;ref name=shannon176 /&gt; In 1928, he was appointed master commissioner of the Woodford County [[circuit court]].&lt;ref name=nga&gt;&quot;Kentucky Governor Albert Benjamin Chandler&quot;. National Governors Association&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, he was elected as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] to represent the Twenty-second district in the [[Kentucky Senate]].&lt;ref name=kye179 /&gt;&lt;ref name=flaherty122 /&gt; As a member of the Senate, he was part of a Democratic coalition that passed legislation to strip [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Governor [[Flem D. Sampson]] of many of his statutory powers.&lt;ref name=pearce28&gt;Pearce, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:J. C. W. Beckham.jpg|thumb|right|upright|alt=Cleanshaven man with drooping eyelids, aged about 40. He is wearing a black bowler hat, white shirt, tie and dark overcoat|Former governor J. C. W. Beckham was one of Chandler's allies in his early political career.]]
As the 1931 gubernatorial election approached, Chandler and [[Prestonsburg, Kentucky|Prestonsburg]] native Jack Howard were mentioned as candidates for [[Lieutenant Governor of Kentucky|lieutenant governor]].&lt;ref name=klotter294&gt;Klotter, p. 294&lt;/ref&gt; [[United States House of Representatives|Congressman]] [[Fred M. Vinson]] backed Howard, a fellow [[Eastern Mountain Coal Fields|Eastern Kentuckian]], while [[political boss]]es Billy Klair, [[Johnson N. Camden, Jr.]], and [[Ben Johnson (politician)|Ben Johnson]] supported Chandler.&lt;ref name=klotter294 /&gt; The support of another political boss, Mickey Brennan, gave Chandler the edge at the party's nominating convention.&lt;ref name=klotter294 /&gt; Democratic gubernatorial nominee [[Ruby Laffoon]] also owed his selection to the machinations of the state's political bosses, notably his uncle, Congressman [[Polk Laffoon]].&lt;ref name=klotter294 /&gt; Problematically, Chandler was an ally of former Governor [[J. C. W. Beckham]], ''[[Louisville Courier-Journal]]'' publisher [[Robert Worth Bingham]], and [[political boss]] Percy Haly, which put him at odds with Laffoon, a member of a Democratic faction headed by [[Russellville, Kentucky|Russellville]] political boss [[Thomas Rhea]] and opposed to Beckham, Worth, and Haly.&lt;ref name=harrison368&gt;Harrison and Klotter, p. 368&lt;/ref&gt; Despite disharmony within the ticket, the worsening of the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]] under Republican President [[Herbert Hoover]] and Governor Sampson ensured a Democratic victory.&lt;ref name=klotter294 /&gt; Chandler was elected over John C. Worsham by a vote of 426,247 to 353,573.&lt;ref name=kye179 /&gt; In a break with precedent, Chandler set up an office on the executive floor of the [[Kentucky State Capitol|state capitol]] and worked there full-time; previous lieutenant governors had stayed in [[Frankfort, Kentucky|Frankfort]] only during legislative sessions, when they were charged with presiding over the state senate.&lt;ref name=pearce34&gt;Pearce, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after their election, the divide between Chandler and Laffoon widened over the issue of implementing a state [[sales tax]].&lt;ref name=kye179 /&gt; Laffoon favored the tax; Chandler opposed it.&lt;ref name=kye179 /&gt; As presiding officer of the state senate, Chandler worked with [[Speaker of the Kentucky House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] [[John Y. Brown, Sr.]] to block passage of the tax.&lt;ref name=shannon177&gt;Shannon, p. 177&lt;/ref&gt; In retaliation, Laffoon's allies in the [[Kentucky General Assembly|General Assembly]] stripped Chandler of some of his statutory power as lieutenant governor, after which they were able to pass the tax by a single vote in each house of the legislature.&lt;ref name=shannon177 /&gt;

Free from any constitutional duties during the time between sessions, Chandler had begun laying the groundwork to succeed Laffoon as governor almost from the beginning of his term as lieutenant governor.&lt;ref name=pearce34 /&gt; Laffoon, however, had made it clear that he favored Thomas Rhea to be his successor.&lt;ref name=pearce36&gt;Pearce, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; Rhea secured the services of rising political boss [[Earle C. Clements]] as his campaign manager.&lt;ref name=pearce36 /&gt; Hailing from [[Morganfield, Kentucky|Morganfield]], only a short distance from Chandler's hometown of Corydon, Clements later said that if Chandler had asked him first, he might have managed Chandler's campaign instead of Rhea's.&lt;ref name=pearce36 /&gt; Instead, by virtue of managing the opposing campaign, Clements became the leader of a Democratic faction that opposed Chandler for the next three decades.&lt;ref name=pearce36 /&gt;

Chandler feared Laffoon, who controlled the State Democratic Central Committee, would attempt to hand-select the Democratic gubernatorial nominee by calling a nominating convention instead of holding a [[primary election]], and he used a bold move to circumvent Laffoon's ability to carry out such an action.&lt;ref name=kye179 /&gt; Under the [[Kentucky Constitution]], Chandler became acting governor any time Laffoon left the state. When Laffoon traveled to meet with President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] in Washington, D. C. on February 6, 1935, Chandler used his authority to call the legislature into session to consider a bill requiring that each party's gubernatorial candidates be chosen by a primary rather than a nominating convention.&lt;ref name=kye179 /&gt;&lt;ref name=harrison368 /&gt; Laffoon returned to the state the next day and challenged Chandler's authority to make the call, but Chandler's actions were validated by the [[Kentucky Court of Appeals]] on February 26.&lt;ref name=roland170&gt;Roland, p. 170&lt;/ref&gt;

Laffoon knew the primary bill would be widely supported in the General Assembly, since both legislators and their constituents had grown to distrust party nominating conventions.&lt;ref name=pearce37&gt;Pearce, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, he proposed a bill enacting a mandatory two-stage primary in which a [[Two-round system|runoff election]] would be held between the top two candidates in the first round.&lt;ref name=harrison368 /&gt; Historian [[Lowell H. Harrison]] maintained that Laffoon expected his rival faction to nominate the aging Beckham to oppose Rhea, and that he hoped a two-stage primary would wear Beckham down.&lt;ref name=harrison368 /&gt; Journalist John Ed Pearce, however, contends that Beckham had already declined to become a candidate &amp;ndash; citing his own ill health and that of his son &amp;ndash; before the special session convened.&lt;ref name=pearce38&gt;Pearce, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; Whatever the case, the legislature passed the bill that Laffoon proposed.&lt;ref name=pearce37 /&gt;

==First term as governor==
After Beckham declined to run for governor, the anti-Laffoon faction supported Chandler against Rhea.&lt;ref name=harrison368 /&gt; During the primary campaign, Chandler seized upon the unpopular sales tax, labeling Rhea &quot;Sales Tax Tom&quot; and calling on the electorate to redeem the state from &quot;Ruby, Rhea, and Ruin&quot;.&lt;ref name=harrison368 /&gt; In the first round of the primary, Rhea garnered 203,010 votes to Chandler's 189,575.&lt;ref name=klotter305&gt;Klotter, p. 305&lt;/ref&gt; Frederick A. Wallis received 38,410 votes and Elam Huddleston received 15,501.&lt;ref name=pearce38 /&gt; The votes for Wallis and Huddleston meant that neither Rhea nor Chandler had achieved a majority, triggering the runoff primary.&lt;ref name=klotter305 /&gt; Both Wallis and Huddleston backed Chandler in the runoff, and Chandler defeated Rhea by a vote of 260,573 to 234,124 to secure the nomination.&lt;ref name=pearce38 /&gt;

[[File:King Swope.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=A man in his late twenties with dark, short, slicked-back hair wearing a black coat and tie and white shirt|King Swope lost his gubernatorial bid to Chandler in 1935.]]
Chandler promised to repeal the unpopular sales tax, lower the [[gasoline tax]], oppose any increase in property taxes, and end the common practice of assessing state employees a percentage of their salaries to be used for campaign activities.&lt;ref name=pearce41&gt;Pearce, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; Infuriated by their loss, Laffoon and his allies abandoned the party and supported Republican nominee [[King Swope]].&lt;ref name=harrison368 /&gt; Policy-wise, there were few differences between the two, and personal attacks were employed by both sides.&lt;ref name=harrison368 /&gt; Swope's reputation as a stern judge contrasted sharply with Chandler's charisma, and Chandler used this to his advantage by dubbing Swope &quot;his majesty&quot;.&lt;ref name=shannon181&gt;Shannon, p. 181&lt;/ref&gt; When Chandler touted his service during World War I, Laffoon's [[adjutant general]] [[Henry Denhardt]] countered by pointing out that Chandler had only been a cadet in training and never engaged in active service in the war.&lt;ref name=pearce42&gt;Pearce, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, the campaign turned on the failed presidential administration of Republican Herbert Hoover versus that of the sitting president, Democrat Franklin D. Roosevelt.&lt;ref name=harrison368 /&gt; Chandler defeated Swope by a vote of 556,262 to 461,104 in the general election.&lt;ref name=kye179 /&gt; The 95,000-vote margin of victory was, at the time, the largest ever recorded in a Kentucky gubernatorial election, and at age 37, Chandler was the youngest governor of any U.S. state.&lt;ref name=flaherty122 /&gt;&lt;ref name=shannon181 /&gt;

One of Chandler's first acts as governor was to secure the repeal of the sales tax passed under Laffoon.&lt;ref name=roland170 /&gt;  He also successfully lobbied the legislature to abolish the two-round primary in favor of a single primary for future elections.&lt;ref name=harrison368 /&gt; Knowing that he would need to raise revenue to offset the repeal of the sales tax and bring the state's expenditures in line with its income, Chandler appointed a commission headed by former Governor Beckham to draft suggested budgetary legislation.&lt;ref name=shannon182&gt;Shannon, p. 182&lt;/ref&gt; Knowing that [[lobbyist]]s hostile to the suggestions would likely try to encourage legislative gridlock until the constitutionally-mandated end of the sixty day session, Chandler asked his allies in the General Assembly to adjourn after thirty-nine days and allow him to call a special legislative session that would not be time-limited and could only entertain the agenda he specified.&lt;ref name=shannon182 /&gt; Legislators obliged this request.&lt;ref name=shannon182 /&gt;

Acting on recommendations from Beckham's commission, legislators helped offset the lost revenue from the sales tax by raising [[excise tax]]es; of particular import was the tax on [[whiskey]], which was made possible by the repeal of [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] in 1935.&lt;ref name=roland170 /&gt; Legislators also enacted the state's first [[income tax]] during the session.&lt;ref name=shannon182 /&gt; Chandler further proposed to achieve savings through the Governmental Reorganization Act of 1936.&lt;ref name=shannon182 /&gt; The bill realized significant cost savings by restructuring the state government, reducing the number of boards and commissions in the executive branch from 133 to 22.&lt;ref name=kye179 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ukaa&gt;&quot;Albert Benjamin Chandler&quot;. ''Hall of Distinguished Alumni''&lt;/ref&gt; Critics pointed out that the act also centralized more power in the hands of the governor and accused Chandler of ulterior motives in supporting it.&lt;ref name=klotter309&gt;Klotter, p. 309&lt;/ref&gt;

Chandler used the savings realized from his reorganization of government to eliminate the state's budget deficit and pay off most of the state's debt.&lt;ref name=kye179 /&gt;&lt;ref name=nga /&gt; This brought about further savings by eliminating debt service costs; these were applied to improvements in the state's infrastructure and educational institutions.&lt;ref name=roland171&gt;Roland, p. 171&lt;/ref&gt; Chandler allocated funds for free textbooks for the state's school children, created a teacher's pension fund, and provided extensive funding for the state's colleges and universities.&lt;ref name=roland171 /&gt; Because segregation prevented [[African-American|blacks]] from attending graduate school in the state, Chandler secured an allocation of $5,000 annually to help blacks attend out-of-state graduate schools.&lt;ref name=harrison369 /&gt; He stopped short of desegregating the state's universities, however, telling a group of black and white educators that &quot;it is not wise to educate the white and colored in the same school in the South. It is not prepared for it yet.&quot;&lt;ref name=paradox&gt;Miller, &quot;Chandler Civil Rights Record Shows 'Paradox'&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1936, Chandler urged implementation of the state's first rural roads program and development of electrical infrastructure with assistance from the federal [[Rural Electrification Act]].&lt;ref name=roland171 /&gt; He implemented an old-age assistance program authorized by an earlier constitutional amendment and in 1938, proposed another amendment that would add dependent children and needy blind people to the state's assistance rolls.&lt;ref name=roland171 /&gt; He increased funding to the state's hospitals and asylums, and personally aided with the evacuation of the Frankfort Penitentiary during the [[Ohio River flood of 1937]].&lt;ref name=roland172&gt;Roland, p. 172&lt;/ref&gt; Following the flood, Chandler convinced the legislature to construct a new [[Kentucky State Reformatory|reformatory]] at [[La Grange, Kentucky|La Grange]].&lt;ref name=harrison369&gt;Harrison and Klotter, p. 369&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally a friend of [[trade union|organized labor]], Chandler supported miners' efforts to unionize, organized the state Department of Industrial Relations, and prohibited mine operators from being appointed as deputy sheriffs.&lt;ref name=roland172 /&gt; He also endorsed the proposed [[Child Labor Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution|federal constitution]] and secured passage of a state anti-child-labor law that had previously been defeated twice in the state legislature by overwhelming margins.&lt;ref name=roland172 /&gt;&lt;ref name=shannon183&gt;Shannon, p. 183&lt;/ref&gt; However, he opposed [[closed shop]]s and [[sitdown strike]]s, and utilized the [[Kentucky National Guard]] to quell labor-related violence in [[Harlan County, Kentucky|Harlan County]].&lt;ref name=kye179 /&gt;

In the 1936 senatorial contest in Kentucky, incumbent Democrat [[Marvel Mills Logan]] was seen as vulnerable, and Chandler backed Democratic challenger J. C. W. Beckham in the Democratic primary.&lt;ref name=klotter310&gt;Klotter, p. 310&lt;/ref&gt; This endorsement drew the ire of Chandler's former ally, Democratic Congressman John Y. Brown, Sr., who believed that, in exchange for his support of Chandler in the 1935 gubernatorial race, Chandler would support him in the U.S. Senate contest.&lt;ref name=klotter310 /&gt; An embittered Brown entered the race anyway, and the votes he pulled from Beckham likely allowed Logan to retain the seat.&lt;ref name=klotter310 /&gt; Brown remained Chandler's political enemy for the rest of his political career.&lt;ref name=klotter310 /&gt;

In 1936, Chandler was awarded an [[honorary degree|honorary]] [[Doctor of Laws]] degree from the University of Kentucky; the following year, [[Harvard University]] awarded him the same degree.&lt;ref name=ukaa /&gt;

==U.S. Senator==
Both Robert Bingham and Percy Haly died in 1937; with J. C. W. Beckham aging &amp;ndash; he would die in 1940 &amp;ndash; Chandler moved to fill the leadership void in the faction.&lt;ref name=harrison369 /&gt; He soon came to believe he was destined to become President of the United States.&lt;ref name=harrison368 /&gt; In mid-1937, he began advocating for Marvel Mills Logan, Kentucky's junior senator, to be appointed to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]], creating a Senate vacancy to which Chandler, as governor, could appoint himself.&lt;ref name=hixson312&gt;Hixson, p. 312&lt;/ref&gt; The death of Justice [[George Sutherland]] in January 1938 gave President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] the opportunity to accommodate Chandler's wishes, but Roosevelt preferred younger justices &amp;ndash; Logan was 63 &amp;ndash; and Kentucky's senior Senator, [[Alben Barkley]], recommended [[Solicitor General of the United States|Solicitor General]] [[Stanley Forman Reed]] for the appointment.&lt;ref name=hixson312 /&gt; Roosevelt heeded Barkley's advice and appointed Reed instead of Logan.&lt;ref name=hixson312 /&gt;

Eager to augment his power and angered by Roosevelt's and Barkley's refusal to accept his suggestion of appointing Logan to the Supreme Court, Chandler did not attend a long-planned dinner in Barkley's honor on January 22, 1938; instead, he held an event of his own at [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]]'s exclusive Pendennis Club at which he alluded to his intentions of challenging Barkley during the upcoming Democratic senatorial primary. Barkley officially announced his re-election bid the following day. The death of another federal judge on January 26 provided a second opportunity for Roosevelt to appoint Senator Logan to a judgeship and appease Chandler, but Logan refused to consider the appointment. Following a January 31 meeting in Washington, D.C. between Roosevelt and Chandler, during which Roosevelt urged Chandler to put his senatorial ambitions on hold, Chandler was encouraged by his political mentor, [[Virginia]]'s [[Harry F. Byrd]] to challenge Barkley. Chandler heeded Byrd's advice, making an official announcement of his candidacy on February 23, 1938, in [[Newport, Kentucky]].&lt;ref&gt;Hixson, pp. 312&amp;ndash;314&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Alben W Barkley.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=A man with dark, wavy hair, wearing a black coat, patterned tie, and white shirt|Alben Barkley retained his U.S. Senate seat in 1938 despite a challenge from Chandler.]]
Barkley, recently chosen as [[Party leaders of the United States Senate|Senate Majority Leader]] by a single vote, was a strong supporter of President Roosevelt and the [[New Deal]]. Chandler identified with the more conservative southern Democrats who, wary of Roosevelt and his New Deal, sought to gain control of the party ahead of the [[United States presidential election, 1940|1940 presidential election]]. Because Roosevelt was very popular in Kentucky, Chandler was put in the awkward position of expressing personal support of the president while opposing his hand-picked leader in the Senate and his New Deal legislation. In April, polls showed Barkley ahead of Chandler by a 2-to-1 margin, and the May 3 primary victory of New Deal Florida Senator [[Claude Pepper]] finally persuaded Chandler to abandon his attacks of the program.&lt;ref&gt;Hixson, pp. 310, 314&amp;ndash;316&lt;/ref&gt;

In late May 1938, Chandler's campaign manager publicly claimed that federal relief agencies &amp;ndash; especially the [[Works Progress Administration]] &amp;ndash; were openly working for Barkley's re-election.&lt;ref name=hixson316&gt;Hixson, p. 316&lt;/ref&gt; Although the WPA administrator in Kentucky denied the charges, veteran reporter [[Thomas Lunsford Stokes]] launched an investigation of the agency's activities in the state and eventually raised twenty-two charges of political corruption in a series of eight articles covering the Barkley-Chandler campaign.&lt;ref name=hixson317&gt;Hixson, p. 317&lt;/ref&gt; Federal WPA administrator [[Harry Hopkins]] claimed an internal investigation of the agency refuted all but two of Stokes' charges, but Stokes was awarded the [[Pulitzer Prize for Reporting]] in 1939 for his investigation.&lt;ref name=hixson317 /&gt; In the wake of the investigation. Congress passed the [[Hatch Act of 1939]] to limit the WPA's involvement in future elections.&lt;ref name=harrison369 /&gt;

The negative effects of the investigation on Barkley's campaign were minimal because of Chandler's own use of his gubernatorial power and patronage on behalf of his own campaign. Dan Talbott, one of Chandler's chief political advisors, encouraged supervisors of state workers to take punitive action against employees who made &quot;pessimistic expressions&quot; concerning Chandler's chances in the primary. Furthermore, Chandler initiated a rural road building project in the state, employing loyal supporters to construct and maintain the new roads. State workers who supported Chandler were employed to deliver pension checks to the state's elderly citizens, and Talbott did not deny charges that these workers threatened to withhold the checks if the recipients did not pledge their support to Chandler.&lt;ref&gt;Hixson, pp. 318&amp;ndash;319&lt;/ref&gt;

President Roosevelt personally visited Kentucky to campaign on Barkley's behalf on July 8, 1938. As governor of the state, Chandler was on hand to greet Roosevelt on his arrival in [[Covington, Kentucky|Covington]]. Seeking to benefit from being nearest to the president, Chandler sat between Roosevelt and Barkley in the back seat of the open-topped vehicle that transported them to [[Latonia Race Track]], the site of Roosevelt's first speech. Throughout his tour of the state, Roosevelt endorsed Barkley while remaining friendly with Chandler; after Roosevelt's departure, Chandler played up Roosevelt's complimentary remarks about him while downplaying or ignoring critical remarks.&lt;ref&gt;Hixson, pp. 321&amp;ndash;323&lt;/ref&gt;

Late in the campaign, Chandler fell ill with chills, stomach pains, and a high fever.&lt;ref name=hixson324&gt;Hixson, p. 324&lt;/ref&gt; After first claiming the symptoms were similar to those he experienced a year earlier, Chandler later described his malady as &quot;intestinal poisoning&quot;.&lt;ref name=hixson324 /&gt; His doctor announced that Chandler, Dan Talbott, and a state police officer had all been sickened after drinking &quot;poisoned water&quot; provided to Chandler for a radio address.&lt;ref name=hixson324 /&gt; Chandler maintained that someone from the Barkley campaign had tried to poison him, but the charge never gained much credence with the press or the electorate.&lt;ref name=harrison370&gt;Harrison and Klotter, p. 370&lt;/ref&gt; Barkley frequently mocked it on the campaign trail by first accepting a glass of water offered to him, then shuddering and rejecting it.&lt;ref name=harrison370 /&gt; He pointed out to audiences that it was the young Chandler, and not he, who had broken down first under the strain of the grueling campaign.&lt;ref name=hixson325&gt;Hixson, p. 325&lt;/ref&gt;

With Chandler ally Robert Bingham no longer at its helm, ''The Courier-Journal'' supported Barkley, and organized labor, a key Chandler supporter in 1935, also threw their support to Barkley.&lt;ref name=harrison369 /&gt; Former Chandler ally John Y. Brown, Sr. also took an active part in the Barkley campaign.&lt;ref name=hixson328&gt;Hixson, p. 328&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, Barkley defeated Chandler by a vote of 294,391 (56%) to 223,149 (42.6%).&lt;ref name=harrison370 /&gt; The remaining 1.4% of the vote was dividing among minor candidates.&lt;ref name=hixson326&gt;Hixson, p. 326&lt;/ref&gt; Chandler's 70,872-vote loss was the worst loss for a primary candidate in state history.&lt;ref name=hixson326 /&gt;

[[File:M.-M.-Logan-(side).jpg|thumb|right|upright|alt=A portly man with wavy, black hair and a prominent nose, wearing a black jacket and tie and white shirt|M. M. Logan's death in 1939 created a vacancy in the Senate to which Chandler was appointed.]]
On October 9, 1939, following the death of Senator Logan, Chandler resigned as governor, elevating Lieutenant Governor [[Keen Johnson]] to the governorship; the following day, Johnson appointed Chandler to Logan's vacated seat in the Senate.&lt;ref name=congbio /&gt;&lt;ref name=kye179 /&gt; In a subsequent special election to fill the remainder of the unexpired term, Chandler first defeated [[Charles R. Farnsley]] in the Democratic primary, then bested Republican Walter B. Smith by a vote of 561,151 to 401,812 in the November 5, 1940, general election.&lt;ref name=pearce46&gt;Pearce, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; Although he never forgave President Roosevelt for backing Barkley in the 1938 senatorial primary, he generally supported his administration, although he opposed parts of the New Deal.&lt;ref name=roland173&gt;Roland, p. 173&lt;/ref&gt;

Chandler's mentor Harry F. Byrd led a group of [[Southern United States|Southern]] [[Conservatism in the United States|conservatives]] in the Senate, and through Byrd's influence, Chandler was appointed to the [[United States Senate Committee on Armed Services|Committee on Military Affairs]].&lt;ref name=roland173 /&gt; In 1943, he was part of a five-person delegation from the Military Affairs Committee that traveled the world, inspecting U.S. military bases.&lt;ref name=ukaa /&gt;&lt;ref name=roland173 /&gt; He vociferously disagreed with Roosevelt's decision to prioritize [[European Theatre of World War II|European operations]] in World War II over [[Pacific Theater of Operations|the war in the Pacific]].&lt;ref name=kye179 /&gt;

Chandler upset many in the black community by voting against an anti-[[lynching]] bill soon after taking office. The bill levied fines against local governments and individual government officials in counties where illegal lynchings occurred. Of his vote against the bill, Chandler remarked, &quot;I am against lynching by anybody and of anybody, black or white, but the present bill carries penalties on local officials and local subdivisions which I think are too severe.&quot; The bill passed in the House of Representatives, but died in the Senate. Later, Chandler joined with senators from other southern states in opposing the repeal of [[poll tax]]es, long used as a mechanism to prevent blacks from voting.&lt;ref name=paradox /&gt;

At the expiration of his partial term in 1942, Chandler faced a challenge from former ally John Y. Brown, Sr. in the Democratic primary.&lt;ref name=harrison373&gt;Harrison and Klotter, p. 373&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of his votes on the anti-lynching bill and the poll tax repeal, the Louisville chapter of the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] worked against his re-election effort.&lt;ref name=paradox /&gt; During the campaign, Brown accused Chandler of abusing his power, including having a swimming pool installed at his home in violation of the federal rationing provisions implemented during World War II.&lt;ref name=harrison373 /&gt; Chandler invited the [[Truman Committee]] to investigate the installation of the pool; the committee found no violations of the federal rationing provisions.&lt;ref name=flaherty127&gt;Flaherty, p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; Chandler went on to defeat Brown and was easily re-elected in the general election over Republican Richard J. Colbert.&lt;ref name=pearce46 /&gt;

Chandler believed that he had enough support at the [[1944 Democratic National Convention]] to be nominated as President Roosevelt's running mate for the [[United States presidential election, 1944|upcoming presidential election]]. That support failed to materialize, however, after the Kentucky delegation and Earle C. Clements in particular, refused to back his nomination. The convention nominated [[Harry S. Truman]] as Roosevelt's running mate. Truman became president upon Roosevelt's death in 1945, and Chandler never forgave Clements for costing him the chance to be president.&lt;ref name=pearce46 /&gt;

==Commissioner of baseball==
[[File:Landis portrait-restored.png|thumb|right|upright|alt=A white-haired man in his fifties, wearing a black jacket and tie and white shirt|Kenesaw Mountain Landis, Chandler's predecessor as Baseball Commissioner]]
Following the death of Baseball Commissioner [[Kenesaw Mountain Landis]] in November 1944, John O. Gottlieb, a friend of Chandler's in the [[United States Department of War|War Department]], suggested Chandler as a successor.&lt;ref name=mlb /&gt; Baseball owners who had been afraid that their players would be made eligible for the [[Conscription in the United States|draft]] during the war had decided that their new commissioner needed to have the skills and influence to represent baseball's interests in Washington, D. C.&lt;ref name=hill31&gt;Hill, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; As a senator, Chandler had advocated on behalf of baseball during the war, endearing him to the owners.&lt;ref name=hill31 /&gt; Furthermore, the commissioner's $50,000 annual salary—about five times that of a US senator at the time—proved a significant enticement, and Chandler agreed to be considered for the job.&lt;ref name=deford57 /&gt;

Other candidates being considered for the position included [[National League]] president [[Ford Frick]], [[Democratic National Committee]] chairman [[Robert E. Hannegan]], former [[United States Postmaster General|Postmaster General]] [[James Farley]], US Senator [[John W. Bricker]], [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] director [[J. Edgar Hoover]], former federal judge [[Fred M. Vinson]], [[Governor of Ohio|Ohio Governor]] [[Frank Lausche]], and Undersecretary of War [[Robert P. Patterson]].&lt;ref&gt;Hill, pp. 31&amp;ndash;32&lt;/ref&gt; After [[Cincinnati Reds]] owner [[Warren Giles]] and [[Chicago Cubs]] owner [[Philip K. Wrigley]] raised strong opposition to Frick, formerly the front runner, [[New York Yankees]] co-owner [[Larry MacPhail]] began to advocate for Chandler.&lt;ref name=hill31 /&gt; When the owners met in [[Cleveland]], Ohio on April 24, 1945 to vote for a new commissioner, Chandler's name was not on the short list; the candidates were Frick, Farley, Hannegan, Vinson, Lausche, and Patterson.&lt;ref name=hill32&gt;Hill, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; None of the candidates received the required [[two-thirds majority]], and after lobbying by MacPhail and [[San Francisco Giants|New York Giants]] owner [[Horace Stoneham]], the owners took an informal vote to see if anyone had the potential to be elected.&lt;ref name=hill32 /&gt; Chandler's name appeared in the top three on each of the sixteen ballots.&lt;ref name=hill32 /&gt; Encouraged, the owners then held another formal vote.&lt;ref name=hill32 /&gt; After two ballots, Chandler received the necessary majority; a third vote was taken to make the choice unanimous.&lt;ref name=hill32 /&gt;

Chandler remained in the Senate for several months after his election as commissioner because he wanted to cast his vote on the [[International Monetary Fund|Bretton Woods Monetary Agreement]] and the [[Charter of the United Nations]].&lt;ref name=overview365&gt;Marshall, &quot;A. B. Chandler as Baseball Commissioner 1945&amp;ndash;1951: An Overview&quot;, p. 365&lt;/ref&gt; He received only his Senate salary until his resignation on November 1, 1945, despite claims to the contrary by the press.&lt;ref name=overview365 /&gt; Nevertheless, his delay in assuming the commissioner's job upset many team owners, as did his late arrival to Game 3 of the [[1945 World Series]], which rendered him unavailable to rule on whether the weather was clement enough to begin the game.&lt;ref name=overview365 /&gt; Many owners believed Chandler had been attending a political meeting; the actual cause of his delay was his attendance at a Detroit Athletic Club luncheon, where he was representing Major League Baseball.&lt;ref name=overview366&gt;Marshall, &quot;A. B. Chandler as Baseball Commissioner 1945&amp;ndash;1951: An Overview&quot;, p. 366&lt;/ref&gt;

Chandler's election was also met with disdain from much of the press in the Eastern United States, where most of baseball's teams resided at that time.&lt;ref name=pivotal107&gt;Marshall, &quot;Happy Chandler and Baseball's Pivotal Era&quot;, p. 107&lt;/ref&gt; His southern drawl and willingness to sing &quot;[[My Old Kentucky Home]]&quot; with very little encouragement led some sportswriters to opine that he was too undignified for the office.&lt;ref name=pivotal107 /&gt; Others resented his folksy, political style, calling him &quot;a preening politician&quot;, &quot;the Kentucky windbag&quot;, and &quot;a hand-shaking baby-kissing practitioner of the arts&quot;.&lt;ref name=pivotal107 /&gt; Chandler further alienated the press by moving the commissioner's office to Cincinnati from Chicago in 1946.&lt;ref name=pivotal107 /&gt;

In early 1946, Jorge Pasquel and his four brothers, owners of the [[Mexican League (baseball)|Mexican baseball league]], siphoned campaign funds from the upcoming Mexican presidential election and used them to offer large salaries and signing bonuses to American baseball players.&lt;ref name=pivotal111&gt;Marshall, &quot;Happy Chandler and Baseball's Pivotal Era&quot;, p. 111&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, the offers were triple the salaries being paid in the Major Leagues.&lt;ref name=pivotal111 /&gt; Chandler deterred players from considering Mexican League offers by imposing a five-year ban from [[Major League Baseball]] to anyone who played in the Mexican League and did not return by April 1, 1946.&lt;ref name=pivotal111 /&gt; In all, eighteen players played for the Mexican league despite the ban, including [[Mickey Owen]], [[Max Lanier]], and [[Sal Maglie]].&lt;ref name=pivotal111 /&gt;&lt;ref name=moffi129&gt;Moffi, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vern Stephens]] initially agreed to play in Mexico as well, but returned before Chandler's April 1 deadline.&lt;ref name=pivotal112&gt;Marshall, &quot;Happy Chandler and Baseball's Pivotal Era&quot;, p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ted Williams]], [[Stan Musial]], and [[Phil Rizzuto]] were also offered lucrative contracts and incentives, but all eventually declined to play in Mexico.&lt;ref name=pivotal111 /&gt;

Shortly after the Mexican league incident, Robert Murphy, a former negotiator for the [[National Labor Relations Board]], attempted to organize the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] into a [[guild]] for purposes of [[collective bargaining]].&lt;ref name=pivotal112 /&gt; Murphy decried the [[reserve clause]] in player contracts that gave team owners unlimited control over the player's services, and demanded more rights for players, including the right of contract and the right of salary arbitration.&lt;ref name=pivotal112 /&gt; Chandler worked with Pirates officials to avoid a threatened strike by the players.&lt;ref name=pivotal113&gt;Marshall, &quot;Happy Chandler and Baseball's Pivotal Era&quot;, p. 113&lt;/ref&gt; Part of Chandler's intervention included organizing a team of replacement players as a contingency plan; the team would have included [[Honus Wagner]], who was 72 years old at the time.&lt;ref name=pivotal113 /&gt;

The defections to the Mexican league and the threat of a strike by the Pirates prompted owners to form an advisory committee, chaired by Larry MacPhail, to suggest needed changes that would calm the discontent among the players.&lt;ref name=overview371&gt;Marshall, &quot;A. B. Chandler as Baseball Commissioner 1945&amp;ndash;1951: An Overview&quot;, p. 371&lt;/ref&gt; On August 27, 1946, the committee presented a draft a document outlining the changes.&lt;ref name=pivotal113 /&gt; Language in the original draft admitted that baseball was operating as a monopoly and that racial bias was the sole reason for segregation in baseball.&lt;ref name=pivotal113 /&gt; Baseball's attorney's stripped this controversial language from the version eventually adopted by the owners.&lt;ref name=pivotal113 /&gt;

===Breaking baseball's color line===
[[File:Jackie Robinson Kansas City Monarchs.jpg|thumb|right|alt=An African-American man wearing a pinstriped baseball uniform, hat, and glove|Jackie Robinson broke the baseball color barrier during Chandler's tenure.]]
Days prior to Chandler's assumption of the commissionership, [[Brooklyn Dodgers]] general manager [[Branch Rickey]] had announced the signing of [[Jackie Robinson]] to a minor league contract with the [[Montreal Royals]], making him the first African-American to play for a Major League Baseball affiliate.&lt;ref name=hill35&gt;Hill, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, Rickey transferred Robinson's contract from Montreal to Brooklyn, effectively breaking [[Baseball color line|baseball's color line]].&lt;ref name=mlb /&gt; In a speech at [[Wilberforce University]] in February 1948, Rickey recounted a secret meeting allegedly held by baseball officials at the [[Renaissance Blackstone Hotel|Blackstone Hotel]] in Chicago on August 28, 1946.&lt;ref name=hill37&gt;Hill, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; At the meeting, Rickey claimed that Ford Frick disseminated a report which stated that &quot;However well-intentioned, the use of Negro players would hazard all physical properties of baseball.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;hill37&quot; /&gt; According to Rickey, the other fifteen team owners voted to endorse the report; he was the lone dissent.&lt;ref name=&quot;hill37&quot; /&gt; Rickey claimed Frick meticulously collected all copies of the report at the end of the meeting to prevent them from being disseminated.&lt;ref name=&quot;hill37&quot; /&gt; Baseball historian Bill Marshall later wrote that the document and subsequent vote to which Rickey was referring was the advisory committee's initial draft of recommended reforms.&lt;ref name=pivotal113 /&gt; Marshall further records that Rickey identified the meeting and the report shortly after his speech at Wilberforce and retracted his claim of 15-to-1 opposition to Robinson's entry into Major League Baseball.&lt;ref name=pivotal118&gt;Marshall, &quot;Happy Chandler and Baseball's Pivotal Era&quot;, p. 118&lt;/ref&gt;

Chandler, who was also allegedly at the meeting, made no public mention of it until a 1972 interview.&lt;ref name=&quot;hill37&quot; /&gt; In the interview, Chandler then corroborated the essentials of Rickey's story, although he placed the meeting at the [[Waldorf-Astoria Hotel]] in January 1947.&lt;ref name=overview376&gt;Marshall, &quot;A. B. Chandler as Baseball Commissioner 1945&amp;ndash;1951: An Overview&quot;, p. 376&lt;/ref&gt; He also recounted that later in 1947, Rickey came to his home in Kentucky to discuss the matter further.&lt;ref name=&quot;hill37&quot; /&gt; According to Chandler, Rickey professed that he would not move forward with Robinson's transfer unless he had Chandler's full support, which Chandler subsequently pledged.&lt;ref name=&quot;hill37&quot; /&gt; Aside from Chandler's anecdote, which he frequently repeated after the 1972 interview, there is no evidence that his meeting with Rickey ever took place.&lt;ref name=hill38&gt;Hill, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, future baseball commissioner [[Bowie Kuhn]] and ''[[Washington Post]]'' sportswriter [[Bob Addie]] maintained that Robinson would not have played had it not been for Chandler's intervention.&lt;ref name=hill38 /&gt;

That Chandler supported Robinson and the integration of baseball is evidenced by his actions during the 1947 season. First and foremost, as commissioner, Chandler had the power to void Robinson's contract, but he chose to approve it.&lt;ref name=&quot;hill37&quot; /&gt; Further, following extreme, race-based jeering at Robinson by the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] and their manager, [[Ben Chapman (baseball)|Ben Chapman]], Chandler threatened both the team and Chapman personally with disciplinary action for any future incidents of race-based taunting.&lt;ref name=hill40&gt;Hill, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; Later that season, he decisively supported Ford Frick's decision to indefinitely suspend any members of the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] who followed through on a threat to strike in protest of integration.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, pp. 40&amp;ndash;41&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Commissioner of Football'''

A little known fact, about Albert Benjamin &quot;Happy&quot; Chandler, was that he was a Commissioner of Football with the Contenental Football League, the ContFL operated from 1965 until 1969, then it ceased operations all together. A.B. &quot;Happy&quot; Chandler was employed, as their Football Commissioner from March 17, 1965 until January 20, 1966. After a legal dispute, A.B. &quot;Happy&quot; Chandler resigned, from the position of Football Commissioner, of the Contenental Football League. Because, he stated that, the ContFL had lied to him, about the Commissioner's powers. He was replaced by Sol Rosen, who took over the reigns, for the next two football seasons until 1968. Then was replaced respectively by Daniel &quot;Danny&quot; Hill from 1968 until 1969. Then late in 1969, James &quot;Jim&quot; Dunn was the last ContFL Football Commissioner, and the Contenental Football League ceased operations, at the end of the 1969 football season.

===Other matters of Chandler's term===
[[File:Leo Durocher.png|thumb|left|upright|alt=A man wearing a baseball cap with a &quot;B&quot; emblazoned on it and a jersey that reads &quot;Dodgers&quot;|Leo Durocher received a one-year suspension from Chandler for &quot;conduct detrimental to baseball&quot;.]]
During the 1946 postseason, rumors began to swirl that Yankees owner Larry MacPhail was lobbying Brooklyn Dodgers manager [[Leo Durocher]] to leave the Dodgers and manage the Yankees. The move angered Dodgers owner Branch Rickey, who encouraged Chandler to begin an investigation into the gambling habits of Durocher and his associate, actor [[George Raft]]. In the offseason, Chandler and Durocher had a meeting wherein Chandler counseled Durocher to abandon his gambling.&lt;ref name=moffi126 /&gt; Branch Rickey charged Chandler with maintaining a double standard, however, when the commissioner took no action after seeing MacPhail with two known gamblers at a Yankees&amp;ndash;Dodgers preseason exhibition in [[Havana, Cuba]].&lt;ref name=moffi126&gt;Moffi, p. 126&lt;/ref&gt; MacPhail then signed two Dodgers assistant coaches—[[Chuck Dressen]] and [[John Corriden]]—as aides to Yankee manager [[Bucky Harris]] while they were still employed by the Dodgers.&lt;ref name=mlb /&gt; Chandler suspended Dressen for 30 days and levied $2,000 fines against MacPhail and the Yankees.&lt;ref name=mlb /&gt;

The Yankees&amp;ndash;Dodgers feud continued in the New York newspapers throughout the offseason.&lt;ref name=moffi126 /&gt; Charges were levelled by both sides, including accusations that Durocher was a philanderer because of his alleged involvement with married actress [[Laraine Day]], which ultimately resulted in Day's divorce.&lt;ref name=moffi126 /&gt;&lt;ref name=overview379&gt;Marshall, &quot;A. B. Chandeler as Baseball Commissioner 1945&amp;ndash;1951: An Overview&quot;, p. 377&lt;/ref&gt; When Durocher subsequently married Day, a local Catholic priest declared that attending Dodgers games was a [[venal sin]].&lt;ref name=moffi127&gt;Moffi, p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; Prompted in part by this declaration, Chandler suspended Durocher from baseball for a year just days before [[Opening Day]], citing &quot;conduct detrimental to baseball&quot;.&lt;ref name=mlb /&gt;

Also in 1947, Chandler sold the rights to broadcast the [[World Series]] on the radio for $475,000; he used the money from the contract to establish a pension fund for baseball players.&lt;ref name=mlb /&gt; In 1949, Chandler negotiated a seven-year contract with [[Gillette (brand)|Gillette]] and the [[Mutual Broadcasting System]] to broadcast the Series.&lt;ref name=mlb /&gt; Proceeds from the $4,370,000 deal went directly into the pension fund.&lt;ref name=mlb /&gt; The same two companies negotiated a six-year, $6&amp;nbsp;million contract to broadcast the Series on television in 1950.&lt;ref name=mlb /&gt; Again, Chandler directed the proceeds into the pension fund.&lt;ref name=mlb /&gt;

In 1949, [[Danny Gardella]], who had left the New York Giants for the Mexican League in 1946, filed suit against Major League Baseball, claiming Chandler's ban on players who went to the Mexican League had denied him a means of pursuing his livelihood.&lt;ref name=overview381&gt;Marshall, &quot;A. B. Chandler as Baseball Commissioner 1945&amp;ndash;1951: An Overview&quot;, p. 381&lt;/ref&gt; Gardella demanded $100,000 in damages from the suspension, and claimed that the award should be tripled because baseball was subject to federal antitrust laws.&lt;ref name=overview381 /&gt; Similar suits were filed by Max Lanier and [[Fred Martin (baseball)|Fred Martin]], both of whom also played in Mexico.&lt;ref name=overview381 /&gt; On June 2, 1949, a federal court refused to reinstate the three players pending their trials, but urged that the antitrust issues be adjudicated as soon as possible.&lt;ref name=overview381 /&gt; Attempting to alleviate the legal pressure on Major League Baseball, Chandler lifted the bans on players who had gone to Mexico, reinstating them almost two years early.&lt;ref name=overview381 /&gt; Lanier and Martin dropped their suits, but Gardella pursued his.&lt;ref name=overview381 /&gt; After Gardella's lawyer publicly questioned Chandler in court about baseball's antitrust exemption for a day and a half in September 1949, baseball executives, including Chandler, agreed to settle Gardella's case for $60,000.&lt;ref name=overview382&gt;Marshall, &quot;A. B. Chandler as Baseball Commissioner 1945&amp;ndash;1951: An Overview&quot;, p. 382&lt;/ref&gt;

Chandler's contract as baseball commissioner was not due to expire until April 1952, but he asked for the owners to extend it in December 1949.&lt;ref name=hill42&gt;Hill, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; The owners voted against offering the extension at that time, but promised to consider the request again in December 1950.&lt;ref name=hill43&gt;Hill, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; The vote in 1950 was nine votes for Chandler and seven against, leaving him three votes short of the necessary three-fourths majority.&lt;ref name=hill43 /&gt; Chandler asked that the extension be considered again at the owners' meeting on March 12, 1951, but the vote was again 9&amp;ndash;7.&lt;ref name=hill43 /&gt; Upset that his contract was not extended, Chandler resigned effective July 15, 1951.&lt;ref name=mlb /&gt;

In an interview with ''[[The Sporting News]]'' in August 1951, Chandler cited his decision to void a trade between the New York Yankees and [[Chicago White Sox]] for outfielder [[Dick Wakefield]] as a major factor in his inability to secure a new contract.&lt;ref name=hill45&gt;Hill, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; The Yankees traded Wakefield to the White Sox for cash, but Wakefield refused to report to the White Sox after a salary dispute, leading to a disagreement between the teams over who was responsible for his salary.&lt;ref name=hill44&gt;Hill, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; Chandler voided the trade, making Wakefield's contract the Yankees' responsibility and angering their owner, [[Del Webb]].&lt;ref name=hill44 /&gt; It was not until the 1970s that Chandler began to cite his involvement in the integration of baseball as a reason for his contract not being renewed.&lt;ref name=hill43 /&gt; Historian John Paul Hill considers this unlikely, however, because two of Chandler's strongest allies, [[Connie Mack]] and [[Walter Briggs, Sr.]], were ardently opposed to integration while [[William DeWitt]], the second owner in the American League to integrate, voted against him.&lt;ref name=hill43 /&gt; Hill points to the Dick Wakefield dispute, as well as Chandler's investigations of Del Webb and Cardinals owner [[Fred Saigh]] involving their rumored connections to gambling interests, as more compelling reasons for Chandler's dismissal.&lt;ref name=hill44 /&gt;

Following his tenure as baseball commissioner, Chandler returned to his law practice.&lt;ref name=congbio /&gt; He also engaged in farming and published ''The Woodford Sun'' newspaper.&lt;ref name=congbio /&gt;&lt;ref name=ukaa /&gt; The Kentucky Press Association and the Kentucky Broadcasting Association both named him Man of the Year.&lt;ref name=ukaa /&gt; He continued his involvement in sports, presiding over the [[International Baseball Federation|International Baseball Conference]] from 1952 to 1955.&lt;ref name=ukaa /&gt;

==Second term as governor==
Chandler remained involved in politics throughout his tenure as baseball commissioner. In 1948, he became the leader of the [[Dixiecrat]] movement in Kentucky.&lt;ref name=harrison387&gt;Harrison and Klotter, p. 387&lt;/ref&gt; He hosted Dixiecrat presidential candidate [[Strom Thurmond]] at his home when he visited the state, but did not officially endorse Thurmond's campaign.&lt;ref name=paradox /&gt;&lt;ref name=harrison387 /&gt; By the time he had permanently returned to the state in mid-1951, it was too late to influence the gubernatorial contest.&lt;ref name=harrison403&gt;Harrison and Klotter, p. 403&lt;/ref&gt; He spent the next four years rebuilding his political base in preparation for another run at the office.&lt;ref name=harrison403 /&gt;

===1955 gubernatorial campaign===
Twenty years after first holding the governorship, Chandler again entered the gubernatorial race in 1955 using the slogan &quot;Be like your Pappy and vote for Happy&quot;.&lt;ref name=roland174&gt;Roland, p. 174&lt;/ref&gt; His opponents in the Democratic Party, led by senator and former governor [[Earle C. Clements]] and sitting governor [[Lawrence Wetherby]], had difficulty finding a candidate to oppose him.&lt;ref name=harrison403 /&gt; The most likely choice, Lieutenant Governor [[Emerson Beauchamp|Emerson &quot;Doc&quot; Beauchamp]], was handicapped by his connections to political bosses in [[Logan County, Kentucky|Logan County]].&lt;ref name=harrison403 /&gt; Clements virtually hand-picked a relatively unknown candidate in Kentucky Court of Appeals Judge [[Bert T. Combs]].&lt;ref name=harrison403 /&gt; Because Combs &amp;ndash; whom Chandler nicknamed &quot;The Little Judge&quot; &amp;ndash; had no record for Chandler to campaign against, Chandler portrayed him as a pawn of Clements and Wetherby &amp;ndash; who he derisively referred to as &quot;Clementine&quot; and &quot;Wetherbine&quot;.&lt;ref name=harrison403 /&gt;

The inexperienced Combs did little to help his campaign. His first campaign speech, which he dryly read verbatim from his notes, included the candid admission that it might be necessary to re-institute the state sales tax to balance the budget.&lt;ref name=harrison403 /&gt; Following the speech, a disappointed observer remarked that &quot;Combs opened and closed [his campaign] on the same night.&quot;&lt;ref name=harrison403 /&gt; The speech also gave Chandler his main issue for the campaign. He charged that Combs would raise taxes while promising that he would lower them as he had in his first term.&lt;ref name=pearce65&gt;Pearce, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;

Chandler's strategy in the campaign was to launch an attack upon the Wetherby administration and, before the Clements-Wetherby-Combs faction could react to it, to launch a new one.&lt;ref name=harrison403 /&gt; He claimed Wetherby had used the state's money frivolously by installing air conditioning in the [[Kentucky State Capitol|state capitol]] and installing a $20,000 rug in his office.&lt;ref name=harrison403 /&gt; (An invoice showing that carpeting for the entire first floor of the capitol had cost one-tenth that amount did not stop Chandler from repeating the claim, which he said &quot;didn't hurt anybody, and people liked to hear it&quot;.)&lt;ref name=pearce61&gt;Pearce, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; After a Wetherby administration official approved the purchase of African [[mahogany]] paneling for the governor's office, Chandler charged that Wetherby had gone &quot;clear to Africa&quot; to find paneling for his office and promised that, if elected, he would use good, honest Kentucky wood for decoration.&lt;ref name=pearce61 /&gt; He also denounced the construction of a turnpike connecting [[Elizabethtown, Kentucky|Elizabethtown]] and [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]], the state fairgrounds, and [[Freedom Hall]] as unnecessary.&lt;ref name=harrison403 /&gt;

Chandler won the Democratic primary by 18,000 votes over Combs.&lt;ref name=harrison403 /&gt; In the general election, he defeated Republican [[Edwin R. Denney]] by a vote of 451,647 to 322,671, the largest margin of victory for a gubernatorial candidate to that point in the state's history.&lt;ref name=roland174 /&gt;

===Governorship===
Soon after Chandler took office, it became clear that he could not fund the social programs initiated by Clements and Wetherby, plus Chandler's own proposed programs, with the revenue presently being brought into the state treasury.&lt;ref name=pearce67&gt;Pearce, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; He cut the popular Youth Authority, initiated by Wetherby to unify the state's children's welfare programs, but the savings were not enough to balance the budget.&lt;ref name=pearce66 /&gt; In order to deliver on his campaign promises, Chandler ignored the budget during the regular legislative session in 1956, then called a special session during which he presented his budget proposal.&lt;ref name=pearce68&gt;Pearce, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; The proposal called for spending in excess of $46&amp;nbsp;million more than officials estimated would be brought into the state's coffers over the two-year budget.&lt;ref name=pearce68 /&gt; Chandler convinced legislators to pass the budget, promising to propose a tax plan to pay for the expenditures in a subsequent special session.&lt;ref name=pearce68 /&gt; The promised package added 150,000 citizens to the state's tax rolls, put a surtax on income taxes, and cut [[tax credits]]. It created a new 5 percent [[production tax]] on whisky, and added taxes to deeds and life insurance premiums.&lt;ref name=pearce68 /&gt; It increased the state [[gasoline tax]] for trucks by two cents per gallon and raised [[corporate tax]]es by half a percent.&lt;ref name=pearce68 /&gt; In addition, it transferred the assessment and collection of taxes on certain intangibles from local to state government.&lt;ref name=pearce68 /&gt; The plan also called for a $100&amp;nbsp;million bond issue, allowing the allocation of generous budgets for state universities and colleges and improvements to the state highway system.&lt;ref name=kye179 /&gt;

Although Democrats held a majority in both houses of the General Assembly, they were divided by factionalism, which made it difficult for Chandler to find sufficient support for his programs.&lt;ref name=harrison405&gt;Harrison and Klotter, p. 405&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the factionalism came from Clements and Combs supporters who were not willing to cooperate with Chandler, their chief political enemy.&lt;ref name=pearce70&gt;Pearce, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; Still other resistance to Chandler came from a group of more liberal lawmakers like [[John B. Breckinridge]] who simply had philosophical differences with the governor.&lt;ref name=pearce70 /&gt; Near the end of the 1958 legislative session, this group demanded a special session to deal with the need for more money for schools and welfare programs, but Chandler refused to call the session when the liberals would not agree to pass only the measures he put before them.&lt;ref name=pearce70 /&gt; Because of the factionalism, Chandler had to ally with Republican legislators throughout his term in order to pass many of his proposals, including his tax plan.&lt;ref name=harrison405 /&gt; Frequently, this meant promising to build or repair roads in Republican districts in return for their support of his programs.&lt;ref name=pearce70 /&gt;

[[File:Albert B. Chandler Hospital.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A red, four-story building with two eight-story towers rising above it|The Albert B. Chandler Hospital, part of the Chandler Medical Center, is named in Chandler's honour.]]
During his campaign, Chandler had promised that he would fund a medical school at the University of Kentucky, despite the fact that the [[University of Louisville]] already had a medical school and a poll of state physicians showed overwhelming opposition to the plan because of this.&lt;ref name=pearce66&gt;Pearce, p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Chandler delivered on his promise, allocating $5&amp;nbsp;million to the establishment of what became known as the [[Chandler Medical Center|Albert B. Chandler Medical Center]].&lt;ref name=kye179 /&gt;&lt;ref name=nga /&gt; Chandler said the establishment of the school was his proudest achievement as governor.&lt;ref name=kye179 /&gt;

Just as he had as baseball commissioner, Chandler faced the issue of racial integration during his second term as governor. Among his first actions upon his election was to issue an executive order ensuring that blacks and whites would have equal access to the [[List of Kentucky state parks|state park system]].&lt;ref name=paradox /&gt; He publicly acknowledged the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]]'s 1954 decision in ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' as the law of the land and promised to enforce it.&lt;ref name=harrison388 /&gt; The Kentucky Court of Appeals struck down Kentucky's Day Law &amp;ndash; the law proscribing segregation &amp;ndash; the following year.&lt;ref name=harrison388&gt;Harrison and Klotter, p. 388&lt;/ref&gt; Some areas of the state resisted the change. Notably, in 1956, when nine black students in [[Sturgis, Kentucky]] attempted to enter previously all-white Sturgis High School, they were blocked by 500 opponents of integration.&lt;ref name=paradox /&gt; On September 4, 1956, Chandler called out the National Guard &amp;ndash; including a force of over 900 guardsmen and several [[M47 Patton]] tanks &amp;ndash; to disperse the crowd.&lt;ref name=paradox /&gt;&lt;ref name=harrison388 /&gt; The confrontation lasted a total of 18 days before the protesters peacefully dispersed.&lt;ref name=paradox /&gt; Shortly thereafter, Chandler took similar actions in response to a protest in the town of [[Clay, Kentucky|Clay]], which was also resolved without violence.&lt;ref name=paradox /&gt; Of his actions, Chandler remarked &quot;We regret it is necessary to use this means of guaranteeing equal rights to our citizens, but that we must do.&quot;&lt;ref name=paradox /&gt;

Still convinced he was destined to become president, Chandler attended the [[1956 Democratic National Convention]] with hopes of securing the party's presidential nomination.&lt;ref name=harrison404&gt;Harrison and Klotter, p. 404&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being told by his advisors that the convention would nominate [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]], Chandler continued to seek the nomination, but received only 36 1/2 votes.&lt;ref name=mead /&gt; Following Stevenson's nomination, Chandler returned to Kentucky bitterly disappointed.&lt;ref name=harrison403 /&gt; Due to the death of Senator Alben Barkley and the expiration of Senator Clements' term, Kentucky would also elect two senators in November 1956.&lt;ref name=harrison403 /&gt; Clements was seeking re-election, and the state Democratic committee chose Wetherby as the nominee for Barkley's seat.&lt;ref name=harrison403 /&gt; Chandler refused to use his office to support Stevenson, Clements, or Wetherby, and Republicans [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], [[John Sherman Cooper]], and [[Thruston Ballard Morton]] won the presidential and senatorial races in the state.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison and Klotter, pp. 403&amp;ndash;404&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1959 gubernatorial primary, Chandler threw his support to Lieutenant Governor [[Harry Lee Waterfield]].&lt;ref name=harrison406&gt;Harrison and Klotter, p. 406&lt;/ref&gt; The anti-Chandler forces eventually put forth Bert Combs as their nominee again.&lt;ref name=harrison407&gt;Harrison and Klotter, p. 407&lt;/ref&gt; Having learned from his previous campaign, Combs now attacked Chandler for allegedly requiring state employees to donate 2% of their salaries to his campaign.&lt;ref name=harrison407 /&gt; According to Combs, Chandler had deposited the money in a [[Cuba]]n bank, but the money was lost when [[Fidel Castro]] overthrew the government in the [[Cuban Revolution]].&lt;ref name=harrison407 /&gt; Ultimately, Combs prevailed in the primary by a vote of 292,462 to 259,461.&lt;ref name=harrison407 /&gt; Republicans nominated [[John M. Robsion, Jr.]] to oppose Combs, and when Democratic President [[Harry S. Truman]] came to [[Paducah, Kentucky|Paducah]] to campaign for Combs, Chandler refused to welcome him to the state, a customary duty of the sitting governor.&lt;ref name=pearce96&gt;Pearce, p. 96&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, in a letter to Truman, Chandler launched a blistering attack on his party's nominees, calling Combs a liar and alleging that his running mate, [[Wilson W. Wyatt]], who had previously served in Truman's administration, had actually tried to undermine Truman by helping found [[Americans for Democratic Action]].&lt;ref name=pearce96 /&gt; Combs ultimately won the general election by a wide margin.&lt;ref name=pearce97&gt;Pearce, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life and death==
In 1957, Chandler was one of ten inaugural members of the Kentucky Sports Hall of Fame.&lt;ref name=ukaa /&gt; A [[vestryman]] at St. John's Church in Versailles, he was awarded the Bishop's Medal of the Episcopal Church in 1959.&lt;ref name=ukaa /&gt; That same year, he received the Cross of Military Service from the [[United Daughters of the Confederacy]].&lt;ref name=ukaa /&gt; He served as a trustee of the Ty Cobb Foundation and Transylvania University.&lt;ref name=congbio /&gt; At the [[1960 Democratic National Convention]], he again sought the party's presidential nomination, opining that the front-runner, [[John F. Kennedy]], was &quot;a nice young fellow ... (but) too young for the nomination.&quot;&lt;ref name=mead /&gt; Chandler proposed that he be the presidential nominee with Kennedy as the nominee for vice-president, but the convention chose Kennedy for president instead.&lt;ref name=mead /&gt;

On January 3, 1962, Chandler opened a campaign headquarters in Frankfort, announcing his bid for an unprecedented third term as governor with the slogan &quot;ABC [Albert Benjamin Chandler] in '63&quot;.&lt;ref name=pearce183&gt;Pearce, p. 183&lt;/ref&gt; His opponent in the primary was [[Edward T. Breathitt, Jr.|Edward T. &quot;Ned&quot; Breathitt, Jr.]], the choice of outgoing Governor Bert Combs.&lt;ref name=harrison411 /&gt; Chandler reverted to his familiar campaign themes, charging the Combs administration with wasting state funds in the construction of a [[Floral clock (Frankfort, Kentucky)|floral clock]] at the state capitol and denouncing Combs for re-instituting the state sales tax.&lt;ref name=harrison411&gt;Harrison and Klotter, p. 411&lt;/ref&gt; However, he found it very difficult to adapt to campaigning via television, an increasingly important medium, and his attacks mostly fell flat.&lt;ref name=harrison411 /&gt;

Breathitt enraged Chandler by charging that, when Chandler was a senator, he had voted in favor of declaring World War II, but soon after resigned his commission as a reserve army captain.&lt;ref name=pearce213&gt;Pearce, p. 213&lt;/ref&gt; According to Chandler's version of events, after he voted in favor of the war declaration, he called [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of War]] [[Henry Stimson]] and asked to be put on active duty.&lt;ref name=pearce213 /&gt; Chandler said Stimson told him he would rather have a senator than a captain, after which Chandler resigned his commission.&lt;ref name=pearce213 /&gt; Chandler's explanation did not stop Breathitt from repeating the charge often on the campaign trail.&lt;ref name=pearce213 /&gt;

Chandler lost to Breathitt in the primary by more than 60,000 votes, although his running mate, Harry Lee Waterfield, won the nomination for lieutenant governor.&lt;ref name=pearce215&gt;Pearce, p. 215&lt;/ref&gt; Journalist John Ed Pearce opined that the loss marked the demise of the Chandler wing of the Democratic Party in Kentucky, although Chandler himself remained somewhat influential.&lt;ref name=pearce180&gt;Pearce, p. 180&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wendell-H-Ford.jpg|thumb|right|upright|alt=A graying man in his fifties, facing left, wearing glasses and a suit and tie|Wendell Ford defeated Chandler for governor in 1971.]]
In 1965, Chandler was named to the University of Kentucky Hall of Distinguished Alumni and became commissioner of the [[Continental Football League]].&lt;ref name=ukaa /&gt; He served as Democratic National Committeeman from Kentucky.&lt;ref name=congbio /&gt; Becoming somewhat of a [[perennial candidate]], he unsuccessfully ran for governor in 1967 and 1971.&lt;ref name=nga /&gt; After his loss in the 1967 Democratic primary, he endorsed Republican [[Louie B. Nunn]].&lt;ref name=roland175&gt;Roland, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; After his election, Nunn appointed Chandler to the first of his three terms on the University of Kentucky's board of trustees.&lt;ref name=board&gt;Brammer, &quot;Governor Names Chandler to UK Board&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968, Chander was given serious consideraton as the vice-presidential running mate of [[Alabama]]'s former [[governor of Alabama|Governor]] [[George Wallace]] in the latter [[American Independent Party]] bid for the U.S. presidency. Wallace instead turned to Air Force General [[Curtis LeMay]]. the ticket lost to [[Richard M. Nixon]] and [[Spiro T. Agnew]]. Chandler said that he and Wallace were unable to come to an agreement regarding their positions on racial matters.&lt;ref name=mead /&gt;

In 1971, Chandler again entered the gubernatorial race, this time as an [[Independent (politician)|independent]], but he garnered only 39,493 votes, compared to 470,720 for eventual Democratic victor [[Wendell H. Ford]], and 412,653 for Republican challenger [[Tom Emberton]].&lt;ref name=harrison415&gt;Harrison and Klotter, p. 415&lt;/ref&gt; Ford's successor, [[Julian Carroll]], again appointed Chandler to the University of Kentucky's board of trustees.&lt;ref name=board /&gt;

The Major League Baseball [[Veterans Committee]] chose Chandler for induction into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1982.&lt;ref name=hof&gt;&quot;Chandler, Happy&quot;. Baseball Hall of Fame&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987, filmmaker [[Robby Henson]] profiled Chandler in a 30-minute documentary entitled ''Roads Home: The Life and Times of A.B. 'Happy' Chandler''.&lt;ref name=carter&gt;Carter, &quot;Documentary an Endearing Portrait of Chandler&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Chandler endorsed dark horse candidate [[Wallace G. Wilkinson]] in the 1987 Democratic primary, and his endorsement was considered crucial to Wilkinson's victory in the race.&lt;ref name=newcontroversy&gt;Lucke, &quot;Chandler Remark Sparks New Controversy; UK Students Demand Removal of Trustee&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; After Wilkinson's election as governor, he restored Chandler's voting rights on the University of Kentucky's board of trustees.&lt;ref name=kye179 /&gt; (In 1981, then-governor [[John Y. Brown, Jr.]] had designated Chandler an &quot;honorary&quot;, non-voting member of the board.)&lt;ref name=2sentences&gt;Lucke, &quot;With 2 Sentences, Chandler Sparked Protest and Debate&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; While discussing the University of Kentucky's decision to dispose of its investments in South Africa at a meeting of the university's board of trustees on April 5, 1988, Chandler remarked &quot;You know [[Zimbabwe]]'s all [[nigger]] now. There aren't any whites.&quot;&lt;ref name=2sentences /&gt;&lt;ref name=assailed&gt;Lucke and Anderson, &quot;Chandler Assailed for Racist Remark&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The comment immediately drew calls for Chandler's resignation from the University Senate Council and the [[Student Government Association]], and approximately 50 students marched on university president [[David Roselle]]'s office demanding that Chandler apologize or resign.&lt;ref name=assailed /&gt; Commenting on the controversy the next day, Chandler said  &quot;I was raised in a small town in Western Kentucky. There were 400 whites and 400 blacks, and we called them niggers and they didn't mind. And I reverted temporarily, at least, to that expression, and of course, I wish I hadn't.&quot;&lt;ref name=assailed /&gt; That apology did not satisfy many, and 200 protesters marched on the [[Kentucky State Capitol|state capitol]], demanding that Governor Wilkinson remove Chandler from the board.&lt;ref name=2sentences /&gt; Wilkinson refused to remove Chandler and urged the crowd to forgive him.&lt;ref name=2sentences /&gt;

Chandler published his autobiography, ''Heroes, Plain Folks, and Skunks'', in 1989.&lt;ref name=kye179 /&gt; In an interview with ''[[The Kentucky Kernel]]'', the University of Kentucky's student newspaper, Chandler was asked about his controversial comments the previous year, which were addressed in the book.&lt;ref name=newcontroversy /&gt; Chandler reportedly told the paper &quot;I said most of the Zimbabweans were niggers and they are niggers.&quot;&lt;ref name=newcontroversy /&gt; The comment sparked fresh protests and calls for Chandler's resignation.&lt;ref name=newcontroversy /&gt; In response to the controversy, Chandler's personal assistant said &quot;He used the word again in explaining that it was not intended by him to be a racial slur,&quot; and called the ''Kernel's'' story &quot;a complete and total distortion.&quot;&lt;ref name=newcontroversy /&gt;

Chandler died in Versailles on June 15, 1991 and was buried in the churchyard of Pisgah Presbyterian Church near Versailles.&lt;ref name=congbio /&gt; Prior to his death, he had been the oldest living member of the Baseball Hall of Fame and was the longest-living former Kentucky governor.&lt;ref name=mead /&gt;
