'''George Wilcken Romney''' (July 8, 1907{{spaced ndash}}July 26, 1995) was an [[United States|American]] [[businessman]] and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] [[politician]]. He was chairman and president of [[American Motors|American Motors Corporation]] from 1954 to 1962, the [[List of Governors of Michigan|43rd]] [[Governor of Michigan]] from 1963 to 1969, and the [[United States Secretary of Housing and Urban Development]] from 1969 to 1973.  He is the father of former [[Governor of Massachusetts]] [[Mitt Romney]] and the husband of former Michigan U.S. Senate candidate [[Lenore Romney]].

Romney was born to American parents living in the [[Mormon colonies in Mexico]]; events during the [[Mexican Revolution]] forced his family to flee back to the United States when he was a child.  The family lived in several states and ended up in [[Salt Lake City, Utah]], where they struggled during the [[Great Depression]].  Romney worked in a number of jobs, served as a [[Mormon missionary]] in [[England]] and [[Scotland]], and attended several colleges in the U.S. but did not graduate from any.  In 1939 he moved to [[Detroit]] and joined the [[Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers|American Automobile Manufacturers Association]], where he served as the chief spokesman for the automobile industry during [[World War II]] and headed a cooperative arrangement in which companies could share production improvements.  He joined [[Nash-Kelvinator Corporation|Nash-Kelvinator]] in 1948, and became the chief executive of its successor, [[American Motors Corporation]], in 1954.  There he turned around the struggling firm by focusing all efforts on the compact [[Rambler (automobile)#1958-1969|Rambler]] car.  Romney mocked the products of the &quot;[[Big Three (automobile manufacturers)#United States and Canada|Big Three]]&quot; automakers as &quot;gas-guzzling dinosaurs&quot; and became one of the first high-profile, media-savvy business executives.  Devoutly religious, Romney presided over the [[Stake (Latter Day Saints)|Detroit Stake]] of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]].

Romney entered politics by participating in a state [[Constitutional convention (political meeting)|constitutional convention]] to rewrite the [[Michigan Constitution]] during 1961–1962.  He was elected Governor of Michigan in 1962 and was re-elected by increasingly large margins in 1964 and 1966.  Romney worked to overhaul the state's financial and revenue structure, culminating in Michigan's first [[state income tax]], and greatly expanded the size of state government.  Romney was a strong supporter of the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955–1968)|American Civil Rights Movement]].  He briefly represented moderate Republicans against conservative Republican [[Barry Goldwater]] during the [[United States presidential election, 1964|1964&amp;nbsp;U.S. presidential election]].  He requested the intervention of federal troops during the [[1967 Detroit riot]].

Romney was [[George Romney presidential campaign, 1968|a candidate for the Republican nomination]] for President of the United States in 1968.  While initially a front-runner, he proved an ineffective campaigner, and fell behind [[Richard Nixon]] in polls.  Following a mid-1967 remark that his earlier support for the [[Vietnam War]] had been due to a &quot;brainwashing&quot; by U.S. military and diplomatic officials in Vietnam, his campaign faltered even more, and he withdrew from the contest in early 1968.  Once elected president, Nixon appointed Romney Secretary of Housing and Urban Development.  Romney's ambitious plans for housing production increases for the poor, and for open housing to desegregate suburbs, were modestly successful but often thwarted by Nixon.  Romney left the administration at the start of Nixon's second term in 1973.  Returning to private life, Romney advocated volunteerism and public service, and headed the [[National Center for Voluntary Action]] and its successor organizations from 1973 through 1991.  He also served as a [[regional representative of the Twelve]] within his church.

Romney's parents, [[Gaskell Romney]] (1871–1955) and Anna Amelia Pratt (1876–1926), were American citizens and natives of [[Utah]].

In 1913, the family moved to [[Oakley, Idaho]], and bought a farm, where they grew and subsisted largely on [[Idaho potato]]es.&lt;ref name=&quot;mahoney-64&quot;&gt;Mahoney, ''The Story of George Romney'', pp. 63–65.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harris, ''Romney's Way'', p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;  The farm was not on good land and failed when potato prices fell.&lt;ref name=&quot;mahoney-64&quot;/&gt; The family moved to [[Salt Lake City, Utah]], in 1916, where Gaskell Romney resumed construction work, but the family remained generally poor.&lt;ref name=&quot;mahoney-64&quot;/&gt;  In 1917, they moved to [[Rexburg, Idaho]], where Gaskell became a successful home and commercial builder in an area growing owing to high [[World War I]] commodities prices.&lt;ref name=&quot;mahoney-66&quot;&gt;Mahoney, ''The Story of George Romney'', pp. 65–67.&lt;/ref&gt;

George started working in wheat and sugar beet fields at the age of eleven and was the valedictorian at his grammar school graduation in 1921.&lt;ref name=&quot;mahoney-66&quot;/&gt;  The [[Depression of 1920–21]] brought a collapse in prices and local building was abandoned.&lt;ref name=&quot;mahoney-66&quot;/&gt; His family returned to Salt Lake City in 1921, and while his father resumed construction, George became skilled at [[lath-and-plaster]] work.&lt;ref name=&quot;mahoney-68&quot;&gt;Mahoney, ''The Story of George Romney'', pp. 68–69.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cby-367&quot;&gt;''Current Biography Yearbook 1958'', p. 367.&lt;/ref&gt;  The family was again prospering when the [[Great Depression]] hit in 1929 and ruined them.&lt;ref name=&quot;cby-366&quot;/&gt;  George watched his parents fail financially in Idaho and Utah&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt-course&quot;/&gt; and having to take a dozen years to pay off their debts.&lt;ref&gt;Mollenhoff, ''George Romney'', p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; Seeing their struggles influenced his life and business career.&lt;ref name=&quot;cby-367&quot;/&gt;

In Salt Lake City, Romney worked while attending Roosevelt Junior High School and, beginning in 1922, [[Latter-day Saints High School]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cby-367&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fuller, ''George Romney and Michigan'', p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;  There he played [[Halfback (American football)|halfback]] in football, [[Guard (basketball)|guard]] in basketball, and [[right field]] in baseball, all with more persistence than talent, but in an effort to uphold the family tradition of athleticism, he earned [[varsity letter]]s in all three sports.&lt;ref name=&quot;gwr-ssps&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mahoney-68&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harris, ''Romney's Way'', pp. 59–60.&lt;/ref&gt;  In his senior year, he and junior [[Lenore Romney|Lenore LaFount]] became high school sweethearts;&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt-course&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harris, ''Romney's Way'', p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; she was from a more well-assimilated Mormon family.&lt;ref name=&quot;bg-series-1&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last=Swidey|first=Neil | last2=Paulson|first2=Michael | url=http://www.boston.com/news/politics/2008/specials/romney/articles/part1_main/ | title=The Making of Mitt Romney: Privilege, tragedy, and a young leader | newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]] | date=June 24, 2007 | &lt;!-- accessdate=July 21, 2009 --&gt;| authorlink2=Michael Paulson}} Also available as [http://www.deseretnews.com/article/680195540/Mitt-Romney-the-beginning.html &quot;Mitt Romney: the beginning&quot;], ''[[Deseret Morning News]]'', July 1, 2007 ([http://web.archive.org/web/20070918090328/http://deseretnews.com/dn/view/0,1249,680195540,00.html also archived on September 18, 2007]).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harris, ''Romney's Way'', pp. 53–55.&lt;/ref&gt; Academically, Romney was steady but undistinguished.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, ''Romney's Way'', p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from high school in 1925; his yearbook picture caption was &quot;Serious, high minded, of noble nature—a real fellow.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;mahoney-68&quot;/&gt;

Partly to stay near Lenore,&lt;ref name=&quot;time-cover&quot;/&gt; Romney spent the next year as a junior college student at the co-located [[Latter-day Saints University]], where he was elected [[student body president]].&lt;ref name=&quot;mahoney-71&quot;&gt;Mahoney, ''The Story of George Romney'', pp. 71–72.&lt;/ref&gt;  He was also president of the [[booster club]] and played on the basketball team that won the Utah–Idaho Junior College Tournament.&lt;ref name=&quot;mahoney-71&quot;/&gt;

==Missionary work==
After becoming an [[Elder (Latter Day Saints)|elder]], Romney earned enough money working to fund himself as a [[Missionary (LDS Church)|Mormon missionary]].&lt;ref name=&quot;mahoney-76&quot;/&gt;  In October 1926, he sailed to Great Britain and was first assigned to preach in a [[Glasgow]], Scotland, slum.&lt;ref name=&quot;mahoney-76&quot;&gt;Mahoney, ''The Story of George Romney'', pp. 73–76.&lt;/ref&gt; The abject poverty and hopelessness he saw there affected him greatly,&lt;ref name=&quot;gwr-ssps&quot;/&gt; but he was ineffective in gaining converts and temporarily suffered a [[crisis of faith]].&lt;ref&gt;Harris, ''Romney's Way'', pp. 76–77.&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1927, he was shifted to [[Edinburgh]] and in February 1928 to London,&lt;ref name=&quot;mahoney-79&quot;&gt;Mahoney, ''The Story of George Romney'', pp. 77–81.&lt;/ref&gt; where he kept track of mission finances.&lt;ref name=&quot;harris-78&quot;&gt;Harris, ''Romney's Way'', pp. 78, 81.&lt;/ref&gt; He worked under renowned [[Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (LDS Church)|Quorum of the Twelve Apostles]] intellectuals [[James E. Talmage]] and [[John A. Widtsoe]]; the latter's admonitions to &quot;Live mightily today, the greatest day of all time is today&quot; made a lasting impression on him.&lt;ref name=&quot;gwr-ssps&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;harris-78&quot;/&gt;  Romney experienced British sights and culture and was introduced to members of the [[peerage]] and the [[Oxford Group]].&lt;ref name=&quot;mahoney-83&quot;&gt;Mahoney, ''The Story of George Romney'', pp. 83–87.&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1928, Romney became president of the Scottish missionary district.&lt;ref name=&quot;mahoney-83&quot;/&gt;  Operating in a [[whisky]]-centric region was difficult, and he developed a new &quot;task force&quot; approach of sending more missionaries to a single location at a time; this successfully drew local press attention and several hundred new recruits.&lt;ref name=&quot;harris-78&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mahoney-83&quot;/&gt; Romney's frequent public proselytizing&amp;nbsp;– from [[The Mound|Edinburgh's Mound]] and in London from soap boxes at [[Speakers' Corner]] in [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] and from a platform at [[Trafalgar Square]]&amp;nbsp;– developed his gifts for debate and sales, which he would use the rest of his career.&lt;ref name=&quot;cby-367&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt-course&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mahoney-79&quot;/&gt; Three decades later, Romney said that his missionary time had meant more to him in developing his career than any other experience.&lt;ref name=&quot;mahoney-76&quot;/&gt;

==Early career, marriage and children==
Romney returned to the U.S. in late 1928 and studied briefly at the [[University of Utah]] and [[LDS Business College]].&lt;ref name=&quot;mahoney-89&quot;&gt;Mahoney, ''The Story of George Romney'', pp. 89–94.&lt;/ref&gt;  He followed LaFount to [[Washington, D.C.]], in fall 1929, after her father had accepted an appointment by President [[Calvin Coolidge]] to serve on the [[Federal Radio Commission]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt-course&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bg-series-1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mahoney-89&quot;/&gt;  He worked for [[Massachusetts]] Democratic [[U.S. Senator]] [[David I. Walsh]] during 1929 and 1930, first as a stenographer using [[speedwriting]], then, when his abilities at that proved limited, as a staff aide working on tariffs and other legislative matters.&lt;ref name=&quot;time-cover&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt-gear&quot;/&gt; Romney researched aspects of the proposed [[Smoot–Hawley Tariff Act|Smoot-Hawley tariff legislation]] and sat in on committee meetings; the job was a turning point in his career and gave him lifelong confidence in dealing with Congress.&lt;ref name=&quot;mahoney-89&quot;/&gt;

With one of his brothers, Romney opened a [[Milk bar#Similar establishments|dairy bar]] in nearby [[Virginia]] during this time. The business soon failed, in the midst of the Great Depression.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt-course&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harris, ''Romney's Way'', pp. 91–92.&lt;/ref&gt;  He also attended [[George Washington University]] at night.&lt;ref name=&quot;gwr-ssps&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cby-367&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt-gear&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F40B1EF73F55107A93C2A81789D85F468685F9 | title=Politician in High Gear; George Wilcken Romney Wants a Citizen Party | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=February 10, 1962 | format=fee required}}&lt;/ref&gt; Romney did not attend for long, or graduate from, any of the colleges in which he was enrolled; instead he has been described as an [[autodidact]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt-course&quot;/&gt;  Romney became an apprentice for [[Alcoa]] in [[Pittsburgh]] in 1930.&lt;ref name=&quot;cby-367&quot;/&gt;

Romney's position as the leader of the moderate Republicans at the constitutional convention helped gain him the Republican nomination for [[Governor of Michigan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;mich-576&quot;/&gt;
He ran against incumbent Democratic Governor [[John B. Swainson]] in the general election.  Romney campaigned on revising the state's tax structure, increasing its appeal to businesses and the general public, and getting it &quot;rolling again&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt-gear&quot;/&gt;  Romney decried both the large influence of labor unions within the Democratic Party and the similarly large influence of big business within the Republican Party.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt-gear&quot;/&gt;  His campaign was among the first to exploit the capabilities of [[electronic data processing]].&lt;ref&gt;Harris, ''Romney's Way'', pp. 2–3, 227–228.&lt;/ref&gt;

Romney won by some 80,000&amp;nbsp;votes and ended a fourteen-year stretch of Democratic rule in the state executive spot.&lt;ref name=&quot;white-1968-37&quot;&gt;White, ''The Making of the President, 1968'', p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; His win was attributed to his appeal to independent voters and to those from the increasingly influential suburbs of Detroit, who by 1962 were more likely to vote Republican than the heavily Democratic residents of the city itself.  Additionally, Romney had appeal to labor union members that was unusual for a Republican.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt-obit&quot;/&gt;  Democrats won all of the other statewide executive offices in the election,&lt;ref name=&quot;mich-576&quot;/&gt; including Democratic incumbent [[T.

Romney was sworn in as governor on January 1, 1963.&lt;ref&gt;Mollenhoff, ''George Romney'', p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt;  His initial concern was the implementation of the overhaul of the state's financial and revenue structure that had been authorized by the constitutional convention.&lt;ref name=&quot;mich-577&quot;&gt;Dunbar; May, ''Michigan'', p. 577.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1963, he proposed a comprehensive tax revision package that included a flat-rate [[state income tax]], but general economic prosperity alleviated pressure on the state budget and the [[Michigan Legislature]] rejected the measure.&lt;ref name=&quot;mich-577&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt-impatient&quot;/&gt; Romney's early difficulties with the legislature helped undermine an attempted push that year of Romney as a national political figure by former [[Richard Nixon]] associates.&lt;ref&gt;White, ''The Making of the President, 1964'', p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; One Michigan Democrat said of Romney, &quot;He has not yet learned that things in government are not necessarily done the moment the man at the top gives an order. He is eager and sometimes impatient.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt-impatient&quot;/&gt;  His blunt and unequivocal manner also sometimes caused friction.&lt;ref name=&quot;wapo-obit&quot;/&gt;  But over his first two years in office, Romney was able to work with Democrats&amp;nbsp;– who often had at least partial control of the legislature&amp;nbsp;– and an informal bipartisan coalition formed which allowed Romney to accomplish many of his goals and initiatives.&lt;ref name=&quot;mich-576&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt-impatient&quot;/&gt;

Romney held a series of Governor's Conferences, which sought to find new ideas from public services professionals and community activists who attended.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, ''Romney's Way'', p. 242.&lt;/ref&gt;  He opened his office in the [[Michigan State Capitol]] to visitors, spending five minutes with every citizen who wanted to speak with him on Thursday mornings,&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt-impatient&quot;/&gt; and was always sure to shake the hands of schoolchildren visiting the capitol.&lt;ref name=&quot;wapo-obit&quot;/&gt;  He almost always eschewed political activities on Sunday, the Mormon Sabbath.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt-impatient&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F20A16F73F581B728DDDA10894DE405B848AF1D3 | title=An Impatient Politician: George Wilcken Romney | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=June 8, 1964 | format=fee required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States presidential election, 1964|1964&amp;nbsp;U.S. presidential election]], Senator [[Barry Goldwater]] quickly became the likely Republican Party nominee.  Goldwater represented a new wave of [[American conservatism]], of which the moderate Romney was not a part.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt-impatient&quot;/&gt;  Romney also felt that Goldwater would be a drag on Republicans running in the all the other races that year, including Romney's own&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt-impatient&quot;/&gt; (at the time, Michigan had two-year terms for its governor).&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt010367&quot;/&gt; Finally, Romney disagreed strongly with Goldwater's views on civil rights; he would later say, &quot;Whites and Negroes, in my opinion, have ''got'' to learn to know each other. Barry Goldwater didn't have any background to understand this, to fathom them, and I couldn't get through to him.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;white-1968-37&quot;/&gt;

During the June 1964 [[National Governors' Conference]], 13 of 16 Republican governors present were opposed to Goldwater; their leaders were [[Jim Rhodes]] of Ohio, [[Nelson Rockefeller]] of New York (whose own campaign had just stalled out with a loss to Goldwater in the California primary), [[William Scranton]] of Pennsylvania, and Romney.&lt;ref name=&quot;white-1964-154&quot;&gt;White, ''The Making of the President, 1964'', pp. 154–155, 157.&lt;/ref&gt;  In an unusual Sunday press conference,&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt-impatient&quot;/&gt; Romney declared, &quot;If [Goldwater's] views deviate as indicated from the heritage of our party, I will do everything within my power to keep him from becoming the party's presidential nominee.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;white-1964-154&quot;/&gt;  Romney had, however, previously vowed to Michigan voters that he would not run for president in 1964.&lt;ref name=&quot;white-1964-160&quot;&gt;White, ''The Making of the President, 1964'', p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt;  Detroit newspapers indicated they would not support him in any such bid, and Romney quickly decided to honor his pledge to stay out of the contest.&lt;ref name=&quot;white-1964-160&quot;/&gt;  Scranton entered instead, but Goldwater prevailed decisively at the [[1964 Republican National Convention]].

On August 31, 1967, in a taped interview with talk show host [[Lou Gordon (journalist)|Lou Gordon]] of [[WKBD-TV]] in Detroit, Romney stated: &quot;When I came back from Viet Nam [in November 1965], I'd just had the greatest brainwashing that anybody can get.&quot; He then shifted to opposing the war: &quot;I no longer believe that it was necessary for us to get involved in South Vietnam to stop Communist aggression in Southeast Asia.&quot;  Decrying the &quot;tragic&quot; conflict, he urged &quot;a sound peace in South Vietnam at an early time.&quot; Thus Romney disavowed the war and reversed himself from his earlier stated belief that the war was &quot;morally right and necessary&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;johns&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | first=Andrew L. | last=Johns | title=Achilles' Heel: The Vietnam War and George Romney's Bid for the Presidency, 1967 to 1968 | journal=Michigan Historical Review | volume= 26 | year=2000 | pages=1–29 | doi=10.2307/20164896 | issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The &quot;brainwashing&quot; reference had been an offhand, unplanned remark that came at the end of a long, behind-schedule day of campaigning.&lt;ref name=&quot;white-1968-58&quot;&gt;White, ''The Making of the President, 1968'', pp. 58–60.&lt;/ref&gt;  By September 7, it found its way into prominence at ''The New York Times''.&lt;ref name=&quot;lfls&quot;/&gt;  Eight other governors who had been on the same 1965 trip as Romney said no such activity had taken place, and one of them, [[Philip H.

Either he's a most naïve man or he lacks judgment.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;time-bw&quot;/&gt;  The connotations of [[brainwashing]], following the experiences of American prisoners of war (highlighted by the 1962&amp;nbsp;film ''[[The Manchurian Candidate (1962 film)|The Manchurian Candidate]]''), made Romney's comments devastating,&lt;ref name=&quot;johns&quot;/&gt; especially as it reinforced the negative image of Romney's abilities that had already developed.&lt;ref name=&quot;witcover-88&quot;/&gt;  The topic of brainwashing quickly became newspaper editorial and television talk show fodder, and Romney bore the brunt of the topical humor.&lt;ref name=&quot;johns&quot;/&gt; Senator [[Eugene McCarthy]], running against Johnson for the Democratic nomination, said that in Romney's case, &quot;a light rinse would have been sufficient.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;lfls&quot;/&gt;  Republican Congressman [[Robert T.

Romney nonetheless persevered, staging a three-week, 17-city tour of the nation's ghettos and disadvantaged areas that included an effort to engage militants in dialogue (and that also produced an unusual encounter with [[hippies]] and [[Diggers (theater)|The Diggers]] in San Francisco's [[Haight-Ashbury]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;nytm-weaver&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F10C17FF395C107B93C1AB1782D85F438685F9 | title=Romney Pays Visit to Coast Hippies | last=Weaver | first=Warren, Jr. | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=September 23, 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He formally announced on November 18, 1967, at Detroit's [[UAW-Ford National Programs Center|Veterans Memorial Building]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F7071EF63D5B1B7A93CBA8178AD95F438685F9 | title=Text of Romney's Statement | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=November 19, 1967 | page=62 | format=fee required}}&lt;/ref&gt; that he had &quot;decided to fight for and win the Republican nomination and election to the Presidency of the United States.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.upi.com/Audio/Year_in_Review/Events-of-1967/Elections/12303074818188-11/ | title=1967 Year In Review | publisher=[[United Press International]] | accessdate=October 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He spent the following months campaigning tirelessly, focusing on the [[New Hampshire primary]], the first of the season, and doing all the on-the-ground activities known to that state: greeting workers at factory gates before dawn, having neighborhood meetings in private homes, and stopping at bowling alleys.&lt;ref name=&quot;white-1968-61&quot;/&gt;  He returned to Vietnam in December 1967 and made speeches and proposals on the subject, one of which presaged Nixon's eventual policy of [[Vietnamization]].&lt;ref name=&quot;witcover-88&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;white-1968-61&quot;/&gt;  For a while, he got an improved response from voters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F70C10F63C5E1A7B93CAAB178AD85F4C8685F9 | title=Romney is Gaining in New Hampshire | last=Ripley | first=Anthony | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=January 28, 1968 | format=fee required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the election, Nixon named Romney to be [[United States Secretary of Housing and Urban Development|Secretary of Housing and Urban Development]] (HUD). The president-elect made the announcement as part of a nationally televised presentation of his new cabinet on December 11, 1968.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt-cabinet&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F20D12FB3C54157493C0A81789D95F4C8685F9 | title=Nixon Presents the New Cabinet, Pledges to Seek Peace and Unity; All Republicans | last=Semple | first=Robert B., Jr. | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=December 12, 1968 | format=fee required}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nixon praised Romney for his &quot;missionary zeal&quot; and said that he would also be tasked with mobilizing volunteer organizations to fight poverty and disease within the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt-cabinet&quot;/&gt;  In actuality, Nixon distrusted Romney politically, and appointed him to a liberally-oriented, low-profile federal agency partly to appease Republican moderates and partly to reduce Romney's potential to challenge for the [[United States presidential election, 1972|1972&amp;nbsp;Republican presidential nomination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bg-series-4-side&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lamb, ''Housing Segregation in Suburban America Since 1960'', p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;kotlowski-52&quot;/&gt;

Romney was confirmed by the Senate without opposition on January 20, 1969, the day of Nixon's inauguration,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F20F13FE3F5E147493C3AB178AD85F4D8685F9 | title=Cabinet Approved Except for Hickel | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=January 21, 1969 | format=fee required}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was sworn into office on January 22, with Nixon presiding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=FA0B14FD3F5E147493C1AB178AD85F4D8685F9 | title=11 Cabinet Members Take Oath of Office; Hickel Vote Today | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=January 23, 1969 | last=Blair | first=William M. | format=fee required}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Romney resigned as Governor of Michigan that same day, and was succeeded by Lieutenant Governor [[William G. Milliken]]. Milliken continued Romney's model of downplaying party label and ideology, and Republicans held onto the governorship for three more terms until 1983, though Michigan was one of the nation's most blue-collar states.&lt;ref&gt;Witcover, ''Marathon'', p. 424.&lt;/ref&gt;

As secretary, Romney conducted the first reorganization of the department since its 1966 creation.&lt;ref name=&quot;nenno-11&quot;&gt;Nenno, ''Ending the Stalemate'', p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;  His November 1969 plan brought programs with similar functions together under unified, policy-based administration at the Washington level, and created two new assistant secretary positions.&lt;ref name=&quot;nenno-11&quot;/&gt;  At the same time, he increased the number of regional and area offices and decentralized program operations and locality-based decisions to them.&lt;ref name=&quot;nenno-11&quot;/&gt;

The [[Fair Housing Act of 1968]] mandated a federal commitment towards housing desegregation, and required HUD to orient its programs in this direction.&lt;ref name=&quot;mason&quot;&gt;Mason, ''Richard Nixon and the Quest for a New Majority'', pp. 149–150.&lt;/ref&gt;  Romney, filled with moral passion, wanted to address the widening economic and geographic gulf between whites and blacks by moving blacks out of inner-city ghettos into suburbs.&lt;ref name=&quot;kotlowski-45&quot;&gt;Kotlowski, ''Nixon's Civil Rights'', p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;  Romney proposed an [[open housing]] scheme to facilitate desegregation, dubbed &quot;Open Communities&quot;; HUD planned it for many months without keeping Nixon informed.&lt;ref name=&quot;lamb-69&quot;&gt;Lamb, ''Housing Segregation in Suburban America Since 1960'', pp. 69–72.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;kotlowski-55&quot;&gt;Kotlowski, ''Nixon's Civil Rights'', pp. 55–57.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nixon and Romney in a cabinet meeting.jpeg|Romney with Nixon at a Cabinet meeting in 1969|thumb|left|alt=Two middle-aged men sit at the right side of a large tabletop.]]  
When the open housing proposal became public, local reaction was often hostile.&lt;ref name=&quot;mason&quot;/&gt;  This included [[Warren, Michigan]], a blue-collar suburb of Detroit where many blacks worked but could not live owing to the zoning practices, refusals, and intimidatory actions of white property owners, many of whom had come there from the city as part of [[white flight]].&lt;ref name=&quot;lamb-93&quot;&gt;Lamb, ''Housing Segregation in Suburban America Since 1960'', pp. 85–93.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt072970&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F20813F63A5A157493CBAB178CD85F448785F9 | title=Michiganites Jeer Romney Over Suburbs' Integration | last=Flint |first=Jerry M. | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=July 29, 1970 | page=27 | format=fee required}}&lt;/ref&gt;  HUD made Warren a prime target for Open Communities enforcement and threatened to halt all federal assistance to the town unless it took a series of actions to end racial discrimination there; town officials said progress was being made and that their citizens resented forced integration.&lt;ref name=&quot;lamb-93&quot;/&gt;  Romney rejected this response, partly because when he was  governor, Warren residents had thrown rocks and garbage and yelled obscenities for days at a biracial couple who moved into town.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt072970&quot;/&gt;  Now the secretary said, &quot;The youth of this nation, the minorities of this nation, the discriminated of this nation are not going to wait for 'nature to take its course.' What is really at issue here is responsibility&amp;nbsp;– moral responsibility.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;lamb-93&quot;/&gt;

Romney visited Warren in July 1970, and emphasized that [[Affirmative action in the United States|affirmative action]] rather than forced integration was all that HUD was demanding, but the local populace was not satisfied and Romney was jeered as a police escort took him away from the meeting place.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt072970&quot;/&gt;   Nixon saw what happened in Warren&lt;ref name=&quot;lamb-93&quot;/&gt; and had no interest in the Open Communities policy in general, remarking to domestic adviser [[John Ehrlichman]] that, &quot;This country is not ready at this time for either forcibly integrated housing or forcibly integrated education.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;mason&quot;/&gt;  Open Communities also conflicted with Nixon's use of the [[Southern strategy]] and his own views on race.&lt;ref&gt;Lamb, ''Housing Segregation in Suburban America Since 1960'', pp. 112, 119.&lt;/ref&gt;  Romney was forced to back down on Warren and release federal monies to them unconditionally.&lt;ref name=&quot;lamb-93&quot;/&gt;

When [[Black Jack, Missouri]], subsequently resisted a HUD-sponsored plan for desegregated lower- and middle-income housing, Romney appealed to U.S. Attorney General [[John N. Mitchell|John Mitchell]] for [[U.S. Justice Department|Justice Department]] intervention.&lt;ref name=&quot;mason&quot;/&gt;  In September 1970, Mitchell refused and Romney's plan collapsed.&lt;ref name=&quot;mason&quot;/&gt;  Under Romney, HUD did put into place stricter racial guidelines in relation to new public housing projects, but overall administration implementation of the Fair Housing Act was lacking.&lt;ref name=&quot;mason&quot;/&gt;  Some of the responsibility lay with Romney's inattentiveness to gaining political backing for the policy, including the failure to rally natural allies such as the [[NAACP]].&lt;ref name=&quot;kotlowski-55&quot;/&gt;  [[Salisbury State University]] historian Dean J. Kotlowski writes that, &quot;No civil rights initiative developed on Nixon's watch was as sincerely devised or poorly executed as open communities.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;kotlowski-55&quot;/&gt;

Another of Romney's initiatives was &quot;Operation Breakthrough&quot;, which was intended to increase the amount of housing available to the poor and which did have Nixon's initial support.&lt;ref name=&quot;kotlowski-52&quot;/&gt;  Based on his automotive industry experience, Romney thought that the cost of housing could be significantly reduced if in-factory [[modular building|modular construction]] techniques were used.&lt;ref name=&quot;huduser&quot;/&gt;  However, HUD officials saw it too as a means to spearhead desegregation; Romney said, &quot;We've got to put an end to the idea of moving to suburban areas and living only among people of the same economic and social class&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Lamb, ''Housing Segregation in Suburban America Since 1960'', p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;  This aspect of the program brought about strong opposition at the local suburban level and lost support in the White House as well.&lt;ref&gt;Lamb, ''Housing Segregation in Suburban America Since 1960'', pp. 64–66.&lt;/ref&gt;  Over half of HUD's research funds during this time were spent on Operation Breakthrough, and it was modestly successful in its building goals.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt-obit&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nenno-13&quot;&gt;Nenno, ''Ending the Stalemate'', p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;  It did not revolutionize home construction, and was phased out once Romney left HUD,&lt;ref name=&quot;nenno-13&quot;/&gt; but side effects of the program did lead to more modern and consistent [[building codes]] and to introduction of technological advances such as the [[smoke alarm]].&lt;ref name=&quot;huduser&quot;/&gt;
In any case, using conventional methods, HUD set records for the amount of construction of assisted housing for low- and moderate-income families.&lt;ref name=&quot;nenno-13&quot;/&gt;  Toward the end of his term, Romney oversaw demolition of the infamous [[Pruitt–Igoe]] housing project in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;huduser&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.huduser.org/Periodicals/CITYSCPE/VOL1NUM3/foote.pdf | title=As They Saw It: HUD's Secretaries Reminisce About Carrying Out the Mission | last=Foote | first=Joseph | journal=Cityscape: A Journal of Policy Development and Research | volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=71–92 |year=1995 |month=September}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

[[File:NixonAndRomneyInOffice.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Two middle-aged men at a desk, in a forced pose of engaged conversation|President Nixon and Secretary Romney confer at [[The White House]] ]]
Romney was largely outside the president's inner circle and had minimal influence within the [[Nixon administration]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt-obit&quot;/&gt;  His intense, sometimes bombastic style of making bold advances and awkward pullbacks lacked adequate guile to succeed in Washington.&lt;ref name=&quot;kotlowski-50&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;drew-41&quot;&gt;Drew, ''Richard M. Nixon'', p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;  Desegregation efforts in employment and education had more success than in housing during the Nixon administration, but HUD's many missions and unwieldy structure, which sometimes worked at cross-purposes, made it institutionally vulnerable to political attack.&lt;ref name=&quot;bonastia-3&quot;&gt;Bonastia, ''Knocking on the Door'', [http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/s8205.pdf pp. 3–5].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bonastia-paper&quot;/&gt;  Romney also failed to understand or circumvent Nixon's use of Ehrlichman and [[White House Chief of Staff]] [[H. R. Haldeman]] as policy gatekeepers and the consequent ''de facto'' downgrading of cabinet officers.&lt;ref name=&quot;kotlowski-52&quot;&gt;Kotlowski, ''Nixon's Civil Rights'', p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;drew-41&quot;/&gt;  Romney was used to being listened to and making his own decisions,&lt;ref name=&quot;reeves-231&quot;&gt;Reeves, ''President Nixon'', p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt; and annoyed Nixon by casually interrupting him at meetings; at one point, Nixon told Haldeman, &quot;Just keep [Romney] away from me.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Reeves, ''President Nixon'', p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;  A statement by Romney that he would voluntarily reduce his salary to aid the federal budget was viewed by Nixon as an &quot;ineffective grandstand play&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;reeves-231&quot;/&gt;

By early 1970, Nixon had decided he wanted Romney removed from his position.&lt;ref name=&quot;kotlowski-53&quot;/&gt;  Nixon, who hated to fire people&lt;ref name=&quot;drew-41&quot;/&gt; and was, as Ehrlichman later described, &quot;notoriously inadept&quot; at it,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/choice/bob/erlichman.html | title=Stories of Bob: John Ehrlichman, Domestic Policy Advisor and Special Assistant to President Nixon | work=[[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]] | publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] | date=May 28, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; instead hatched a plot to get Romney to run in the 1970 U.S. Senate race in Michigan.&lt;ref name=&quot;kotlowski-53&quot;&gt;Kotlowski, ''Nixon's Civil Rights'', p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;  Lenore Romney ended up running instead, losing badly to incumbent Democrat [[Philip A.

In spring 1972, a major scandal struck the [[Federal Housing Administration]] (FHA), which since passage of the [[Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968]] and the creation of the [[Government National Mortgage Association]] (Ginnie Mae) had been responsible for helping the poor buy homes in inner-city areas via government-backed mortgages.&lt;ref name=&quot;time-fha&quot;/&gt; This was financed by [[mortgage-backed securities]], the first issues of which Romney had announced in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F10C17F83C5914768FDDA90A94DA405B808BF1D3 | title=U.S.-Backed Issues For Housing Sold | agency=[[Associated Press]] | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=February 20, 1970 | format=fee required}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A number of FHA employees, along with a number of real estate firms and lawyers, were indicted for a scheme in which the value of cheap inner city homes was inflated and sold using those government-backed mortgages to black buyers who could not really afford them, and the government was stuck for the bad loans when owners defaulted.&lt;ref name=&quot;time-fha&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,905892-2,00.html | title=Ghetto Shakedown | magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] | date=April 10, 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bonastia-132&quot;&gt;Bonastia, ''Knocking on the Door'', pp. 132–133.&lt;/ref&gt;  FHA was under Romney's purview, and he conceded that HUD had been unprepared to deal with speculators and had not been alert to earlier signs of illegal activity.&lt;ref name=&quot;time-fha&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bonastia-132&quot;/&gt;  The FHA scandal gave Nixon the ability to shut down HUD's remaining desegregation efforts with little political risk;&lt;ref name=&quot;bonastia-paper&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last=Bonastia | first=Christopher | title=Hedging His Bets: Why Nixon Killed HUD's Desegregation Efforts | journal=[[Social Science History]] | volume=28 | issue=1 | date=Spring 2004 | pages= 19–52 | doi=10.1215/01455532-28-1-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; by January 1973, all federal housing funds had been frozen.&lt;ref name=&quot;bonastia-3&quot;/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Americans have four basic ways of solving problems that are too big for individuals to handle by themselves. One is through the federal government. A second is through state governments and the local governments that the states create. The third is through the private sector&amp;nbsp;– the economic sector that includes business, agriculture, and labor. The fourth method is the independent sector&amp;nbsp;– the voluntary, cooperative action of free individuals and independent association.  Voluntary action is the most powerful of these, because it is uniquely capable of stirring the people themselves and involving their enthusiastic energies, because it is their own&amp;nbsp;– voluntary action is the people's action. ...

For much of his final two decades, Romney had been out of the political eye,&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt-obit&quot;/&gt; but he re-emerged to the general public when he campaigned for his son, Mitt Romney, during the younger Romney's bid to unseat Senator [[Edward M.

And what Ted is trying to do is bring it into the picture.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;bg-series-4&quot;/&gt;  The father counseled the son to be relaxed in appearance and to pay less attention to his political consultants and more to his own instincts, a change that the younger Romney made late in the ultimately unsuccessful campaign.&lt;ref name=&quot;bg-series-4&quot;/&gt;

By January 1995, amid press criticism of the Points of Light Foundation engaging in ineffective, wasteful spending, Romney expressed concern that the organization had too high a budget.&lt;ref name=&quot;lat-pol&quot;/&gt;  Active to the end, in July 1995, four days before his death, Romney proposed a presidential summit to encourage greater volunteerism and community service,&lt;ref name=&quot;cnn-summit&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.cnn.com/1997-04-27/us/9704_27_volunteer.ceremony_1_volunteer-work-summit-hope-presidents-summit?_s=PM:US | title=Clinton kicks off volunteer summit | publisher=[[CNN]] | date=April 27, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and the night before his death he drove to a meeting of another volunteer organization.&lt;ref name=&quot;gwr-ssps&quot;/&gt;

The [[Presidents' Summit For America's Future]] took place in Philadelphia in 1997, manifesting Romney's last volunteerism proposal,&lt;ref name=&quot;cnn-summit&quot;/&gt; with the organization [[America's Promise]] coming out of it.
For many years, the Points of Light Foundation (and its predecessor organization) has given out an annual Lenore and George W. Romney Citizen Volunteer Award (later retitled the George and Lenore Romney Citizen Volunteer Award); the inaugural such award in 1987 went to George Romney himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20030604005617/en/Raymond-Chambers-Honored-Lifetime-Achievement-Volunteer-Service | title=Raymond Chambers Honored for Lifetime Achievement in Volunteer Service | publisher=[[Business Wire]] | date=June 4, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Points of Light Foundation and the [[Corporation for National and Community Service]] also give out a George W.
