'''Thelma Catherine''' &quot;'''Pat'''&quot; '''Ryan Nixon''' (March 16, 1912 – June 22, 1993) was the wife of [[Richard Nixon]], 37th [[President of the United States]], and was [[First Lady of the United States]] from 1969 to 1974. 

Born in [[Ely, Nevada]], she grew up with her two brothers in what is now [[Cerritos, California]], graduating from high school in 1929. She attended [[Fullerton Junior College]] and later the [[University of Southern California]]. She paid for her schooling by working multiple jobs, including pharmacy manager, typist, [[X-ray technician]], and [[retail clerk]]. In 1940, she married lawyer Richard Nixon and they had two daughters. She campaigned for her husband in his successful [[United States Congress|congressional]] campaigns of 1946 and 1948. Richard Nixon was elected [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] in the [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]] administration, whereupon Pat undertook many missions of goodwill with her husband and gained favorable media coverage. She assisted her husband in both his unsuccessful [[United States presidential election, 1960|1960 presidential campaign]], and later in his successful [[United States presidential election, 1968|presidential campaign of 1968]].

As First Lady, Pat Nixon promoted a number of charitable causes, including [[volunteerism]]. She oversaw the collection of more than 600 pieces of historic art and furnishings for the [[White House]], an acquisition larger than that of any other administration. She was the most traveled First Lady in U.S. history, a record unsurpassed until twenty-five years later. She accompanied the President as the first First Lady to visit [[Peoples Republic of China|China]] and the [[Soviet Union]] and her solo trips to [[Africa]] and South America gained her recognition as &quot;Madame Ambassador&quot;; she was the first First Lady to enter a combat zone as well. These trips gained her favorable reception in the media and the host countries. Her tenure ended when, after being re-elected in a [[United States presidential election, 1972|landslide victory in 1972]], President Nixon resigned two years later amid the [[Watergate scandal]].

Her public appearances became increasingly rare later in life. She and her husband returned to [[California]], and later moved to [[New Jersey]]. She suffered two [[stroke]]s — one in 1976 and another in 1983 — and was diagnosed with [[lung cancer]] in 1992 and died in 1993, aged 81.

==Early life==
Thelma Catherine Ryan was born in the small mining town of [[Ely, Nevada]], the day before [[St. Patrick's Day]].&lt;ref name=&quot;First Lady Pat Nixon&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firstladies.org/biographies/firstladies.aspx?biography=38|title=First Lady Biography: Pat Nixon|accessdate= 2007-08-15|year= 2005|publisher= The National First Ladies Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her father, William M. Ryan Sr., was a sailor, gold miner, and [[market gardening|truck farmer]] of Irish descent; her mother, Katherine Halberstadt, was a German immigrant.&lt;ref name=&quot;First Lady Pat Nixon&quot;/&gt; &quot;Pat&quot; was a nickname given to her by her father, referring to her birthdate and Irish ancestry.&lt;ref name=&quot;First Lady Pat Nixon&quot;/&gt; Upon enrolling in college in 1931 she dropped her first name of Thelma, replacing it with Pat and occasionally rendering it as Patricia; the name change, however, was not a legal action, merely one of preference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Halloran, Richard|title=First Lady of the Land at 60: Thelma Catherine Ryan Nixon, Woman in the News|work=The New York Times|date=March 16, 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Kinnard, Judith M.|title=Thelma Ryan's Rise: From White Frame to White House|work=The New York Times|date=August 20, 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After her birth, the Ryan family moved to California, and in 1914 settled on a small truck farm in [[Artesia, California|Artesia]] (present-day [[Cerritos, California|Cerritos]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=First Lady Hailed on Return 'Home'|work=The New York Times|date=September 6, 1969|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thelma Ryan's high-school yearbook page gives her nickname as &quot;Buddy&quot; and her ambition to run a boarding house.&lt;ref&gt;Illustration in a ''New York Times'' article by Judith M. Kinnard, entitled &quot;Thelma Ryan's Rise: From White Frame to White House&quot; (August 20, 1971).&lt;/ref&gt; 

During this time she worked on the family farm, and also at a local bank as a janitor and bookkeeper. Her mother died of cancer in 1924.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt-obit&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Pat Nixon, Former First Lady, Dies at 81|work=The New York Times|date=July 23, 1993|page=D22|accessdate=2007-11-09|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE5D7113AF930A15755C0A965958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pat, who was 12 at the time, assumed all the household duties for her father, who died in 1929 of [[silicosis]], and two older brothers, William Jr. (1910–1997) and Thomas (1911–1992). She also had a half-sister, Neva Bender (born 1909), and a half-brother, Matthew Bender (born 1907), from her mother's first marriage;&lt;ref name=&quot;First Lady Pat Nixon&quot;/&gt; her mother's first husband had died during a [[flash flood]] in South Dakota.&lt;ref name=&quot;First Lady Pat Nixon&quot;/&gt;

== Education and career ==
It has been said that few, if any, First Ladies worked as consistently before their marriage as did Pat Nixon.&lt;ref name=&quot;First Lady Pat Nixon&quot;/&gt; As she told the writer [[Gloria Steinem]] during the 1968 presidential campaign, &quot;I never had time to think about things like that—who I wanted to be, or who I admired, or to have ideas. I never had time to dream about being anyone else. I had to work.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;steinem&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nymag.com/news/politics/45934/index11.html|title=In Your Heart You Know He's Nixon|author=Steinem, Gloria|publisher=''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]''|date=1968-10-28|accessdate=2009-05-16 | authorlink=Gloria Steinem}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduating from [[Excelsior High School (Norwalk, California)|Excelsior High School]] in  1929, she attended [[Fullerton College|Fullerton Junior College]]. She paid for her education by working odd jobs, including as a driver, a pharmacy manager, a telephone operator, and a typist.&lt;ref name=&quot;First Lady Pat Nixon&quot;/&gt; She also earned money sweeping the floors of a local bank,&lt;ref name=&quot;First Lady Pat Nixon&quot;/&gt; and from 1930 until 1932, she lived in New York City, working as a secretary and an [[X-ray technician]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt-obit&quot; /&gt;

Determined &quot;to make something out of myself&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;PN is the Ultimate Good Sport&quot;&gt;{{cite news|author=Viorst, Judith|title=Pat Nixon Is the Ultimate Good Sport|work=The New York Times|date=September 13, 1970|page=SM13}}&lt;/ref&gt; she enrolled in 1931 at the [[University of Southern California]] (USC), where she majored in merchandising. A former professor noted that she &quot;stood out from the empty-headed, overdressed little sorority girls of that era like a good piece of literature on a shelf of cheap paperbacks.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;silentpartner&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=The Silent Partner|work=Time|date=February 29, 1960|accessdate=2007-11-09|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,873226-1,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; She held part-time jobs on campus, worked as a sales clerk in [[Bullocks Wilshire|Bullock's-Wilshire]] department store,&lt;ref name=&quot;Roderick75&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Wilshire Boulevard: Grand Concourse of Los Angeles|last1=Roderick|first1=Kevin|last2=Lynxwiler|first2=J.

In 1937, Pat Ryan graduated ''[[cum laude]]'' from USC with a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in merchandising,&lt;ref name=&quot;First Lady Pat Nixon&quot;/&gt; together with a certificate to teach at the [[high school]] level, which USC deemed equivalent to a [[Master's degree]].&lt;ref&gt;Eisenhower, Julie Nixon (1986), p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; Pat accepted a position as a high school teacher in [[Whittier, California]].&lt;ref name=&quot;wh&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/history/firstladies/pn37.html|title=Patricia Ryan Nixon|accessdate=2008-08-01|publisher=The White House}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Marriage and family ==
While in Whittier, Pat Ryan met a young lawyer fresh out of [[Duke University]] law school, [[Richard Nixon|Richard Milhous Nixon]]. The two became acquainted at a Little Theater group when they were cast together in ''[[The Dark Tower (play)|The Dark Tower]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt-obit&quot;/&gt; Known as Dick, he asked Pat Ryan to marry him the first night they went out. &quot;I thought he was nuts or something!&quot; she recalled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Diplomat in High Heels: Thelma Ryan Nixon|work=The New York Times|date=July 28, 1959|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; He courted the redhead he called his &quot;wild Irish Gypsy&quot; for two years,&lt;ref&gt;Marton, Kati (2001), p. 173&lt;/ref&gt; even driving her to and from her dates with other men. Eventually they married at the [[Mission Inn]] in [[Riverside, California]] on June 21, 1940. She said that she had been attracted to the young Nixon because he &quot;was going places, he was vital and ambitious&amp;nbsp;... he was always doing things&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;PN is the Ultimate Good Sport&quot;/&gt; Later, referring to Richard Nixon, she said, &quot;Oh but you just don’t realize how much fun he is! He’s just so much fun!&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;os234&quot;/&gt; While Richard Nixon served in the [[U.S. Navy|Navy]] during [[World War II]], Pat worked as a government [[economist]] living in [[San Francisco]].&lt;ref name=&quot;First Lady Pat Nixon&quot;/&gt;

Veteran [[United Press International|UPI]] reporter [[Helen Thomas]] suggested that in public, the Nixons &quot;moved through life ritualistically&quot;, but privately, however, they were &quot;very close&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;csa172&quot;/&gt; In private, Richard Nixon was described as being &quot;unabashedly sentimental&quot;, often praising Pat for her work, remembering anniversaries and surprising her with frequent gifts.&lt;ref name=&quot;csa172&quot;/&gt; During state dinners, he ordered the protocol changed so that Pat could be served first.&lt;ref name=&quot;csa173&quot;&gt;Anthony, C. S. (1991), p. 173&lt;/ref&gt; Pat, in turn, felt that her husband was vulnerable and sought to protect him.&lt;ref name=&quot;csa173&quot;/&gt; Of his critics, she said that &quot;Lincoln had worse critics. He was big enough not to let it bother him. That's the way my husband is.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;csa173&quot;/&gt;

===Early campaigns===
Pat campaigned at her husband's side in 1946 when he entered politics, running successfully for a seat in the [[United States House of Representatives]]. That same year, she gave birth to a daughter and namesake, [[Patricia Nixon Cox|Patricia]], known as Tricia. In 1948, Pat had her second and last child, [[Julie Nixon Eisenhower|Julie]]. When asked about her husband's career, Pat once stated, &quot;The only thing I could do was help him, but [politics] was not a life I would have chosen.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,942982,00.html|title=Pat Nixon: Steel and Sorrow|accessdate=2008-08-18|work=Time|date=August 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pat participated in the campaign by doing research on his opponent, incumbent [[Jerry Voorhis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;First Lady Pat Nixon&quot;/&gt; She also wrote and distributed campaign literature.&lt;ref name=&quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia| title =The American Presidency| encyclopedia = Encyclopædia Britannica | publisher =Encyclopædia Britannica| year= 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nixon was elected in his first campaign to represent [[California's 12th congressional district]]. During the next six years, Pat saw her husband move from the U.S. House of Representatives to the [[United States Senate]], and then be nominated as [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]'s [[Vice President of the United States|vice presidential]] candidate.

Although Pat Nixon was a [[Methodist]], she and her husband attended whichever [[Protestant Church]] was nearest to their home, especially after moving to Washington. They attended the Metropolitan Memorial Methodist Church because it sponsored her daughters' Brownie troop, occasional [[Baptist]] services with the Reverend Dr. [[Billy Graham]], and [[Norman Vincent Peale]]'s Marble Collegiate Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,844670-2,00.html|title=A Worshiper in the White House|accessdate= 2007-10-08|date= December 6, 1968 |publisher=Time|pages=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Wife of the Vice President, 1953–1961 ==
[[Image:Nixons in Ghana 1957.jpg|thumb|right|Vice President and Pat Nixon during a visit to [[Ghana]], 1957]]
During the [[United States presidential election, 1952|Presidential campaign of 1952]] Pat Nixon's attitude toward politics changed when her husband was accused of accepting illegal campaign contributions. Pat encouraged him to fight the charges, and he did so by delivering the famed &quot;[[Checkers speech]]&quot;, so-called for the family's dog, a [[cocker spaniel]] given them by a political supporter. This was Pat's first national television appearance, and she, her daughters, and the dog were featured prominently. Defending himself as a man of the people, Nixon stressed his wife's abilities as a stenographer,&lt;ref name=&quot;steinem&quot;/&gt; then said, &quot;I should say this, that Pat doesn't have a mink coat. But she does have a respectable Republican cloth coat, and I always tell her she would look good in anything.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/presidents/34_eisenhower/psources/ps_checkers.html|title=Richard Nixon's Checkers Speech|accessdate=2007-11-05|year=2002–2003|publisher=PBS}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In 1968, however, a fashion writer of ''The New York Times'' noted that Pat Nixon had purchased a coat made of blonde mink and one of brown-and-black [[Persian lamb]] by the furrier Sidney Fink of Blum &amp; Fink. {{cite news|author=Curtis, Charlotte|title=Fashion Spotlight Turns to New First Family|work=The New York Times|date=December 21, 1968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pat Nixon accompanied her husband abroad in his vice presidential years. She visited 53 nations, often bypassing luncheons and teas and instead visiting hospitals, orphanages, and even a [[leper colony]] in [[Panama]].&lt;ref name=&quot;First Lady Pat Nixon&quot;/&gt; On a trip to [[Venezuela]], the Nixons' [[limousine]] was pelted with rocks and the couple was spat upon as representatives of the U.S. government.&lt;ref name=&quot;silentpartner&quot;/&gt;

A November 1, 1958 article in the ''[[Seattle Times]]'' was typical of the media's favorable coverage of the future First Lady, stating that &quot;Mrs. Nixon is always reported to be gracious and friendly. And she sure is friendly. She greets a stranger as a friend. She doesn't just shake hands but clasps a visitor's hand in both her hands. Her manner is direct&amp;nbsp;... Mrs. Nixon also upheld her reputation of always looking neat, no matter how long her day has been.&quot; A year and a half later, during her husband's campaign for the presidency, ''[[The New York Times]]'' called her &quot;a paragon of wifely virtues&quot; whose &quot;efficiency makes other women feel slothful and untalented&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Bender, Marylin|title=Pat Nixon: A Diplomat in High Heels|work=The New York Times|date=July 28, 1960|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pat Nixon was named Outstanding Homemaker of the Year (1953), Mother of the Year (1955), and the Nation's Ideal Housewife (1957), and once admitted that she pressed all of her husband's suits one evening.&lt;ref name=&quot;PN is the Ultimate Good Sport&quot;/&gt; &quot;Of course, I didn't have to,&quot; she told ''The New York Times'', &quot;But when I don't have work to do, I just think up some new project.&quot;

== Her husband's campaigns—1960, 1962 and 1968 ==
Vice President Nixon ran for President of the United States in [[United States presidential election, 1960|1960]] against then-Senator [[John F. Kennedy]]. Pat was featured prominently in the campaign; an entire advertisement campaign was built around the slogan &quot;Pat for First Lady&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;First Lady Pat Nixon&quot;/&gt; Nixon conceded the election to Kennedy, although the race was very close and there were allegations of voter fraud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/K/htmlK/kennedy-nixon/kennedy-nixon.htm|title=Kennedy-Nixon Presidential Debates, 1960|accessdate= 2007-10-08|author= Allen, Erika Tyner|publisher= Museum of Broadcast Communications}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pat had urged her husband to demand a recount of votes, though Nixon declined.&lt;ref name=&quot;os234&quot;&gt;O'Brien, C.; Suteski, M. (2005), p. 234&lt;/ref&gt; Pat was most upset about the television cameras, which recorded her reaction when her husband lost—&quot;millions of television viewers witnessed her desperate fight to hold a smile upon her lips as her face came apart and the bitter tears flowed from her eyes&quot;, as one reporter put it.&lt;ref name=&quot;PN is the Ultimate Good Sport&quot;/&gt; This permanently dimmed Pat Nixon's view of politics.&lt;ref name=&quot;First Lady Pat Nixon&quot;/&gt;

In 1962, the Nixons embarked on another campaign, this time for [[Governor of California]]. Prior to Richard Nixon's announcement of his candidacy, Pat's brother Tom Ryan said, &quot;Pat told me that if Dick ran for governor she was going to take her shoe to him.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Eisenhower, Julie Nixon (1986), p. 205-206&quot;&gt;Eisenhower, Julie Nixon (1986), pp. 205–206&lt;/ref&gt; She eventually agreed to another run, citing that it meant a great deal to her husband,&lt;ref name=&quot;Eisenhower, Julie Nixon (1986), p. 205-206&quot;/&gt; but Richard Nixon lost the gubernatorial election to [[Pat Brown]].

Six years later, Richard Nixon ran again for the presidency. Pat was reluctant to face another campaign, her eighth since 1946.&lt;ref name=&quot;jne235237&quot;&gt;Eisenhower, Julie Nixon (1986), pp. 235, 237&lt;/ref&gt; Her husband was a deeply controversial figure in American politics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Mason |first=Robert |title=Richard Nixon and the Quest for a New Majority |publisher=UNC Press |year=2004 |isbn=0-8078-2905-6| page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Pat had witnessed and shared the praise and vilification he had received without having established an independent public identity for herself.&lt;ref name=&quot;steinem&quot;/&gt;  Although she supported him in his career, she feared another &quot;1960&quot;, when Nixon lost to Kennedy.&lt;ref name=&quot;jne235237&quot;/&gt; She consented, however, and participated in the campaign by traveling on campaign trips with her husband.&lt;ref&gt;Eisenhower, Julie Nixon (1986), p. 236&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Nixon would make a political comeback with his presidential victory of [[United States presidential election, 1968|1968]] over Vice-President [[Hubert Humphrey]]—and the country would have a new First Lady.

== First Lady of the United States, 1969–1974 ==
=== Major initiatives ===
Pat Nixon felt that the First Lady should always set a public example of high virtue as a symbol of dignity, but she refused to revel in the trappings of the position.&lt;ref name=&quot;csa165&quot;&gt;Anthony, C. S. (1991), p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; When considering ideas for a project as First Lady, Pat refused to do (or be) something simply to emulate her predecessor, [[Lady Bird Johnson]].&lt;ref&gt;Anthony, C. S. (1991), p. 168&lt;/ref&gt; She decided to continue what she called &quot;personal diplomacy&quot;, which meant traveling and visiting people in other states or other nations.&lt;ref&gt;Eisenhower, Julie Nixon (1986), p. 254&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Richard Nixon 1969 inauguration.png|thumb|left|Pat Nixon holds the Ryan and Nixon family Bibles as her husband is sworn in, January 20, 1969]]
One of her major initiatives as First Lady was the promotion of volunteerism, in which she encouraged Americans to address social problems at the local level through volunteering at hospitals, civic organizations, and rehabilitation centers.&lt;ref name=&quot;PN Biography: Richard Nixon Library&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nixonfoundation.org/index.php?src=gendocs&amp;link=PNbio|title=Biography of First Lady Pat Nixon|accessdate= 2007-10-08|year= 2005|publisher= Richard Nixon Library &amp; Birthplace Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; She stated, &quot;Our success as a nation depends on our willingness to give generously of ourselves for the welfare and enrichment of the lives of others.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;csa177&quot;&gt;Anthony, C. S. (1991), p. 177&lt;/ref&gt; She undertook a &quot;Vest Pockets for Volunteerism&quot; trip, where she visited ten different volunteer programs.&lt;ref name=&quot;csa177&quot;/&gt; Susan Porter, in charge of the First Lady's scheduling, noted that Pat &quot;saw volunteers as unsung heroes who hadn't been encouraged or given credit for their sacrifices and who needed to be&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;csa177&quot;/&gt; Her second volunteerism tour—she traveled {{convert|4130|mi|km|0}} within the United States—helped to boost the notion that not all students were protesting the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref&gt;Anthony, C. S. (1991), p. 181&lt;/ref&gt; She herself belonged to several volunteer groups, including Women in Community Services and Urban Services League,&lt;ref name=&quot;csa177&quot;/&gt; and was an advocate of the Domestic Volunteer Service Act of 1973,&lt;ref name=&quot;First Lady Pat Nixon&quot;/&gt; a bill that encouraged volunteerism by providing benefits to a number of volunteer organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=3984|title=Richard Nixon: Statement on Signing the Domestic Volunteer Service Act of 1973|date=October 1, 1973|accessdate=2008-08-19|publisher=The American Presidency Project}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some reporters viewed her choice of volunteerism as safe and dull compared to the initiatives undertaken by Lady Bird Johnson and [[Jacqueline Kennedy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;burns-125&quot;&gt;Burns, Lisa (2008), p. 125&lt;/ref&gt;

Pat Nixon became involved in the development of recreation areas and parkland, was a member of the President's Committee on Employment of the Handicapped, and lent her support to organizations dedicated to improving the lives of handicapped children.&lt;ref name=&quot;First Lady Pat Nixon&quot;/&gt; For her first [[Thanksgiving]] in the White House, Pat organized a meal for 225 senior citizens who did not have families.&lt;ref name=&quot;csa178&quot;&gt;Anthony, C. S. (1991), p. 178&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, she invited wounded servicemen to a second annual Thanksgiving meal in the White House.&lt;ref name=&quot;csa178&quot;/&gt; Though presidents since [[George Washington]] had been issuing Thanksgiving proclamations, Pat became the only First Lady to issue one.&lt;ref name=&quot;csa178&quot;/&gt;

=== Life in the White House ===

After her husband was elected president in 1968, Pat Nixon met with the outgoing First Lady Lady Bird Johnson and toured the private quarters of the White House on December 12.&lt;ref&gt;Eisenhower, Julie Nixon (1986), pp. 260, 264&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually she asked Sarah Jackson Doyle—an interior decorator who had worked for the Nixons since 1965 and who decorated the family's 10-room apartment on [[Fifth Avenue]] in [[New York City|New York]] with French and English antiques—to serve as a design consultant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Reif, Rita|title=A Decorator for Nixons Gives Julie A Bit of Help|work=The New York Times|date=November 30, 1968}}&lt;/ref&gt; She hired Clement Conger from the [[United States Department of State|State Department]] to be the Executive Mansion's new curator- replacing the house's first curator, James Ketchum, who had been hired by Jacqueline Kennedy.&lt;ref&gt;Eisenhower, Julie Nixon (1986), pp. 261, 263&lt;/ref&gt;

Pat Nixon had an interest in adding artifacts to the Executive Mansion, and built on [[Jacqueline Kennedy]]'s more publicized efforts. She added more than 600 paintings and furnishings to the White House and its collections, the largest number of acquisitions by any administration.&lt;ref name=&quot;First Lady Pat Nixon&quot;/&gt; She created the [[Map Room (White House)|Map Room]] and renovated the China room, and refurbished nine others.&lt;ref name=&quot;csa188&quot;/&gt; She worked with engineers to develop an exterior lighting system for the entire White House, literally making it glow a soft white.&lt;ref name=&quot;csa188&quot;/&gt; She ordered the flag flown, day and night, even when the president was not there.&lt;ref name=&quot;csa188&quot;/&gt;

She ordered pamphlets describing the rooms of the house for tourists so they could understand everything, and had them translated into Spanish, French, Italian and Russian for foreigners.&lt;ref name=&quot;csa188&quot;/&gt; She had ramps installed for the handicapped and physically disabled. She instructed the police who served as tour guides to attend sessions at [[Winterthur]] (to learn how tours were guided &quot;in a real museum&quot;),&lt;ref name=&quot;csa188&quot;/&gt; and arranged for them to wear less menacing uniforms, with their guns hidden underneath.&lt;ref name=&quot;csa188&quot;/&gt; The tour guides were to speak slowly to deaf groups, to help those who lip-read, and Pat ordered that the blind be able to touch the antiques.&lt;ref name=&quot;csa188&quot;/&gt;

The First Lady had long been irritated with the perception that the White House and access to the President and First Lady were exclusively for the wealthy and famous;&lt;ref name=&quot;csa188&quot;&gt;Anthony, C. S. (1991), p. 188&lt;/ref&gt; she would routinely come down from the family quarters to greet tourists, shake hands, sign autographs, and pose for photos.&lt;ref name=&quot;csa187&quot;/&gt; Her daughter Julie Eisenhower reflected, &quot;she invited so many groups to the White House to give them recognition, not famous ones, but little known organizations...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;David, Lester (1978), p. 128&lt;/ref&gt;

She opened the White House for evening tours so that the public could see the interior design work that had been implemented. Among these tours were those conducted in December, displaying the White House's Christmas decor. In addition, she instituted a series of performances by artists at the White House in varied American traditions, from opera to [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]]; among the guests were [[The Carpenters]] in 1972. These events were described as ranging from &quot;creative to indifferent, to downright embarrassing&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;PN is the Ultimate Good Sport&quot;/&gt; When they entered the White House in 1969, the Nixons began inviting families to non-denominational Sunday church services in the [[East Room]] of the White House.&lt;ref name=&quot;csa188&quot;/&gt; She also oversaw the White House wedding of her daughter, Tricia, to [[Edward F. Cox|Edward Ridley Finch Cox]] in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Krebs, Alvin|title=More on the Wedding|work=The New York Times|date=May 11, 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She spoke out in favor of women running for political office and encouraged her husband to nominate a woman to the [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]], saying &quot;woman power is unbeatable; I've seen it all across this country&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;cc-nyt&quot;&gt;{{cite news|author=Curtis, Charlotte|title=Pat Nixon: 'Creature Comforts Don't Matter'|work=The New York Times|date=July 3, 1968}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was the first of the American First Ladies to publicly support the [[Equal Rights Amendment]],&lt;ref&gt;Anthony, C. S. (1991), p. 194&lt;/ref&gt; though her views on abortion were mixed. Following the Court's 1973 ''[[Roe vs. Wade]]'' decision, Pat stated she was [[pro-choice]].&lt;ref name=&quot;First Lady Pat Nixon&quot;/&gt; However in 1972, she said, &quot;I'm really not for abortion. I think it's a personal thing. I mean abortion on demand—wholesale.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mrs. Nixon Asserts Jane Fonda Should Bid Hanoi End War|work=The New York Times|date=August 9, 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, she became the first Republican First Lady to address a [[1972 Republican National Convention|national convention]].&lt;ref name=&quot;First Lady Pat Nixon&quot;/&gt; Her efforts in the 1972 reelection campaign—traveling across the country and speaking on behalf of her husband—were copied by future candidates' spouses.&lt;ref name=&quot;First Lady Pat Nixon&quot;/&gt;

=== Travels ===

[[File:President Richard and Pat Nixon on Great Wall.png|thumb|right|The Nixons on the [[Great Wall of China]] during their historic trip, 1972]]
Pat Nixon held the record as the most-traveled First Lady before [[Hillary Rodham Clinton]].&lt;ref name=&quot;First Lady Pat Nixon&quot;/&gt; In President Nixon's first term, Pat traveled to 39 of 50 states, and in the first year alone, shook hands with a quarter of a million people.&lt;ref&gt;O'Brien, C.; Suteski, M. (2005), p. 239&lt;/ref&gt; She undertook many missions of goodwill to foreign nations as well. Her first foreign trip took in Guam, India, the Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand, Pakistan, Romania, and England.&lt;ref name=&quot;csa171&quot;&gt;Anthony, C. S. (1991), p. 171&lt;/ref&gt; On such trips, Pat refused to be serviced by an entourage, feeling that they were an unnecessary barrier and a burden for taxpayers.&lt;ref name=&quot;csa171&quot;/&gt; Soon after, during a trip to [[South Vietnam]], Pat became the first First Lady to enter a combat zone.&lt;ref name=&quot;First Lady Pat Nixon&quot;/&gt; She had tea with the wife of President [[Nguyễn Văn Thiệu]] in a palace, visited an orphanage, and lifted off in an open-door helicopter—armed by military guards with machine guns—to witness U.S. troops fighting in a jungle below.&lt;ref name=&quot;csa171&quot;/&gt; She would later admit to experiencing a &quot;moment of fear going into a battle zone&quot;, because, as author and historian Carl Sferrazza Anthony noted, &quot;Pat Nixon was literally in a line of fire.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;csa171&quot;/&gt; She later visited an army hospital, where, for two hours, she walked through the wards and spoke with each wounded patient.&lt;ref name=&quot;csa172&quot;&gt;Anthony, C. S. (1991), p. 172&lt;/ref&gt; The First Lady of South Vietnam, Madame Thieu, said Pat Nixon's trip &quot;intensified our morale&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;csa172&quot;/&gt;

After hearing about the [[Great Peruvian Earthquake]] of 1970, which caused an avalanche and additional destruction, Pat initiated a &quot;volunteer American relief drive&quot; and flew to the country, where she aided in taking relief supplies to earthquake victims.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony, C. S. (1991), p. 185&lt;/ref&gt; She toured damaged regions and embraced homeless townspeople; they trailed her as she climbed up hills of rubble and under fallen beams.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony, C. S. (1991), p. 186&lt;/ref&gt; Her trip was heralded in newspapers around the world for her acts of compassion and disregard for her personal safety or comfort,&lt;ref name=&quot;PN is the Ultimate Good Sport&quot;/&gt; and her presence was a direct boost to political relations. One Peruvian official commented: &quot;Her coming here meant more than anything else President Nixon could have done,&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;csa187&quot;/&gt; and an editorial in Peru's ''Lima Prensa'' said that Peruvians could never forget Pat Nixon.&lt;ref name=&quot;csa187&quot;&gt;Anthony, C. S. (1991), p. 187&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fran Lewine]] of the [[Associated Press]] wrote that no First Lady had ever undertaken a &quot;mercy mission&quot; resulting in such &quot;diplomatic side effects&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;csa187&quot;/&gt; On the trip, the Peruvian government presented her with the [[Order of the Sun (Peru)|Grand Cross of the Order of the Sun]], the highest Peruvian distinction and the oldest such honor in the Americas.&lt;ref name=&quot;First Lady Pat Nixon&quot;/&gt;

She became the first First Lady to visit Africa in 1972, on a {{convert|10000|mi|km|0|adj=on}}, eight-day journey to [[Ghana]], [[Liberia]], and the [[Ivory Coast]].&lt;ref name=&quot;csa196&quot;&gt;Anthony, C. S. (1991), p. 196&lt;/ref&gt; Upon arrival to Liberia, Pat was honored with a 19-gun salute, a tribute reserved only for heads of government, and she reviewed troops.&lt;ref name=&quot;csa196&quot;/&gt; She later donned a traditional native costume and danced with locals. She was awarded the Grand Cordon of the Most Venerable Order of Knighthood, Liberia's highest honor.&lt;ref name=&quot;csa196&quot;/&gt; In Ghana, she again danced with local residents, and addressed the nation's [[Parliament of Ghana|Parliament]].&lt;ref name=&quot;csa196&quot;/&gt; In the Ivory Coast, she was met by a quarter of a million people shouting &quot;''Vive Madame Nixon!''&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;csa196&quot;/&gt; She conferred with leaders of all three African nations.&lt;ref name=&quot;csa196&quot;/&gt; Upon her return home, White House staffer [[Charles Colson]] sent a memo to the President reading in part, &quot;Mrs. Nixon has now broken through where we have failed&amp;nbsp;... People—men and women—identify with her, and in return with you.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;csa197&quot;&gt;Anthony, C. S. (1991), p. 197&lt;/ref&gt;

Another notable journey was the [[1972 Nixon visit to China|Nixons' historic visit]] to the [[People's Republic of China]] in 1972. While President Nixon was in meetings, Pat toured through [[Peking]] in her red coat. According to Carl Sferrazza Anthony, China was Pat Nixon's &quot;moment&quot;, her turning point as an acclaimed First Lady in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;csa199200&quot;&gt;Anthony, C. S. (1991), pp. 199–200&lt;/ref&gt; She accompanied her husband to the Nixon–[[Leonid Brezhnev|Brezhnev]] summit meetings in the [[Soviet Union]] later in the year. Though security constraints left her unable to walk freely through the streets as she did in China, Pat was still able to visit with children and walk arm-in-arm with [[Soviet First Lady]] [[Viktoria Brezhneva]].&lt;ref name=&quot;csa199200&quot;/&gt; Later, she visited [[Brazil]] and [[Venezuela]] in 1974 with the unique diplomatic standing of personal representative of the president. The Nixons' last major trip was in June 1974, to Austria, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Israel, and Jordan.&lt;ref name=&quot;csa215&quot;&gt;Anthony, C. S. (1991), p. 215&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fashion and style ===
[[Image:Pat Nixon poses 1970.jpg|thumb|right|Pat Nixon posing in the White House, 1970]]
The fashion press tends to take special interest in First Ladies. The traditional role of a First Lady as the nation's hostess puts her personal appearance and style under scrutiny, and the attention to Pat was lively. ''[[Women's Wear Daily]]'' stated that Pat had a &quot;good figure and good posture&quot;, as well as &quot;the best-looking legs of any woman in public life today&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,900581,00.html|title=Redoing Pat|accessdate=2008-07-25|work=Time|date=January 24, 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some fashion writers tended to have a lackluster opinion of her well tailored, but nondescript, American-made clothes. &quot;I consider it my duty to use American designers&quot;, she said,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Weinman, Martha|title=First Ladies—In Fashion, Too?|work=The New York Times|date=September 11, 1960}}&lt;/ref&gt; and favored them because, &quot;they are now using so many materials which are great for traveling because they're non crushable&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony, C. S. (1991), p. 192&lt;/ref&gt; She preferred to buy readymade garments rather than made-to-order outfits. &quot;I'm a size 10,&quot; she told ''[[The New York Times]]''. &quot;I can just walk in and buy. I've bought things in various stores in various cities. Only some of my clothes are by designers.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;cc-nyt&quot;/&gt; She did, however, wear the custom work of some well-known talents, notably [[Geoffrey Beene]], at the suggestion of Clara Treyz, her personal shopper.&lt;ref name=&quot;cc-nyt&quot;/&gt; Many fashion observers concluded that Pat Nixon did not greatly advance the cause of American fashion. Nixon's yellow-satin inaugural gown by Harvey Berin was criticized as &quot;a schoolteacher on her night out&quot;, but Treyz defended her wardrobe selections by saying, &quot;Mrs. Nixon must be ladylike.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pat's Wardrobe Mistress|work=Time|date=January 12, 1970|accessdate=2007-11-09|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,942153-2,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nixon also frequently wore wigs that replicated her short blonde hairstyle, especially on political trips when access to a hairdresser would be difficult. {{cite news|author=Curtis, Charlotte|title=Pat Nixon: 'Creature Comforts Don't Matter'|work=The New York Times|date=July 3, 1968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nixon did not sport the outrageous fashions of the 1970s, because she was concerned about appearing conservatively dressed, especially as her husband's political star rose. &quot;Always before, it was sort of fun to get some&amp;nbsp;... thing that was completely different, high-style&quot;, she told a reporter. &quot;But this is not appropriate now. I avoid the spectacular.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Eisenhower, Julie Nixon (1986), p. 187&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Watergate ===
{{see|Watergate scandal}}
At the time the Watergate scandal broke to the media, Nixon &quot;barely noticed&quot; the reports of a break-in at the [[Democratic National Committee]] headquarters.&lt;ref name=&quot;csa201&quot;&gt;Anthony, C. S. (1991), p. 201&lt;/ref&gt; Later, when asked by the press about Watergate, she replied curtly, &quot;I know only what I read in the newspapers.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;csa203&quot;&gt;Anthony, C. S. (1991), p. 203&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, when a reporter asked &quot;Is the press the cause of the president's problems?&quot;, she shot back, &quot;What problems?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Anthony, C. S. (1991), p. 210&lt;/ref&gt; Privately, she felt that the power of her husband's staff was increasing, and President Nixon was becoming more removed from what was occurring in the administration.&lt;ref name=&quot;csa203&quot;/&gt;''

[[Image:NIXONSandFORDS.jpg|thumb|left|The Fords escort the Nixons to a [[Marine One|waiting helicopter]] on Nixon's final day as president, August 9, 1974.]]
Pat Nixon did not know of the secret tape recordings her husband had made. [[Julie Nixon Eisenhower]] stated that the First Lady would have ordered the tapes destroyed immediately, had she known of their existence.&lt;ref&gt;Eisenhower, Julie Nixon (1986), pp. 409–410&lt;/ref&gt; Once she did learn of the tapes, she vigorously opposed making them public, and compared them to &quot;private love letters—for one person alone&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony, C. S. (1991), p. 214&lt;/ref&gt; Believing in her husband's innocence, she also encouraged him not to resign and instead fight all the impeachment charges that were eventually leveled against him. She said to her friend Helene Drown, &quot;Dick has done so much for the country. Why is this happening?&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;csa215&quot;/&gt;

After President Nixon told his family he would resign the office of the presidency, she replied, &quot;But why?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Anthony, C. S. (1991), p. 216&lt;/ref&gt; She contacted White House curator Clement Conger to cancel any further development of a new [[White House china|official china pattern]] from the Lenox China Company, and began supervising the packing of the family's personal belongings.&lt;ref&gt;Eisenhower, Julie Nixon (1986), pp. 417–419&lt;/ref&gt; On August 7, 1974, the family met in the [[Sunroom|solarium]] of the White House for their last dinner. Pat sat on the edge of a couch and held her chin high, a sign of tension to her husband.&lt;ref name=&quot;csa217&quot;&gt;Anthony, C. S. (1991), p. 217&lt;/ref&gt; When the president walked in, she threw her arms around him, kissed him, and said, &quot;We're all very proud of you, Daddy.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;csa217&quot;/&gt; Later Pat Nixon said of the photographs taken that evening, &quot;Our hearts were breaking and there we are smiling.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Eisenhower, Julie Nixon (1986), p. 424&lt;/ref&gt;

The next morning, a televised 20-minute farewell speech to the White House staff took place in the East Room, during which the President read from [[Theodore Roosevelt]]'s biography and praised his own parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historyplace.com/speeches/nixon-farewell.htm|title= Richard M. Nixon: White House Farewell|accessdate= 2007-09-23|publisher=The History Place}}&lt;/ref&gt; The First Lady could hardly contain her tears; she was most upset about the cameras, because they recorded her anguish, as they had during the 1960 election defeat. The Nixons walked onto the Executive Mansion's South Lawn with Vice President [[Gerald Ford]] and Betty Ford to ''[[Marine One]]''. As they walked, Pat, with one arm around her husband's waist and one around Betty's, said to Betty, &quot;You'll see many of these red carpets, and you'll get so you hate 'em.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Anthony, C. S. (1991), p. 218&lt;/ref&gt; The helicopter carried them to [[Andrews Air Force Base]]; from there they flew to California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=CNN|url=http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/stories/1999/08/06/nixon.resigns/|title=Nixon's resignation changed American politics forever|date=August 9, 1999|accessdate=2008-08-18|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070829175425/http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/stories/1999/08/06/nixon.resigns/ |archivedate = August 29, 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pat Nixon later told her daughter Julie, &quot;Watergate is the only crisis that ever got me down&amp;nbsp;... And I know I will never live to see the vindication.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Eisenhower, Julie Nixon (1986), p. 453&lt;/ref&gt;

== Public perception ==
[[Image:Pat Nixon reaches out to young girl.jpg|thumb|right|Pat Nixon reaches out from her limousine to a young girl during an October 1972 campaign stop in [[Atlanta]].]]
Historian Carl Sferrazza Anthony noted that ordinary citizens responded to Nixon.&lt;ref name=&quot;csa187&quot;/&gt; When a group of rural people visited the White House to present a quilt to the First Lady, many were overcome with nervousness; upon hearing their weeping, Pat hugged each individual tightly, and the tension dissipated.&lt;ref name=&quot;csa187&quot;/&gt; When a young boy doubted that the Executive Mansion was her house because he could not see the washing machine, Pat led him through the halls and up an elevator, into the family quarters and the laundry room.&lt;ref name=&quot;csa187&quot;/&gt; She mixed well with different races, and made no racial distinctions.&lt;ref name=&quot;csa197&quot;/&gt; During the Nixons' trip to China in 1972, foreign minister [[Zhou En-lai]] became so smitten with her that he gave two rare [[giant panda]]s to the ambassador as a gift from China.&lt;ref name=&quot;csa199200&quot;/&gt;

Pat Nixon was listed on the [[Gallup Organization]]'s [[Gallup's most admired man and woman poll|top-ten list of the most admired women]] fourteen times, from 1959–1962 and 1968–1979.&lt;ref name=&quot;gallup 10&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/3415/Most-Admired-Men-Women-19481998.aspx|title=Most Admired Men and Women: 1948–1998|date=December 13, 1999|accessdate=2008-10-12|publisher=Gallup Organization|author=Newport, Frank; David W. Moore and Lydia Saad}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was third in 1969, and remained at number two until 1972, when she was ranked number one as the most admired woman. She remained on the top-ten list until 1979, five years after her husband left office.&lt;ref name=&quot;gallup 10&quot;/&gt; To many, she was seen as an example of the &quot;[[American Dream]],&quot; having risen from a poor background, with her greatest popularity among the &quot;great silent majority&quot; of voters.&lt;ref name=&quot;csa201&quot;/&gt; Mary Brooks, the director of the [[United States Mint]], described the First Lady as &quot;a good example to the women of this country&amp;ndash;if they're not part of those Women's Liberation groups.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;PN is the Ultimate Good Sport&quot;/&gt; Additionally, it was the view of veteran UPI correspondent [[Helen Thomas]] that Pat &quot;was the warmest First Lady I covered and the one who loved people the most. I think newspeople who covered her saw a woman who was sharp, responsive, sensitive.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Anthony, C. S. (1991), p. 167&lt;/ref&gt;

Press accounts [[Framing (social sciences)|framed]] Nixon as an embodiment of [[Cold War]] domesticity, in stark contrast to the [[second-wave feminism]] of the time.&lt;ref&gt;Burns, Lisa (2008), pp. 107–108&lt;/ref&gt; Journalists often portrayed her as dutiful and selfless&lt;ref name=&quot;burns-110&quot;&gt;Burns, Lisa (2008), pp. 110–111&lt;/ref&gt; and seeing herself as a wife first and individual second.&lt;ref name=&quot;burns-125&quot;/&gt; ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine described her as &quot;the perfect wife and mother&amp;ndash;pressing [her husband's] pants, making dresses for daughters Tricia and Julie, doing her own housework even as the Vice President's wife.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Woman in the Cloth Coat|author=Angelo, Bonnie|accessdate=2008-08-22|date=July 5, 1993|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,978822,00.html|work=Time}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early years of her tenure as First Lady she was tagged 'Plastic Pat,' the derogatory nickname applied because, according to critics, she was always smiling while her face rarely expressed emotion&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://millercenter.org/academic/americanpresident/nixon/essays/firstlady|title=Thelma Nixon|accessdate=2008-07-25|publisher=Miller Center of Public Affairs|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.www.theracquet.net/media/storage/paper978/news/2008/03/12/Spotlight/Secrets.Will.Be.Shared.In.OneWoman.Show.Lady.Bird.Pat.Betty.Tea.For.Three.At.To-3263920.shtml|title=Secrets will be shared in one-woman show, Lady Bird, Pat &amp; Betty: Tea for Three at Toland theatre|author=Schmitz, Justin|publisher=University of Wisconsin|accessdate=2008-07-25|date=March 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and her body language made her seem reserved, and at times, artificial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wnyc.org/books/56606|title=Between You and Me|author=Wallace, Mike|accessdate=2008-08-22|publisher=WNYC Radio|year=2005 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080618213837/http://www.wnyc.org/books/56606 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some observers described Pat Nixon as &quot;a paper doll, a [[Barbie doll]]&amp;ndash;plastic, antiseptic, unalive&quot; and that she &quot;has put every bit of the energy and drive of her youth into playing a role, and she may no longer recognize it as such&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;PN is the Ultimate Good Sport&quot;/&gt;

As for the criticisms, she said, &quot;I am who I am and I will continue to be.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;PN is the Ultimate Good Sport&quot;/&gt; She portrayed some of her views on her life in a 1968 interview aboard a campaign plane with Gloria Steinem: &quot;Now, I have friends in all the countries of the world. I haven’t just sat back and thought of myself or my ideas or what I wanted to do. Oh no, I’ve stayed interested in people. I’ve kept working. Right here in the plane I keep this case with me, and the minute I sit down, I write my thank you notes. Nobody gets by without a personal note. I don’t have time to worry about who I admire or who I identify with. I’ve never had it easy. I’m not like all you ... all those people who had it easy.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;steinem&quot;/&gt;

Despite her largely demure public persona as a traditional wife and homemaker, Nixon was not as self-effacing and timid as her critics often claimed. When a news photographer wanted her to strike yet another pose while wearing an apron, she firmly responded, &quot;I think we've had enough of this kitchen thing, don't you?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Toner, Robin|title=Running Mates|work=The New York Times|date=February 2, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some journalists, such as columnist and White House Correspondent [[Robert E Thompson|Robert Thompson]] felt that Pat was an ideal balance for the 1970s; Thompson wrote that she proved that &quot;women can play a vital role in world affairs&quot; while still retaining a &quot;feminine manner.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;csa201&quot;/&gt; Other journalists felt that Pat represented the failings of the [[feminine mystique]], and portrayed her as being out of step with her times.&lt;ref name=&quot;burns-110&quot;/&gt; Those who opposed the Vietnam War identified her with the Nixon administration's policies, and, as a result, occasionally picketed her speaking events. After she had spoken to some of them, though, one student told the press that &quot;she wanted to listen. I felt like this is a woman who really cares about what we are doing. I was surprised.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Anthony, C. S. (1991), p. 182&lt;/ref&gt; Veteran CBS correspondent [[Mike Wallace (journalist)|Mike Wallace]] expressed regret that the one major interview he was never able to conduct was that of Pat Nixon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/people/2006-03-22-wallace-press-club_x.htm|title=The one big interview Mike Wallace never landed|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=2009-11-12|date=March 22, 2006|publisher=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Later life ==
[[Image:Pat nixon.jpg|thumb|right|Her official White House portrait, painted in 1978 by [[Henriette Wyeth|Henriette Wyeth Hurd]]]]
After returning to [[San Clemente, California]] in 1974 and settling into the Nixons' home, ''[[La Casa Pacifica]]'', Pat Nixon rarely appeared in public and only granted occasional interviews to the press. In late May 1975, Pat went to her girlhood town of Artesia, California (present-day [[Cerritos, California|Cerritos]]) to dedicate the [[Patricia Nixon Elementary School]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Eisenhower, Julie Nixon (1986), p. 441&quot;&gt;Eisenhower, Julie Nixon (1986), p. 441&lt;/ref&gt; In her remarks, she said, &quot;I'm proud to have the school carry my name. I always thought that only those who have gone had schools named after them.

Nixon suffered a [[stroke]] on July 7, 1976 at ''La Casa Pacifica'', which resulted in the paralysis of her entire left side.

Former First Lady [[Barbara Bush]] reflected, &quot;I loved Pat Nixon, who was a sensational, gracious, and thoughtful First Lady&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Bush, Barbara (1994), p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; and at the dedication of the Reagan Library, Bush remembered, &quot;There was one sad thing. Pat Nixon did not look well at all. Through her smile you could see that she was in great pain and having a terrible time getting air into her lungs.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Bush, Barbara (1994), p. 441&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nixons moved to a gated complex in [[Park Ridge, New Jersey]] in 1991.

== Death and funeral ==
Pat Nixon died at her New Jersey home at 5:45&amp;nbsp;am on June 22, 1993, the day after her 53rd wedding anniversary. She was 81. Her daughters and husband were by her side.

The funeral service for Pat Nixon took place in the grounds of the Richard Nixon Library in Yorba Linda, California on June 26, 1993. Speakers at the ceremony, including [[Governor of California|California Governor]] [[Pete Wilson]], Kansas senator [[Bob Dole]], and the Reverend Dr. [[Billy Graham]], eulogized the former First Lady. In addition to her husband and immediate family, former presidents [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[Gerald Ford]] and their wives, [[Nancy Reagan|Nancy]] and [[Betty Ford|Betty]], were also in attendance.&lt;ref name=&quot;PN funeral&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nixonfoundation.org/index.php?src=gendocs&amp;link=PNfuneral|title=Funeral Services of Mrs. Nixon|accessdate= 2007-10-02|year= 2005|publisher= Richard Nixon Library &amp; Birthplace Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lady Bird Johnson was unable to attend because she was in the hospital recovering from a stroke, and [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis]] did not attend either.&lt;ref name=&quot;PN funeral&quot;/&gt; President Nixon sobbed openly, profusely, and at times uncontrollably during the ceremony. A rare display of emotion from the former president, Helen McCain Smith said that she had never seen him more distraught.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Helen (1999) p. 258&lt;/ref&gt;

Pat Nixon's tombstone gives her name as &quot;Patricia Nixon&quot;, the name by which she was popularly known. Former President Nixon survived her by 10 months, dying on April 22, 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/watergate/stories/nixobit.htm|title=Richard M.

In 1994, the [[Pat Nixon Park]] was established in [[Cerritos, California]]. The site where her girlhood home stood is on the property.&lt;ref name=&quot;PN Biography: Richard Nixon Library&quot;/&gt; The Cerritos City Council voted in April 1996 to erect a statue of the former first lady, one of the few statues created in the image of a first lady.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ci.cerritos.ca.us/gallery/nixonfact.html|title=Pat Nixon Statue at the Cerritos Senior Center|year=2000|publisher=City of Cerritos|accessdate=2008-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pat has been portrayed by [[Joan Allen]] in the 1995 film ''[[Nixon (film)|Nixon]]'', [[Patty McCormack]] in the 2008 film ''[[Frost/Nixon (film)|Frost/Nixon]]'' and [[Nicole Sullivan]] in the 2009 film ''[[Black Dynamite]]''. She was sung by soprano [[Carolann Page]] in the 1987 opera ''[[Nixon in China (opera)|Nixon in China]].
