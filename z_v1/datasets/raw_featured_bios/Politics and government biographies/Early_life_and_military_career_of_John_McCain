&lt;!-- NB: THE DATES IN THIS ARTICLE ARE NON-AUTOFORMATTED --&gt;
The early life and military career of [[John McCain|John Sidney McCain III]] spans the first forty-five years of his life (1936–1981). [[John S. McCain, Jr.|McCain's father]] and [[John S. McCain, Sr.|grandfather]] were [[Admiral (United States)|admirals]] in the [[United States Navy]]. McCain was born on August 29, 1936, in the [[Panama Canal Zone]], and attended many schools growing up as his family moved among naval facilities.  McCain graduated from the [[United States Naval Academy]] in 1958.  He married the former [[Carol McCain|Carol Shepp]] in 1965; he adopted two children from her previous marriage and they had another child together.

As a [[United States Naval Aviator|naval aviator]], McCain flew [[attack aircraft]] from [[aircraft carrier|carriers]]. During the [[Vietnam War]], he narrowly escaped death in the [[1967 USS Forrestal fire|1967 ''Forrestal'' fire]]. On his twenty-third &lt;!--NB this article intentionally uses words instead of numerals for numbers like this, as permitted by [[WP:MOSNUM#Numbers as figures or words]], both for formality and to avoid awkward numeral expressions later on--&gt; bombing mission in October 1967, he was shot down over [[Hanoi]] and badly injured. He subsequently endured five and a half years as a [[prisoner of war]], including periods of [[torture]]. In 1968, he refused a [[North Vietnam]]ese offer of early release, because it would have meant leaving before other prisoners who had been held longer. He was released in 1973 after the [[Paris Peace Accords]].

Upon his return, McCain studied at the [[National War College]], commanded a large training squadron in Florida, and was appointed the Navy liaison to the U.S. Senate. He divorced his wife Carol in 1980 and married the former [[Cindy Hensley McCain|Cindy Hensley]] shortly thereafter. He retired from the Navy in 1981 as a [[Captain (United States)#U.S. Navy, U.S. Coast Guard, U.S. Public Health Service, and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|captain]].

===Early life===
[[File:Admiral McCain, wife, and sons.jpg|thumb|right|''Left-to-right:'' McCain in 1951 with his mother [[Roberta McCain|Roberta]], his brother [[Joe McCain|Joe]], and his father [[John S. McCain, Jr.]] ]]
For his first ten years, &quot;Johnny&quot; McCain (the family nickname he was given)&lt;ref name=&quot;alexander-12&quot;/&gt;  was frequently uprooted as his family, including older sister [[Sandy McCain Morgan|Sandy]] (born 1934) and younger brother [[Joe McCain|Joe]] (born 1942),&lt;ref name=&quot;timberg-bio-ch1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nw083008&quot;/&gt; followed his father to [[New London, Connecticut]], [[Pearl Harbor, Hawaii]], and other stations in the Pacific Ocean.&lt;ref name=&quot;alexander-19&quot;/&gt; Summer vacations were sometimes spent at the family's Teoc plantation,&lt;ref name=&quot;ff-21&quot;/&gt; but McCain always felt his heritage was military, not Southern.&lt;ref name=&quot;salon021500&quot;/&gt;  McCain attended whatever naval base school was available,&lt;ref name=&quot;alexander-19&quot;&gt;Alexander, ''Man of the People'', p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; often to the detriment of his education, as schools were sometimes substandard and their curricula often erratic.&lt;ref name=&quot;alexander-19&quot;/&gt;  After the 1941 [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], his father was absent for long stretches.&lt;ref name=&quot;timberg-bio-ch1&quot;/&gt;  His formal education was supplemented by the efforts of his mother, who took advantage of the family's many long-distance travels to expose him to historical and cultural sites.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt121407&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ff-103&quot;&gt;McCain, ''Faith of My Fathers'', pp. 101–103. Used to give role of mother in upbringing not fully detailed by any other source, and for direct quotation.&lt;/ref&gt; He later wrote, &quot;She taught me to find so much pleasure in life that misfortune could not rob me of the joy of living.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ff-103&quot;/&gt; A [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], she also made sure that he followed current events, although his parents avoided outward partisan affiliations due to his father's military career.&lt;ref name=&quot;wapo030200&quot;&gt;{{cite news | title=Out of the Fire, Politics Calls; Ex-POW Turns Washington Insider | author=Romano, Lois | publisher=''[[The Washington Post]]'' | date=2000-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After World War II ended, his father stayed in the Navy, sometimes working political liaison posts.&lt;ref name=&quot;timberg-bio-ch1&quot;/&gt;  The family settled in [[Northern Virginia]], and McCain attended the educationally stronger [[St. Stephen's and St. Agnes School|St. Stephen's School]] in [[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria]] from 1946 to 1949.&lt;ref name=&quot;alexander-20&quot;&gt;Alexander, ''Man of the People'', p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;  To his family, McCain had long been quiet, dependable, and courteous,&lt;ref name=&quot;timberg-bio-ch1&quot;/&gt; while at St. Stephen's he began to develop an unruly, defiant streak.&lt;ref name=&quot;alextimes&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.alextimes.com/article.asp?article=7851&amp;paper=1&amp;cat=141 | title=Episcopal fetes a favorite son | author= Arundel, John | work=[[Alexandria Times]] | date=2007-12-06 | accessdate=2007-12-07| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071222232417/http://www.alextimes.com/article.asp?article=7851&amp;paper=1&amp;cat=141| archivedate = December 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another two years were then spent following his father to naval stations;&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, ''Man of the People'', p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; altogether he attended about twenty schools during his youth.&lt;ref name=&quot;ap-wmd&quot;/&gt; He was frequently disciplined in school for fighting.&lt;ref name=&quot;ff-100&quot;&gt;McCain, ''Faith of My Fathers'', p. 100. &quot;Many of the base schools I attended were substandard institutions. Sometimes the school building was nothing more than a converted aircraft hangar. The classes mixed children of varying ages. We might have one teacher on Monday and a different one on Tuesday. On other days, we lacked the services of any teacher at all. My first purpose during my brief stay in these schools was to impress upon my classmates that I was not a person to suffer slights lightly. My second purpose was to prove myself as an athlete. When I was disciplined by my teachers, which happened regularly, it was often for fighting.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; He later wrote, &quot;The repeated farewells to friends rank among the saddest regrets of a childhood constantly disrupted by the demands of my father's career... At each new school I arrived eager to make, by means of my insolent attitude, new friends to compensate for the loss of others. At each new school I grew more determined to assert my crude individualism. At each new school I became a more unrepentant pain in the neck.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;McCain, ''Faith of My Fathers'', pp. 107–108.  Used for direct quotation.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1951, McCain enrolled at [[Episcopal High School (Alexandria)|Episcopal High School]] in Alexandria, an academically superior, all-male private boarding school with a rigorous [[honor code]], tradition of [[hazing]], and spartan living environment.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, ''Man of the People'', p. 22–24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;wapo083108&quot;/&gt;  Most of the children there were sons of wealthy Southerners, from whom McCain got a glimpse of life and career aspirations outside the Navy culture.&lt;ref name=&quot;ff-108&quot;&gt;McCain, ''Faith of My Fathers'', pp. 108–110.  Used to support McCain view of others at school.  Timberg, ''An American Odyssey'', pp. 23–24, illustrates the well-to-do Southerners part by sampling their names.&lt;/ref&gt;  Nicknamed &quot;Punk&quot; and &quot;McNasty&quot; due to his combative, fiery disposition, McCain enjoyed and cultivated that tough guy image; he also made a few friends.&lt;ref name=&quot;timberg-bio-ch1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;alextimes&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;vf0207&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.vanityfair.com./politics/features/2007/02/mccain200702 | title=Prisoner of Conscience | author=Purdum, Todd S | publisher=''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' | date=February 2007 | accessdate=2008-01-19 | authorlink=Todd Purdum}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;alexander-28&quot;&gt;Alexander, ''Man of the People'', p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;  McCain earned two [[varsity letter]]s in [[scholastic wrestling|wrestling]], excelling in the lighter [[Wrestling weight classes|weight classes]].&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, ''Man of the People'', pp. 25, 26.&lt;/ref&gt; He also played on the [[junior varsity]] [[American football|football]] team and the tennis team, and participated in the student newspaper, yearbook, and drama club.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, ''Man of the People'', p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; English teacher [[William Bee Ravenel III]], who was also his football coach, became a great influence towards his sense of learning, honor, and self-image.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/Vote2008/Story?id=4565619 | title=McCain the 'Punk' Goes Back to School | author=Ed O'Keefe | publisher=[[ABC News]] | date=2008-04-01 | accessdate=2008-04-02}} Ravenel was the only person outside McCain's family whom he sought out to talk with upon his return from being a POW in Vietnam, but Ravenel had died two years earlier.&lt;/ref&gt;  With what he later termed an &quot;undistinguished, but acceptable&quot; academic record,&lt;ref&gt;McCain, ''Faith of My Fathers'', p. 116.

Having done well on its entrance exams,&lt;ref name=&quot;timberg-bio-ch1&quot;/&gt; McCain entered the [[United States Naval Academy]] in [[Annapolis, Maryland]] in June 1954, following in the footsteps of his father and grandfather.&lt;ref name=&quot;timberg-ns-ch1&quot;&gt;Timberg, ''The Nightingale's Song'', [http://www.amazon.com/dp/product-description/0684826739 pp. 31–35.]&lt;/ref&gt;  He had neither been ordered to go there by his parents nor discussed alternatives; as he later wrote, &quot;I remember simply recognizing my eventual enrollment at the Academy as an immutable fact of life, and accepting it without comment.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;McCain, ''Faith of My Fathers'', pp. 110–111. Used to support McCain state of mind and direct quotation. Timberg, ''An American Odyssey'', p. 34, gives this formulation: &quot;And so, ... John McCain journeyed to Annapolis, raised his right hand, and marched joylessly into his future.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Ambivalent about his presence there,&lt;ref name=&quot;timberg-ns-ch1&quot;/&gt; McCain chose not to conform to the Academy's rules and some of its traditions.&lt;ref name=&quot;ff-120&quot;&gt;McCain, ''Faith of My Fathers'', pp. 120–124. &quot;In this well-ordered and timeless world, with its lofty aspirations and grim determination to make leaders and gentlemen of schoolboys, plebes who possessed minor eccentricities might be tolerated somewhat, but arrogant nonconformists encountered open hostility. Recognized as belonging in the latter category, I soon found myself in conflict with the Academy's authorities and traditions. Instead of beginning a crash course in self-improvement so that I could find a respectable place in the ranks, I reverted to form and embarked on a four-year course of insubordination and rebellion.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Each year he was given over a hundred demerits – earning him membership in the &quot;Century Club&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;az-naval&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.azcentral.com/news/specials/mccain/articles/0301mccainbio-chapter2.html |title=John McCain Report: At the Naval Academy |author=Nowicki, Dan &amp; [[Bill Muller|Muller, Bill]] |work=[[The Arizona Republic]] |date=2007-03-01 |accessdate=2007-11-10}}  Part of multi-chapter biographical profile of John McCain.

Brute physical mistreatment of prisoners was rarer than in other camps, but did occur to some Plantation prisoners; McCain received probably the worst of any.

====Solitary====
In March 1968, McCain was put into [[solitary confinement]], where he remained for two years.&lt;ref&gt;Timberg, ''An American Odyssey'', p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; Unknown to the POWs, in April 1968, Jack McCain was named [[United States Pacific Command|Commander-in-Chief, Pacific Command (CINCPAC)]] effective in July, stationed in [[Honolulu]] and commander of all U.S. forces in the Vietnam theater.&lt;ref name=&quot;hub-451&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F50F16F73E541B7B93C3A8178FD85F4C8685F9 | title=Gen.

Bai was called &quot;Cat&quot; by the POWs, who assigned often derogatory nicknames to all of the prison officials and guards.&lt;/ref&gt; offered McCain a chance to return home early.&lt;ref name=&quot;hub-451&quot;/&gt; The North Vietnamese wanted to score a worldwide propaganda coup by appearing merciful,&lt;ref name=&quot;r-k-363&quot;/&gt; and also wanted to show other POWs that members of the elite like McCain were willing to be treated preferentially.&lt;ref name=&quot;hub-451&quot;&gt;Hubbell, ''P.O.W.'', pp. 450–451.&lt;/ref&gt; McCain turned down the offer of release, due to the POWs' &quot;first in, first out&quot; interpretation of the [[Code of the U.S. Fighting Force|U.S. Code of Conduct]]:&lt;ref&gt;The Code of Conduct itself only forbade prisoners from accepting parole or special favors from the enemy. The POWs decided this meant that they could only accept release in the order they had been captured. They made an exception for those seriously sick or badly injured. One fellow prisoner told McCain he qualified under that exception, but after deliberation McCain refused nonetheless.

====Release====

McCain and other prisoners were moved around to different camps at times, but conditions over the next several years were generally more tolerable than they had been before.&lt;ref name=&quot;usnwr73&quot;/&gt; Unbeknownst to them, each year that Jack McCain was CINCPAC, he paid a Christmastime visit to the American troops in [[South Vietnam]] serving closest to the [[Vietnamese Demilitarized Zone|DMZ]]; he would stand alone and look north, to be as close to his son as he could get.&lt;ref name=&quot;ff-287&quot;&gt;McCain, ''Faith of My Fathers'', pp. 287–288. McCain states that he has received dozens of reports over the years of his father doing this.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1971, some 30–50&amp;nbsp;percent of the POWs had become disillusioned about the war, both because of the apparent lack of military progress and what they heard of the growing anti-war movement in the U.S., and some of them were less reluctant to make propaganda statements for the North Vietnamese.&lt;ref name=&quot;hub-549&quot;&gt;Hubbell, ''P.O.W.'', pp. 548–549.&lt;/ref&gt; McCain was not among them: he participated in a defiant church service&lt;ref&gt;Timberg, ''An American Odyssey'', p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; and led an effort to write letters home that only portrayed the camp in a negative light,&lt;ref&gt;Rochester and Kiley, ''Honor Bound'', p. 537.&lt;/ref&gt; and as a result spent much of the year in a camp reserved for &quot;bad attitude&quot; cases.&lt;ref name=&quot;hub-549&quot;/&gt; 

Back at the &quot;Hanoi Hilton&quot; from November 1971 onward,&lt;ref&gt;Timberg, ''An American Odyssey'', p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; McCain and the other POWs cheered [[Operation Linebacker|the resumed bombing of the north starting in April 1972]], whose targets included the Hanoi area and whose daily orders were issued by Jack McCain, knowing his son was in the vicinity.&lt;ref name=&quot;timberg-106&quot;&gt;Timberg, ''An American Odyssey'', pp. 106–107.&lt;/ref&gt; Jack McCain's tour as CINCPAC ended in September 1972,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Frankum | first=Ronald Bruce | title=Like Rolling Thunder: The Air War In Vietnam 1964-1975 | publisher=[[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]] | year=2005 | isbn=0-7425-4302-1}} p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt; despite his desire to have it extended so he could see the war to its conclusion.&lt;ref name=&quot;ff-287&quot;/&gt; The old-time POWs cheered even more during the intense [[Operation Linebacker II|&quot;Christmas Bombing&quot; campaign]] of December 1972,&lt;ref name=&quot;timberg-106&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt030473&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url= http://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F10A1EF93D591A7A93C6A91788D85F478785F9 | title=Unshakable Will to Survive Sustained P.

Altogether, McCain was held as a prisoner of war in North Vietnam for five and a half years, nearly five of them after his refusal to accept the out-of-sequence repatriation offer.

===Commanding officer===
McCain recuperated just enough to pass his flight physical and have his flight status reinstated.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kristof&quot;/&gt; In August 1974, he was assigned to the [[Replacement Air Group]] [[Attack Squadron 174 (United States Navy)|VA-174 &quot;Hellrazors&quot;]].&lt;ref name=&quot;milrec-bio&quot;/&gt; This was an [[A-7 Corsair II]] training squadron located at [[Naval Air Station Cecil Field]] in Jacksonville&lt;ref name=&quot;dict-va174&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

As commanding officer, McCain relied upon a relatively unorthodox leadership style based upon the force of his personality.&lt;ref name=&quot;bg083108&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.boston.com/news/politics/2008/articles/2008/08/31/taking_command___the_mccain_way/?page=full | title=Taking command – The McCain way | author=Helman, Scott | publisher=''[[The Boston Globe]]'' | date=2008-08-31 | accessdate=2008-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He removed personnel he thought ineffective, and sought to improve morale and productivity by establishing an informal rapport with enlisted men.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kristof&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;alexander-84&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bg083108&quot;/&gt; Dealing with limited post-Vietnam defense budgets and parts shortages,&lt;ref name=&quot;Kristof&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;alexander-84&quot;/&gt; he was forceful in demanding that respect be given the female officers just beginning to arrive into the unit.&lt;ref name=&quot;bg083108&quot;/&gt;  McCain's leadership abilities were credited with improving the unit's aircraft readiness; for the first time, all fifty of its aircraft were able to fly.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kristof&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;alexander-84&quot;/&gt; Although some operational metrics declined during the period,&lt;ref name=&quot;lat041408&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bg083108&quot;/&gt; the pilot safety improved to the point of having zero accidents.&lt;ref name=&quot;lat041408&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;alexander-84&quot;/&gt; The squadron was awarded its first-ever [[Meritorious Unit Commendation]],&lt;ref name=&quot;dict-va174&quot;/&gt; while McCain received a [[Meritorious Service Medal (United States)|Meritorious Service Medal]].&lt;ref name=&quot;milrec-citations&quot;/&gt; McCain later stated that being commanding officer of VA-174 was the most rewarding assignment of his naval career.&lt;ref&gt;McCain, ''Worth the Fighting For'', p. 13.  Used to support McCain assessment of this part of his career.&lt;/ref&gt; When his stint ended in July 1977,&lt;ref name=&quot;dict-va174&quot;/&gt; the change of command ceremony was attended by his father and the rest of his family, as well as some of his fellow POWs; speaker Admiral [[Isaac C. Kidd, Jr.]] said that John had joined Jack and Slew McCain in a place of honor in Navy tradition, a tribute that deeply moved McCain.&lt;ref name=&quot;timberg-123&quot;/&gt;

During their time in Jacksonville, the McCains' marriage began to falter.&lt;ref name=&quot;timberg-ns-239&quot;&gt;Timberg, ''The Nightingale's Song'', p. 239.&lt;/ref&gt;  McCain had extramarital affairs;&lt;ref name=&quot;timberg-ns-239&quot;/&gt; he was seen with other women in social settings and developed a reputation among his colleagues for womanizing.&lt;ref name=&quot;bg083108&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;One VA-174 legal officer and her colleague approached the base chaplain about McCain's behavior. See &quot;Taking command – The McCain way&quot;. There were also widespread rumors at the time that some of the affairs were with women who were subordinates under his command, which McCain later flatly denied. See ''The Nightingale's Song'', p. 239.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of McCain's activity with other women occurred when he was off-duty after routine flights to [[Marine Corps Air Station Yuma]] and [[Naval Air Facility El Centro]].&lt;ref name=&quot;timberg-ns-239&quot;/&gt;  McCain later said, &quot;My marriage's collapse was attributable to my own selfishness and immaturity more than it was to Vietnam, and I cannot escape blame by pointing a finger at the war. The blame was entirely mine.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;az-arizona&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.azcentral.com/news/specials/mccain/articles/0301mccainbio-chapter5.html |title=John McCain Report: Arizona, the early years |author=Nowicki, Dan and [[Bill Muller|Muller, Bill]] |publisher=''[[The Arizona Republic]]'' |date=2007-03-01 |accessdate=2007-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; His wife Carol later stated that the failure was not due to her accident or Vietnam and that &quot;I attribute [the breakup of our marriage] more to John turning 40 and wanting to be 25 again than I do to anything else.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;timberg-ns-240&quot;&gt;Timberg, ''The Nightingale's Song'', p. 240. Timberg also observed that, &quot;McCain was no different from most veterans of the war. As he went through life, Vietnam kept scrambling onstage and chewing up the scenery no matter how often he thought he had written it out of the script.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; John McCain's biographer, Robert Timberg, believes that &quot;Vietnam did play a part, perhaps not the major part, but more than a walk-on.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;timberg-ns-240&quot;/&gt; According to John McCain, &quot;I had changed, she had changed. People who have been apart that much change.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;timberg-ns-240&quot;/&gt;

===Senate liaison, divorce, and second marriage===
McCain had thought about entering politics since his return from Vietnam,&lt;ref name=&quot;wapo030200&quot;/&gt; although 1964 had been the only time in his life he had ever voted.&lt;ref name=&quot;wapo030200&quot;/&gt; In 1976, he briefly thought of running for the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] from Florida;&lt;ref name=Frantz/&gt; he had the support of some local figures in Jacksonville, but was convinced by other Republican Party leaders that he did not have sufficient political experience, funding, or popular support to defeat longtime [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] incumbent [[Charles Edward Bennett|Charles E. Bennett]].&lt;ref name=&quot;wapo030200&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;wapo101308&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Scheiber&quot;/&gt;  He did work so hard for [[Ronald Reagan]]'s [[Republican Party (United States) presidential primaries, 1976|1976 Republican primary campaign]] that his base commander reprimanded him for being too politically active for his naval position.&lt;ref name=&quot;bg083108&quot;/&gt;

As his tenure with VA-174 was ending, McCain was assigned to a low-profile desk job within the [[Naval Air Systems Command]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bg083108&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;timberg-126&quot;/&gt;  [[Chief of Naval Operations]] Admiral [[James L. Holloway III]] thought this assignment a waste of McCain's social talents,&lt;ref name=&quot;timberg-126&quot;&gt;Timberg, ''An American Odyssey'', pp. 126–128.&lt;/ref&gt; and instead in July 1977 McCain was appointed to the Senate Liaison Office within the Navy's [[Office of Legislative Affairs (United States Navy)|Office of Legislative Affairs]]&lt;ref name=&quot;milrec-bio&quot;/&gt; (an assignment Jack McCain had once held).&lt;ref name=Frantz&gt;{{cite news | author=Frantz, Douglas | url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9404E5DD1430F932A15751C0A9669C8B63 | title=The Arizona Ties: A Beer Baron and a Powerful Publisher Put McCain on a Political Path | publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' | date=2000-02-21 | accessdate=2006-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The office's role mostly consisted of providing [[Electoral district|constituent]] service and acting as a facilitator among legislators, the Department of Defense, and lobbyists.&lt;ref name=&quot;timberg-126&quot;/&gt; McCain later said the liaison job represented &quot;[my] real entry into the world of politics and the beginning of my second career as a public servant&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;az-return&quot;/&gt; McCain's lively personality and knowledge of military matters made his post in the [[Russell Senate Office Building]] a popular gathering spot for senators and staff.&lt;ref name=&quot;timberg-126&quot;/&gt; He also frequently escorted congressional delegations on overseas trips, where he arranged entertaining side escapades.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt052908&quot;/&gt; McCain was influenced by senators of both parties, and formed an especially strong bond with [[John Tower]] of Texas, the ranking member of the [[Senate Armed Services Committee]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt052908&quot;/&gt; During 1978 and 1979, McCain played a key behind-the-scenes role in gaining congressional funding for a new [[supercarrier]] against the wishes of the [[Carter administration]] and [[U.S. Secretary of the Navy|Navy Secretary]] [[W. Graham Claytor Jr.]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Kristof&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Timberg, ''An American Odyssey'', pp. 132–134.&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1979, McCain was promoted to [[Captain (United States)#U.S. Navy, U.S. Coast Guard, U.S. Public Health Service, and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|captain]],&lt;ref name=&quot;milrec-bio&quot;/&gt; and became Director of the Senate Liaison Office.&lt;ref name=&quot;milrec-citations&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;timberg-126&quot;/&gt;  During McCain's time there, the Senate Liaison Office enjoyed one of its few periods of high influence.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scheiber&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.tnr.com/politics/story.html?id=0fd7470d-a41f-4d9e-9328-fd079b476a0a | title=Made Man | author=Scheiber, Noam | publisher=''[[The New Republic]]'' | date=2008-08-20 | accessdate=2008-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[After describing social friendship with Reagans following POW return] &quot;My divorce from Carol, whom the Reagans loved, caused a change in our relationship. Nancy, for whom Carol now worked in the White House, was particularly upset with me and treated me on the few occasions we encountered each other after I came to Congress with a cool correctness that made her displeasure clear... [Ronald Reagan was more friendly to him] Nevertheless, we weren't social friends any longer... I had, of course, deserved the change in our relationship, and I knew it... From her kindness and my good luck, Nancy and I recovered our friendship long ago and remain friends to this day [2002].&quot; No detailed account of Nancy Reagan's side of this is known, although she stated in March 2008: &quot;John McCain has been a good friend for over thirty years.&quot;  See [http://www.reaganlibrary.com/pressrelease.asp?press_id=133 &quot;Statement by Mrs. Ronald Reagan Endorsing Senator John McCain for President of the United States&quot;] (2008-03-25).&lt;/ref&gt; The same happened with most of McCain's other friends, who were eventually won over by the force of his personality and his frequent expressions of guilt over what had happened.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kristof&quot;/&gt;

Around the end of 1980, McCain decided to retire from the Navy.&lt;ref name=&quot;wtff-9&quot;&gt;''Worth the Fighting For'', pp. 9–10.
