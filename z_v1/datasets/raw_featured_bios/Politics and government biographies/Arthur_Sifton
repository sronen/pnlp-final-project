'''Arthur Lewis Watkins Sifton''', [[Queen's Privy Council for Canada|PC]], [[King's Counsel|KC]] (October 26, 1858 – January 21, 1921) was a Canadian politician who served as the [[List of premiers of Alberta|second]] [[Premier of Alberta]] from 1910 until 1917 and as a minister in the [[Government of Canada]] thereafter.  Born in [[Ontario]], he grew up there and in [[Winnipeg]], where he became a lawyer.  He subsequently practiced law with his brother [[Clifford Sifton]] in [[Brandon, Manitoba|Brandon]], [[Manitoba]], where he was also active in municipal politics.  He moved west to [[Prince Albert, Saskatchewan|Prince Albert]] in 1885 and to [[Calgary]] in 1889.  There he was elected to the [[4th North-West Legislative Assembly|4th]] and [[5th North-West Legislative Assembly|5th]] North-West Legislative Assemblies; he later served as a minister in the government of Premier [[Frederick W. A. G. Haultain]].  In 1903, the federal government, at the instigation of his brother who was now one of its ministers, made Arthur Sifton the Chief Justice of the Northwest Territories.  When Alberta was created out of a portion of the Northwest Territories in 1905, Sifton became its first chief justice.

In 1910, the government of Alberta Premier [[Alexander Cameron Rutherford]] was embroiled in the [[Alberta and Great Waterways Railway scandal]].  The Liberal Lieutenant-Governor of Alberta, [[George Bulyea]], determined that for the sake of the [[Liberal Party of Alberta]] Rutherford had to be pushed aside in favour of a new Premier; when other prominent Liberals declined it, the position was offered to Sifton.  As Premier, he smoothed over the divisions in the party that had caused and been exacerbated by the railway scandal.  He made attempts to break with the Rutherford railway policy; when these were rebuffed by the courts, he adopted a course similar to Rutherford's.  He unsuccessfully pursued the transfer of rights over Alberta's natural resources from the federal government, which had retained them by the terms of Alberta's provincehood.

While Sifton was Premier, the [[United Farmers of Alberta]] rose as a political force.  Sifton tried to accommodate many of their demands: his government constructed [[agricultural college]]s, incorporated a farmer-run [[grain elevator]] cooperative, and implemented a municipal system of [[hail]] insurance.  Outside of the agricultural sphere, the UFA was instrumental in the Sifton government's implementation of some [[direct democracy]] measures (which resulted in [[prohibition in Canada|prohibition]]) and the extension of the vote to women.

During the [[conscription crisis of 1917]], Sifton supported the [[Conservative Party of Canada (historical)|Conservative]] Prime Minister, [[Robert Borden]], in his attempt to impose [[conscription]] to help win the [[First World War]].  He backed the creation of a [[Unionist Party (Canada)|Union]] government composed of Conservatives and pro-conscription Liberals.  In 1917 he left provincial politics and became a minister in this government.  Over the next three and a half years he served briefly in four different ministries and was a delegate to the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference of 1919]].  He died in [[Ottawa]] in January 1921 after a brief illness.

==Early life==
Arthur Sifton was born October 26, 1858, in [[Arva, Ontario|Arva]], [[Ontario]], to [[John Wright Sifton]] (1833&amp;ndash;1912) and Catherine &quot;Kate&quot; Watkins (1832&amp;ndash;1909).&lt;ref&gt;Perry, Craig 2006, pg. 243&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hall 20&quot;&gt;Hall 20&lt;/ref&gt;  He was the older brother of [[Clifford Sifton]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hall 20&quot;/&gt;  He attended public schools across southern Ontario, culminating with a boys' school in [[Dundas, Ontario|Dundas]] and high school in [[London, Ontario|London]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hall 20&quot;/&gt;  His father was a devout [[Methodist]] and a staunch [[Reform Party (pre-Confederation)|Reformer]] and, later, [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hall 20&quot;/&gt;  These allegiances permeated his home life; the Sifton household was often visited by clergy, laity, businessmen, lawyers, and politicians.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hall 20&quot;/&gt;  In 1874&lt;ref name=&quot;Hall 20&quot;/&gt; or 1875,&lt;ref name=&quot;DCB&quot;/&gt; John Sifton won contracts for preliminary construction work on the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] (CPR) and moved the family to [[Winnipeg]], where Arthur completed high school at [[Wesley College, Winnipeg|Wesley College]].&lt;ref name=&quot;leg bio&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.assembly.ab.ca/lao/library/premiers/sifton.htm |title=The Honourable Arthur L. Sifton, 1910-17 |publisher=Legislative Assembly of Alberta |accessdate=2008-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Following his graduation, he and Clifford attended [[Victoria University in the University of Toronto|Victoria College]], then located in [[Cobourg, Ontario|Cobourg]], Ontario.  In 1880, he graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hall 20&quot;/&gt;  While in Cobourg, he was not a devoted student: he skipped many classes, and was judged by his classmates to be &quot;intellectually, morally, physically and erratically preeminent in virtue and otherwise, especially otherwise&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;DCB&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?&amp;id_nbr=8365 |title=Sifton, Arthur Lewis Watkins |work=Dictionary of Canadian Biography |accessdate=2008-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Calgary officials.jpg|thumb|left|Sifton, front row right, as Calgary's city solicitor, 1892]]Upon graduation, Arthur Sifton returned to Winnipeg to [[Articled clerk|article]] with Albert Monkman until 1881, when he followed his father to [[Brandon, Manitoba|Brandon]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hall 21&quot;&gt;Hall 21&lt;/ref&gt;  John hoped to take advantage of a local [[real estate]] boom; nominally, Arthur was running a Brandon branch of Monkman's law firm, though he had not yet finished his articling and was accordingly unqualified to practice law.&lt;ref name=&quot;DCB&quot;/&gt;  On September 20, 1882, he married Mary Deering of Cobourg; the pair would have two children, Nellie Louise Sifton (born August 1883) and Lewis Raymond St Clair Sifton (born February 1898).&lt;ref name=&quot;DCB&quot;/&gt;  In 1883, he wrote and passed his [[bar exam]] and joined Clifford's Brandon law firm, now styled Sifton and Sifton.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hall 21&quot;/&gt;

[[University of Alberta]] historian David Hall describes the next phase of Sifton's life as &quot;shrouded in mystery&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hall 21&quot;/&gt;  For reasons that are not clear, in 1885 Sifton dissolved his partnership with his brother and moved his family to [[Prince Albert, Saskatchewan|Prince Albert]]. (Hall speculates that the brothers had a falling out, but notes that their later working relationship appears to have been amicable.)&lt;ref name=&quot;Hall 22&quot;&gt;Hall 22&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1885, Prince Albert's prospects did not appear bright, as it had been bypassed by the CPR line.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hall 22&quot;/&gt;  Regardless, Sifton practiced law and was in 1885 made a [[notary public]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hall 22&quot;/&gt;  Three years later, he earned a [[Master of Arts (postgraduate)|Master of Arts]] from Victoria College and a [[Bachelor of Laws]] from the [[University of Toronto]].&lt;ref name=&quot;leg bio&quot;/&gt;  In 1889, he relocated again, to [[Calgary]]; there is some suggestion that this move was for the sake of his wife's health.&lt;ref name=&quot;DCB&quot;/&gt;  There he opened a law office, worked in the office of the city solicitor, and became a partner in the firm of Sifton, Short, and Stuart.  At one point he was a [[crown prosecutor]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hall 22&quot;/&gt;  In 1892, he was appointed [[Queen's Counsel]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hall 22&quot;/&gt;

===Early political career===

Sifton's first foray into politics was in 1878, when he campaigned for the introduction of [[Prohibition in Canada|prohibition]] under the auspices of the [[Canada Temperance Act]] in the Manitoba electoral districts of [[Lisgar (electoral district)|Lisgar]] and [[Marquette (Canadian electoral district)|Marquette]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DCB&quot;/&gt;  His first bid for elected office took place in 1882, when he was elected to Brandon's first city council.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hall 21&quot;/&gt;  He was re-elected in 1883, and did not seek re-election at the conclusion of this second term,&lt;ref name=&quot;DCB&quot;/&gt; though he did briefly consider running for mayor before concluding that he had insufficient support to be elected.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hall 21&quot;/&gt;  He also served on the local school board.&lt;ref name=&quot;DCB&quot;/&gt;  When his brother Clifford became [[Wilfrid Laurier]]'s Minister of the Interior in November 1896, Sifton advised him on Liberal Party affairs in western Canada.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hall 22&quot;/&gt;  This advice included suggested [[patronage]] appointments, one of which was an unimplemented proposal that Arthur himself be appointed chief justice of the [[Northwest Territories]] (a position that did not at the time exist).&lt;ref name=&quot;Hall 22&quot;/&gt;  In 1898, Sifton re-entered politics—Hall speculates to increase his chances at a judgeship—by challenging [[Robert Brett]], the long-time Member of the [[Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories]] for [[Banff (N.W.T. electoral district)|Banff]], in the [[Northwest Territories general election, 1898|1898 territorial election]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hall 22&quot;/&gt;  Election day returns showed Sifton with a plurality of thirty-six votes, but by the time contested ballots were dealt with this had turned into a majority of two votes for Brett.&lt;ref name=&quot;DCB&quot;/&gt;  Sifton successfully challenged this result in court, and in the ensuing by-election he defeated Brett by a comfortable margin.&lt;ref name=&quot;DCB&quot;/&gt;  One oft-repeated anecdote from the campaign involved a campaign forum for which Brett was late.  After giving his own speech, Sifton offered to give the still-absent Brett's speech as well, since he had heard it so many times.&lt;ref&gt;Hall 22–23&lt;/ref&gt;  He did so, and when Brett eventually arrived to give a speech nearly identical to the one Sifton had given on his behalf he was puzzled by the audience's amusement.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hall 23&quot;&gt;Hall 23&lt;/ref&gt;

Having defeated Brett, Sifton was immediately one of the area's most prominent Liberals, and was named president of the [[District of Alberta]] Liberals shortly thereafter.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hall 23&quot;/&gt;  In 1901 Clifford Sifton appointed [[James Hamilton Ross]], Northwest Territories Treasurer and Minister of Public Works, [[Commissioner of Yukon]].  It fell to Northwest Territories Premier [[Frederick William Gordon Haultain]] to fill the ensuing vacancy and, to preserve the delicate non-partisan balance of his administration, he had to pick a successor who was, like Ross, a Liberal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hall 23&quot;/&gt;  The role fell to Sifton.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hall 23&quot;/&gt;  Soon after his appointment, Clifford offered him his sought-after position of Northwest Territories Chief Justice; Arthur declined on the basis of his recently-assumed ministerial duties, but made it clear that he was still interested in receiving it eventually.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hall 23&quot;/&gt;

As minister, Sifton had to cope with increasing expenses and with grants from the federal government that did not keep pace.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hall 23&quot;/&gt;  He dealt with this through support for territorial autonomy—the creation of one or more new provinces from the Northwest Territories.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hall 23&quot;/&gt;  Campaigning on this position, he was re-elected in the [[Northwest Territories general election, 1902|1902 territorial election]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hall 23&quot;/&gt;  Months later, however, T. H. Maguire retired as territorial chief justice, and this time Sifton accepted his brother's offer of the position.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hall 23&quot;/&gt;  He resigned his political offices in January 1903.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hall 23&quot;/&gt;

===Career as a jurist===

Despite the accusations of [[nepotism]] that greeted his appointment on January 3, 1903, Sifton fast became a well-respected judge.&lt;ref name=&quot;DCB&quot;/&gt;  He served as chief justice of the Northwest Territories until September 16, 1907, when the [[Alberta Court of Queen's Bench|Supreme Court of Alberta]] was established, whereupon he headed this new court, sitting in Calgary as the first Chief Justice of Alberta.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hall 23&quot;/&gt;  He was notoriously difficult for barristers to read: he generally heard arguments expressionlessly smoking a cigar, and it was as a judge that he first acquired his long-time nickname of the [[Sphinx]] for his inscrutability.&lt;ref name=&quot;DCB&quot;/&gt;  In one trial, he sat apparently vigorously taking notes during both sides' lengthy closing arguments and, once they concluded, immediately delivered his judgment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hall 24&quot;&gt;Hall 24&lt;/ref&gt;  The bewildered lawyers wondered what he had been writing down, since he had obviously made up his mind before closing arguments; once Sifton had left the courtroom, they found their answer in the form of page after page covered with the judge's signature.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hall 24&quot;/&gt;  He rarely recorded his ''[[ratio decidendi]]'' but, despite this, few of his decisions were overturned on appeal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hall 24&quot;/&gt; It has also been argued that his fellow judges had difficulty ruling on appeals from his decisions specifically because he rarely provided reasons. Much of his work was in [[criminal law]], dealing especially with theft of livestock (in which cases he generally delivered a sentence of three years [[hard labour]], severe by the standards of the day).&lt;ref name=&quot;Hall 24&quot;/&gt; By the end of his judicial career, he had convicted as many Americans as Canadians. His rulings were generally concerned with practicalities rather than legal theory, based more on social morality than legal precedent, and he did not establish any important [[stare decisis|precedents]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DCB&quot;/&gt;

In 1907, Sifton was one member of a three-member commission assigned to investigate labour unrest between coal miners and mine operators.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 48&quot;/&gt;  His colleagues were mining executive Lewis Stockett and miners' union executive William Haysom.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 48&quot;&gt;Thomas 48&lt;/ref&gt;  Miners' demands included increased wages,&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 47&quot;&gt;Thomas 47&lt;/ref&gt; a reduction in working hours to eight per day (from ten), the posting of mine inspection reports, the isolated storage of explosives, the use of non-freezing explosives, and semi-monthly rather than monthly pay.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 48&quot;/&gt;  The mine operators objected to this last point on the basis that many miners did not report to work the day after payday, and it was thus desirable to keep paydays to a minimum.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 48&quot;/&gt;  The commission recommended that children under sixteen should not be allowed to work in mines, that inspectors should post their reports, that mine sites should have bath houses, and that ventilation inspection should be improved.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 48&quot;/&gt; It also recommended that Albertans keep a supply of coal on hand during the summer for winter use.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 48&quot;/&gt; The commission was silent on wages (except to say that these should not be fixed by legislation), the operation of [[company stores]] (a sore point among the miners), and the [[incorporation (business)|incorporation]] of mine unions (which was recommended by mines but opposed by the unions).&lt;ref&gt;Thomas 48–49&lt;/ref&gt; It made no recommendation about working hours, but Premier [[Alexander Rutherford]]'s government legislated an eight hour day anyway.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 49&quot;&gt;Thomas 49&lt;/ref&gt;

He resigned from the bench on May 25, 1910 to become Premier.

==Premier==
===Ascension and cabinet-building===

In 1910, the [[Alberta Liberal Party|Liberal]] government of [[Alexander Cameron Rutherford]] was embroiled in the [[Alberta and Great Waterways Railway scandal|Alberta and Great Waterways (A&amp;GW) Railway scandal]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hall 24&quot;/&gt;  Accusations of favouritism by the government towards the Alberta and Great Waterways Railway had split the Liberal Party, and Rutherford's ability to remain at its head was in doubt.&lt;ref name=&quot;DCB&quot;/&gt;  Lieutenant-Governor [[George Bulyea]], a Liberal who had reluctantly asked Rutherford to form a government in 1905, saw his doubts about the Premier's leadership skills validated and quietly began looking for candidates to replace him and save the Liberal Party.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 87&quot;&gt;Thomas 87&lt;/ref&gt;  Several possibilities—including [[William Henry Cushing]], [[Peter Talbot (politician)|Peter Talbot]], and [[Frank Oliver (politician)|Frank Oliver]]—were considered and either rejected or found to be uninterested in the job.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 88&quot;&gt;Thomas 88&lt;/ref&gt;  As early as March 14, Bulyea had concluded that Sifton might be &quot;the only permanent solution&quot;, though it was not until May that the Lieutenant-Governor was able to secure Rutherford's agreement to resign and the agreement of both major factions in the Liberal caucus to accept Sifton as Premier.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 89&quot;&gt;Thomas 89&lt;/ref&gt;  Even up until the last minute, Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs) loyal to [[Charles Wilson Cross]]—the province's Attorney-General and a staunch Rutherford ally—threatened to scuttle the arrangement unless Cross was kept on as attorney-general, to which Sifton refused to agree.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 90&quot;&gt;Thomas 90&lt;/ref&gt;  On May 26, Rutherford resigned and Arthur Sifton became the second Premier of Alberta.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hall 25&quot;&gt;Hall 25&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sifton in Wetaskiwin.jpg|thumb|left|Sifton addressing a political meeting in [[Wetaskiwin]], August 1910]]One of his first challenges was to craft a cabinet satisfactory to all factions; this he did by excluding the leaders of all sides.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 91&quot;&gt;Thomas 91&lt;/ref&gt;  He himself took the portfolios of Public Works and Provincial Treasurer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 90&quot;/&gt;  [[Charles R. Mitchell]], who like Sifton had been a judge during the scandal and had accordingly played no part in it, became Minister of Education and Attorney-General.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 90–91&quot;&gt;Thomas 90–91&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Archibald J. McLean]] was named Provincial Secretary.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 90&quot;/&gt;  His support for the insurgents (though not as one of their leaders) was offset by the continuation of Rutherford's Agriculture Minister [[Duncan Marshall]], who had played no particular role during the scandal but had remained loyal to Rutherford.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 90–91&quot;/&gt;  To the consternation of the opposition [[Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta|Conservatives]], Bulyea [[prorogued]] the legislation before this new government's strength could be tested by a [[vote of confidence]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 91&quot;/&gt;  Still, its acceptance by the Liberal caucus can be measured by the fact that only one member, [[Ezra Riley]], resigned in protest.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 93&quot;&gt;Thomas 93&lt;/ref&gt;  Riley objected to the exclusion from cabinet of insurgency leader W. H. Cushing;&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 93&quot;/&gt; after his resignation he ran as an independent Liberal in the ensuing by-election, but was defeated by Sifton supporter [[Archibald J. McArthur]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 94&quot;&gt;Thomas 94&lt;/ref&gt;  As time began to heal old wounds, Sifton expanded his cabinet to include several of the old adversaries: in February 1912 Cross was re-instated as Attorney-General and rebel leader [[John R. Boyle]] was made Minister of Education (Mitchell, who had previously held both of these posts, was transferred to the Public Works portfolio).&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 125&quot;&gt;Thomas 125&lt;/ref&gt;  The other new additions to cabinet—[[Malcolm McKenzie]] as Provincial Treasurer and [[Charles Stewart (Canadian politician)|Charles Stewart]] in the new position of Minister of Municipal Affairs&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 125&quot;/&gt;—had voted with the Rutherford government during the scandal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 113&quot;&gt;Thomas 113&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 84&quot;&gt;Thomas 84&lt;/ref&gt;

Another early challenge for the new Premier was to win a seat in the [[Legislative Assembly of Alberta]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 93&quot;/&gt;  Although he lived and worked in Calgary,&lt;ref name=&quot;Hall 25&quot;/&gt; his first cabinet was composed mostly of southern members (McLean represented [[Lethbridge District]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 90&quot;/&gt; Marshall represented [[Olds (provincial electoral district)|Olds]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 90&quot;/&gt; and Mitchell would soon be elected in [[Medicine Hat (provincial electoral district)|Medicine Hat]]),&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 94&quot;/&gt; so Sifton had [[Archibald Campbell (Alberta politician)|Archibald Campbell]] resign his [[Vermilion (provincial electoral district)|Vermilion]] seat and sought election there.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 93&quot;/&gt;  Sifton made few promises during the campaign, though he did identify as his priorities &quot;the development of [Alberta's] agricultural and mining resources and the transportation facilities&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hall 25&quot;/&gt;  Despite accusations by the Conservatives that the Liberals bought &quot;the foreign vote&quot; with beer, whiskey, and tobacco, he won a comfortable majority.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hall 25&quot;/&gt;

===Railway policy===

Before resigning, Rutherford's government had called a [[Royal Commission]] into the Alberta and Great Waterways affair, and this commission had not reported by the time that Sifton took office.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 95&quot;&gt;Thomas 95&lt;/ref&gt;  Between that and the proroguing of the legislature, the new Premier enjoyed a calm that lasted until November 10, when the legislature reconvened.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 95&quot;/&gt;  Conservative leader [[Edward Michener]] attacked the government's [[speech from the throne]] for failing to commit itself on railway policy and attacked Sifton for failing to call a general election or seek the confidence of the legislature during his first half year in office.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas 107–108&lt;/ref&gt;  In the meantime, Sifton was facing a breach in his own party on the railway question.  Many Liberals from the south of the province, including Sifton himself, felt inclined to abandon the construction of &quot;pioneer&quot; railways (such as the Alberta and Great Waterways Railway) designed to hasten the settlement of the province's emptier areas, and concentrate only on those connecting major population centres.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 109&quot;&gt;Thomas 109&lt;/ref&gt;  Members from the north of the province, who comprised most of the Liberal caucus, disagreed, and were vehement in their insistence that the A&amp;GW be built.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas 110–111&lt;/ref&gt;  Even among this latter group there were divisions: some Liberals agreed with the Conservatives that the railway should be directly built by the government, while others, including Cross, favoured a partnership with a &quot;responsible company&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 111&quot;&gt;Thomas 111&lt;/ref&gt;  These divisions were not calmed by the release of the commission's report, whose majority condemned Rutherford and Cross for poor judgment even as it concluded that there was insufficient evidence to find that they had engaged in improper behaviour.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 106&quot;&gt;Thomas 106&lt;/ref&gt;

It was against this backdrop that Sifton announced his government's policy with respect to the Alberta and Great Waterways Railway Company.  Because it had failed to meet its construction obligations, Sifton introduced legislation to confiscate the proceeds of the sale of government-guaranteed [[Bond (finance)|bonds]] sold to finance the railway's construction.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 110&quot;&gt;Thomas 110&lt;/ref&gt;  He gave no indication of how the money, which was being held in trust by several banks, would be used.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 110&quot;/&gt;  Cross's faction of (primarily northern) Liberals opposed the bill on the grounds that it did not commit the government to using the money to construct the railway,&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 110&quot;/&gt; while the Conservatives opposed it as an unjustified confiscation of private property.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas 111–112&lt;/ref&gt;  As Conservative [[R. B. Bennett]] said,
&lt;blockquote&gt;[The bill is] an act of confiscation, an act such as never before has been carried out in the British Empire, an act such as has few equals in the pages of history.  Similar acts have been carried out, once in Nicaragua and Virginia, and in South Carolina and only in times of war or revolution ... In my opinion the bargain was an improvident one, but that does not justify confiscation ... I did not think the new road would pay.  But it is a new doctrine that because a bargain did not pay it should be repudiated and one should become a repudiator of bargains and a confiscator of private rights.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 112&quot;&gt;Thomas 112&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In speaking of A&amp;GW President William Clarke (an American), Bennett went on to say &quot;Clarke I despise but Clarke I am bound to respect, because this province gave him a right by charter and if I know the United States I do not think it will allow this province to take his property without due process of the law.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 112&quot;/&gt;  The Conservatives, however, had not been expected to support the legislation; the real question was whether Sifton could command enough support among Liberals to pass it.  After all, during the Alberta and Great Waterways crisis only nine months earlier, a legislature of very similar makeup had endorsed the Rutherford government's handling of railway policy by a vote of twenty-three votes to fifteen; would Sifton's bill, effectively a repudiation of the Rutherford policy, convince enough Liberals to change sides?&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 112&quot;/&gt;  The answer came in December, when the bill passed [[third reading]] by a vote of twenty-five votes to fourteen.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 112&quot;/&gt;  Nine Liberals had reversed themselves and saved Sifton's government, though both Cross and Rutherford were among those to vote against it.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas 112–113&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite calls from Clarke for the federal government to use its power of [[disallowance and reservation|reservation]] to stop the legislation, Bulyea granted [[royal assent]] December 16.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 111&quot;/&gt;  Sifton, in his capacity as provincial treasurer, immediately tried to access the money; the [[Royal Bank of Canada|Royal]], [[Toronto-Dominion Bank|Dominion]], and [[Union Bank of Halifax|Union]] banks, where the funds were deposited, refused payment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 113&quot;/&gt;  Attorney-General Mitchell sued the banks; on November 4, 1911, Justice [[Charles Stuart (politician)|Charles Allen Stuart]] of the [[Alberta Court of Queen's Bench|Supreme Court of Alberta]] found in the government's favour.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 121&quot;&gt;Thomas 121&lt;/ref&gt;  The Royal Bank appealed this ruling and unsuccessfully petitioned the federal government to use its powers of [[disallowance]] to strike down the provincial act.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 121&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hall 27&quot;&gt;Hall 27&lt;/ref&gt;  In the meantime, Sifton announced a new railway policy that would see eight new lines constructed by private companies with the assistance of provincial [[loan guarantees]], including several pioneer lines; this policy, in its resemblance to the Rutherford policy, met with the approval of the Cross faction, and the Liberals were once more united.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas 121–122&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1912, Justice Stuart's ruling was upheld by the Supreme Court of Alberta ''[[en banc]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 127&quot;&gt;Thomas 127&lt;/ref&gt;  Again the Royal Bank appealed, and on January 31, 1913, the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]], which was at the time Canada's highest judicial authority, found for the Royal Bank, ruling that the provincial government did not have the right to confiscate money raised outside of the province.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas 127–128&lt;/ref&gt;  On September 22 Sifton announced new management of the AG&amp;W agreeable to the bondholders, the government, and the banks.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 148&quot;&gt;Thomas 148&lt;/ref&gt;  The Conservatives protested that other companies were prepared to construct the railroad for less than the sum agreed on with the A&amp;GW, to which Sifton replied that the Privy Council's ruling meant that the government could not use the money raised to deal with any other company.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas 149–150&lt;/ref&gt;  The Conservatives [[filibuster]]ed the legislation and moved a series of amendments (including one calling for the scheme to be put to [[referendum]]), but the Liberals voted unanimously in its favour.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 150&quot;&gt;Thomas 150&lt;/ref&gt;  The Alberta and Great Waterways saga had reached its end, and Sifton's caucus was never more united.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 150&quot;/&gt;

===Natural resources===
When Alberta and [[Saskatchewan]] had been made provinces in 1905, the federal government had retained control over their lands and natural resources, which made the new provinces unique in Canada.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 8&quot;&gt;Thomas 8&lt;/ref&gt;  The Rutherford government had acquiesced to this state of affairs: because the terms of confederation had been drawn up by the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] government of [[Sir Wilfrid Laurier]], it was natural for the provincial Liberal Party to cast itself as their defender.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas 25–26&lt;/ref&gt;  In this capacity, Rutherford pointed to the $375,000 per year that the provincial government received from the federal government as compensation.&lt;ref&gt;Babcock 27–28&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1910, however, Liberal MLA [[Alwyn Bramley-Moore]] (who was a staunch provincial rights advocate and who many years later would be called &quot;Alberta's first [[Alberta separatism|separatist]]&quot; by the ''[[Edmonton Journal]]'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.canada.com/edmontonjournal/news/blog/thomson.html?post=1939 |work=Edmonton Journal |date=November 11, 2005 |title=Remembrance Day |first=Graham |last=Thompson |accessdate=2008-01-12}} {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; moved a resolution calling on the Sifton government to &quot;take such steps as may be deemed necessary to acquire the control of all such natural resources as are of purely local concern&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas 114–115&lt;/ref&gt;  Sifton responded that it was already the intention of his government to begin negotiations with the federal government to this end.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 115&quot;&gt;Thomas 115&lt;/ref&gt;  He asserted &quot;I have always believed ... that we should administer our mines and timber.  The question is not now whether we would like to control our natural resources, but what is the best way to get them.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hall 30&quot;&gt;Hall 30&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Arthur Lewis Sifton.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Sifton at the coronation of [[George V of the United Kingdom]], 1910]]Soon after, Sifton made a trip east and spoke on the subject of provincial resource control to the [[Canadian Club of Toronto]], where his points were well-received.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hall 30&quot;/&gt;  In May 1910, Sifton and Saskatchewan Premier [[Thomas Walter Scott|Walter Scott]] met with Laurier in [[Ottawa]], where he was able to secure the Prime Minister's agreement that if the Liberals were re-elected in the [[Canadian federal election, 1911|1911 federal election]] they would transfer to Alberta control over its resources.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hall 30&quot;/&gt;  This election was fought primarily on the issue of [[Reciprocity (Canadian politics)|reciprocity]], which was popular in Alberta, and Sifton campaigned actively for Laurier (distinguishing himself from his brother, who broke with Laurier on reciprocity).&lt;ref&gt;Thomas 120–121&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite winning six of Alberta's seven seats, the Liberals were defeated by [[Robert Borden]]'s [[Conservative Party of Canada (historical)|Conservatives]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 116&quot;&gt;Thomas 116&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, this did not appear to be a problem: Borden had long called for the transfer of resource control to the prairie provinces,&lt;ref name=&quot;Hall 30&quot;/&gt; but when Sifton and Scott raised the issue with the new Prime Minister, little action resulted.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hall 30&quot;/&gt;  Borden stalled for some time, and it emerged that he did not wish to buoy the fortunes of the provincial Liberal parties by giving them the political victory that would result from the transfer of resource control.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hall 30&quot;/&gt;  Upon the outbreak of the [[First World War]], the issue fell out of public prominence, and it was not until 1930 that Alberta would achieve this long-time objective.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hall 30&quot;/&gt;

===Agricultural policy===
Sifton's time as Premier corresponded with the rise of the [[United Farmers of Alberta]] (UFA) as a political force.  Formed in 1909 by the merger of the Society of Equity and the Alberta Farmers' Association,&lt;ref&gt;Rennie 34–35&lt;/ref&gt; the UFA would later become a political party and govern Alberta from 1921 until 1935.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=A1ARTA0008226 |title=United Farmers of Alberta |publisher=The Canadian Encyclopedia |accessdate=2008-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During Sifton's tenure, however, its entry into direct politics was still several years away, and it confined itself to advocating for farmers' interests.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rennie 89&quot;&gt;Rennie 89&lt;/ref&gt;  In a province in which 50,004 people voted in the [[Alberta general election, 1909|1909 provincial election]],&lt;ref name=&quot;EA&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elections.ab.ca/pastelections.html |title=Alberta provincial election results |publisher=Elections Alberta |accessdate=2008-01-13| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080211122446/http://www.elections.ab.ca/pastelections.html| archivedate = February 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; the UFA claimed an initial membership of 2,100, which climbed to 9,400 in 1913.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rennie 51&quot;&gt;Rennie 51&lt;/ref&gt;  Moreover, these figures did not include the many farmers who were active in the organization without paying dues; the UFA was a force to be reckoned with, and Sifton took notice.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rennie 51&quot;/&gt;

The UFA's first provincial victory took place in 1910, and involved the construction of [[agricultural college]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hall 31&quot;&gt;Hall 31&lt;/ref&gt;  While Premier, Alexander Rutherford, always a stalwart ally of the [[University of Alberta]], approved a plan to locate Alberta's first agricultural college on the university's campus, in Rutherford's home town of [[Strathcona, Alberta|Strathcona]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hall 31&quot;/&gt;  At the 1910 UFA convention, a resolution proposed putting the college in southern Alberta, though it was supplanted by an [[Edward Michener]] motion calling for the UFA's leadership to consult with the province on a mutually amenable location.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rennie 37&quot;&gt;Rennie 37&lt;/ref&gt;  After consultation with the UFA, Sifton agreed that, in addition to the college, agricultural schools would be built around the province, and that farmers would be guaranteed representation on the college's board.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rennie 38&quot;&gt;Rennie 38&lt;/ref&gt;  In fact, Sifton held off on the establishment of the college all together in favour of the creation of seven demonstration farms in different regions of the province.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hall 31&quot;/&gt;  In 1912, the government announced the creation of agricultural colleges in connection with three of these farms (all of them in the [[electoral district|ridings]] of provincial cabinet ministers: Duncan Marshall's [[Olds, Alberta|Olds]], [[Claresholm, Alberta|Claresholm]] in Archibald McLean's Lethbridge District, and Sifton's [[Vermilion, Alberta|Vermilion]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Hall 31&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 134&quot;&gt;Thomas 134&lt;/ref&gt;

Another of the UFA's policies called for a single tax on land to replace most other forms of taxation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rennie 42&quot;&gt;Rennie 42&lt;/ref&gt;  The farmers hoped that this tax would help replace [[tariff]]s, which made it harder for them to export their produce,&lt;ref name=&quot;Rennie 42&quot;/&gt; and shift the tax burden towards cities, where land values were higher.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rennie 44&quot;&gt;Rennie 44&lt;/ref&gt;  They also called for a surtax on undeveloped land to curb [[land speculation]] and encourage the sale of land to farmers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rennie 44&quot;/&gt;  On this demand too, Sifton acted: in 1911–1912 he allowed municipalities to levy [[property tax]]es and required that rural municipalities tax only land, and in 1914 he imposed a provincial tax on undeveloped land to discourage land speculation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rennie 44&quot;/&gt;  Other UFA-motivated acts by Sifton's government included abandonment of a 1912 plan to privatize [[hail]] insurance (it instead enacted a municipal insurance scheme) and the prohibition of contract clauses that allowed farm machinery companies to avoid responsibility for their products.&lt;ref&gt;Rennie 45–46&lt;/ref&gt;  Perhaps the most important piece of farm legislation passed by Sifton's government was the incorporation of the Alberta Farmers' Co-operative Elevator Company, Limited (AFCEC).&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 135&quot;&gt;Thomas 135&lt;/ref&gt;  Though the UFA's first preference was for government ownership and operation of [[grain elevators]], which Sifton refused,&lt;ref name=&quot;Rennie 46&quot;&gt;Rennie 46&lt;/ref&gt; it gladly accepted the AFCEC, in which only farmers could hold shares and which was supported by provincial startup loans.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 135&quot;/&gt;

Hall writes that &quot;the Sifton government in effect responded wholly or in part to practically every resolution from the 1913 UFA convention related to provincial powers.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hall 31&quot;/&gt;  This rate could not sustain itself, however, especially once the First World War began to occupy an increasing share of the province's attention and resources.  During the 1916 legislative session, the government acted on only two of the UFA's twenty-three demands of that year — one to allow the sale of [[gopher (animal)|gopher]] poison by UFA locals, and one dealing with [[Livestock branding|brand]] inspection.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rennie 128&quot;&gt;Rennie 128&lt;/ref&gt;

===Democratic and moral reform===

It was not only in agricultural policy that the UFA spread its influence.  The organization had a strong [[progressivism|progressive]] bent, and advocated [[direct democracy]], [[women's suffrage]], and [[Prohibition in Canada|prohibition]].  In response to the first of these, Sifton in 1913 introduced the ''Direct Democracy Act''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 136&quot;/&gt;  Though it went somewhat less far than the UFA would have liked—for example, it made no provision for [[recall election|recall]] of elected officials—it did allow for Albertans to call a referendum directly by submitting a [[petition]] including the names of eligible voters totalling ten percent of the votes cast in the previous provincial election, including at least eight percent in each of eighty-five percent of the province's ridings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 136&quot;&gt;Thomas 136&lt;/ref&gt;  The Conservatives were on record as supporting direct democracy, and could therefore criticize the bill only in detail.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 136&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Arthur Sifton.jpg|thumb|left|Sifton's official portrait, by V. A. Long]]The large number of signatures required (beginning with the [[Alberta general election, 1913|1913 election]], 9,399 signatures were required)&lt;ref name=&quot;EA&quot;/&gt; meant that only an issue capable of galvanizing much of the province could lead to a referendum.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rennie 126&quot;&gt;Rennie 126&lt;/ref&gt;  Prohibition was such an issue.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rennie 126&quot;/&gt;  The Conservatives were advocates of such a referendum (during the [[1st Alberta Legislative Assembly]], Conservative [[Cornelius Hiebert]] had advocated prohibition or, failing that, a government monopoly on alcohol sales), but Sifton and his Liberals were less enthusiastic.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas 138–139&lt;/ref&gt;  They knew the boon to government coffers that liquor sales represented, and were not eager to alienate either the UFA's moral reformers or the province's hoteliers and saloonkeepers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 139&quot;&gt;Thomas 139&lt;/ref&gt;  Once the referendum legislation was in place, however, its advocates wasted no time: in 1914 the legislature accepted a petition bearing 23,656 names, and duly called a referendum on the subject.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 158&quot;&gt;Thomas 158&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Alberta prohibition referendum]] passed resoundingly, and the legislature passed the [[Prohibition Act]] in the spring of 1916.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas 159–160&lt;/ref&gt;  Initially the new Act appeared successful: in 1917 there were 5,151 convictions for all crimes across Alberta, as compared to an annual average of 12,706 over the preceding four years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 163&quot;&gt;Thomas 163&lt;/ref&gt;  By the time the province's enforcement of the act was exposed as being either deliberately lax or merely futile, depending on the observer, Sifton had left office.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 163&quot;/&gt;

Alberta's women, especially those of the UFA-affiliated United Farm Women of Alberta, were active in the province's moral reform movement.&lt;ref&gt;Rennie 118–119&lt;/ref&gt;  They were also active in seeking the vote: in 1913 a delegation of them arrived at the legislature demanding the vote; Sifton asked them &quot;did you ladies wash up your luncheon dishes before you came down here to ask me for the vote?  If you haven't you'd better go home because you're not going to get any votes from me.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hall 34–35&lt;/ref&gt;  In October 1914 another delegation arrived, bearing the signatures of 40,000 people.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 164&quot;/&gt;  At that time, the Premier agreed that most traditional objections to extension of the franchise were &quot;played out&quot;, but expressed concern at the increases that would result to the cost of elections and uncertainty at whether most of the province's women actually wanted suffrage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 164&quot;&gt;Thomas 164&lt;/ref&gt;  In February 1915 a larger delegation arrived at the legislature and occupied the MLAs' seats,&lt;ref name=&quot;Hall 35&quot;&gt;Hall 35&lt;/ref&gt; demanding that the franchise be extended quickly enough to allow women to vote in the upcoming prohibition referendum; an angry Sifton refused and suggested to the women that if they wanted the vote, they should contact their MLAs and promise that they would use their votes to re-elect them, &quot;which is after all one of the strongest way in which you can appeal to male human nature, as represented in the legislature.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hall 35&quot;/&gt;  Even so, he committed to raising the issue in the legislature after the referendum.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 165&quot;&gt;Thomas 165&lt;/ref&gt;  On September 17, 1915, he told UFA President James Speakman that he had given instructions for the preparation of a statute &quot;placing men and women in Alberta on the basis of absolute equality so far as Provincial matters are concerned.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 165&quot;/&gt;  True to his word, he introduced legislation in the spring of 1916 giving women the vote in all provincial and municipal elections.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 165&quot;/&gt;  The Conservatives supported it enthusiastically, and only [[St. Albert (provincial electoral district)|St. Albert]] MLA [[Lucien Boudreau]] voted against it (though [[Ribstone (provincial electoral district)|Ribstone]] Liberal [[James Gray Turgeon]] admitted that he was supporting his leader's legislation against his own convictions).&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 165&quot;/&gt;

===Style and political success===

Arthur Sifton's political style was to remain aloof and detached, and to say no more than necessary; this cemented his reputation as &quot;the Sphinx&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hall 38&quot;&gt;Hall 38&lt;/ref&gt;  He was authoritarian and, while he inspired respect, he was not loved; historian L. G. Thomas credits him with holding the Liberal Party together through his strength, but blames him for failing to heal its underlying divisions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 180&quot;&gt;Thomas 180&lt;/ref&gt;  Sifton was originally selected as Premier in the hopes that he would lead the Liberal Party to continued dominance of provincial politics in Alberta.  His success in this regard was mixed: although he led the party to victory in the [[Alberta general election, 1913|1913]] and [[Alberta general election, 1917|1917]] elections, its majorities declined each time.&lt;ref name=&quot;EA&quot;/&gt; Moreover, his victories were marred by accusations of unethical electoral tactics.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas 137, 142&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hall 33&quot;/&gt;

In advance of the 1913 election, government-sponsored [[Redistribution (election)|redistribution]] legislation increased the number of ridings from 41 to 56 and left them of unequal size;&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 137&quot;/&gt; only 103 votes were cast in [[Clearwater (provincial electoral district)|Clearwater]] in its first election.&lt;ref&gt;Mardon 51&lt;/ref&gt;  The Liberals argued that a model of straight [[representation by population]] was inappropriate in a province in which some districts were growing far more quickly than others.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 137&quot;&gt;Thomas 137&lt;/ref&gt;  David Hall has called the bill a &quot;flagrant [[gerrymander]]&quot; and the ensuing election the &quot;crookedest election in Alberta history&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hall 33&quot;&gt;Hall 33&lt;/ref&gt;  There being few policy differences separating the Liberals from the Conservatives, the electoral battle was instead an organizational one, with the two sides accusing one another of bribing ethnic minorities with alcohol and importing elections workers from outside of the province to bribe, intimidate, and mislead rural voters.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 142&quot;&gt;Thomas 142&lt;/ref&gt;  The Conservatives also accused the Liberals of using government-paid civil servants to campaign for their re-election.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 142&quot;/&gt;  Sifton, not confident of victory in his own riding, sought election both there and in [[Macleod (provincial electoral district)|Macleod]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hall 33&quot;/&gt;  In the event, he was defeated there but retained his Vermilion riding.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hall 33&quot;/&gt;

Since the 1917 election was held in the throes of the [[First World War]], it was unlikely to be an election as usual—indeed, the Conservatives favoured prolonging the legislature until the end of the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 169&quot;&gt;Thomas 169&lt;/ref&gt;  Sifton was not willing to go that far, but did introduce legislation to re-elect, by act of the legislature, the twelve MLAs who had enlisted in the armed forces—of these, seven were Liberals and five Conservatives; one of the Liberals, [[Joseph Stauffer]] of [[Didsbury (provincial electoral district)|Disbury]], was killed in action before the legislation took effect.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 169&quot;/&gt;  The Conservatives supported this legislation, though they later cast aspersions on it by suggesting that of the Liberals re-elected, two had never left Canada.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 169&quot;/&gt;  A second piece of election legislation provided for two special MLAs to be elected by the 38,000 Albertans serving overseas; the Conservatives protested that two MLAs was not sufficient for such a large number of voters, especially since Clearwater by this time had only 116 eligible voters.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 169&quot;/&gt;

After a sedate election that the Liberals won by a slightly reduced majority,&lt;ref&gt;Thomas 178–179&lt;/ref&gt; Sifton announced his resignation as Premier to enter federal politics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 179&quot;&gt;Thomas 179&lt;/ref&gt;  Sifton's 1917 victory would be the Liberals' last: his successor, [[Charles Stewart (Canadian politician)|Charles Stewart]], would lose the [[Alberta general election, 1921|1921 election]] to the newly-political UFA.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 204&quot;&gt;Thomas 204&lt;/ref&gt;  In Thomas's estimation, Sifton would have faced a similar fate in 1917 if the UFA had run candidates then.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 207&quot;&gt;Thomas 207&lt;/ref&gt;

==Federal politics and death==

[[File:Arthur Sifton federal.jpg|thumb|right|Sifton as a federal cabinet minister]]The [[Conscription crisis of 1917]] divided the Liberal Party of Canada, and this division extended into the provincial camp.  Liberal leader Laurier opposed Prime Minister Borden's proposal to implement wartime [[conscription]], a stand which was denounced by many Liberals, especially those from outside of [[Quebec]], as unpatriotic.  Borden reached out to these Liberals to propose a [[coalition government]], to be led by him and to include Conservatives and pro-conscription Liberals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hall 37&quot;/&gt;  Clifford Sifton was a major broker of the resulting deal and, when the question of a suitable Alberta representative in the cabinet came up, Arthur Sifton was a natural choice.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 170&quot;&gt;Thomas 170&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1914, he had announced Alberta's willingness to sacrifice &quot;its last dollar and its last man&quot;, and was a staunch supporter of conscription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hall 36&quot;&gt;Hall 36&lt;/ref&gt;  He had agreed by August 1917 to join the [[Unionist Party (Canada)|Unionist]] government, and resigned as Premier in October.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hall 37&quot;/&gt;

Although he was only 58 at the time of joining government, his health was suffering.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hall 37&quot;/&gt;  He was short of energy, and required a car to transport him even the several hundred meters from his Ottawa residence to the [[Canadian House of Commons]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hall 37&quot;/&gt;  Because of this, he was given relatively undemanding portfolios: Minister of Customs and Inland Revenue, Minister of Public Works, and Secretary of State.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hall 37&quot;/&gt;  Hall has called him among the least visible of Borden's ministers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hall 37&quot;/&gt;  Because of his health and his short tenure in each position, he made very little impact.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hall 37&quot;/&gt;  Despite this, he was highly-regarded by his colleagues, including Borden, who later stated &quot;there was no one in whose judgment I placed firmer reliance&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hall 37&quot;&gt;Hall 37&lt;/ref&gt;  He was appointed to the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Imperial Privy Council]] in the 1920 New Year Honours,&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette |issue=31712 |date=30 December 1919 |startpage=2 |supp=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; entitling him to the style &quot;The Right Honourable&quot;.

Sifton was one of four Canadian delegates to the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference of 1919]], along with Borden, [[Charles Doherty]], and [[George Eulas Foster]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hall 37&quot;/&gt;  There, he acted as vice chair of the Commission on Ports, Waterways, and Railways, and served on the Commission on Aerial Navigation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hall 37&quot;/&gt;  In these capacities he argued for Canada to be treated as an independent state at a time when its foreign policy was still managed by the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hall 37&quot;/&gt;  On June 28, 1919, Arthur Sifton was one of two Canadians to sign the [[Treaty of Versailles]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hall 38&quot;/&gt; 

In January 1921, Sifton became ill and took leave from his duties for a few days.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hall 38&quot;/&gt;  After recovery seemed imminent, his condition suddenly worsened and he died January 21 at the age of 62.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hall 38&quot;/&gt;  Borden mourned the loss of &quot;a public servant of the highest ability and of the most conspicuous patriotism&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hall 39&quot;&gt;Hall 39&lt;/ref&gt;
