Cordray was elected Attorney General of Ohio in November 2008 to fill the remainder of the unexpired term ending January 2011. On November 2, 2010, Cordray lost his bid for re-election to former Lt. Governor and U.S. Senator [[Mike DeWine]]. Prior to his Attorney General position, Cordray served as the [[Ohio State Treasurer]] and as [[treasurer]] of [[Franklin County, Ohio]]. He has also previously served as a member of the [[Ohio House of Representatives]] (1991&amp;ndash;1993) and as the first [[Solicitor General of Ohio|Ohio state solicitor]] (1993&amp;ndash;1994).

Cordray was a [[Marshall Scholar]] at [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]], 1981&amp;ndash;83.  Later, he was editor-in-chief of the ''[[University of Chicago Law Review]]'' and subsequently served as a [[law clerk]] for Judge [[Robert Bork]] on the U.S. Court for the District of Columbia Circuit (1986 - 87 term), and after that, Justice [[Anthony Kennedy]] of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]]. In 1987 he became an undefeated five-time ''[[Jeopardy!]]'' champion.

After the 1990 census, the district he represented in the Ohio House of Representatives in 1992 was [[redistricting|merged]] with another district held by a Democratic incumbent. Cordray decided to run for a [[United States House of Representatives]] seat but did not win the election. The following year he was appointed by the Ohio attorney general as the first Ohio state solicitor. His experience as Solicitor led to his appearance before the United States Supreme Court to argue six cases, where he had previously clerked.  Following Republican victories in Ohio statewide elections in 1994, Cordray left his appointed position and entered the private practice of law. He was elected Franklin County treasurer in 2002. While in private practice he unsuccessfully ran for Ohio attorney general in 1998 and [[United States Senate|United States senator]] in 2000.  Cordray won re-election as Franklin County treasurer before being elected state treasurer in 2006.

While in private practice in 1993, Cordray co-wrote a [[legal brief]] for the [[Anti-Defamation League]], in a campaign supported by Ohio's attorney general, for the reinstatement of Ohio's [[hate crime]] laws.

In 1993 the [[government of Ohio]] created the office of state solicitor general to handle the state's appellate work.

Cordray contested the [[Ku Klux Klan]]'s right to erect a cross at the [[Ohio Statehouse]] after the state's Capitol Square Review and Advisory Board denied the Klan's request during the 1993 Christmas holiday. He argued that the symbolic meaning of the cross was different from the [[Christmas tree]] and [[Menorah (Hanukkah)|menorah]], which the state permits. The Klan prevailed in the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on December 21, 1993, and erected a 10-foot (3&amp;nbsp;m) cross the following day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CLDB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=10E0DACFE0B58900&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=0D0CB579A3BDA420|title=Klan May Raise Cross, Judge Rules|accessdate=2008-10-19|date=1993-12-22|publisher=[[Newsbank]]|work=[[The Columbus Dispatch]]|author=Edwards, Randall}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:ABJB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0EB62FEFCEA9BFC2&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=0D0CB579A3BDA420|title=Judge OKS New Cross By Klan Display To Be Erected Outside Statehouse|accessdate=2008-10-19|date=1993-12-22|publisher=[[Newsbank]]|work=[[Akron Beacon Journal]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same board denied the Klan a permit to rally on [[Martin Luther King Day]] (January 15, 1994) due to the group's failure to pay a $15,116 bill from its Oct. 23 rally and its refusal to post a bond to cover expenses for the proposed rally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:ABJB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0EB62FF59399D75B&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=0D0CB579A3BDA420|title=State Stops Klan Rally On King's Birthday Board Cites Unpaid Bill For Earlier Event, Plus Concern For Public Safety|accessdate=2008-10-19|date=1994-01-07|publisher=[[Newsbank]]|work=[[The Plain Dealer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the same 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned the decision to deny the 1994 permit, the state chose not to appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CPDB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0F807C33C868C2E3&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=0D0CB579A3BDA420|title=State Won't Appeal KKK Holiday Rally|accessdate=2008-10-19|date=1994-01-07|publisher=[[Newsbank]]|work=[[The Plain Dealer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year the Klan again applied to erect a cross for the Christmas holiday season, and the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals concurred with the prior ruling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CLDB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=10E081C85D311D30&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=0D0CB579A3BDA420|title=KKK Wins Round in Statehouse Cross Dispute|accessdate=2008-10-19|date=1994-07-26|publisher=[[Newsbank]]|work=[[The Columbus Dispatch]]|author=Edwards, Randall}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States Supreme Court did not agree to hear arguments on the topic until a few weeks after Cordray resigned from his solicitor general position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CLDB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=10E07CE5EE3B6748&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=0D0CB579A3BDA420|title=High Court Takes KKK Cross Case - U.S. Justices Expected to Decide By July on Statehous Display|accessdate=2008-10-19|date=1995-01-14|publisher=[[Newsbank]]|work=[[The Columbus Dispatch]]|author=Lowe, Roger K.}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his resignation in 1994 he several times represented the federal government in the U.S. Supreme Court: two of Cordray's appearances before were by appointment of the Democratic [[Bill Clinton]] [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] and two were by the Republican [[George W.

Ohio statewide offices are regularly contested every four years in the [[United States midterm election|midterm election]] years. 2008 is [[Classes of United States Senators|Class 2]] senatorial election year, and Ohio is a state with class 1 and class 3 senators. Thus, the Attorney General race was the only non-presidential race in the 2008 election aside from contests for two seats on the Ohio Supreme Court. Cordray garnered 56.74% of the vote, while his challengers, Republican Mike Crites and Independent Robert Owens, received 38.43% and 4.83%, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sos.state.oh.us/SOS/elections/electResultsMain/2008ElectionResults/attGen110408.aspx|title=Ohio Attorney General - Unexpired Term Ending January 9, 2011: November 4, 2008|accessdate=December 28, 2008 |publisher=[[Ohio Secretary of State]]|work=www.sos.state.oh.us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tenure===
;Bank of America
In July 2009, [[Denny Chin]], a [[judge]] on the [[United States district court]] for the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York|Southern District of New York]], granted lead [[plaintiff]] status to a group of five public [[pension funds]] for investor [[class-action]] lawsuits against the [[Bank of America Corporation]] over its [[Bank of America#Acquisition of Merrill Lynch|acquisition]] of [[Merrill Lynch &amp; Company]]. The claim is that Bank of America misled investors about Merrill's financial well-being prior to the January 1, 2009 acquisition despite awareness that Merrill was headed toward a significant loss that amounted to $15.84 billion in its fourth quarter.&lt;ref name=PFtLSAB/&gt; The suit also alleges that significant [[WIKT:bonus|bonus]] payments were concealed.&lt;ref name=AGRCfciBoAa&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cleveland.com/business/index.ssf/2009/09/cordray_files_complaint_in_ban.html|title=Attorney General Richard Cordray files complaint in Bank of America action|accessdate=2009-11-01|date=2009-09-28|work=Cleveland Ohio Business News|publisher=Cleveland Live, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the filing the five funds had filed individual complaints, but the September filing of an amended complaint joined the actions with Cordray representing the lead plaintiff.&lt;ref name=BSbFOM/&gt;  The amended complaint includes details about conversations and communications between Bank of America and Merrill Lynch executives that were revealed in media reports, congressional testimony and investigations by the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]].&lt;ref name=AGRCfciBoAa/&gt; The filing is an attempt to recover losses endured when Bank of America's share price fell after the transaction.  The damages are sought from Bank of America, individual executives, the bank's [[board of directors]], including any insurers that cover directors' legal liabilities.&lt;ref name=BSbFOM/&gt; Among the specifics of the claim are that Bank of America agreed to allow Merrill Lynch to pay as much as $5.8 billion in undisclosed year-end discretionary bonuses to executives and employees and that Bank of America and Merrill Lynch executives were aware of billions of dollars in losses suffered by Merrill Lynch in the two months before the merger vote but failed to disclose them.&lt;ref name=AGRCfciBoAa/&gt;

In April 2010, he reached a 1 billion dollar settlement with [[American International Group]] (AIG), one of four remaining named defendants (along with [[Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies|Marsh &amp; McLennan]], [[The Hartford|Hartford Financial Services]] and [[Chubb Corp.]]), in a 2007 [[antitrust]] case regarding business practices between 2001 and 2004.  The settlement is to be divided among 26 Ohio universities, cities and schools.  [[Zurich Financial Services]] settled in 2006. Cordray believes that Marsh was the organizing company for the illegal practices and notes that a trial could commence in 2011.

==Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (2012-Present)==
On Wednesday, December 15, 2010, Special Advisor to President [[Barack Obama]], [[Elizabeth Warren]] announced that she had selected Richard Cordray to lead the enforcement arm of the newly-created [[United States Consumer Financial Protection Bureau]] (CFPB). She added that &quot;Richard Cordray has the vision and experience to help us build a team that ensures every lender in the marketplace is playing by the rules.&quot; In announcing his appointment to this position Cordray also stated that he intends to once again, run for statewide office in Ohio in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dispatch.com/live/content/local_news/stories/2010/12/15/15-cordray.html?sid=101|title=Cordray to lead U.S. consumer agency enforcement|accessdate=2010-12-15|date=2010-12-15|work=[[The Columbus Dispatch]]|author=Staff}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/columbus/news/2010/12/15/bloomberg-cordray-going-to-washington.html|title=Cordray taking top post with federal consumer protection bureau|accessdate=2011-02-10|date=2010-12-15|publisher=[[American City Business Journals, Inc.]]|author=Burns, Matt}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cleveland.com/consumeraffairs/index.ssf/2010/12/outgoing_ohio_attorney_general.html|title=Outgoing Ohio Attorney General Cordray to go to Consumer Financial Protection Bureau|accessdate=2011-02-10|date=2010-12-15|work=[[The Plain Dealer]]|author=Harris, Sheryl}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cordray described the opportunity to ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' as a chance to resume &quot;...in many ways doing on a 50-state basis the things I cared most about as a state attorney general, with a more robust and a more comprehensive authority.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703507804576130370862263258.html?mod=googlenews_wsj|title=Warning Shot On Financial Protection |accessdate=2011-02-10|date=2011-02-09|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|author=Eaglesham, Jean}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On July 17, Cordray was selected over Warren as the head of the entire CFPB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/18/business/former-ohio-attorney-general-picked-to-lead-consumer-agency.html|title=Former Ohio Attorney General Picked to Lead Consumer Agency|accessdate=2011-07-17|date=2011-07-17|work=[[The New York Times]]|author=Appelbaum, Binyamin}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, his nomination was immediately in jeopardy because 44 Senate Republicans had previously vowed to derail any nominee in order to push for a decentralized structure to the organization.  This was part of a pattern of conflict between Republicans in the Senate and the Obama administration that had led to record numbers of blocked and failed nominations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/19/business/dodd-frank-under-fire-a-year-later.html|title=Dodd-Frank Under Fire a Year Later|accessdate=2011-07-22|date=2011-07-18|work=[[The New York Times]]|author=Wyatt, Edward}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/richard-cordray-and-the-cfpb-let-the-nominee-speak/2011/07/20/gIQAGEQcQI_story.html|title=Richard Cordray and the CFPB: Let the nominee speak|accessdate=2011-07-22|date=2011-07-20|work=[[The Washington Post]]|author=Shakir, Faiz}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 21, Senator [[Richard Shelby]] wrote an [[op-ed]] article for ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' affirming continued opposition (that went back to a May 5 letter to the President) to a centralized structure, noting that both the [[Securities Exchange Commission]] and [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]] had executive boards and that the CFPB should be no different.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111903554904576457931310814462.html|title=The Danger of an Unaccountable 'Consumer-Protection' Czar: The SEC and FDIC are led by boards.

On January 4, 2012, a White House communications director announced in a tweet that Obama would be giving Cordray a [[recess appointment]] to the post, bypassing the Senate and installing Cordray.&lt;ref name=SbCOtbsn/&gt;&lt;ref name=DROtNCaCAC/&gt;&lt;ref name=BSOACC/&gt; The move was criticized by Republican senators, who argued that Congress had not officially been in recess, and that Obama did not have the authority to bypass Congressional approval.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/mcconnell-obama-cordray-approach-is-arrogant-2012-01-04?link=MW_latest_news|title=McConnell: Obama Cordray approach is 'arrogant'|accessdate=2012-01-05|date=2012-01-04|work=[[MarketWatch]]|author=Orol, Ronald D.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for the [[The New Republic|New Republic]], [[Timothy Noah]], a supporter of Cordray, wrote, &quot;As someone who strongly supported a recess appointment for Richard Cordray to run the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, I'm confused as to why President Obama chose to act today...
