'''Edwin Porch Morrow''' (November 28, 1877{{spaced ndash}}June 15, 1935) was an [[United States|American]] politician who served as the [[List of Governors of Kentucky|40th]] [[Governor of Kentucky]] from 1919 to 1923. He was the only [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] elected to this office between 1907 and 1927. He championed the typical Republican causes of his day, namely equal rights for [[African-American]]s and the use of force to quell violence. Morrow had been schooled in his party's principles by his father, [[Thomas Z. Morrow]], who was its candidate for governor in 1883, and his uncle, [[William O. Bradley]], who was elected governor in 1895. Both men were founding members of the Republican Party in Kentucky.

After rendering non-combat service in the [[Spanish–American War]], Morrow graduated from the [[University of Cincinnati Law School]] in 1902 and opened his practice in [[Lexington, Kentucky|Lexington]], Kentucky. He made a name for himself almost immediately by securing the acquittal of a black man who had been charged with murder based on an extorted confession and perjured testimony. He was appointed [[United States Attorney|U.S. District Attorney]] for the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky|Eastern District of Kentucky]] by President [[William Howard Taft]] in 1910 and served until he was removed from office in 1913 by President [[Woodrow Wilson]]. In 1915, he ran for governor against his good friend, [[Augustus O. Stanley]]. Stanley won the election by 471 votes, making the 1915 contest the closest gubernatorial race in the state's history.

Morrow ran for governor again in 1919. His opponent, [[James D. Black]], had ascended to the governorship earlier that year when Stanley resigned to take a seat in the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]]. Morrow encouraged voters to &quot;Right the Wrong of 1915&quot; and ran on a [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive]] platform that included [[women's suffrage]] and quelling [[Mass racial violence in the United States|racial violence]]. He charged the Democratic administration with corruption, citing specific examples, and won the general election in a landslide. With a friendly legislature in 1920, he passed much of his agenda into law including an anti-[[lynching]] law and a reorganization of state government. He won national acclaim for preventing the lynching of a black prisoner in 1920. He was not hesitant to remove local officials who did not prevent or quell mob violence. By 1922, Democrats regained control of the [[Kentucky General Assembly|General Assembly]], and Morrow was not able to accomplish much in the second half of his term. Following his term as governor, he served on the United States Railroad Labor Board and the Railway Mediation Board, but never again held elected office. He died of a heart attack on June 15, 1935, while living with a cousin in [[Frankfort, Kentucky|Frankfort]].

==Early life==
Edwin Morrow was born to Thomas Zanzinger and Virginia Catherine (Bradley) Morrow in [[Somerset, Kentucky|Somerset]], Kentucky, on November 28, 1877.&lt;ref name=hay152&gt;Hay, p. 152&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nga&gt;&quot;Kentucky Governor Edwin Porch Morrow&quot;. National Governors Association&lt;/ref&gt; He and his twin brother, Charles, were the youngest of eight children.&lt;ref name=jillson22&gt;Jillson, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; His father was one of the founders of the Republican Party in Kentucky and an unsuccessful candidate for governor in 1883.&lt;ref name=harrison655&gt;Harrison in ''The Kentucky Encyclopedia'', p. 655&lt;/ref&gt; His mother was a sister to [[William O'Connell Bradley]], who was elected the first Republican governor of Kentucky in 1895.&lt;ref name=powell86&gt;Powell, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; 

Morrow's early education was in the public schools of Somerset.&lt;ref name=powell86 /&gt; At age 14, he entered preparatory school at [[St. Mary's College (Kentucky)|St. Mary's College]] near [[Lebanon, Kentucky|Lebanon]], Kentucky.&lt;ref name=jillson24&gt;Jillson, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; He continued there throughout 1891 and 1892.&lt;ref name=jillson24 /&gt; From there, he enrolled at Cumberland College (now the [[University of the Cumberlands]]) in [[Williamsburg, Kentucky]], and distinguished himself in the debating society.&lt;ref name=hay152 /&gt; He was also interested in sports, playing [[Halfback (American football)|halfback]] on the [[American football|football]] team and [[Left fielder|left field]] on the baseball team.&lt;ref name=jillson25&gt;Jillson, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; 

On June 24, 1898, Morrow enlisted as a [[Private (rank)|private]] in the 4th Kentucky Infantry Regiment for service in the [[Spanish–American War]].&lt;ref name=hay152 /&gt;&lt;ref name=powell86 /&gt;&lt;ref name=tapp376&gt;Tapp, p. 376&lt;/ref&gt; He was first stationed at [[Lexington, Kentucky]], and later trained at [[Anniston, Alabama]].&lt;ref name=jillson27&gt;Jillson, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; Due to a bout with [[typhoid fever]], he never saw active duty, and mustered out as a [[second lieutenant]] on February 12, 1899.&lt;ref name=cotterill&gt;Cotterill in ''Dictionary of American Biography''&lt;/ref&gt; In 1900, he matriculated for the fall semester at the [[University of Cincinnati Law School]].&lt;ref name=jillson27 /&gt; He graduated with a [[Bachelor of Laws]] degree in 1902.&lt;ref name=hay152 /&gt;

Morrow opened his practice in Lexington.&lt;ref name=hay152 /&gt; He established his reputation in one of his first cases&amp;mdash;the trial of William Moseby, a black man accused of murder.&lt;ref name=hay152 /&gt; Moseby's first trial had ended in a [[hung jury]], but because the evidence against him included a confession (which he later recanted), most observers believed he would be convicted in his second trial.&lt;ref name=jillson30&gt;Jillson, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; Unable to find a defense lawyer for Moseby, the judge in the case turned to Morrow, who as a young lawyer was eager for work.&lt;ref name=jillson30 /&gt; Morrow proved that his client's testimony had been extorted; he had been told that a lynch mob waited outside the jail for him, but no such mob had ever existed.&lt;ref name=jillson31&gt;Jillson, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; Morrow further showed that other testimony against his client was false.&lt;ref name=hay152 /&gt; Moseby was acquitted September 21, 1902.&lt;ref name=jillson31 /&gt; 

Morrow returned to Somerset in 1903.&lt;ref name=harrison655 /&gt; There, he married Katherine Hale Waddle on June 18, 1903.&lt;ref name=powell86 /&gt; Waddle's father had studied law under Morrow's father, and Edwin and Katherine had been playmates, schoolmates, and later sweethearts.&lt;ref name=jillson33&gt;Jillson, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; The couple had two children, Edwina Haskell in July 1904 and Charles Robert in November 1908.&lt;ref name=jillson34&gt;Jillson, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political career==
In 1904, Morrow was appointed [[city attorney]] for Somerset, serving until 1908.&lt;ref name=harrison655 /&gt; President [[William Howard Taft]] appointed him [[United States Attorney|U.S. District Attorney]] for the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky|Eastern District of Kentucky]] in 1910.&lt;ref name=powell86 /&gt; He continued in this position until he was removed from office by President [[Woodrow Wilson]] in 1913.&lt;ref name=harrison655 /&gt;&lt;ref name=powell86 /&gt;

[[File:William Bradley.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A black and white photo of a balding man in his sixties|William O. Bradley, Morrow's uncle, was elected governor of Kentucky in 1895.]]
Morrow's first political experience was working in his uncle William O. Bradley's gubernatorial campaign in 1895.&lt;ref name=nga /&gt; In 1899, Republican gubernatorial candidate [[William S. Taylor]] offered to make Morrow his [[Kentucky Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] in exchange for Bradley's support in the election; Bradley refused.&lt;ref name=tapp425&gt;Tapp, p. 425&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the encouragement of friends, Morrow declined to run for governor in 1911.&lt;ref name=harrison655 /&gt; 

In 1912, Morrow was chosen as the Republican candidate for the Senate seat of [[Thomas Paynter]].&lt;ref name=klotter220&gt;Klotter, p. 220&lt;/ref&gt; Paynter had decided not to seek re-election, and the Democrats nominated [[Ollie M. James]] of [[Crittenden County, Kentucky|Crittenden County]].&lt;ref name=klotter220 /&gt; The [[Kentucky General Assembly|General Assembly]] was heavily Democratic and united behind James.&lt;ref name=klotter220 /&gt; On a joint ballot, James defeated Morrow by a vote of 105–28.&lt;ref name=klotter220 /&gt; Due to the passage of the [[Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Seventeenth Amendment]] the next year, this was the last time the Kentucky legislature would elect a senator.&lt;ref name=klotter220 /&gt; 

At the state Republican convention in Lexington on June 15, 1915, Morrow was chosen as the Republican candidate for governor over Latt F. McLaughlin.&lt;ref name=hay153&gt;Hay, p. 153&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=appleton32&gt;Appleton, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; His [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] opponent was his close friend, [[Augustus O. Stanley]].&lt;ref name=harrison655 /&gt; Morrow charged previous Democratic administrations with corruption and called for the election of a Republican because &quot;You cannot clean house with a dirty broom.&quot;&lt;ref name=nhok285&gt;Harrison in ''A New History of Kentucky'', p. 285&lt;/ref&gt; Both men ran on progressive platforms, and the election went in Stanley's favor by only 471 votes.&lt;ref name=harrison655 /&gt; Although it was the closest gubernatorial vote in the state's history, Morrow refused to challenge the results, which greatly increased his popularity.&lt;ref name=hay153 /&gt; His decision was influenced by the fact that a challenge would be decided by the [[Kentucky General Assembly|General Assembly]], which had a Democratic majority in both houses.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison in ''A New History of Kentucky'', pp. 285–286&lt;/ref&gt;

===Governor of Kentucky===
Morrow served as a delegate to the [[Republican National Convention]] in [[1916 Republican National Convention|1916]], [[1920 Republican National Convention|1920]], and [[1928 Republican National Convention|1928]].&lt;ref name=nga /&gt; In 1919, he was chosen by acclamation as his party's candidate for governor.&lt;ref name=hay153 /&gt; This time, his opponent was [[James D. Black]].&lt;ref name=harrison655 /&gt; Black was Stanley's [[Lieutenant Governor of Kentucky|lieutenant governor]] and had ascended to the governorship in May 1919 when Stanley resigned to take a seat in the U.S. Senate.&lt;ref name=harrison655 /&gt;

Morrow encouraged the state's voters to &quot;Right the Wrong of 1915&quot;.&lt;ref name=klotter233&gt;Klotter, p. 233&lt;/ref&gt; He again ran on a progressive platform, advocating an amendment to the [[Kentucky Constitution|state constitution]] to grant women's suffrage.&lt;ref name=harrison655 /&gt; His support was not as strong for a [[Prohibition in the United States|prohibition]] amendment.&lt;ref name=harrison655 /&gt; He attacked the Stanley–Black administration as corrupt.&lt;ref name=harrison655 /&gt; Days before the election, he exposed a contract awarded by the state Board of Control to a non-existent company.&lt;ref name=harrison655 /&gt; Historian [[Lowell H. Harrison]] opined that Black's refusal to remove the members of the board following this revelation probably sealed his defeat.&lt;ref name=harrison655 /&gt; Morrow won the general election by more than 40,000 votes.&lt;ref name=harrison655 /&gt; It was the largest margin of victory for a Republican gubernatorial candidate in the state's history.&lt;ref name=klotter233 /&gt;

[[File:Morrow signs Anthony Amendment.jpg|thumb|right|300px|alt=A man sits at a desk sigining a document while a large group of women watches|Morrow signs the bill ratifying the 19th Amendment, Kentucky Equal Rights Association members look on in celebration, January 6, 1920.]]
On January 6, 1920, Governor Morrow signed the bill ratifying the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Nineteenth Amendment]], making Kentucky the 23rd state to ratify it, and the moment is captured in a photograph with members of the [[Kentucky Equal Rights Association]].  During the 1920 legislative session, the Republicans held a majority in the [[Kentucky House of Representatives|state House of Representatives]] and were a minority by only two votes in the [[Kentucky Senate|state Senate]].&lt;ref name=harrison655 /&gt; During the session, Morrow was often able to convince C. W. Burton, a Democratic senator from [[Grant County, Kentucky|Grant County]], to support Republican proposals.&lt;ref name=klotter267&gt;Klotter, p. 267&lt;/ref&gt; Tie votes in the Senate were broken by Republican lieutenant governor [[S. Thruston Ballard]].&lt;ref name=klotter267 /&gt; Consequently, Morrow was able to effect a considerable reorganization of the state government, including replacing the Board of Control with a nonpartisan Board of Charities and Corrections, centralizing highway works, and revising property taxes.&lt;ref name=harrison655 /&gt;&lt;ref name=jillson56&gt;Jillson, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; He oversaw improvements to the education system, including better textbook selection and a tax on racetracks to support a minimum salary for teachers.&lt;ref name=harrison655 /&gt;&lt;ref name=klotter267 /&gt; Among Morrow's reforms that did not pass was a proposal to make the [[judiciary]] nonpartisan.&lt;ref name=harrison655 /&gt;

Morrow urged enforcement of state laws against [[Concealed carry in the United States|carrying concealed weapons]] and restricted activities of the [[Ku Klux Klan]].&lt;ref name=harrison655 /&gt; During his first year in office, he granted only 100 pardons.&lt;ref name=jillson61&gt;Jillson, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; This was a considerable decrease from the number granted by his immediate predecessors. During their first years in office, [[J. C. W. Beckham]] granted 350 pardons, [[James B. McCreary]] (during his second stint as governor) granted 139, and Augustus O. Stanley granted 257.&lt;ref name=jillson61 /&gt; He was also an active member of the [[Commission on Interracial Cooperation]], a society for the elimination of racial violence in the South.&lt;ref name=wright12&gt;Wright, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lockett mob.jpg|thumb|left|300px|alt=A discolored photo of a mob gathered outside a courthouse|A mob gathered outside the courthouse during the trial of Will Lockett in 1920.]]
On February 9, 1920, Morrow dispatched the [[Kentucky National Guard]] to Lexington to protect Will Lockett, a black World War&amp;nbsp;I veteran on trial for murder.&lt;ref name=klotter69&gt;Klotter, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; Morrow told the state [[adjutant general]] &quot;Do as much as you have to do to keep that negro in the hands of the law. If he falls into the hands of the mob I do not expect to see you alive.&quot;&lt;ref name=wright195&gt;Wright, p. 195&lt;/ref&gt; Lockett had already confessed, without the benefit of a lawyer, to the murder.&lt;ref name=klotter69 /&gt; His trial took only thirty minutes as he pleaded guilty but asked for a life sentence instead of death.&lt;ref name=wright195 /&gt; Despite his plea, he was sentenced to die in the electric chair.&lt;ref name=wright195 /&gt;

A crowd of several thousand gathered outside the courthouse while Lockett's trial was underway.&lt;ref name=klotter69 /&gt; A cameraman asked a large group of those gathered to shake their fists and yell so he could get a picture.&lt;ref name=nhok351&gt;Harrison in ''A New History of Kentucky'', p. 351&lt;/ref&gt; The rest of the crowd mistakenly believed they were storming the courthouse and rushed forward.&lt;ref name=nhok351 /&gt; In the ensuing skirmish, one policeman was injured so badly that his arm later had to be amputated.&lt;ref name=wright196&gt;Wright, p. 196&lt;/ref&gt; The National Guard opened fire, killing six people and wounding approximately fifty.&lt;ref name=nhok351 /&gt; Some members of the mob looted nearby stores in search of weapons to retaliate, but reinforcements arrived from a nearby army post by mid-afternoon.&lt;ref name=klotter70&gt;Klotter, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martial law]] was declared, and no further violence was perpetrated.&lt;ref name=klotter70 /&gt; A month later, Lockett was executed at the [[Kentucky State Penitentiary]] in [[Eddyville, Kentucky|Eddyville]].&lt;ref name=klotter70 /&gt; 

The incident is believed to be the first forceful suppression of a lynch mob by state and local officials in the [[Southern United States|South]].&lt;ref name=klotter69 /&gt; Morrow received a laudatory telegram from the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People|NAACP]], and most of the national press regarding the incident was favorable. [[W. E. B. Du Bois]] called it the &quot;Second [[Battles of Lexington and Concord|Battle of Lexington]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=wright196 /&gt; Morrow was consistent in his use of state troops to end violence in the state. In 1922, he again dispatched the National Guard to quell a violent mill strike in [[Newport, Kentucky|Newport]].&lt;ref name=harrison655 /&gt;

Morrow also demanded consistency from local law enforcement officials. In 1921, he removed the [[Woodford County, Kentucky|Woodford County]] jailer from office because he allowed a black inmate to be lynched and offered a reward of $25,000 for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the perpetrators.&lt;ref name=hay154&gt;Hay, p. 154&lt;/ref&gt; Citizens of [[Versailles, Kentucky|Versailles]] were more outraged that the jailer had been removed from office than that the prisoner had been lynched.&lt;ref name=wright203&gt;Wright, p. 203&lt;/ref&gt; The locals refused to aid in the investigation, and the lynchers were never arrested or charged.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, pp. 203–204&lt;/ref&gt; Local officials appointed the jailer's wife to finish his term in an attempt to skirt the removal.&lt;ref name=wright204&gt;Wright, p. 204&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1922, a traveling salesman named Jack Eaton was arrested for allegedly [[assault]]ing several young girls.&lt;ref name=wright204 /&gt; The girls' parents refused to press charges, and Eaton was released.&lt;ref name=wright204 /&gt; Later, he was captured by a mob, who cut him several times and poured turpentine into his wounds.&lt;ref name=wright204 /&gt; An investigation found that the [[Scott County, Kentucky|Scott County]] [[Sheriffs in the United States|sheriff]] had willfully delivered Eaton to the mob, and Morrow removed him from office.&lt;ref name=wright204 /&gt; Though Eaton was a white man, blacks were elated with the removal because they hoped it would encourage other jailers to step up efforts to protect against lynchings and mob violence.&lt;ref name=wright204 /&gt;

Morrow was frequently mentioned as a potential candidate for [[Vice President of the United States|vice president]] in 1920, but he withdrew his name from consideration, sticking to a campaign promise not to seek a higher office while governor. On July 27, 1920, he made a speech in [[Northampton, Massachusetts|Northampton]], Massachusetts, officially notifying [[Calvin Coolidge]] of his nomination for that office. Although he supported [[Frank O. Lowden]] for president, the nomination went to [[Warren G. Harding]], and Morrow campaigned vigorously on behalf of his party's ticket.&lt;ref&gt;Hay, pp. 154–155&lt;/ref&gt;

In his address to the 1922 legislature, Morrow asked for {{Nowrap|$50 million}} for improvements to the state highway system and for the repeal of all laws denying equal rights to women.&lt;ref name=harrison655 /&gt; He also recommended a large [[Government bond|bond]] issue to finance improvements to the state's universities, schools, prisons, and hospitals.&lt;ref name=hay155&gt;Hay, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; By this time, however, the Republicans had surrendered their majority in the state House, and practically all of Morrow's proposals were voted down.&lt;ref name=harrison655 /&gt; Morrow countered by vetoing several Democratic bills, including $700,000 in appropriations.&lt;ref name=harrison655 /&gt;&lt;ref name=klotter268 /&gt; Among the few accomplishments of the 1922 legislature were passage of an anti-lynching law, the abolition of [[Penal labour|convict labor]] and the establishment of normal schools at [[Murray, Kentucky|Murray]] and [[Morehead, Kentucky|Morehead]].&lt;ref name=nhok351 /&gt;&lt;ref name=klotter268 /&gt; Today, these schools are [[Murray State University]] and [[Morehead State University]], respectively. The 1922 legislature also established a commission to govern [[My Old Kentucky Home State Park]] and approved construction of the [[Jefferson Davis State Historic Site|Jefferson Davis Monument]].&lt;ref name=klotter268&gt;Klotter, p. 268&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the fact that Morrow gained national praise for his handling of the Lockett trial, historian James Klotter opined that he &quot;left behind a solid, and rather typical, record for a Kentucky governor.&quot;&lt;ref name=klotter275&gt;Klotter, p. 275&lt;/ref&gt; He cited Morrow's fiscal conservatism and inability to control the legislature in 1922 as reasons for his lackluster assessment, although he praised Morrow's advancement of racial equality in the state. Morrow was prohibited by the state constitution from seeking a second consecutive term, and the achievements of his administration were not significant enough to ensure the election of [[Charles I. Dawson]], his would-be Republican successor in the gubernatorial election of 1923.&lt;ref name=klotter275 /&gt;

===Later career and death===
Following his term as governor, Morrow retired to Somerset where he became active in the [[Watchmen of the Republic]], an organization devoted to the eradication of prejudice and the promotion of tolerance.&lt;ref name=harrison655 /&gt; He served on the United States Railroad Labor Board from 1923 to 1926 and its successor, the Railway Mediation Board, from 1926 to 1934.&lt;ref name=harrison655 /&gt; He resigned to run for a seat in the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] representing the [[Kentucky's 9th congressional district|Ninth District]], but lost his party's nomination to [[John M. Robsion]].&lt;ref name=powell86 /&gt;&lt;ref name=hay155 /&gt; 

Following his defeat in the congressional primary, Morrow made plans to return to Lexington to resume his law practice.&lt;ref name=hay155 /&gt; On June 15, 1935, he died unexpectedly of a heart attack while temporarily living with a cousin in [[Frankfort, Kentucky|Frankfort]].&lt;ref name=hay155 /&gt; He is buried in [[Frankfort Cemetery]].&lt;ref name=nga /&gt;
