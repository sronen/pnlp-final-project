'''Charles Stewart''', [[Queen's Privy Council for Canada|PC]] (August 26, 1868 – December 6, 1946) was a Canadian politician who served as the [[List of premiers of Alberta|third]] [[Premier of Alberta]] from 1917 until 1921.  Born in [[Strabane, Ontario|Strabane]], [[Ontario]], in [[Wentworth County, Ontario|Wentworth County]], Stewart was a farmer who moved west to [[Alberta]] after his farm was destroyed by a storm.  There he became active in politics and was elected to the [[Legislative Assembly of Alberta]] in the [[Alberta general election, 1909|1909 election]].  He served as Minister of Public Works and Minister of Municipal Affairs—the first person to hold the latter position in Alberta—in the government of [[Arthur Sifton]].  When Sifton left provincial politics in 1917 to join the federal cabinet, Stewart was named his replacement.

As premier, Stewart tried to hold together his [[Alberta Liberal Party|Liberal Party]], which was divided by the [[Conscription Crisis of 1917]].  He endeavoured to enforce [[Prohibition in Canada|prohibition of alcoholic beverages]], which had been enshrined in law by a referendum during Sifton's premiership, but found that the law was not widely enough supported to be effectively policed.  His government took over several of the province's financially troubled railroads, and guaranteed bonds sold to fund irrigation projects.  Several of these policies were the result of lobbying by the [[United Farmers of Alberta]] (UFA), with which Stewart enjoyed good relations; even so, the UFA was politicized during Stewart's premiership and ran candidates in the [[Alberta general election, 1921|1921 election]].  Unable to match the UFA's appeal to rural voters, Stewart's government was defeated at the polls and he was succeeded as premier by [[Herbert Greenfield]].

After leaving provincial politics, Stewart was invited to join the federal cabinet of [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]], in which he served as Minister of the Interior and Mines.  In this capacity he signed, on behalf of the federal government, an agreement that transferred control of Alberta's natural resources from Ottawa to the provincial government—a concession he had been criticized for being unable to negotiate as Premier.  He served in King's cabinet until 1930, when the King government was defeated, but remained a member of Parliament until he lost his seat in 1935.  He died in December 1946 in Ottawa.

==Early life==

Charles Stewart was born on August 26, 1868, in [[Strabane, Ontario|Strabane]], [[Ontario]], on [[Wentworth County, Ontario|Wentworth County]], to Charles and Catherine Stewart. Charles Sr. was a [[stonemasonry|stonemason]] and farmer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jaques 44&quot;&gt;Jaques 44&lt;/ref&gt; As a child, Charles Jr. accompanied his father to [[Carlisle, Middlesex County, Ontario|Carlisle]] to hear Canadian Prime Minister Sir [[John A. Macdonald]].  According to family lore, Macdonald noticed the young future Premier and told him that he was a fine boy who would make a good politician someday.  When Charles Jr. was 16, he moved with his family to a farm near [[Barrie, Ontario|Barrie]]. Seven years later, on December 17, 1891, he married Jane Russell Sneath;&lt;ref name=&quot;Jaques 44&quot; /&gt; the pair had eight children.&lt;ref name=&quot;leg bio&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.assembly.ab.ca/lao/library/premiers/stewart.htm |title=The Honourable Charles Stewart, 1917–21 |publisher=Legislative Assembly of Alberta |accessdate=2008-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After marrying Sneath, he converted to her [[Church of England]] faith.&lt;ref name=&quot;leg bio&quot; /&gt;

[[File:Stewart house.jpg|thumb|alt=A three story house with four men and two children on the front porch and three women on the second floor balcony|left|Stewart's farmhouse in Killam; Stewart himself is standing at lower left.]]In 1892, Charles Sr. died, leaving his son in charge of the family farm.  Twelve years later, this farm was destroyed by a storm, and Stewart decided to move west, settling near [[Killam, Alberta|Killam]], [[Alberta]] in 1905.  His family endured a cold winter—the warmest place in their shack was on the kitchen table, so they kept the baby there—and in the spring their crops were destroyed by hail.  As he was unsuccessful at farming, he supplemented his income using the stonemason's skills he had learned from his father: he laid foundations for the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]], worked on the [[High Level Bridge (Edmonton)|High Level Bridge]] in [[Edmonton]], and dug Killam's town well.  He later worked in real estate and as a farm implement dealer, earning enough to buy a new and larger homestead in 1912.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jaques 44&quot; /&gt;

Stewart was active in his local community: he was the first chair of the Killam School District, attended the first meeting of Killam ratepayers on January 19, 1907, and was involved in the incorporation of Killam in January 1908.  In 1909, the [[Alberta Liberal Party]], which had dominated provincial politics throughout Alberta's short history, came seeking a candidate to run in the new [[riding (politics)|riding]] of [[Sedgewick (provincial electoral district)|Sedgewick]].  Stewart agreed to run and was elected by [[acclamation]] in the [[Alberta general election, 1909|1909 election]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Jaques 45&quot;&gt;Jaques 45&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early political career===

At the time of Stewart's acclamation, Premier [[Alexander Cameron Rutherford]] seemed unassailable: he controlled 36 of the [[Legislative Assembly of Alberta]]'s 41 seats (Stewart's being one),&lt;ref name=&quot;Jaques 45&quot; /&gt; and his Liberals had just won nearly sixty percent of the vote in their re-election bid.&lt;ref name=&quot;EA&quot; /&gt;  Months later, however, Rutherford and his government were embroiled in the [[Alberta and Great Waterways Railway scandal]], and the Liberal Party was split.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jaques 45&quot; /&gt;  Initially, Stewart remained loyal to Rutherford, and went so far as to allege in the legislature that insurgent Liberal [[John R. Boyle]] had offered two members of the legislative assembly (MLAs), who were also hotel keepers, immunity from prosecution for liquor violations if they would support a new government in which Boyle was [[Attorney-General]].&lt;ref&gt;Thomas 84&lt;/ref&gt;  As additional details of the scandal emerged, however, Stewart himself became an insurgent, and was pleased when [[Arthur Sifton]] replaced Rutherford as Premier.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jaques 45&quot; /&gt;

In May 1912, Sifton expanded his cabinet, and Stewart was made the province's first Minister of Municipal Affairs.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas 125&lt;/ref&gt;  As was required by the custom of the day when an MLA was appointed to cabinet, he resigned his seat to run in a [[by-election]], in which he easily defeated [[Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta|Conservative]] [[William John Blair]].&lt;ref&gt;Thomas 127&lt;/ref&gt;  In cabinet, he became known as an advocate of public ownership of utilities, which placed him more in sympathy with the Conservative opposition than with Sifton.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jaques 46&quot;&gt;Jaques 46&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite this position, he backed Sifton's 1913 resolution to the Alberta and Great Waterways problem, which involved partnering with the private sector; this vote marked the first time that the Liberal caucus was united on the railways question since before the scandal broke in 1910.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas 150&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1913, Sifton moved Stewart from Municipal Affairs into the Public Works portfolio; in this capacity, Stewart played a major role in the incorporation of the Alberta Farmers' Co-operative Elevator Company,&lt;ref name=&quot;Jaques 46&quot; /&gt; which was a farmer-run co-operative with a charter to own and operate [[grain elevator]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas 135&lt;/ref&gt;

==Premier==

Shortly after the [[Alberta general election, 1917|1917 provincial election]] (in which Stewart and the Liberals were both soundly re-elected), Canada found itself embroiled in a [[Conscription crisis of 1917|conscription crisis]].  The federal [[Conservative Party of Canada (historical)|Conservative]] government, led by [[Robert Borden]], supported implementing conscription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 179&quot;&gt;Thomas 179&lt;/ref&gt;  The opposition Liberals, led by [[Wilfrid Laurier]], nominally opposed conscription, but many English-speaking Liberals in fact supported it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 182&quot; /&gt;  The crisis was resolved when Borden formed a [[Unionist Party (Canada)|Union]] government composed of Conservatives and pro-conscription Liberals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 180&quot;&gt;Thomas 180&lt;/ref&gt;  Sifton, falling into the latter group, was chosen as Alberta's representative in that government, and resigned as Premier in October 1917.  [[Lieutenant Governor of Alberta|Lieutenant-Governor]] [[Robert Brett]], accepting Sifton's choice of successor, asked Stewart to form a government.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 179&quot; /&gt;  His only serious rival for the position of premier was [[Charles Wilson Cross]], who opposed conscription and was therefore not a palatable choice for much of the Liberal establishment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jaques 46&quot; /&gt;

===Party division===

The Alberta and Great Waterways scandal had opened up a rift in the provincial Liberal Party, between those who remained loyal to Cross and Rutherford and those who did not, with the latter group being led by [[William Henry Cushing]] and [[Frank Oliver (politician)|Frank Oliver]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 88&quot;&gt;Thomas 88&lt;/ref&gt;  Sifton had papered over, if not in fact healed, this rift, and it did not burst open again until the conscription crisis.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 180&quot; /&gt;  This time, however, the fault lines were different: Cross and Oliver had put aside their longtime enmity to join in opposing conscription, and Sifton, who had been selected Premier in part because he was not identified with either faction in the old feud, was Alberta's most prominent pro-conscription Liberal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 182&quot; /&gt;

Stewart was a supporter of conscription and of the Union government,&lt;ref name=&quot;Jaques 47&quot;&gt;Jaques 47&lt;/ref&gt; but did not take any active part in the acrimonious [[Canadian federal election, 1917|1917 federal election]], which was fought on the issue.  Several of his ministers were not so circumspect: Attorney-General Cross, Education Minister Boyle, and Municipal Affairs Minister [[Wilfrid Gariépy]] campaigned for the [[Laurier Liberals]]; Public Works Minister [[Archibald J. McLean]] and Treasurer [[Charles R. Mitchell]] stayed out of the fray while leaving no doubt of their support for Union.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 182&quot;&gt;Thomas 182&lt;/ref&gt;  During the first legislative session after this election, Stewart came under attack from members of his own party. [[Alexander Grant MacKay]] criticized his failure to take advantage of the recent conference of premiers to press for the transfer of rights over Alberta's natural resources from the federal to the provincial government (Sifton had made this a priority during the pre-war years, but had largely ceased his advocacy on the breakout of hostilities), and [[James Gray Turgeon]] attacked the government's policy of levying taxes for the support of soldiers' dependants on the grounds that he considered it a federal responsibility.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 183&quot;&gt;Thomas 183&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Charles stewart sod turning.jpg|thumb|alt=A crowd of men gathered in a field watching one man push a plow|right|Stewart (behind the plow) at a sod-turning event in [[St. Albert, Alberta|St. Albert]], soon after becoming premier]]
Divisions within the provincial Liberals came to a head in August 1918, when Stewart dismissed Cross as Attorney-General.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 183&quot; /&gt;  It later emerged that Cross had refused to fire two detectives in his department after Stewart had concluded that their work would be better done by the provincial police, and that Stewart had found Cross's work to be generally poor.  He had asked for Cross's resignation, received no response, and rescinded the [[Order in Council]] appointing him.  In an effort to secure Cross's departure from politics, Stewart offered him the position of Alberta's provincial agent in [[London, England]]; Cross refused it, and Stewart was criticized for using appointments for political advantage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 194&quot;&gt;Thomas 194&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prohibition and democratic reform===

Alberta had implemented [[prohibition in Canada|prohibition]] in 1916 as the result of a [[referendum]] supported by the powerful [[United Farmers of Alberta]] (UFA) lobby group.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas 159–160&lt;/ref&gt;  By the time Stewart took office, it was becoming apparent that the policy was not being universally complied with: Conservative MLA [[George Douglas Stanley]] alleged that judges were often [[Hangover|hungover]] when they sat in judgment of those accused of violating liquor laws, and Cross's replacement as Attorney-General, John Boyle, admitted that in his estimation 65% of the province's male population broke the Prohibition Act.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 192&quot;&gt;Thomas 192&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1921 the government realized profits of $800,000 on alcohol legally sold for &quot;medicinal&quot; purposes, and Boyle estimated [[rum-running|bootleggers]]' profits at nine times that figure.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 193&quot;&gt;Thomas 193&lt;/ref&gt;  Stewart blamed the problems on insufficient public support for the law,&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 192&quot; /&gt; but even as he did so it was clear that there was not enough support to repeal it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 193&quot; /&gt;

[[File:Premier Charles Stewart.jpg|thumb|alt=A black and white image of a middle-aged white man in a hat and overcoat|left|Charles Stewart as Premier]]Prohibition was not the only UFA-endorsed policy to have been passed by Sifton's government: indeed, the legislation that allowed for citizen-initiated referenda of the sort that had led to prohibition was itself the result of UFA advocacy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 136&quot;&gt;Thomas 136&lt;/ref&gt;  Once Stewart became Premier, he committed to the introduction of another UFA-favoured democratic reform&amp;mdash;[[proportional representation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 195&quot;&gt;Thomas 195&lt;/ref&gt;  However, a committee formed to examine the possibility disintegrated over what historian Carrol Jaques calls &quot;battles within the group and a general dislike of the concept&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jaques 50&quot;&gt;Jaques 50&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public works===

Railway development had dominated the premierships of Stewart's predecessors and, while losing political potency as an issue, it was still a matter that demanded his attention.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jaques 51&quot;&gt;Jaques 51&lt;/ref&gt;  Though Sifton had established a railway policy in 1913 that was satisfactory to all wings of the Liberal Party, the outbreak of the [[First World War]] the following year had all but put an end to railway construction across Canada.  Once peace came, Albertans living near promised but as yet unbuilt lines began to clamour for their completion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 190&quot;&gt;Thomas 190&lt;/ref&gt;  The private companies with whom the government had partnered, however, were in no position to undertake the construction.  The Edmonton, Dunvegan and British Columbia Railway was taken over by the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]], with a clause in the agreement requiring the provincial government to spend $1 million to improve the route, and the Alberta and Great Waterways was taken over by Stewart's government directly (J. D. McArthur, the line's previous owner, retained an option to repurchase it, but it was never exercised).&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 191&quot;&gt;Thomas 191&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Irrigation]] projects also occupied much of Stewart's attention as Premier.  As with railways, the First World War had disrupted planned irrigation projects, and Albertan farmers, especially those from the arid [[Southern Alberta|south]], were eager to see them resumed.  Specifically popular was a project to irrigate {{convert|500000|acre|ha}} in [[Lethbridge County, Alberta|Lethbridge County]], but when [[bond (finance)|bonds]] were issued to finance the project, they did not sell.  Stewart sought federal backing of the bonds, but Prime Minister [[Arthur Meighen]] declined.  Stewart reluctantly agreed to offer a provincial guarantee, but to avoid negative reaction from [[northern Alberta]] he linked the enabling legislation to one allowing for [[drainage]] in northern areas.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 189&quot;&gt;Thomas 189&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stewart and the United Farmers of Alberta===

The [[United Farmers of Alberta]] had its beginnings as a farmers' advocacy organization; Stewart, a farmer, had joined it.&lt;ref&gt;Jaques 49–50&lt;/ref&gt;  The UFA had achieved several successes in dealing with the Sifton government, and Stewart also endeavoured to cooperate with it.  The irrigation project was strongly supported by the UFA, as was Stewart's action on proportional representation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jaques 50&quot;&gt;Jaques 50&lt;/ref&gt;  When [[Peace River (provincial electoral district)|Peace River]] MLA [[William Archibald Rae]] introduced legislation to allow [[Imperial Oil]] to build a [[pipeline transport|pipeline]] in the province, UFA President [[Henry Wise Wood]] sent Stewart a telegram of protest, as he believed that pipelines should be [[common carrier]]s;&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 200&quot;&gt;Thomas 200&lt;/ref&gt; Stewart read it in the legislature, and Rae's bill was withdrawn.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jaques 50&quot; /&gt;  Even given these victories, the UFA was not satisfied with the government's record: in 1918, the government only took action on three of the many resolutions the UFA had sent to it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rennie 128&quot;&gt;Rennie 128&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Charles Stewart.jpg|thumb|alt=A painted portrait of an unsmiling bald white man in a three piece suit|right|Stewart's official portrait by V. A. Long]]

Some in the UFA had long favoured contesting elections directly as a political party instead of remaining on the sidelines as a pressure group, but Wood and other UFA leaders were implacably opposed to the idea.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rennie 132&quot;&gt;Rennie 132&lt;/ref&gt;  During the war, however, the political wing began to gain momentum, and at the 1919 UFA convention it was decided that UFA candidates would contest the next provincial election.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rennie 180&quot;&gt;Rennie 180&lt;/ref&gt;  In fact, it ended up doing so somewhat sooner: in 1919 [[Charles W. Fisher]], Liberal MLA for [[Cochrane (provincial electoral district)|Cochrane]], died as a result of that year's [[influenza]] epidemic, and a by-election was necessitated to replace him.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 195&quot;&gt;Thomas 195&lt;/ref&gt;  The UFA's [[Alex Moore (politician)|Alex Moore]] defeated his only opponent, Liberal Edward V. Thomson, by 835 votes to 708.&lt;ref&gt;Mardon 53&lt;/ref&gt;

Stewart felt betrayed: &quot;It has been my fight ever since I became a minister to see that the farmers of the province were having a square deal,&quot; he remarked, &quot;and I think I have done this with some success.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Jaques 50&quot; /&gt;  Despite his general sympathy with the aims of the UFA, he could not support their transition into a political party.  For one, he disagreed with the UFA's belief that politics should be conducted along [[social class|class]], rather than ideological, lines.  Stewart believed that &quot;the more strongly armed the classes become the harder will it be to get the things we really need in our government&quot;, and asserted that &quot;I never did and never will have any desire to form a coalition with anybody except with men who think the same as I do.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 196&quot;&gt;Thomas 196&lt;/ref&gt;

Given the UFA's formal adoption of the goal of replacing Stewart's Liberal government with a Farmer government, it remained surprisingly friendly towards the Premier.  While campaigning for Moore during the Cochrane by-election, Wood called Stewart &quot;an honourable, upright citizen, doing the best he could under difficult circumstances&quot; and boasted that &quot;if I have got to tear down the character of an honourable man to build up something that I want, I am not going to build it up.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rennie 184&quot;&gt;Rennie 184&lt;/ref&gt;  When at last the general election came, in 1921, the UFA declined to run a candidate in Stewart's Sedgewick riding as a sign of respect to the Premier.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jaques 52&quot;&gt;Jaques 52&lt;/ref&gt;  After the UFA swept to victory, there was even speculation that Stewart, still a UFA member, would stay on as Premier of a new Farmer's government (as part of its opposition to &quot;old style politics&quot;, the UFA had contested the election without designating a leader),&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 205&quot;&gt;Thomas 205&lt;/ref&gt; but he announced otherwise.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jaques 52&quot; /&gt;

===Defeat and legacy===
{{main|Alberta general election, 1921}}

The last provincial election had been held in June 1917, and four years was the normal life of a legislature in Canada.  Stewart called an election for July 19.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 202&quot;&gt;Thomas 202&lt;/ref&gt;  Though the Liberals' fortunes had been sagging in the post-war years, there remained no doubt that they could again defeat the Conservatives; their real challenge was evidently from the newly politicized UFA.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas 204–205&lt;/ref&gt;  Bolstering this challenge by increasing farmers' discontent was a collapse of agricultural prices.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 204&quot;&gt;Thomas 204&lt;/ref&gt;  The UFA had no leader, no fixed platform, and no inclination to attack Stewart or his government.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 205&quot; /&gt;  What it did have was superior organization,&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 205&quot; /&gt; and on election day this organization made itself felt in the form of thirty-nine UFA members elected to fourteen Liberals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 204&quot; /&gt;  Stewart announced that he would resign as Premier as soon as the UFA had selected somebody to replace him.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 205&quot; /&gt;  Once it had selected [[Herbert Greenfield]], Stewart made good on his pledge, and Greenfield replaced him August 13.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jaques 52&quot; /&gt;

[[File:Charles stewart and family.jpg|thumb|alt=A man and three women seated on the front stoop of a house. One of the women is cradling a baby.|left|Stewart with his family, c. 1930]]In Jaques' view, Stewart was defined by what he was not: &lt;blockquote&gt;
he was not involved in any of the railway scandals, current or past; he was not conspicuously involved in any of the personal battles that had consumed Alexander Rutherford, Frank Oliver, the brothers Arthur and Clifford Sifton, Charles Cross, or any of their followers; he was not a high-powered flamboyant Liberal partisan; he did not let himself get involved in federal Liberal Party machinations over issues such as the conscription crisis; nor did he seem to be high-handed or dictatorial—a criticism levelled at his predecessor, Arthur Sifton.&lt;ref&gt;Jaques 51–52&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

She argues that he was a &quot;decent family man&quot; whose career was a product of the circumstances in which he found himself.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jaques 52&quot; /&gt;

Historian L. G. Thomas recognized Stewart's admirable qualities,&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 183&quot; /&gt; but criticized him for lacking Sifton's &quot;ruthless and forceful leadership&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 207&quot;&gt;Thomas 207&lt;/ref&gt; and claimed that &quot;few provincial premiers have been more universally praised by their opponents and more unanimously deplored by their supporters.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 183&quot; /&gt;  Even so, he acknowledged that the decisive factor in Stewart's downfall was not anything that he did, but the decision by the UFA to run candidates in 1921; in Thomas's view, Sifton would have been defeated in 1917 if he had had to contend with a politicized UFA.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 207&quot; /&gt;

==Federal politics==

Following the [[Canadian federal election, 1921|1921 federal election]], [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]]'s Liberals came to power in Ottawa.  They had not won any seats in Alberta, and Stewart was invited to join King's cabinet as Minister of the Interior and Mines (which included responsibility as Superintendent-General of Indian Affairs).&lt;ref name=&quot;Jaques 52&quot; /&gt;  He won a 1922 by-election in the [[Quebec]] seat of [[Argenteuil (electoral district)|Argenteuil]], before shifting to the more familiar territory of [[Edmonton West]] in the [[Canadian federal election, 1925|1925 election]]; he was re-elected there in [[Canadian federal election, 1926|1926]] and [[Canadian federal election, 1930|1930]].  In the [[Canadian federal election, 1935|1935 election]], he ran in the new riding of [[Jasper—Edson]], where he was defeated by [[Social Credit Party of Canada|Social Crediter]] [[Walter Frederick Kuhl]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Jaques 53&quot;&gt;Jaques 53&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the seated men, third from the left, is sitting in a much more ornate chair than the others; he is the Prime Minister of Canada, William Lyon MacKenzie King.|right|The signing ceremony for the resource transfer agreement; Stewart is seated second from left.]]As a cabinet minister, Stewart aggressively marketed Canada's coal both domestically and internationally, for which he was honoured by Alberta's coal producers at a banquet and later awarded the [[Robert Randolph Bruce|Randolph Bruce]] Gold Medal in Science by the [[Canadian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy]].  He took a great interest in [[water power]], and advised the government on jurisdictional issues surrounding the [[Niagara River|Niagara]], [[St. Mary River (Montana-Alberta)|St. Mary]], and [[Milk River (Montana-Alberta)|Milk Rivers]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Jaques 53&quot; /&gt;  In 1927, he served as Canada's representative at the [[League of Nations]].&lt;ref name=&quot;leg bio&quot; /&gt;  As Minister of the Interior, he oversaw the 1927 creation of [[Prince Albert National Park]].&lt;ref&gt;Wardhaugh 130&lt;/ref&gt;  Ironically, given the attacks he had sustained as Premier from Alexander Grant MacKay, he was part of the federal delegation that finally negotiated the transfer of resource control from the federal to the Alberta provincial government in December 1929.&lt;ref&gt;Jaques 54–55&lt;/ref&gt;  The same agreement transferred resource rights to [[Saskatchewan]] and [[Manitoba]].  After it was signed but before it took effect, Manitoba Premier [[John Bracken]] concluded an agreement with the Winnipeg Electric Company, a private concern, to develop a [[hydroelectric dam]] at Seven Sisters' Reach.  Because resource rights were still controlled by the federal government, the deal required federal approval.  Stewart advocated withholding this approval in deference to Manitoba public opinion, which favoured public ownership of such projects, but King honoured a provision of the resource transfer agreement that required the wishes of provincial governments to be respected until the transfer was complete and granted approval.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wardhaugh 144&quot;&gt;Wardhaugh 144&lt;/ref&gt;  Stewart's preference for public over private ownership extended to King's planned creation of the [[Bank of Canada]]; Stewart wanted the new institution entirely under the control of the government, but King preferred an arrangement whereby half of its directors would be appointed by the government and half by private shareholders and suggested that advocates of public ownership might find themselves more at home in the socialist [[Cooperative Commonwealth Federation]] than in his Liberal caucus.&lt;ref&gt;Wardhaugh 179&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Charles Stewart federal.jpg|thumb|alt=A headshot photo of a bald white man|left|Charles Stewart as a federal cabinet minister]]Despite Stewart's involvement in transferring resource rights to Alberta, his relationship with the UFA government that had defeated him in 1921 was frosty: [[Lakeland College (Alberta)|Lakeland College]] historian Franklin Foster, in his biography of UFA Premier [[John Edward Brownlee]], alleges that this antipathy influenced Stewart's preference for private corporations over the Alberta government in granting [[hydroelectric power]] permits.&lt;ref&gt;Foster 102, 147&lt;/ref&gt;  He also feuded with then-Premier Brownlee over development in Alberta's [[List of National Parks of Canada|national parks]] (Stewart favouring large-scale private development and Brownlee opposing it), causing King to record in his diary &quot;Brownlee strikes me as...being superior to Mr. Stewart, who is handicapped in his dislike of [Brownlee].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Foster 167&lt;/ref&gt;  When King sought to absorb [[Progressive Party of Canada|Progressives]] into his Liberal Party to form a stronger coalition against the Conservatives, Stewart opposed cooperation with the UFA leaders who made up a large part of the Progressives' Albertan base.&lt;ref&gt;Foster 129; Wardhaugh 66, 114&lt;/ref&gt;  While King was inclined to view UFA politicians, like Progressives elsewhere, as &quot;Liberals in a hurry&quot; who were fundamentally comfortable with his government and preferred it to the [[Conservative Party of Canada (historical)|Conservatives]],&lt;ref&gt;Wardhaugh 124, 149&lt;/ref&gt; Stewart understood that the UFA was a distinct group whose members were in many respect more conservative than liberal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wardhaugh 114&quot;&gt;Wardhaugh 114&lt;/ref&gt;  King dismissed his minister's views as being the result of Stewart's acrimonious history with the UFA.&lt;ref&gt;Wardhaugh 149&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact, Stewart did not enjoy King's confidence.&lt;ref&gt;Wardhaugh 152&lt;/ref&gt;  Though he brought him into his cabinet in 1921 in part at the urging of Progressive leader [[Thomas Crerar]], King found Stewart to be an inadequate protector of western interests—especially in his advocacy of [[tariff]] reduction, which King found lacklustre—and did not trust his political advice on the west.&lt;ref&gt;Wardhaugh 84, 87&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1925 he was considering appointing Stewart to the [[Canadian Senate|Senate]], to remove him from active political involvement, but was handicapped by the absence of any other Alberta representation in his cabinet.&lt;ref&gt;Wardhaugh 106, 114, 125&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1926 Stewart served as an emissary from King to recruit Saskatchewan Premier [[Charles Avery Dunning]] to the federal cabinet;&lt;ref&gt;Wardhaugh 111&lt;/ref&gt; the mission fulfilled, King kept Stewart in cabinet but wrote in his diary that all matters pertaining to Alberta were to be &quot;left to Dunning to do as he thinks best&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wardhaugh 114&quot; /&gt;  By 1927, King complained that Stewart had &quot;no grip&quot; on the province of which he had once been Premier,&lt;ref&gt;Wardhaugh 134&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1930 he wrote &quot;Organization in Alberta is terrible.  Stewart is worse than useless, is like an old woman, with no real control of situation.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Wardhaugh 159&lt;/ref&gt;  In the [[Canadian federal election, 1930|1930 federal election]] Dunning and Crerar were both defeated; King complained that it was &quot;perfectly terrible to have Stewart alone representing the West.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Wardhaugh 160&lt;/ref&gt;  When Stewart too went down to defeat in 1935, King was pleased &quot;not to have to consider him&quot; in assembling his new cabinet, and opted instead to leave Alberta unrepresented to punish it for failing to elect any Liberals.&lt;ref&gt;Wardhaugh 190&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-political life==

After Stewart's defeat in 1935, he was appointed by [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]] to chair the Canadian section of the [[International Joint Commission]], in recognition of his expertise on international water boundary issues.  In 1938, he was appointed chair of the Canadian section of the British Columbia – Yukon – Alaska Highway Commission.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jaques 53&quot; /&gt;  In these capacities, he travelled across Canada, visiting his son George at the family homestead near Killam at every opportunity.&lt;ref&gt;Jaques 53–54&lt;/ref&gt;  He died December 6, 1946, leaving an estate of $21,961.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jaques 55&quot;&gt;Jaques 55&lt;/ref&gt;

Born in one of Canada's original provinces, Stewart moved west as part of a vast migration to the prairies, and settled in Alberta the year it became a province.  As Alberta grew, Stewart played an increasingly important political role in it, until he joined the federal government to become Alberta's voice there, ultimately helping it achieve constitutional equality with the older provinces by transferring to its government control of its resources.  As Mackenzie King eulogized him, &quot;in more respects than one, Mr. Stewart's career mirrored the development of Canada itself.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Jaques 55&quot; /&gt;
