'''Edward Michael''' &quot;'''Ed'''&quot; '''Stelmach''', [[Legislative Assembly of Alberta|MLA]] ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|s|t|ɛ|l|m|æ|k}}; born May 11, 1951) is a [[politics of Canada|Canadian politician]] and served as the [[List of premiers of Alberta|13th Premier of Alberta]], Canada, from 2006 to 2011. The grandson of [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] immigrants, Stelmach was born and raised on a farm near [[Lamont, Alberta|Lamont]] and speaks fluent [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]]. He spent his entire pre-political adult life as a farmer, except for some time spent studying at the [[University of Alberta]]. His first foray into politics was a 1986 municipal election, when he was elected to the county council of [[Lamont County, Alberta|Lamont County]]. A year into his term, he was appointed [[reeve (Canada)|reeve]].  He continued in this position until his entry into provincial politics.

In the [[Alberta general election, 1993|1993 provincial election]], Stelmach was elected as the Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) for [[Vegreville-Viking]] (later [[Fort Saskatchewan-Vegreville]]). A [[Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta|Progressive Conservative]], he served in the [[List of Alberta provincial ministers|cabinets]] of [[Ralph Klein]]—at various times holding the portfolios of Intergovernmental Relations, Transportation, Infrastructure, and Agriculture, Food, and Rural Development—where he developed a reputation as a low-key politician who avoided the limelight. When Klein resigned the party's leadership in 2006, Stelmach was among the first to present his candidature to replace him. After a third place finish on the first ballot of the [[Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta leadership election, 2006|leadership race]], he won an upset second ballot victory over former provincial treasurer [[Jim Dinning]].

Stelmach's premiership was heavily focused on management of the province's oil reserves, especially those of the [[Athabasca Oil Sands]]. He has rejected calls from environmentalists to slow the pace of development in the [[Fort McMurray]] area, and has similarly opposed calls for [[carbon tax]]es.&lt;ref name=&quot;canada.com&quot;/&gt; Other policy initiatives have included commencing an overhaul of the province's health governance system, amendments to the Alberta human rights code, a re-introduction of all-party committees to the Legislature, and the conclusion of a major labour agreement with Alberta's teachers. His government has also attracted controversy for awarding itself a 30% pay increase shortly after its re-election, and has enjoyed strained relations with [[Calgary]], one of Klein's former strongholds.  Despite this, Stelmach increased the Progressive Conservatives' already substantial majority in the [[Alberta general election, 2008|2008 election]]. With the advent of the [[late-2000s recession]], Stelmach has had to cope with a deteriorating economic situation and the Alberta government's first budget deficit in 16 years.

Stelmach was succeeded as Premier by [[Alison Redford]] on October 7, 2011.

==Background==
Edward Michael Stelmach was born on a farm near [[Lamont, Alberta]], the grandson of immigrants from [[:uk:Завидче|Zavyche]], [[Ukraine]]. His grandparents settled near [[Andrew, Alberta]] in 1898, after bypassing [[Saskatchewan]] because they did not care for the terrain.&lt;ref name=&quot;Profile&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Profile: 'Steady Eddie' takes power on his terms |url=http://www.canada.com/edmontonjournal/story.html?id=b9b5fc9b-cafd-4587-8175-603702bd9224&amp;k=0 |work=Edmonton Journal |date=2006-12-03 |accessdate=2008-06-21 |first=Sarah |last=O'Donnell}}&lt;/ref&gt; His parents, Nancy and Michael Stelmach, had five children, of whom Edward was the youngest, ten years younger than his closest sibling.&lt;ref name=&quot;Profile&quot;/&gt; He was raised a [[Ukrainian Catholic]], and continues to attend church regularly, sing in the church choir, and act as volunteer caretaker for the cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Stelmach shares his Catholic faith |date=September 3, 2007 |url=http://www.wcr.ab.ca/news/2007/0903/stelmach090307.shtml |work=Western Catholic Reporter |date=2007-09-03 |accessdate=2008-06-21}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Through high school, he worked as a well-digger and a [[Fuller Brush Company|Fuller Brush]] salesman, where he said his grasp of Ukrainian helped him make sales.&lt;ref name=&quot;Profile&quot;/&gt; After graduating high school—his grade 12 yearbook called him a future Prime Minister of Canada—he attended the [[University of Alberta]], intending to become a lawyer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Profile&quot;/&gt; He continued there, working as an assistant manager at [[Woodward's]], until 1973, when his oldest brother, Victor, died.&lt;ref name=&quot;Profile&quot;/&gt;  While his family had intended for Victor to take over the farm that his grandparents had settled 75 years before, Stelmach dropped out of university, returned home, and bought the land from his parents.&lt;ref name=&quot;Profile&quot;/&gt; He continues to farm the land today.&lt;ref name=&quot;Profile&quot;/&gt;

As a teenager, he met Marie Warshawski at the wedding of a mutual friend. They married in 1973, and have three sons and a daughter.&lt;ref name=&quot;Profile&quot;/&gt;

Stelmach entered politics in 1986 with his election to the council of Lamont County; one year later, he was appointed county [[reeve (Canada)|reeve]], a position he held until his entry into provincial politics in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |publisher=Alberta Association of Municipal Districts &amp; Counties |title=Serving Martha &amp; Henry: Rural Municipal Government in Alberta 1983-1998 |year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bio&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.assembly.ab.ca/net/index.aspx?p=mla_bio&amp;rnumber=55 |title=Stelmach's Legislature biography |publisher=Legislative Assembly of Alberta |accessdate=2008-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==MLA and minister==
Stelmach ran for the [[Legislative Assembly of Alberta]] as a [[Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta|Progressive Conservative]] in the [[Alberta general election, 1993|1993 provincial election]], defeating incumbent [[Alberta New Democratic Party|New Democrat]] [[Derek Fox]] in the [[electoral district (Canada)|riding]] of [[Vegreville-Viking]].&lt;ref name=&quot;93 election&quot;/&gt; Stelmach became a member of the [[Deep Six (Alberta politics)|Deep Six]], a group of enthusiastically fiscally conservative rookie MLAs;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Kelly |last=Cryderman |url=http://www.canada.com/edmontonjournal/news/story.html?id=cbee085d-204c-46cf-836d-a5105cdcbafb |title=Oberg not urging support for Klein, riding association told |work=Edmonton Journal |date=March 23, 2006 |accessdate=2008-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; in addition to supporting Premier [[Ralph Klein]]'s aggressive deficit-cutting, Stelmach practiced fiscal restraint himself, incurring low office expenses and declining a government vehicle.&lt;ref name=&quot;See&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Jeremy |last=Klaszus |url=http://www.ffwdweekly.com/article/news-views/news/ed-stelmach-forgotten-years/ |title=Ed Stelmach: The Forgotten Years |work=Fast Forward Weekly |date=February 28, 2008 |accessdate=2008-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During his first term, Stelmach served as Deputy [[Parliamentary Whip|Whip]] and, later, Chief Government Whip for the P.C. caucus.&lt;ref name=&quot;See&quot;/&gt;  As a [[backbencher]], he sponsored the ''Lloydminster Hospital Act Repeal Act''. This was a government bill that dissolved the then-existing [[Lloydminster]] hospital board in preparation for an arrangement compliant with both the Alberta government's new system of regional health authorities and the [[Saskatchewan]] government's system. Lloydminster sits on the border of Alberta and Saskatchewan, and the hospital, although built and operated by the Alberta government, sits on the Saskatchewan side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite hansard | url=http://www.assembly.ab.ca/ISYS/LADDAR_files%5Cdocs%5Chansards%5Chan%5Clegislature_23%5Csession_4%5C19960220_2000_01_han.pdf | house=[[Legislative Assembly of Alberta]] | date=February 20, 1996}}.

Stelmach said that he had only stepped in to help the riding after its MLA, [[Nicholas Taylor]], had been appointed to the [[Senate of Canada|Senate]].&lt;ref name=&quot;See&quot;/&gt;

After the [[Alberta general election, 1997|1997 provincial election]], Klein appointed Stelmach Minister of Agriculture, Food, and Rural development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Christopher |last=Guly |title=Son of Ukrainian Canadian homesteaders becomes Alberta's agriculture minister|work=Ukrainian Weekly |date=1997-04-27 |url=http://www.ukrweekly.com/old/archive/1997/179709.shtml |accessdate=2008-02-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While he held this office, his department encouraged the establishment of [[feedlot]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;See&quot;/&gt; The opposition parties charged that the government was not regulating these sufficiently, but Stelmach responded that [[municipalities]] had the authority necessary to effectively regulate them.&lt;ref name=&quot;See&quot;/&gt; On the [[Canadian Wheat Board]] controversy, Stelmach sided with farmers who wanted an end to the federal body's monopoly on grain sales in the western provinces.&lt;ref name=&quot;See&quot;/&gt; Legislatively, Stelmach sponsored five bills while in the Agriculture, Food, and Rural Development portfolio, all of which passed through the legislature.&lt;ref name=&quot;1997 bills&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.assembly.ab.ca/pro/bills/s-bill97.htm |title=Bill Status Report - 24th Legislature 1st Session (1997) |publisher=Legislative Assembly of Alberta |accessdate=2008-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;1998 bills&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.assembly.ab.ca/pro/bills/s-bill98.htm |title=Bill Status Report - 24th Legislature 2nd Session (1998) |publisher=Legislative Assembly of Alberta |accessdate=2008-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  1997's ''Meat Inspection Amendment Act'' required meat inspectors to acquire a [[search warrant]] before entering a private dwelling, but also allowed for fines to be voluntarily paid without requiring a court case.&lt;ref name=&quot;May 6&quot;&gt;{{cite hansard |url=http://www.assembly.ab.ca/ISYS/LADDAR_files%5Cdocs%5Chansards%5Chan%5Clegislature_24%5Csession_1%5C19970506_2000_01_han.pdf |date=May 6, 1997 |house=Legislative Assembly of Alberta}}.

In 1999, Klein shifted Stelmach to the new Infrastructure portfolio, where he made traffic safety a priority, increasing fines for traffic offenses, sometimes by as much as 700%.&lt;ref name=&quot;See&quot;/&gt; He also briefly aroused controversy by proposing reversing the slow and fast lanes on provincial highways, on the grounds that this would equalize the rate at which the lanes broke down and therefore save on maintenance costs; nothing came of the proposal.&lt;ref name=&quot;See&quot;/&gt;  He established a fund for capital projects, but has been criticized for not doing enough to address the deterioration of the province's infrastructure.&lt;ref name=&quot;See&quot;/&gt; In 2001, Klein separated Transportation out of the Infrastructure portfolio and appointed Stelmach to it, where the new minister advocated the use of [[public-private partnership]]s to build [[ring road]]s around [[Edmonton]] and [[Calgary]].&lt;ref name=&quot;See&quot;/&gt; He also introduced a program of [[graduated driver licensing]] and initiated a review of traffic safety programs.&lt;ref name=&quot;See&quot;/&gt;  Stelmach was re-elected by his largest majority yet during the [[Alberta general election, 2001|2001 election]],&lt;ref name=&quot;2001 results&quot;/&gt; and retained the Transportation portfolio until 2004, when he was re-assigned to the position of Minister of Intergovernmental Relations.&lt;ref name=&quot;See&quot;/&gt; He resigned this position in 2006 in order to contest the [[Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta leadership election, 2006|P.C. leadership election]] (Klein had required that ministers intending to campaign to succeed him resign from cabinet).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Alta. cabinet minister Stelmach quits position|url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20060321/stelmach_post_060321/20060321?hub=Canada |publisher=CTV.ca |date=2006-03-21 |accessdate=2008-02-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As minister, Stelmach kept a low profile. Mark Lisac, who was the [[Edmonton Journal]]'s provincial affairs columnist during much of Stelmach's time in cabinet, later recalled that Stelmach &quot;never did anything that was flashy or controversial in any way&quot; and that &quot;not a thing&quot; stood out about Stelmach's ministerial service.&lt;ref name=&quot;See&quot;/&gt; This low-key style earned Stelmach the moniker &quot;Steady Eddie&quot;, which would follow him to the Premier's office.&lt;ref name=&quot;steady&quot;/&gt;

==2006 leadership election==
{{Main|Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta leadership election, 2006}}

Stelmach was the first candidate to declare his intention to run for the P.C. leadership, and picked up endorsements from nineteen members of his caucus (including cabinet ministers [[Pearl Calahasen]] and [[Iris Evans]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/calgary/story/2006/11/28/tory-endorse.html |title=Artists for Dinning, MLA Pham for Morton |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |date=2006-11-29 |accessdate= 2008-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, former provincial Treasurer [[Jim Dinning]] had twice as many caucus endorsements (despite not having held elected office since 1997) and was generally considered the race's front-runner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://thetyee.ca/Bigstory/2006/11/27/Alberta_leader/ |work=The Tyee |date=2006-11-27 |title=Albertans Turf Five in Race for New Leader |accessdate=2008-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CTV&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Opponents pledge support for Alta.'s Stelmach |url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20061202/alberta_tories_061203?s_name=&amp;no_ads= |publisher=CTV.ca |date=2006-12-03 |accessdate=2008-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stelmach ran a low-profile campaign, touring the province in a custom-painted [[campaign bus]], while most media attention was focussed on the rivalry between Dinning and the socially conservative [[Ted Morton]].&lt;ref name=&quot;steady&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/calgary/story/2006/12/02/steady-eddir.html |title=Steady Eddie made slow climb to lead Alberta Tories |date=2006-12-03 |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |accessdate=2008-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the race's rules, the three candidates receiving the most votes on the first ballot would move on to a second ballot, which would use a [[preferential ballot|preferential]] voting system to select a winner. Stelmach finished third on the first ballot with 15.3% of the vote, 3,329 votes ahead of fourth place [[Lyle Oberg]] and 10,647 votes behind second place Morton.  However, the fourth, fifth, and sixth place candidates (Oberg, [[Dave Hancock]], and [[Mark Norris (Canadian politician)|Mark Norris]]) all endorsed Stelmach for the second ballot. On this ballot, he finished in first place on the first count, fewer than five hundred votes ahead of Dinning. A majority of Morton's votes went to Stelmach on the second count, and he was elected leader.&lt;ref name=&quot;CTV&quot;/&gt;

===Energy and environmental policy===
Much of Stelmach's term as Premier has been dominated by questions related to the [[Athabasca Oil Sands]].  The rapid development of these reserves was fuelling the Alberta economy's strong growth, but also raised environmental questions. After winning the Premiership, Stelmach emphasized that he had no intention of taking measures that would slow down oilsands development and suggested that the economy would find its own appropriate growth rate.&lt;ref name=&quot;UofA&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Stelmach won't 'brake' oilsands growth |work=Edmonton Journal |date=2006-12-05 |first=Archie |last=McLean}}&lt;/ref&gt; He aggressively defended Alberta's oil at home and abroad, and called the idea that it was extracted at an unacceptably high environmental cost &quot;a myth&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Stelmach fights 'dirty' image of oilsands in Washington |work=National Post |first=Jason |last=Markusoff |date=2008-01-16 |url=http://www.nationalpost.com/news/canada/story.html?id=242318 |accessdate=2008-06-12}} {{Dead link|date=March 2012|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Stelmach defends oilsands in Washington |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/edmonton/story/2008/01/16/stelmach-washington.html |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |date=2008-01-16 |accessdate=2008-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Liberal Party of Canada]] leader [[Stéphane Dion]] proposed a federal [[carbon tax]] to reduce emissions of [[greenhouse gases]], Stelmach rejected the policy on the basis that it would hurt the economy and would unfairly penalize the western provinces.&lt;ref name=&quot;canada.com&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.canada.com/cityguides/kamloops/story.html?id=8080dbc6-543b-4be1-905e-7be4f63c357a |title=Carbon tax would hurt West: premiers |work=Calgary Herald |first=Jason |last=Fekete |date=2008-05-29 |accessdate=2008-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, he has championed the development of [[carbon capture]] technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Saskatchewan, Alberta leading the way in carbon capture, storage |work=Vancouver Sun |url=http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/news/story.html?id=78704a50-8dfd-4975-9c69-b79465f2a0c7 |date=2008-05-30 |first=James |last=Wood |accessdate=2008-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2008, Stelmach announced $2&amp;nbsp;billion worth of funding for carbon capture initiatives, for which he was applauded by industry groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.canada.com/calgaryherald/news/calgarybusiness/story.html?id=cdbc1331-af15-495f-892f-bdaabe07bf2b |title=Carbon capture plan lauded |work=Calgary Herald |date=2008-07-09 |accessdate=2008-07-14 |first=Geoffrey |last=Scotton}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[Canadian Federation of Independent Business]] called it &quot;a huge amount of money to spend on something that isn't proven&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.canada.com/calgaryherald/news/story.html?id=85c49bb4-5d8f-4f06-a572-cf411165206a |title=Critics leery of carbon storage |work=Calgary Herald |first=Renata |last=D'Aliesio |date=2008-07-10 |accessdate=2008-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mike Hudema]] of [[Greenpeace]] suggesting that there were better environmental uses of the money available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.edmontonsun.com/News/Alberta/2008/07/10/6115901-sun.html |title=Carbon-capture plan full of hot air, say critics |work=Edmonton Sun |date=2008-07-10 |first=Jeremy |last=Loome |accessdate=2008-07-14}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Syncrude mildred lake plant.jpg|thumb|right|Stelmach has been a proponent of development of the [[Athabasca Oil Sands|oil sands]].]]
Though Stelmach pledged not to do anything to curb the development of the oilsands, he did promise to review royalty rates—the rates paid by oil companies for the privilege of extracting Alberta's oil. He also committed to reducing the proportion of [[bitumen]] that left Alberta to be upgraded out of province, likening the export of bitumen to &quot;scraping off the [[top soil]]&quot; from farmland.&lt;ref name=&quot;UofA&quot;/&gt; Soon after becoming Premier, he commissioned the [[Alberta Royalty Review]] panel to make recommendations on the province's royalty regime; opposition politicians had accused the government of undercharging substantially.  Stelmach rejected many of the panel's recommendations, but did increase royalty rates by approximately 20% (25% less than recommended by the panel).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Alberta increases royalties charged to energy companies|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/calgary/story/2007/10/25/stelmach-response.html |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |date=2007-10-25 |accessdate=2008-02-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Just after the [[Alberta general election, 2008|2008 election]], Stelmach's government announced a five year royalty break worth $237&amp;nbsp;million per year to encourage development that it feared would have become uneconomical under the new plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Renata |last=D'Aliesio |title=Billion Dollar Royalty Break |work=Edmonton Journal |url=http://www.canada.com/edmontonjournal/news/story.html?id=915c98fb-eee0-4f90-9c0e-10eb94da7b11&amp;k=78771 |date=2008-04-11 |accessdate=2008-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was less decisive in increasing in-province bitumen upgrading; in 2008 he conceded that Alberta would continue upgrading between sixty and sixty-five percent of the bitumen it produced for the foreseeable future, rather than the seventy-two percent target he had previously announced for 2016.&lt;ref name=&quot;pipeline&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Tory leader panned over pipeline |date=2008-02-24 |work=Edmonton Journal |first=Jason |last=Fekete}}&lt;/ref&gt; This admission came in the wake of his government's approval of three new [[Pipeline transport|pipeline]]s designed to export bitumen.&lt;ref name=&quot;pipeline&quot;/&gt;

In January 2008, Stelmach unveiled the province's &quot;made in Alberta&quot;—as distinct from imposed by the federal government or by international treaty—plan to cut carbon emissions in order to fight [[global warming]].  The plan called for reducing [[greenhouse gas]] emissions by 14% (from 2007 levels) by 2050.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jonathan |last=Fowlie |title=Alberta premier on defensive over climate change|url=http://www.nationalpost.com/news/canada/story.html?id=269848 |work=National Post |date=2008-01-28 |accessdate=2008-02-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental groups and opposition parties suggested that this was insufficient in light of [[British Columbia]]'s plan to cut emissions by 80% (from 2007 levels) during the same period, but Stelmach argued that Alberta's position as a supplier of oil to the rest of the country justified higher emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Stelmach says Albertans approve of climate plan |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2008/01/28/federation-meeting.html?ref=rss |work=National Post |date=2008-01-28 |accessdate=2008-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed in June by the unveiling of the government's campaign to ask Albertans to make &quot;one simple act&quot;—such as [[composting]], using reusable shopping bags, and replacing [[incandescent light bulb]]s with the more efficient [[compact fluorescent lamp|fluorescent bulbs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Going green shouldn't be hard: Stelmach |work=Edmonton Journal |url=http://www.canada.com/edmontonjournal/news/story.html?id=44db859b-dba3-4af6-9caa-1f37ea530f1c |date=2008-06-11 |first=Alexandra |last=Zabjek |accessdate=2008-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents argued that the emphasis on personal responsibility by individuals did nothing to address the greater environmental damage caused by the development of the [[Athabasca Oil Sands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Graham |last=Thompson |work=Edmonton Journal |title=One Simple Act simple self-mockery |url=http://www.canada.com/edmontonjournal/news/opinion/story.html?id=ec05749e-04b8-4f2d-aa67-bf2bbc2a1c9a |date=2008-06-11 |accessdate=2008-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late April 2008 hundreds of ducks landed in a northern Alberta [[tailings pond]] belonging to [[Syncrude]], where most died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/edmonton/story/2008/04/29/oilsands-birds.html?ref=rss |title=Hundreds of ducks trapped on toxic Alberta oilsands pond |date=2008-04-29 |accessdate=2009-05-02 |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incident was a blow to Stelmach's efforts to convince the world that Alberta's oil sands were environmentally friendly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nationalpost.com/news/story.html?id=482931 |title=Syncrude faces scrutiny after ducks land on toxic pond |first=Hanneke |last=Brooymans |work=National Post |date=2008-04-30 |accessdate=2009-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of ducks that died was originally reported at around 500, but in March 2009 Syncrude revealed that the number was in fact more than 1,600. In response to accusations from opposition and environmental groups that his government, which had known the actual number since the summer of 2008, had participated in covering it up to save face, Stelmach asserted that it had refrained from making the higher number public for fear of jeopardizing its investigation of whether Syncrude had violated any provincial regulations in the incident.&lt;ref name=&quot;coverup&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.edmontonjournal.com/Business/Stelmach+denies+coverup+dead+duck+debacle/1455252/story.html |title=Stelmach denies coverup in dead duck debacle |first=Darcy |last=Henton |date=2009-04-02 |accessdate=2009-05-02 |work=Edmonton Journal |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090509085757/http://www.edmontonjournal.com/Business/Stelmach+denies+coverup+dead+duck+debacle/1455252/story.html &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt; |archivedate=May 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Investigations were centred around the questions of whether Syncrude had immediately reported the incident as required (the government had first heard of it from an anonymous tip, though Syncrude reported it several hours later) and whether the company had the required measures in place to prevent ducks from landing on its tailings ponds (it had noisemakers designed to deter waterfowl, but these had not been set up at the time of the incident due to winter weather conditions).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Syncrude not off the hook for duck incident: Stelmach |url=http://www.nationalpost.com/news/story.html?id=493749 |first=Kelly |last=Cryderman |date=2008-05-05 |accessdate=2009-05-02 |work=National Post |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090509144013/http://www.nationalpost.com/news/story.html?id=493749 &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt; |archivedate=May 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Syncrude was eventually charged with &quot;failing to have systems in place to divert waterfowl&quot;, which carries a maximum fine of $800,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;coverup&quot;/&gt;

Partially in an effort to counter-act negative publicity from oil sands-related issues—for example, the March 2009 edition of ''[[National Geographic Magazine]]'' contained a 20 page article portraying Alberta's oil sands operations as being highly environmentally damaging&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2009/02/25/oilsands-articles.html |title=Prentice defends oilsands following National Geographic article |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |date=2009-02-25 |accessdate=2009-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;—in 2009 Stelmach's government spent $25&amp;nbsp;million on a [[rebranding]] campaign for the province. Among other things, it replaced the &quot;Alberta Advantage&quot; slogan that had long been in use with &quot;Alberta: Freedom to create.  Spirit to achieve.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/calgary/story/2009/03/25/cgy-alberta-new-slogan-logo.html |title=Province dumps 'Alberta Advantage' for new brand |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |date=2009-03-25 |accessdate=2009-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign became the subject of some ridicule when the ''[[Edmonton Journal]]'' revealed that one of the photos used in it was not taken in Alberta, but at a [[North Sea]] beach in [[Northumberland]]. While the government initially claimed that it had intentionally used a foreign image to represent Alberta's engagement with the world, it later admitted that this was not the case, and that the photo had been used in error.  Stelmach responded to the image, which showed two children running along a beach, by saying that ''&quot;children, no matter where they are around the world, they are the next generation. And air quality, water quality, no matter where we live on this big globe, we're all responsible, and that's the message we're trying to portray.&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/calgary/story/2009/04/24/edm-alberta-ad-england-photo-beach.html?ref=rss |title='We screwed up', Alberta admits after using British beach photo in ads |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |date=2009-04-24 |accessdate=2009-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Energy and Utilities Board affair and land use policy===
In June 2007, the government-mandated [[Alberta Energy and Utilities Board]] admitted that it had hired [[private investigators]] to spy on landowners who opposed the construction of a major power line in the [[Rimbey, Alberta|Rimbey]] area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jim |last=Farrell |title='Heads must roll' Mason says |work=Edmonton Journal |url=http://www.canada.com/edmontonjournal/news/story.html?id=6cbdaa1e-ce15-4a60-b6ec-a8cb7d73b816 |date=2007-08-17 |accessdate=2008-02-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Stelmach initially downplayed the incident, but ordered a judicial investigation once the province's Information and Privacy Commissioner initiated an investigation of his own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Alberta energy board's use of private eyes under investigation |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/calgary/story/2007/06/26/eub-spying.html |date=2007-06-26 |accessdate=2008-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This investigation found that the EUB had violated provincial law and infringed on the landowners' privacy, while the judicial investigation criticized the EUB's tactics as &quot;repulsive&quot;.

Stelmach's government also responded with legislation entitled the ''Alberta Utilities Commission Act'' (Bill 46), which would split the EUB into two parts: the Alberta Utilities Commission (responsible for regulating utilities) and the Energy Resources Conservation Board (responsible for regulating oil and gas). The legislation was controversial, as elements of the EUB's governing legislation that provided for public notice and consultation in the event of energy construction projects were left out. Opposition parties and advocacy groups charged that this was an assault on both landowners' rights and the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Environmentalists dressed as spies protest Bill 46 |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/edmonton/story/2007/11/15/greenpeace-bill46.html?ref=rss |date=2007-11-15 |accessdate=2008-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legislation ultimately passed, and took effect at the beginning of 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Marathon legislative session breaks record |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/edmonton/story/2007/12/05/bill46-passed.html |date=2007-12-05 |accessdate=2008-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stelmach clashed with rural landowners again in 2009 when his government introduced the ''Land Assembly Project Area Act'', designed to make it easier for the government to acquire large blocks of land for public purposes such as [[ring road]]s or [[reservoir]]s. The Act allowed the government to identify land that it may be interested in [[Eminent domain|expropriating]] at some point in the future and to indefinitely prohibit any development on that land that could conflict with the government's purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bill 19 toxic to rural landowners |url=http://www2.canada.com/edmontonjournal/news/ideas/story.html?id=17b0ebf6-d3df-47ab-9484-2378f625a3ba|first=Paula |last=Simons |date=2009-03-14 |accessdate=2009-04-30 |work=Edmonton Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite vigorous opposition from landowners and the opposition parties, the bill passed the legislature in late April.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Land assembly bill passes, despite calls for changes |url=http://www.edmontonjournal.com/news/Land+assembly+bill+passes+despite+calls+changes/1548655/story.html |first=Darcy |last=Henton |work=Edmonton Journal |date=2009-04-30 |accessdate=2009-04-30 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090502175525/http://www.edmontonjournal.com/news/Land+assembly+bill+passes+despite+calls+changes/1548655/story.html &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt; |archivedate=May 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fiscal policy===
Ralph Klein's major focus for much of his premiership had been the elimination of the provincial [[Government budget deficit|deficit]], and the government ran a record $8.9&amp;nbsp;billion surplus during Stelmach's first year in office.&lt;ref name=&quot;Citizen&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www2.canada.com/ottawacitizen/news/story.html?id=a4ffc7a5-bd13-4159-a44b-ab2fbd32d413&amp;k=98334 |title=Alberta records $8.9B surplus |first=Jason |last=Markusuoff |work=[[Ottawa Citizen]] |date=2007-06-21 |accessdate=2009-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Alberta was in the midst of a major [[economic expansion]] driven by high energy prices and major oilsands development.  This growth continued into 2007–2008, when the government's surplus was $4.6&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref name=&quot;surplus 07&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/edmonton/story/2008/06/24/edm-surplus.html |title=Alberta posts $4.6B surplus for 2007–2008 |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |date=2008-06-24 |accessdate=2009-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Both of these surpluses were higher than expected, and Stelmach's government followed a policy of placing one third of unanticipated surpluses into savings and two thirds into construction projects.&lt;ref name=&quot;Citizen&quot;/&gt; Critics, including Liberal MLA [[Laurie Blakeman]] and the [[Canadian Taxpayers Federation]], charged that the government was not saving enough money in anticipation of a fall in energy prices.&lt;ref name=&quot;surplus 07&quot;/&gt;

In her April 2008 budget, Stelmach's Finance Minister [[Iris Evans]] forecast a $1.6&amp;nbsp;billion surplus for 2008–2009. By August, she had revised this prediction to $8.5&amp;nbsp;billion. The major reason for this change is an increase in oil prices: while she had estimated in April that they would average $78 per barrel over the fiscal year, by August increases—including a high of $147 per barrel in July—have led her to make a new estimate of a $119.25 per barrel average. By November, prices had fallen to $55 per barrel, and Evans estimated a $2&amp;nbsp;billion surplus. By February 2009, the government of Alberta appeared poised to run a $1&amp;nbsp;billion deficit. In April 2009, Evans released her budget for 2009–2010, in which she anticipated a $4.6&amp;nbsp;billion deficit. This is the largest deficit in Alberta's history, and its first in sixteen years. The government's fiscal plan includes deficits until 2012–2013, when it again anticipates a surplus.&lt;ref name=&quot;Timeline&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.globaltv.com/globaltv/national/story.html?id=1474369 |title=Boom to bust: an economic timeline of Alberta |date=2009-04-07 |accessdate=2009-05-01 |first=Ashley |last=Terry |publisher=Global Television |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090509201344/http://www.globaltv.com/globaltv/national/story.html?id=1474369 &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt; |archivedate=May 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stelmach's approach to this deteriorating fiscal situation, part of a [[Late-2000s recession|global recession]], has been to invest heavily in infrastructure in an effort to stimulate the economy and take advantage of low construction costs.  He has gone so far as to advocate borrowing for capital construction, a departure from the Klein government's notoriously anti-debt approach.&lt;ref name=&quot;Timeline&quot;/&gt;  However, his government was also one of only two in Canada (the other being [[Saskatchewan]]'s) to cut overall spending in the 2009–2010 budget. This approach drew the ire of Liberal leader [[David Swann]], who supported increased government spending for [[economic stimulus]] purposes, but drew support from some economists and was defended by Evans on the basis that capital spending was at twice the per capital level of the Canadian average.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Alta. cuts while most governments spend big on stimulus |url=http://www2.canada.com/topics/news/story.html?id=1478474 |first=David |last=Akin |publisher=CanWest News Services |date=2009-04-08 |accessdate=2009-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Teachers pension liability===
During his first year in office, Stelmach and his education minister [[Ron Liepert]] concluded a deal with the [[Alberta Teachers Association]] (ATA) in which the province agreed to contribute $2.1&amp;nbsp;billion towards the $6.6&amp;nbsp;billion unfunded pension liability.  This liability resulted from insufficient contributions to the teachers' pension plan during the period leading up to 1992. In exchange, the ATA agreed to a five-year contract extension. The deal was applauded by the opposition [[Alberta Liberal Party|Liberals]] and [[Alberta New Democratic Party|New Democrats]], but was criticized by the [[Canadian Taxpayers Federation]], which called for a [[plebiscite]] on the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Province offers teachers pension settlement |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/edmonton/story/2007/11/15/teachers-pension.html |accessdate=2008-02-12 | date=November 15, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pay increases===
Shortly after winning an increased majority in the [[Alberta general election, 2008|2008 election]], Stelmach's cabinet approved substantial raises for themselves, increasing the salary paid to cabinet ministers from $142,000 to $184,000 and that paid to the Premier from $159,450 to $213,450. The increases also affect the [[severance package|severance]] paid to ministers who resign or are defeated in elections—under the program implemented by [[Ralph Klein]]'s government to replace the previously existing [[pension]] program, departing MLAs receive three months' pay for every year they served, with the level of the pay based on their three highest-earning years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/edmonton/story/2008/06/05/mla-severance.html |title=Premier, Speaker in line for $1M payouts |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |date=2008-06-05 |accessdate=2008-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The increases were attacked by the [[Canadian Taxpayers Federation]] and the opposition parties, but Stelmach defended the raises as the first received by cabinet ministers in fifteen years and as being necessary to attract qualified people to politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/edmonton/story/2008/06/02/edm-stelmach-pay.html?ref=rss |title=Stelmach unrepentant over hefty cabinet pay hikes |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |date=2008-06-02 |accessdate=2008-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2009, in response to the [[Late-2000s recession]], Stelmach announced that his caucus would decline an automatic 4.9% cost of living pay increase.  The following week, the legislature's all-party Standing Committee on Member Services extended this to all MLAs by voting unanimously to freeze MLA salaries for the fiscal year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.edmontonjournal.com/news/Committee+votes+freeze+MLAs+salaries/1253036/story.html |title=Committee votes to freeze MLAs' salaries |first=Darcy |last=Henton |date=2009-02-04 |accessdate=2009-04-30 |work=Edmonton Journal |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090509085924/http://www.edmontonjournal.com/news/Committee+votes+freeze+MLAs+salaries/1253036/story.html &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt; |archivedate=May 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health policy===
Stelmach's policy on health care has been highlighted by his removal of the province's health care premiums effective the end of 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/edmonton/story/2008/04/22/budget-alta.html |title=Alberta budget to eliminate health-care premiums by 2009 |date=2008-04-22 |accessdate=2008-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Critics had denounced the premiums as being regressive, both because they were the same amount regardless of the payer's income and because people with better-paying jobs often had their premiums covered by their employer. The opposition [[Alberta Liberal Party|Liberal]] and [[New Democratic Party of Alberta|New Democratic]] parties had long called for their removal.&lt;ref name=&quot;premiums&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.canada.com/edmontonjournal/news/story.html?id=5d9ebfde-6d2b-465d-9aba-ebe543cb5ff5&amp;k=91174 |work=Edmonton Journal |title=Stelmach gov't pledges to axe health-care premiums |date=2008-02-04 |accessdate=2008-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This elimination was announced in a [[throne speech]] immediately before the dissolution of the [[Legislative Assembly of Alberta|legislature]] for the [[Alberta general election, 2008|2008 election]], although it was initially promised to take effect by 2012.&lt;ref name=&quot;premiums&quot;/&gt; During this campaign, Stelmach promised to increase the capacity of Alberta universities to train doctors and nurses over four years, eventually resulting in the graduation of 225 more doctors, 350 more [[registered nurse]]s, and 220 [[licensed practical nurse]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/albertavotes2008/story/2008/02/05/stelmach-doctors.html |title=Stelmach unveils plan to train more doctors and nurses |date=2008-02-05 |accessdate=2008-06-12 |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the registrar of the [[Alberta College of Physicians and Surgeons]] called the plan unfeasible, Health Minister [[Dave Hancock]] clarified that most of the increase would in fact come from the immigration of foreign doctors to Alberta, rather than from in-province training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20080205/stelmach_080205/20080206/ |publisher=CTV.ca |title=Alta campaign features promises, accusations |date=2008-02-06 |accessdate=2008-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the election, Stelmach's new Minister of Health, [[Ron Liepert]], released the government's new health plan. In it, Liepert refused to characterize the problems in the health care system as being the result of [[doctor shortage]]s, and instead promised structural reforms. He indicated that these may include consolidating [[Health regions of Canada|health authorities]], closing rural hospitals, and de-listing some health services from coverage under the province's [[universal health care|public health insurance]] scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |title=Stelmach's Health Plan |url=http://cbc.ca/edmonton/media/video/newsatsix/20080417HEALTH_PLAN_realplayer_1.ram |date=2008-04-16 |accessdate=2008-06-12 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080625145719/http://www.cbc.ca/edmonton/media/video/newsatsix/20080417HEALTH_PLAN_realplayer_1.ram &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt; |archivedate=June 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May, the government took the first step in implementing these structural reforms by combining the province's nine health authorities into one health &quot;superboard&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.canada.com/edmontonjournal/news/story.html?id=4b0743f0-2046-4b13-8be7-7e2e4ca7e10d |work=Edmonton Journal |first=Jason |last=Markusoff |title=Tories create health superboard |date=2008-05-16 |accessdate=2008-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2008, three senior health officials announced that they would be leaving the province's employment at the expiration of their contracts in August. Liepert blamed their departures on better offers from other employers, although New Democrat leader [[Brian Mason]] speculated that the government's health restructuring may have been to blame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Alberta loses 4 top public health doctors over salaries |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |url=http://www.cbc.ca/health/story/2008/06/10/topdocs-leaving.html |date=2008-06-10 |accessdate=2008-06-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Detractors pointed out that the optics of allowing the employees to depart for more money elsewhere soon after the government had approved a substantial pay hike for cabinet ministers were not good.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Canadian Press |last= |title=Alberta loses three senior physicians |work=The Calgary Sun |url=http://calsun.canoe.ca/News/Alberta/2008/06/11/5839746-sun.html |date=2008-06-11 |accessdate=2008-06-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the province's fiscal situation worsened in late 2008, the government adapted its health policy. In December, Liepert announced a new seniors drug plan that made drugs free for seniors making less than $21,325 but required those making more to pay as much as $7,500 for their drugs. In response to protests from seniors, he amended the plan in April 2009 to reduce both the income level at which seniors would have to start paying and the amount which those seniors would have to pay. Liepert said that the plan, $10 million more expensive than the one he had announced in December, would see 60% of seniors pay less than they did under the status quo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www2.canada.com/calgaryherald/news/story.html?id=16bda824-937a-4e3f-8e69-23e826012fde&amp;p=1|title=Tories retreat on drug plan |first=Michelle |last=Lang |work=Calgary Herald |date=2009-04-24 |accessdate=2009-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same month, Stelmach's government's budget revealed changes to which medical services it would cover: those de-listed included [[chiropractic]] services, at an annual savings of $53 million, and [[sex change]] operations, at an annual savings of $700,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.edmontonsun.com/News/Edmonton/2009/04/16/9139286.html |first=Kerry |last=Diotte |work=Edmonton Sun |date=2009-04-16 |title=Stelmach questions inter-governmental health transfers arrangement |accessdate=2009-05-02}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the [[Canada Health Act]] requires the federal government to financially penalize provinces that do not support all &quot;medically necessary&quot; procedures, Liepert maintained that the de-listed services were not &quot;medically necessary&quot; from the perspective of the Act, and said that he anticipated no trouble from the federal government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Alberta 'can't carry the country,' says premier asking for federal cash|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/story/2009/04/16/cgy-alberta-health-delist-ottawa-transfers.html|date=2009-04-16 |publisher=The Canadian Press |accessdate=2009-05-02 |first=Jim |last=Macdonald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[2009 H1N1 pandemic]], Stelmach initially announced that the government would make the [[H1N1 vaccine|vaccine]] available to all Albertans, though vaccine shortages resulted in a limited number of clinics, which experienced long lineups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.calgaryherald.com/health/Stelmach+defends+wait+times+Calgary+H1N1+clinics/2152342/story.html |title=Stelmach defends long lineups at Calgary H1N1 clinics |work=Calgary Herald |last=Lang |first=Michelle |author2=Renata D'Aliesio |date=October 29, 2009 |accessdate=2009-11-07 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20091102021207/http://www.calgaryherald.com/health/Stelmach+defends+wait+times+Calgary+H1N1+clinics/2152342/story.html &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt; |archivedate=November 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In response, Liberal leader [[David Swann]] accused the government of managing limited vaccine supplies poorly by not giving priority to the most vulnerable groups.  Liepert defended the government's record by saying that high risk populations had been given priority, but that the government's policy was to turn nobody away; he blamed many of the problems on the federal government's delivery to the province of fewer doses of the vaccine than promised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.calgaryherald.com/health/Stelmach+defends+health+leadership+amid+revamp/2174513/story.html |title=Stelmach defends health leadership amid revamp |date=2009-11-03 |accessdate=2009-11-07 |work=Calgary Herald |last=Lang |first=Michelle |author2=Renata D'Aliesio |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20091105035703/http://www.calgaryherald.com/health/Stelmach+defends+health+leadership+amid+revamp/2174513/story.html &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt; |archivedate=November 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Further controversy erupted when it was revealed that hockey players on the [[Calgary Flames]] were vaccinated with vaccine received directly from Alberta Health, which prompted Stelmach to announce an investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/calgary/story/2009/11/03/calgary-flames-h1n1-swine-flu-shot.html |title=Calgary Flames skip flu vaccine lineups |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |date=2009-11-03 |accessdate=2009-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Two Alberta Health employees were fired as a result of the investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/story/2009/11/06/calgary-flames-flu-shot-clinic-fired-alberta-health.html |title=2nd health worker fired for Flames H1N1 vaccination |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |date=2009-11-06 |accessdate=2009-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human Rights, Citizenship, and Multiculturalism Act===
In spring 2009, Stelmach's government announced its intention to overhaul the Alberta ''Human Rights, Citizenship, and Multiculturalism Act''.&lt;ref name=&quot;human rights&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www2.canada.com/calgaryherald/news/story.html?id=84bb24c7-ecb4-448f-b853-6e76426a0f02 |first=Jason |last=Fekete |title=Alberta Tories gear up for human rights code overhaul |work=Calgary Herald |date=2009-03-18 |accessdate=2009-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1998's ''[[Vriend v. Alberta]]'', the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] had found that the legislation's failure to include sexual orientation among the grounds on which discrimination was prohibited violated the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] and had &quot;read in&quot; this protection. However, the text of the act continued not to mention sexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/calgary/story/2008/04/02/vriend-anniversary.html |title=Alberta 'childish' in lack of gay rights protection, activist says |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |date=2008-04-02 |accessdate=2009-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gay rights activists and opposition politicians hoped that the government's proposed changes to the Act would change this.&lt;ref name=&quot;human rights&quot;/&gt; Conservatives and libertarians, including [[National Post]] columnist [[Colby Cosh]], hoped that the changes would also include removal of a section of the act empowering the Alberta Human Rights Commission to investigate and prosecute complaints of publications &quot;exposing a person or a class of persons to contempt,&quot; believing that the powers granted to the commission amounted to [[censorship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Colby |last=Cosh |work=National Post |date=2009-02-20 |title=Alberta eyes a return to saner days of human rights rules |accessdate=2009-05-02 |url=http://network.nationalpost.com/np/blogs/fullcomment/archive/2009/02/20/colby-cosh-alberta-eyes-a-return-to-saner-days-of-human-rights-rules.aspx}} {{Dead link|date=March 2012|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This section had been used to try to prosecute [[Ezra Levant]] for publishing the cartoons at the centre of the [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy]] in his ''[[Western Standard]]'' magazine, and to successfully prosecute the ''[[Red Deer Advocate]]'' for publishing a letter to the editor entitled &quot;Homosexual agenda wicked&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;HR changes&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Alberta Tories move to enshrine gay rights |url=http://www.canada.com/story_print.html?id=a568105f-5ff9-4fb7-abe8-d5ceeaeb861d&amp;sponsor=|first=Jason |last=Fekete |date=2009-04-29 |accessdate=2009-05-02 |work=Calgary Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The changes that were eventually tabled included the enshrining of sexual orientation as protected grounds but not the removal of the section dealing with &quot;exposing to contempt.&quot; This omission was criticized, Levant said that it made him &quot;deeply embarrassed as a conservative,&quot; but Stelmach said that his caucus was comfortable that another provision, requiring that the impugned section should not &quot;be deemed to interfere with the free expression of opinion on any subject&quot;, protected Albertans against its abusive use.&lt;ref name=&quot;HR changes&quot;/&gt; The proposal also included a section entitling parents to advance notice from schools if their children were going to be taught &quot;subject-matter that deals explicitly with religion, sexuality or sexual orientation&quot; and the right to remove their children from such classes.

Stelmach called this a &quot;very, very fundamental right&quot; and suggested that it would allow parents to opt out of having their children learn about [[evolution]], though his Education Minister [[Dave Hancock]] argued that the new wording didn't extend beyond current practice. [[Alberta Teachers' Association]] President [[Frank Bruseker]] expressed concern that this would make the teaching of science and geography in public schools very difficult, and suggested that parents who did not wish to have their children exposed to evolution should [[home school]] them or send them to [[private school]]. New Democratic Party leader [[Brian Mason]] suggested that the changes would make Alberta &quot;sound like [[Arkansas]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Evolution classes optional under proposed Alberta law |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/calgary/story/2009/04/30/cgy-bill-evolution-law-alberta-classes-teachers.html |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |date=2009-04-30 |accessdate=2009-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Democratic reform===
[[Image:Day276alegislatureb.JPG|thumb|right|Stelmach returned all-party committees to the [[Legislative Assembly of Alberta]], where they had not existed since early in [[Ralph Klein]]'s tenure.]]

Klein's government had received criticism for reducing the importance of the legislature by sitting it fewer days than any other province's legislature and for directing business through standing policy committees of the Progressive Conservative caucus. These committees met in private, unlike the legislature's all-party committees, which fell almost entirely out of use during the Klein years. In April 2007, Stelmach initiated the creation of four new legislative &quot;policy field committees&quot; which would include opposition representation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Sheila |last=Pratt |title=Stelmach gov't takes first steps towards democratic reform|url=http://www.canada.com/edmontonjournal/news/opinion/story.html?id=070341d8-f23f-4061-ae7d-5ad8fed99826 |work=Edmonton Journal |date=2007-05-06 |accessdate=2008-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same month, his government introduced new legislation on [[conflicts of interest]], such that former cabinet ministers would have to wait one year before doing business with the government or lobbying it on behalf of third parties (up from six months). It also created a similar cooling-off period for senior bureaucrats, which lasted six months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/calgary/story/2007/04/19/conflict-rules.html |title=Alberta to tighten conflict-of-interest rules for top bureaucrats, legislators |date=2007-04-19 |accessdate=2008-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, an [[Order in Council]] passed by Stelmach's cabinet shortly before the [[Alberta general election, 2008|2008 election]] delayed the implementation of these rules until one month after the election, meaning that cabinet ministers who retired or lost their bids for re-election would be exempt from the new rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jason |last=Markusoff |title=Ex-MLAs, aides get a free ride out|url=http://www.canada.com/edmontonjournal/news/story.html?id=97b4a799-f7f7-4478-9fb3-3a105633e8d0 |work=Edmonton Journal |date=2008-02-07 |accessdate=2008-02-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationship with Calgary===
Many [[Calgary|Calgarians]] have been critical of Stelmach, suggesting that, as a farmer from the central part of the province, he is biased against Calgary and urban Alberta in general. They pointed to the fact that the city, which was considered the heartland of [[Jim Dinning]]'s support during the leadership race, had only three members ([[Ron Liepert]], [[Ron Stevens]], and [[Greg Melchin]]) in his first eighteen-member cabinet (Stelmach supporters pointed out that [[Edmonton]] had only one minister, [[Dave Hancock]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jason |last=Markusoff |title=Stelmach defends cabinet choices |work=Edmonton Journal |url=http://www.canada.com/edmontonjournal/news/story.html?id=7d861094-ab76-457b-8301-a57c28f5c12f&amp;k=0 |date=2006-12-15 |accessdate=2008-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Stelmach names smaller cabinet |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/calgary/story/2006/12/15/cabinet-stelmach.html |date=2006-12-15 |accessdate=2008-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stelmach also found himself in a feud with Calgary mayor [[Dave Bronconnier]] during his first year as premier as Bronconnier accused Stelmach of failing to keep a promise to the city regarding infrastructure spending during his first budget.&lt;ref name=&quot;monolith&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Nicholas |last=Kohler |title=Cracks in the Tory monolith |work=Maclean's magazine |url=http://www.macleans.ca/article.jsp?content=20070521_105232_105232&amp;source=srch |date=2007-05-21 |accessdate=2008-02-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Dawn |last=Walton |title=Calgary poised to go Liberal, party leader says |work=Globe and Mail |url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20080209.walberta09/BNStory/National/home |date=2008-02-09 |accessdate=2008-02-12 |location=Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several Stelmach supporters suggested that the mayor, a [[Alberta Liberal Party|Liberal]], might be angling to take over as leader of the official opposition if [[Kevin Taft]] fumbled.&lt;ref name=&quot;monolith&quot;/&gt; During the by-election to fill [[Ralph Klein]]'s [[Calgary Elbow]] seat, P.C. candidate Brian Heninger went so far as to tell a voter he'd like to choke his party's leader (Stelmach told media that this was the sort of enthusiasm he wanted from his MLAs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=CP |last= |title=Disgruntled Voters in Alberta |work=Edmonton Sun |url= http://www.edmontonsun.com/News/Alberta/2007/06/10/4250096.html

After Deputy Premier [[Ron Stevens]] resigned his [[Calgary-Glenmore]] seat to accept a judgeship, a 2009 by-election elected outgoing [[Wildrose Alliance Party]] (WRA) leader [[Paul Hinman]] to replace him.  Hinman had been the WRA's only MLA until he lost his [[Cardston-Taber-Warner]] to Progressive Conservative [[Broyce Jacobs]] in the 2008 election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/calgary/story/2009/09/14/calgary-glenmore-byelection-results-hinman-roberts-urquhart.html |title=Wildrose Alliance wins Calgary-Glenmore byelection |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |date=2009-09-14 |accessdate=2009-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Shortly after Hinman's election, polls showed that the Wildrose Alliance, under new leader [[Danielle Smith]], was the second most popular party province-wide, and led the Conservatives 34 percent to 30 percent in Calgary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://erg.environics.net/media_room/default.asp?aID=713 |title=The Wildrose Alliance is gaining ground; Conservative support shrinking. |publisher=Environics Research Group |date=November 5, 2009 |accessdate=2009-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Politics and public opinion===
Critics at first compared Stelmach to [[Harry Strom]], the last [[Social Credit Party of Alberta|Social Credit]] premier of the province.  Strom was regarded as honest but ineffective and lacking charisma; he survived only long enough as Premier to lose the [[Alberta general election, 1971|1971 election]] soundly. Thus ended the last long one-party rule, and observers asked if history would repeat with Stelmach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Dawn |last=Walton |title=Stelmach confronts ghost of Harry Strom |work=Globe and Mail |url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/Page/document/v5/content/subscribe?user_URL=http://www.theglobeandmail.com%2Fservlet%2FArticleNews%2Ffreeheadlines%2FLAC%2F20061204%2FSTROM04%2Fnational%2FNational&amp;ord=22852337&amp;brand=theglobeandmail&amp;force_login=true |date=2006-12-04 |accessdate=2008-02-12 |location=Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Ross |last=Moroz |title=Vuepoint |work=Vue Weekly |url=http://www.vueweekly.com/article.php?id=6276 |date=2007-05-16 |accessdate=2008-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Stelmach's landslide win in the [[Alberta general election, 2008|2008 election]], however, the comparisons largely ceased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nationalpost.com/opinion/story.html?id=353578 |title=Alberta wins |work=National Post |date=2008-03-05 |accessdate=2009-04-30 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090509144037/http://www.nationalpost.com/opinion/story.html?id=353578 &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt; |archivedate=May 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2009, the Conservatives' plunging  popularity at the polls and the surge in support for the right-wing Wildrose Alliance led to speculation that Stelmach would receive lukewarm support at his mandatory [[leadership review]], to be held at the November 2009 Progressive Conservative convention. Klein's resignation came in the wake of his receiving only 55% support at such a review, and Klein suggested that Stelmach should resign if he received less than 70%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.albertalocalnews.com/reddeeradvocate/news/provincial/Leadership_test_69370697.html |title=Leadership test for Ed |work=[[Red Deer Advocate]] |date=November 6, 2009 |accessdate=2009-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The question was whether party leaders would blame Stelmach for the party's decline and look for new leadership in the face of Stelmach's own weakening poll numbers.  Instead, Stelmach met the criterion set up by his critics and won 77.4% support, a strong endorsement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/edmonton/story/2009/11/07/edmonton-stelmach-leadership-vote.html?ref=rss |title=Stelmach wins 77% support for leadership |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |date=2009-11-07 |accessdate=2009-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{title=Stelmach receives 77.4% support |url=http://www.edmontonsun.com/news/alberta/2009/11/07/11671286.html |work=Edmonton Sun |date=2009-11-07 |accessdate=2009-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Resignation===
On January 25, 2011, Stelmach announced that he would not seek re-election; he also promised a leadership race before the next election.&lt;ref&gt;Alberta Premier Ed Stelmach to step down.  Globe and Mail.  http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/alberta-premier-ed-stelmach-to-step-down/article1882290/&lt;/ref&gt; He did not specify his date of resignation at that time, however he submitted his letter of resignation in June, writing that he would leave office on October 1. In the early hours of October 2, 2011, [[Alison Redford]] was declared the new leader of the party, and Stelmach resigned as premier on October 7.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Alison Redford sworn in as Alberta Premier |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/story/2011/10/06/edmonton-redford-sworn-in.html |publisher=CBC News |date=October 7, 2011 |accessdate=October 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
