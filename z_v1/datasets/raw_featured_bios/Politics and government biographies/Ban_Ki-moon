'''Ban Ki-moon''' ({{ko-hhrm|hangul=반기문}}, [[Hanja]]: {{linktext|潘|基|文}}; born 13 June 1944) is the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations#Secretaries-General|eighth and current]] [[Secretary-General of the United Nations#Secretaries-General|Secretary-General]]  of the [[United Nations]], after succeeding [[Kofi Annan]] in 2007. Before going on to be Secretary-General, Ban was a career diplomat in South Korea's [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (South Korea)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] and in the United Nations. He entered [[diplomatic service]] the year he graduated from university, accepting his first post in [[New Delhi, India]]. In the foreign ministry he established a reputation for modesty and competence.

Ban was the [[foreign minister|Foreign Minister]] of the [[South Korea|Republic of Korea]] from January 2004 to November 2006. In February 2006, he began to campaign for the office of Secretary-General. Ban was initially considered to be a long shot for the office. As foreign minister of South Korea, however, he was able to travel to all of the countries that were members of the [[United Nations Security Council]], a maneuver that turned him into the front runner.

On 11 October 2006, he was elected to be the eighth Secretary-General by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] and officially succeeded Annan on 1 January 2007. Ban has led several major reforms regarding peacekeeping and UN employment practices. Diplomatically, Ban has taken particularly strong views on [[Darfur conflict|Darfur]], where he helped persuade Sudanese President [[Omar al-Bashir]] to allow peacekeeping troops to enter [[Sudan]]; and on [[global warming]], pressing the issue repeatedly with former U.S. President [[George W. Bush]]. Ban has received strong criticism from [[United Nations Office of Internal Oversight Services|OIOS]], the UN internal audit unit, stating that the secretariat, under Ban's leadership, is &quot;drifting into irrelevance&quot;.&lt;ref name=OIOS&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.foreignpolicy.com/files/fp_uploaded_documents/100719_0_ahleniussummary.pdf|title = Ahlenius End of Assignment Report|date = 2010-06-14|accessdate = 2012-01-16|work = [[Foreign Policy]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Ban ran unopposed for a second term as Secretary-General. On 21 June 2011, he was unanimously re-elected by the General Assembly and therefore will continue to serve until 31 December 2016.&lt;ref name=unAppointSecond&gt;{{cite web | publisher=UN News Service | title=General Assembly appoints Ban Ki-moon to second term as UN Secretary-General |url=http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=38797&amp;Cr=secretary-general&amp;Cr1= | date=21 June 2011 | accessdate=21 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=secondAppointUnan&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/06/21/us-un-election-idUSTRE75K5XZ20110621 | title= U.N. assembly approves second term for U.N. chief Ban | author=Louis Charbonneau | date=21 June 2011 | accessdate=22 June 2011 | agency=Reuters }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Ban was born in [[Eumseong County|Eumseong]] in a small farming village in [[Chungcheongbuk-do|North Chungcheong]], in 1944 at the end of the [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese rule of Korea]]. His family moved to the nearby town of [[Chungju]], where he was raised.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT 12-22&quot;/&gt; During Ban's childhood, his father had a warehouse business, but the warehouse went bankrupt and the family lost its middle-class standard of living. When Ban was six, his family fled to a remote mountainside for the duration of the [[Korean War]].&lt;ref name=Times12-09/&gt; After the war ended, his family returned to [[Chungju]]. Ban has mentioned meeting [[Military of the United States|U.S. military]] troops at this time.&lt;ref name=LAT10-09/&gt;

In secondary school ([[Chungju High School]]), Ban became a star pupil, particularly in his studies of [[English language|English]]. In 1952, he was selected by his class to address a message to then UN Secretary-General [[Dag Hammarskjöld]], but it is unknown if the message was ever sent. In 1962, Ban won an essay contest sponsored by the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross]] and earned a trip to the [[United States]] where he lived in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] with a host family for several months.&lt;ref name=FT10-10/&gt; As part of the trip, Ban met U.S. President [[John F. Kennedy]].&lt;ref name=Times12-09/&gt; When a journalist at the meeting asked Ban what he wanted to be when he grew up, he said, &quot;I want to become a diplomat.&quot;&lt;ref name=LAT10-09/&gt;

He received a [[bachelor's degree|B.A.]] in [[international relations|International Relations]] from [[Seoul National University]] in 1970, and earned a [[Master of Public Administration]] from the [[John F. Kennedy School of Government]] at [[Harvard University]] in 1985.&lt;ref name=LAT10-09&gt;{{Cite news|title = Aspiring U.N.

In addition to his native [[Korean language|Korean]], Ban speaks English, [[French language|French]], and [[Japanese language|Japanese]]. There have been questions, however, regarding the extent of his knowledge of French, one of the two working languages of the [[United Nations Secretariat]].&lt;ref name=Phoney/&gt;

==Family==
Ban Ki-moon met Yoo Soon-taek in 1962 when they were both high school students. Ban was 18 years old, and Yoo Soon-taek was his secondary school's student council president. Ban Ki-moon married Yoo Soon-taek in 1971. They have three adult children: two daughters and a son. His elder daughter, Seon-yong, was born in 1972 and now works for the [[Korea Foundation]] in Seoul. She is married to an Indian.&lt;ref name = &quot;Ban Ki-moon family ties India&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rediff.com/news/2008/oct/31moon.htm|title=Ban Ki-moon's family nuptial ties with India|publisher=Rediff News|date=31 October 2008|accessdate=5 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Ban Ki-moon India&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rediff.com/news/2007/jul/13hindi.htm|title=Ban ki-Moon at the World Hindi Conference|publisher=Rediff News|date=14 July 2007|accessdate=5 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; His son, Woo-hyun was born in 1974 in India.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ban Ki-moon family ties India&quot;/&gt; He received an MBA from [[UCLA Anderson School of Management|Anderson School of Management]] at [[University of California, Los Angeles]], and works for an investment firm in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|language=Korean |title = 반기문 총장 아들 내달 결혼 |url=http://www.donga.com/fbin/output?n=200904280139| work = [[Dong-a Ilbo]]|date = 2009-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; His younger daughter, Hyun-hee (born 1976), is a field officer for [[United Nations Children's Fund|UNICEF]] in [[Nairobi]].&lt;ref name=Times12-09/&gt; After his election as Secretary-General, Ban became an icon in his hometown, where his extended family still resides.

===Personality===
In the Korean Foreign Ministry his nickname was ''Ban-jusa'', meaning &quot;the Bureaucrat&quot; or &quot;the administrative clerk.&quot; The name was used as both positive and negative: complimenting Ban's attention to detail and administrative skill while deriding what was seen as a lack of charisma and subservience to his superiors.&lt;ref name=Economist10-07&gt;{{Cite news|url =http://www.unsgselection.org/files/Economist_EnterMrBan_7Oct06.pdf |format=PDF| title = Enter Mr Ban; The UN's new secretary-general|work = [[The Economist]]|date = 2006-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Korean press corps calls him &quot;the slippery eel&quot; for his ability to dodge questions.&lt;ref name=LAT10-09/&gt; His peers praise his understated &quot;[[Confucianism|Confucian]] approach.&quot;&lt;ref name=Time&gt;{{Cite news|url =http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1543932,00.html|title = Can This Guy Run the U.N.?|date = 2006-10-16|work = [[Time Magazine]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he is regarded by many as a &quot;stand-up guy&quot;&lt;ref name=FT10-10/&gt; and is known for his &quot;easy smile&quot;.&lt;ref name=Times12-09/&gt;

==Diplomatic career==
[[Image:Ban Ki-moon and Condoleezza Rice.jpg|thumb|left|Ban Ki-moon with former [[US Secretary of State]] [[Condoleezza Rice]]]]
After graduating from university, Ban received the top score on Korea's foreign service exam. He joined the [[Foreign relations of South Korea|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] in May 1970, and worked his way up the career ladder during the years of the [[Yusin Constitution]].&lt;ref name=FT10-10/&gt;

His first overseas posting was to [[New Delhi]], where he served as vice consul and impressed many of his superiors in the foreign ministry with his competence. Ban reportedly accepted a posting to India rather than the more prestigious United States, because in India he would be able to save more money, and send more money home to his family.&lt;ref name=BBCprofile/&gt;&lt;ref name=KH/&gt; In 1974 he received his first posting to the United Nations, as First Secretary of the South Permanent Observer Mission (South Korea became a full UN member-state on 17 September 1991).&lt;ref name=NYT10-03&gt;{{Cite news|title = Council Backs South Korean for U.N. Secretary General|work = [[The New York Times]]|author = [[Warren Hoge]]|date = 2006-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; After [[Park Chung-hee]]'s 1979 assassination, Ban assumed the post of Director of the United Nations Division.

In 1980 Ban became director of the United Nations' International Organizations and Treaties Bureau, headquartered in [[Seoul]].&lt;ref name=KH/&gt; He has been posted twice to the Republic of Korea embassy in [[Washington, D.C.]] Between these two assignments he served as Director-General for American Affairs in 1990–1992. In 1992, he became Vice Chairman of the South-North Joint Nuclear Control Commission, following the adoption by South and [[North Korea]] of the Joint Declaration of the Denuclearization of the [[Korean Peninsula]].&lt;ref name=BBCprofile/&gt; From 1993–1994 Ban was Korea's deputy ambassador to the United States. He was promoted to the position of Deputy Minister for Policy Planning and International Organizations in 1995 and then appointed National Security Advisor to the President in 1996.&lt;ref name=KH/&gt; Ban's lengthy career overseas has been credited with helping him avoid South Korea's unforgiving political environment.&lt;ref name=Time/&gt;

Ban was appointed [[Ambassador]] to [[Austria]] and [[Slovenia]] in 1998, and a year later he was also elected as Chairman of the Preparatory Commission for the [[Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization]] (CTBTO PrepCom). During the negotiations, in what Ban considers the biggest blunder of his career, he included in a public letter a positive statement about the [[Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty]] in 2001, not long after the United States had decided to abandon the treaty. To avoid anger from the United States, Ban was fired by President [[Kim Dae-jung]], who also issued a public apology for Ban's statement.&lt;ref name=Times12-09/&gt;

Ban was unemployed for the only time in his career and was expecting to receive an assignment to work in a remote and unimportant embassy.&lt;ref name=Times12-09/&gt; In 2001, during the 56th Session of the [[United Nations General Assembly]], the Republic of Korea held the rotating presidency, and to Ban's surprise, he was selected to be the chief of staff to general assembly president [[Han Seung-soo]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Times10-14&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|work = The New York Times|date = 2006-10-14|title = South Korean Is Appointed Secretary General of the U.N.|author = Warren Hoge}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, incoming president [[Roh Moo-hyun]] selected Ban as one of his foreign policy advisors.&lt;ref name=KH/&gt;

===Foreign Minister of South Korea===
[[Image:Yudhoyono BanKiMoon.jpg|thumb|Ban Ki-moon with [[President of Indonesia|Indonesian President]] [[Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono]]]]
In 2004, Ban replaced [[Yoon Young Kwan]] as foreign minister of South Korea under president [[Roh Moo-hyun]].&lt;ref name=LAT10-09/&gt; At the beginning of his term, Ban was faced with two major crises: in June 2004 [[Kim Sun-il]], a Korean translator, was kidnapped and killed in Iraq by [[Islamism|Islamic extremists]]; and in December 2004 dozens of Koreans died in the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake|2004 Indian Ocean tsunami]]. Ban survived scrutiny from lawmakers and saw an upturn in his popularity when talks began with North Korea.&lt;ref name=KH&gt;{{Cite news|title = Ban surges toward next career step|author = Lee Joo-hee|work = [[The Korea Herald]]|date = 2006-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ban became actively involved in issues relating to inter-Korean relationships.&lt;ref name=BBCprofile&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/5401856.stm|title = Profile: Ban Ki-moon|work = [[BBC News]]|date = 2006-10-13|accessdate = 2007-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2005, as [[foreign minister|Foreign Minister]], he played a leading role in the diplomatic efforts to adopt the Joint Statement on resolving the North Korean nuclear issue at the Fourth Round of the [[Six-party talks]] held in [[Beijing]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Official Bio&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Newsweek&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url =http://www.newsweek.com/id/45039|title = A Baptism by Fire; Even before taking office, the newly elected secretary-general of the United Nations is confronted with a global crisis|date = 2006-10-23|author = [[Lally Weymouth]]|work = [[Newsweek]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As foreign minister, Ban oversaw the trade and aid policies of South Korea. This work put Ban in the position of signing trade deals and delivering foreign assistance to diplomats who would later be influential in his candidacy for Secretary-General. For example, Ban became the first senior South Korean minister to travel to the [[Republic of the Congo]] since its independence in 1960.&lt;ref name=WashPost0929&gt;{{Cite news|title = S.

In February 2006, Ban declared his candidacy to replace [[Kofi Annan]] as UN Secretary-General at the end of 2006, becoming the first South Korean to run for the office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://times.hankooki.com/lpage/nation/200602/kt2006021416334111990.htm|title=Minister Ban to Run for Top UN Job|author=Song-wu, Park|publisher=[[The Korea Times]]|accessdate=2006-09-28|date=2006-02-14}}{{dead link|date=December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though Ban was the first to announce a candidacy, he was not originally considered a serious contender.&lt;ref name=FT10-10&gt;{{Cite news|title = Relentless pursuit brings a challenge close to home; Profile Ban Ki-moon|work = [[Financial Times]]|author = Anna Fifield|date = 2006-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the next eight months, Ban made ministerial visits to each of the 15 countries with a seat on the Security Council.&lt;ref name=LAT10-09/&gt; Of the seven candidates, he topped each of the four [[straw poll]]s conducted by the [[United Nations Security Council]]: on 24 July,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unsg.org/wordpress/archives/115|title=Ban takes 1st Straw Poll|publisher=[http://www.unsg.org/ UNSG.org]|date=2006-07-24|accessdate=2006-09-28}}{{dead link|date=December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 14 September,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unsg.org/wordpress/archives/138|title=Ban firms up lead in second Straw Poll|publisher=[http://www.unsg.org/ UNSG.org]|date=2006-09-14|accessdate=2006-09-28}}{{dead link|date=December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 28 September,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unsg.org/wordpress/archives/164|title=Ban slips but holds, Vīķe-Freiberga pushes into third|publisher=[http://www.unsg.org/ UNSG.org]|date=2006-09-28|accessdate=2006-09-28}}{{dead link|date=December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 2 October.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unsg.org/wordpress/archives/170|title=Ban Ki-moon wins|publisher=[http://www.unsg.org/ UNSG.org]|date=2006-10-02|accessdate=2006-10-02}}{{dead link|date=December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the period in which these polls took place, Ban made major speeches to the [[Asia Society]] and the [[Council on Foreign Relations]] in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.asiasource.org/news/special_reports/kimoon.cfm|work = Asiasource.org|title = Foreign Minister Ban Ki-moon interview|date = 2006-09-26|accessdate = 2007-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.asiasociety.org/speeches/06ny_ban.html|date = 2006-09-25|accessdate = 2007-08-02|work = Ban Ki-moon address to Asia Society (transcript)|title = The Quest for Peace and Prosperity in the Asia-Pacific and Beyond}}&lt;/ref&gt; To be confirmed, Ban needed not only to win the support of the diplomatic community, but also to be able to avoid a veto from any of the five permanent members of the council: [[People's Republic of China]], [[France]], [[Russia]], the [[United Kingdom]], and the [[United States]]. Ban was popular in Washington for having pushed to send South Korean troops to Iraq, and had the support of the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]] as he pursued the position.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asiantribune.com/news/2010/04/30/un%E2%80%99s-lynn-pascoe-cannot-avoid-being-influenced-us-state-department-agenda-sri-lanka &quot;UN’s Lynn Pascoe cannot avoid being influenced by US State Department agenda on Sri Lanka&quot;], Daya Gamage. Asian Tribune. April 30, 2010. Accessed June 7, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; But Ban also opposed several U.S. positions: he expressed his support for the [[International Criminal Court]] and favoured an entirely non-confrontational approach to dealing with North Korea.&lt;ref name=LAT10-09/&gt; Ban said during his campaign that he would like to visit North Korea in person to meet with [[Kim Jong-il]] directly.&lt;ref name=&quot;Newsweek&quot;/&gt; Ban was viewed as a stark contrast from Kofi Annan, who was considered charismatic, but perceived as a weak manager because of problems surrounding the UN's oil-for-food program in Iraq.&lt;ref name=Economist10-07/&gt;

Ban struggled to win the approval of France. His official biography states that he speaks both [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]], the two working languages of the UN Secretariat. He has repeatedly struggled to answer questions in French from journalists.&lt;ref name=Phoney&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/reportsfromabroad/herland/20061214.html|title=Is Ban Ki-moon a franco-phoney?|work = [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC News]]|date = 2006-12-14|accessdate = 2007-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ban has repeatedly acknowledged his limitations at French, but assured French diplomats that he was devoted to continuing his study. At a press conference on 11 January 2007, Ban remarked, &quot;My French perhaps could be improved, and I am continuing to work. I have taken French lessons over the last few months.

As the Secretary-General election drew closer, there was rising criticism of the South Korean campaign on Ban's behalf. Specifically, his alleged practice of systematically visiting all member states of the Security Council in his role as the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade to secure votes in his support by signing trade deals with European countries and pledging [[aid]] to [[developing country|developing countries]] were the focus of many news articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,25689-2380336,00.html|title = Millions of dollars and a piano may put Korean in UN's top job|work = [[The Times]]|date = 2006-09-26|accessdate = 2007-08-02|location=London|first1=Richard|last1=Beeston|first2=James|last2=Bone}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[The Washington Post]]'', &quot;rivals have privately grumbled that Republic of Korea, which has the world's 11th-largest economy, has wielded its economic might to generate support for his candidacy.&quot; Ban reportedly said that these insinuations were &quot;groundless.&quot; In an interview on 17 September 2006 he stated: &quot;As front-runner, I know that I can become a target of this very scrutinizing process,&quot; and &quot;I am a man of integrity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/28/AR2006092801765.html|work = The Washington Post|date = 2006-09-28|accessdate = 2007-08-02|title = S. Korean Contender for U.N. Post Has an Edge|first=Colum|last=Lynch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the final informal poll on 2 October, Ban received fourteen favorable votes and one abstention (&quot;no opinion&quot;) from the fifteen members of the Security Council. The one abstention came from the Japanese delegation, who [[Japan–Korea disputes|vehemently opposed]] the idea of a Korean taking the role of Secretary-General. Due to the overwhelming support of Ban by the rest of the Security Council, Japan later voted in favor of Ban to avoid controversy. More importantly, Ban was the only one to escape a veto; each of the other candidates received at least one &quot;no&quot; vote from among the five permanent members. After the vote, Shashi Tharoor, who finished second, withdrew his candidacy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ndtv.com/video/player/news/shashi-tharoor-pulls-out-of-un-race/7904|title=Shashi Tharoor pulls out of UN race|publisher=[http://www.ndtv.com/ NDTV.com]|date=2006-10-03|accessdate=2006-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and China's [[Permanent Representative]] to the UN told reporters that &quot;it is quite clear from today's straw poll that Minister Ban Ki-moon is the candidate that the Security Council will recommend to the General Assembly.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://webcast.un.org/ramgen/sc/so061002pm3.rm|title = United Nations Webcast of announcement|work = United Nations|accessdate = 2007-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{wikinews|General Assembly elects Ban Ki-moon as next UN chief}}

On 9 October, the Security Council formally chose Ban as its nominee. In the public vote, he was supported by all 15 members of the council.&lt;ref name=NYT10-10&gt;{{Cite news|title = Security Council Approves South Korean as U.N. Chief|author = Warren Hoge and Choe Sang-Hun|work = The New York Times|date = 2006-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 October, the 192-member [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] [[acclamation|acclaimed]] Ban as Secretary-General.&lt;ref name=&quot;Times10-14&quot;/&gt;

==First Term as Secretary-General==
[[Image:Vladimir Putin 9 April 2008-1.jpg|thumb|Ban Ki-moon with the [[President of Russia]] [[Vladimir Putin]] in [[Moscow]] on 9 April 2008.]]
When Ban became Secretary-General, ''[[The Economist]]'' listed the major challenges facing him in 2007: &quot;rising nuclear demons in [[Iran]] and North Korea, a haemorrhaging wound in [[Darfur]], unending violence in the Middle East, looming environmental disaster, escalating international terrorism, the proliferation of [[weapons of mass destruction]], the spread of HIV/AIDS. And then the more parochial concerns, such as the largely unfinished business of the most sweeping attempt at reform in the UN's history.&quot;&lt;ref name=Econ01-06/&gt; Before starting, Kofi Annan shared the story that when the first Secretary-General [[Trygve Lie]] left office, he told his successor, [[Dag Hammarskjöld]], &quot;You are about to take over the most impossible job on earth.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Times10-14&quot;/&gt;

On 23 January 2007 Ban took office as the eighth Secretary-General of the United Nations. Ban's term as Secretary-General opened with a flap. At his first encounter with the press as Secretary-General on 2 January 2007, he refused to condemn the [[death penalty]] imposed on [[Saddam Hussein]] by the Iraqi High Tribunal, remarking that &quot;The issue of capital punishment is for each and every member State to decide&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.un.org/apps/sg/offthecuff.asp?nid=964|work = [[United Nations]]|title = Secretary-General's encounter with the UN press corps (transcript)| date = 2007-01-02|accessdate = 2007-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ban's statements contradicted long-standing United Nations opposition to the death penalty as a human-rights concern.&lt;ref name=NYT01-03&gt;{{Cite news| url =http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/03/world/middleeast/03nations.html|title = New U.N. Chief Invites Controversy by Declining to Oppose Hussein Execution|date = 2007-01-03|author = Julia Preston|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; He quickly clarified his stance in the case of [[Barzan al-Tikriti]] and [[Awad al-Bandar]], two top officials who were convicted of the deaths of 148 [[Shia Islam|Shia Muslims]] in the Iraqi village of [[Dujail]] in the 1980s. In a statement through his spokesperson on 6 January, he &quot;strongly urged the Government of Iraq to grant a stay of execution to those whose death sentences may be carried out in the near future.&quot;&lt;ref name=FT02-01/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.un.org/apps/sg/sgstats.asp?nid=2395|title = Statement attributable to the Spokesperson for the Secretary-General on the death sentences in Iraq|work = United Nations|date = 2007-01-06|accessdate = 2007-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the broader issue, he told a Washington, D.C., audience on 16 January 2007 that he recognized and encouraged the &quot;growing trend in international society, international law and domestic policies and practices to phase out eventually the death penalty.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.un.org/apps/sg/sgstats.asp?nid=2410|title = Address at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and Q&amp;A (transcript)| work = United Nations|date = 2007-01-16|accessdate = 2007-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the tenth anniversary of [[Khmer Rouge]] leader [[Pol Pot]]'s death, 15 April 2008, Ban Ki-moon appealed for the senior leaders of the regime to be brought to justice. The [[Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia]]-tribunal, which was established by both the United Nations and [[Cambodia]] and which became operational in 2006, is expected to continue until at least 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/04/15/un.pol.pot/index.html|title = U.N. chief calls for justice in Cambodia|work = [[CNN]]|date = 2008-04-15|accessdate = 2008-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cabinet===
In early January, Ban appointed the key members of his cabinet. As his [[United Nations Deputy Secretary-General|Deputy Secretary-General]], he selected [[Tanzania]]n foreign minister and professor [[Asha-Rose Migiro]] – a move that pleased African diplomats who had concerns of losing power without Annan in office.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url =http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/06/world/06nations.html|title = Tanzanian Woman Is Chosen for U.N.'s 2nd Highest Post|work = [[The New York Times]]|date = 2007-01-06|author = Julia Preston }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The top position devoted exclusively to management, Under-Secretary-General for Management, was filled by [[Alicia Bárcena Ibarra]] of Mexico. Bárcena was considered a UN insider, having previously served as Annan's chief of staff. Her appointment was seen by critics as an indication that Ban would not make dramatic changes to UN bureaucracy.&lt;ref name=NYT01-04&gt;{{Cite news|title = Mexican U.N. Insider Gets Manager's Post|date = 2007-01-04|author = Julia Preston}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ban appointed [[John Holmes (British diplomat)|Sir John Holmes]], the British Ambassador to France, as [[Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator|Under-Secretary-General for humanitarian affairs and coordinator of emergency relief]].&lt;ref name=NYT01-04/&gt;

Ban initially said that he would delay making other appointments until his first round of reforms were approved, but he later abandoned this idea after receiving criticism.&lt;ref name=FT02-01/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT02-06/&gt; In February he continued with appointments, selecting [[B. Lynn Pascoe]], the U.S. ambassador to Indonesia, to become Under-Secretary-General for political affairs.
[[Jean-Marie Guéhenno]], a French diplomat, who had served as Under-Secretary-General for peacekeeping operations under Annan, remained in office. Ban selected [[Vijay K. Nambiar]] as his chief of staff.&lt;ref name=NYT02-10&gt;{{Cite news|title = U.N. Chief Gives Key Post to American|author = [[Warren Hoge]]|date = 2007-02-10|work = The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The appointment of many women to top jobs was seen as fulfilling a campaign promise Ban had made to increase the role of women in the United Nations. During Ban's first year as Secretary-General, more top jobs were being handled by women than ever before. Though not appointed by Ban, the president of the General Assembly, [[Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa]], is only the third woman to hold this position in UN history.&lt;ref name=CT04-11&gt;{{Cite news|title = Leaders making world of difference\ Higher profile at UN brings new emphasis on issues affecting women|author = Stevenson Swanson|work = [[Chicago Tribune]]|date = 2007-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reform agenda===
During his first month in office, Ban proposed two major restructurings: to split the UN peacekeeping operation into two departments and to combine the political affairs and disarmament department. His proposals were met with stiff resistance from members of the UN General Assembly who bristled under Ban's request for rapid approval. The proposed merger of the disarmament and political affairs offices was criticized by many in the developing world, partially because of rumours that Ban hoped to place American B. Lynn Pascoe in charge of the new office. [[Alejandro D. Wolff]], then acting American ambassador, said the United States backed his proposals.&lt;ref name=FT02-01&gt;{{Cite news|title = Ban's month of muddle: how the new UN chief is struggling to win over the doubters|author = Mark Turner|date = 2007-02-01|work = [[Financial Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT02-06&gt;{{Cite news|title = U.N. Chief Returns to Headquarters, Where Battles Await Him|date = 2007-02-06|work = [[The New York Times]]|author = [[Warren Hoge]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the early bout of reproach, Ban began extensive consultation with UN ambassadors, agreeing to have his peacekeeping proposal extensively vetted. After the consultations, Ban dropped his proposal to combine political affairs and disarmament.&lt;ref name=NYT02-19&gt;{{Cite news|title = U.N. Chief Is Assuaging Doubts About Leadership|author = Warren Hoge|date = 2007-02-19|work = The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ban nevertheless pressed ahead with reforms on job requirements at the UN requiring that all positions be considered five-year appointments, all receive strict annual performance reviews, and all financial disclosures be made public. Though unpopular in the New York office, the move was popular in other UN offices around the world and lauded by UN observers.&lt;ref name=NYT02-28&gt;{{Cite news|title = New United Nations Chief Tackles the Agency's Tradition of Patronage Jobs|work = The New York Times|date = 2007-02-28|author = Warren Hoge}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ban's proposal to split the peacekeeping operation into one group handling operations and another handling arms was finally adopted in mid-March 2007.&lt;ref name=IrishTimes&gt;{{Cite news|title = Ban Ki-moon learns the hard way|work = [[The Irish Times]]|author = Maggie Farley|date = 2007-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Key issues===
The Secretary-General of the United Nations has the ability to influence debate on nearly any global issue. Although unsuccessful in some areas, Ban's predecessor Annan had been successful in increasing the UN peacekeeping presence and in popularizing the [[Millennium Development Goals]]. UN observers were eager to see on which issues Ban intends to focus, in addition to reform of the United Nations bureaucracy.&lt;ref name=Econ01-06/&gt;

On several prominent issues, such as proliferation in Iran and North Korea, Ban has deferred to the Security Council.&lt;ref name=IrishTimes/&gt; In 2007, the [[Republic of Nauru]] raised the issue of allowing the Republic of China (Taiwan) to sign the [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]]. Ban referenced the [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758]], and refused the motion. On 19 July 2007, Taiwanese President [[Chen Shui-bian]] wrote to request admission into the UN by the name Taiwan. Ban rejected the request.&lt;ref name=Taipei&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2007/07/30/2003371907|title = MOFA spokesman slams Ban Ki-moon for rejecting UN bid|date = 2007-07-30|accessdate = 2007-08-30|work = [[Taipei Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Global warming====

Ban early on identified [[global warming]] as one of the key issues of his administration. In a [[White House]] meeting with U.S. President George W. Bush in January, Ban urged Bush to take steps to curb [[greenhouse gas]] emissions. On 1 March 2007 in a speech before the UN General Assembly, Ban emphasized his concerns about global warming. Ban stated, &quot;For my generation, coming of age at the height of the Cold War, fear of [[nuclear winter]] seemed the leading [[existential threat]] on the horizon. But the danger posed by war to all humanity — and to our planet — is at least matched by [[climate change]]&quot;&lt;ref name=Wash03-02&gt;{{Cite news|url =http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/01/AR2007030101484.html|title = U.N.

On 3 September 2009 he further emphasized his concerns at the World Climate Conference in Geneva, when he stated, &quot;Our foot is stuck on the accelerator and we are heading towards an abyss&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=31926&amp;Cr=climate+change&amp;Cr1= Ban urges rapid progress in negotiations on new climate change pact] ''UN News Centre'', 3 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Middle East====
On Thursday, 22 March 2007, while Ban was taking part in the first stop of a tour of the Middle East, a mortar attack hit just {{convert|80|m|sp=us}} from where the Secretary-General was standing, interrupting a press conference in [[Baghdad]]'s [[Green Zone]], and visibly shaking Ban and others. No one was hurt in the incident.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2007-03/23/content_5884102.htm Rocket blast shakes UN chief in Baghdad] Xinhua – 2007-03-23&lt;/ref&gt; The United Nations had already limited its role in Iraq after its Baghdad headquarters was bombed in August 2003, killing 22 people. Ban said, however, that he still hoped to find a way for the United Nations to &quot;do more for Iraqi social and political development.&quot;&lt;ref name=NYT03-24&gt;{{Cite news|title = U.N. Chief Isn't Discouraged by His Close Call in Iraq|author = [[Warren Hoge]]|date = 2007-03-24|work = [[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On his trip, Ban visited [[Egypt]], [[Israel]], the [[West Bank]], [[Jordan]], [[Lebanon]] and [[Saudi Arabia]], where Ban attended a conference with leaders of the [[Arab League]] and met for several hours with [[Omar Hassan al-Bashir]], the Sudanese president who had resisted UN peacekeepers in Darfur.&lt;ref name=IrishTimes/&gt; While Ban met with [[Mahmoud Abbas]], the Palestinian president, he declined to meet with [[Ismail Haniya]] of [[Hamas]].&lt;ref name=NYT04-03&gt;{{Cite news|title = On Mideast Trip, U.N. Chief Sought to Expand New Role|date = 2007-04-03|author = Warren Hoge|work = The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ban Ki-moon criticized Israel on 10 March 2008 for planning to build housing units in a [[West Bank settlement]], saying the decision conflicts with &quot;Israel's obligation under the road map&quot; for Middle East peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title =U.N. blasts Israel for West Bank housing expansion plan| url=http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/meast/03/10/israel.palestinian.settlement/index.html|publisher=CNN|date=2008-03-10|accessdate=2008-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During a meeting of the [[UN Security Council]] on Wednesday, 7 January 2009, Ban called for an immediate end to fighting in the [[Gaza Strip]]. He criticized both sides, Israel for bombarding [[Gaza]] and Hamas for firing rockets into Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title =U.N. blasts Israel for West Bank housing expansion plan|publisher=BBC|date=2009-01-07|accessdate=2009-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the [[2009 Iranian presidential election]] was widely disputed, Ban Ki-moon sent a traditional congratulation message &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1106757.html UN toasts Ahmadinejad win, as 69 said killed in Iran protests – Haaretz Daily Newspaper|Israel News].

The incident was followed by an official request&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2009/aug/12/iran-ban-ki-moon-protest|work=The Guardian|location=London|title=Dear Mr Ban, heed the Iranian people|date=2009-08-12|accessdate=2010-04-07|first=Akbar|last=Ganji}}&lt;/ref&gt; by more than 200 intellectuals, human rights activists and reformist politicians in Iran for the [[UN]] reaction. Ban Ki-moon however did not take any action to stop the violence in Iran.

====Darfur====
Ban took the first foreign trip of his term to attend the [[African Union]] summit in [[Addis Ababa]], [[Ethiopia]], in January 2007 as part of an effort to reach out to the [[Group of 77]].&lt;ref name=Econ01-06&gt;{{Cite news|title = Mission impossible?—The United Nations|date = 2007-01-06|work = [[The Economist]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He repeatedly identified Darfur as the top humanitarian priority of his administration.&lt;ref name=IrishTimes/&gt; Ban played a large role, with several face-to-face meetings with [[President of Sudan|Sudanese President]] [[Omar Hassan al-Bashir]], in convincing Sudan to allow UN peacekeepers to enter the Darfur region. On 31 July 2007 the United Nations Security Council approved sending 26,000 UN peacekeepers into the region to join 7,000 troops from the African Union. The resolution was heralded as a major breakthrough in confronting the [[Darfur conflict]] (although the United States labeled the conflict a &quot;[[genocide]],&quot; the United Nations has declined to do so). The first phase of the peacekeeping mission began in October 2007.&lt;ref name=NPR08-02&gt;{{Cite news|title = United Nations Deploys Peacekeeping Troops to Darfur|author = Cheryl Corley|date = 2007-08-02|work = [[Tell Me More]] on [[National Public Radio|NPR]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Myanmar====
Ban Ki-moon flew to Myanmar on 25 May 2008 to guide a conference with international agencies aimed at boosting donations for the nation, which was struck by [[Cyclone Nargis]] on 2 May 2008. The conference was initiated after Ban had met with [[Than Shwe]], the leading figure of Myanmar's government 23 May 2008. Ban toured the devastation—especially in the hard-hit [[Irrawaddy Delta]]—23 May 2008 and 24 May 2008. Myanmar officials agreed to allow the [[Yangon International Airport]] to be used as a logistical hub for aid distribution.&lt;ref name=cnn-05-25-08&gt;{{Cite news|title = Cyclone aid conference opens in Myanmar|author = CNN|date = 2008-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campaign for second term as Secretary-General: 2011==
On 6 June 2011, Ban Ki-moon formally announced his candidacy for a second consecutive term&lt;ref name=unAppointSecond /&gt; as Secretary-General of the United Nations. He announced his candidacy at a press conference, following a meeting with the Asian group of countries at the United Nations. Ban Ki-moon's first mandate as the Secretary-General was set to end on 31 December 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/world/2011-06/06/c_13913806.htm | title = Ban Ki-moon launches official re-election campaign|author = |work = Xinhua|date = 2011-06-06|accessdate = 2011-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The five permanent Security Council members supported his candidacy.

==Controversy==
According to ''[[The Washington Post]]'', &quot;some U.N. employees and delegates&quot; expressed resentment at Ban's perceived [[favoritism]] in the appointment of South Korean nationals in key posts. Previous U.N. chiefs such as [[Kurt Waldheim]] (Austria), [[Javier Pérez de Cuéllar]] (Peru) and [[Boutros Boutros-Ghali]] (Egypt) brought small teams of trusted aides or clerical workers from their country's Foreign Ministry. But according to &quot;some officials&quot; in the ''Post'' story, Ban has gone further, boosting South Korea's presence in U.N. ranks by more than 20 percent during his first year in office. In response, Ban and his aides have claimed that allegations of favoritism are wrong, and that some of the harshest criticisms against him have undercurrents of [[racism]].&lt;ref name=fav/&gt; He said that the South Korean nationals he had appointed — including [[Choi Young-jin]], who has served as a high-ranking official in the United Nations' peacekeeping department — are highly qualified for their positions. Others such as Donald P. Gregg, a former U.S. ambassador to South Korea say the complaints are driven by envy, &quot;I think being from South Korea, and people have growing respect for South Korea, that's a great enhancement for the secretary general. &quot;If he brings along talented people who he knows very well, I think that's also a plus.&quot; U.N. records show that South Korea, the organization's eleventh-largest financial contributor, had 54 South Korean nationals assigned to its mission six months before Ban took over the top U.N. post. &lt;ref name=fav&gt;{{Cite news|title = Under U.N.

===Question of bias===
During the [[ROKS Cheonan sinking|ROKS ''Cheonan'' sinking]] saga, he took the unusual step of demanding action against North Korea for the alleged sinking of a vessel from his country. This move was perceived{{by whom|date=April 2012}} as unusual because it was rare for any Secretary-General—and particularly Ban Ki-moon—to comment on the Security Council taking action on a particular issue as his office had, in the past, tended to be extremely deferential to the Security Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undispatch.com/node/9910 |title=Ban Ki Moon Joins The North Korea-Security Council Debate |publisher=UN Dispatch |date= |accessdate=2010-05-25 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100528051009/http://www.undispatch.com/node/9910 &lt;!-- Added by H3llBot --&gt; |archivedate=2010-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
