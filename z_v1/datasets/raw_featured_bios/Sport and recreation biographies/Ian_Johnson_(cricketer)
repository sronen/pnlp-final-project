'''Ian William Geddes Johnson''' &lt;small&gt;[[Order of the British Empire|CBE]]&lt;/small&gt; (8&amp;nbsp;December 1917 &amp;ndash; 9&amp;nbsp;October 1998) was an Australian [[cricketer]] who played 45&amp;nbsp;[[Test cricket|Test matches]] as a slow [[off-spin|off-break]] [[bowling (cricket)|bowler]] between 1946 and 1956. Johnson captured 109&amp;nbsp;Test [[wicket#Dismissing a batsman|wicket]]s at an [[bowling average|average]] of 29.19&amp;nbsp;[[run (cricket)|run]]s per wicket and as a [[batting order (cricket)|lower order]] batsman made 1,000&amp;nbsp;runs at an [[batting average#Cricket|average]] of 22.92&amp;nbsp;runs per [[innings#Cricket|dismissal]]. He [[captain (cricket)|captained]] the [[Australia national cricket team|Australian team]] in 17&amp;nbsp;Tests, winning seven and losing five, with a further five [[result (cricket)#Draw|drawn]]. Despite this record, he is better known as the [[Australian national cricket captains|captain]] who lost consecutive [[the Ashes|Ashes]] series against [[England cricket team|England]].  Urbane, well-spoken and popular with his opponents and the public, he was seen by his team mates as a disciplinarian and his natural optimism was often seen as naive.

Aged 17, Johnson made his [[first-class cricket]] debut for [[Victorian Bushrangers|Victoria]] in the 1935&amp;ndash;36 season but did not establish a permanent place in the team until 1939&amp;ndash;40.  His career was interrupted by the [[World War II|Second World War]]; he served with the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] as a pilot  and later as a [[flight instructor]]. He returned to cricket after his discharge and was selected to tour New Zealand with the Australian team, making his Test debut.  Johnson was part of [[Don Bradman]]'s [[Australian cricket team in England in 1948|''Invincibles'' team]]; undefeated on tour in England in 1948. He was a regular member of the national side until poor form saw him left out of the Australian squad for the [[Australian cricket team in England in 1953|1953 tour of England]].

Johnson was appointed Australian captain following [[Lindsay Hassett]]'s retirement. The appointment was not universally popular; some team mates and supporters felt [[Keith Miller]] had a better claim to the position.  In his [[English cricket team in Australia in 1954-55|first series as captain]], Australia was defeated by a strong English team on home soil.  The tour of the [[West Indies cricket team|West Indies]] that followed was a cricketing and diplomatic triumph for Johnson. Australia won the Test series comfortably and Johnson's astute public relations skills helped avoid a repeat of the crowd disturbances that had marred England's visit to the islands 12 months before. However, his Australian team then went on to lose the [[Australian cricket team in England in 1956|1956 Ashes series in England]]. Johnson's Test career ended with Australia's first Test tour of the [[Indian subcontinent]], which occurred during the voyage back to Australia. Australia lost the one-off Test against Pakistan, the first between the two nations, before claiming the series against India. On his return to Australia, he retired from all forms of cricket at age 39.

After retirement, Johnson worked for a time as a [[Sportscaster|sports commentator]], including covering the [[1956 Summer Olympics]] in Melbourne. In 1957 he was appointed Secretary of the [[Melbourne Cricket Club]], one of the most prestigious positions in Australian sport. He would remain in the role for 26&amp;nbsp;years, overseeing the development of the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] and playing a key role in the organisation of the [[Centenary Test]] in 1977.  In 1957 he was also honoured with an [[Order of the British Empire|MBE]] for services to cricket; this was twice upgraded: to [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] in 1977 and to [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] in 1982.

==Early years==

Johnson was born in [[North Melbourne, Victoria|North Melbourne]], an inner suburb of Melbourne, on 8&amp;nbsp;December 1918.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robinson&quot;&gt;Robinson (1996), pp. 241&amp;ndash;247.&lt;/ref&gt;  His father, [[William Johnson (cricketer)|William Johnson]]&amp;mdash;a wine and spirit grocer&amp;mdash;was a keen cricketer who played one [[first-class cricket|first-class]] match for [[Victorian Bushrangers|Victoria]] in 1924&amp;ndash;25 before serving as a [[selector (sport)|selector]] for the [[Australia national cricket team|Australian Test team]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Robinson&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Daddy&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/16/16253/16253.html| title =  William Johnson| publisher = CricketArchive | accessdate = 2008-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PremierCricket&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://premier.cricketvictoria.com.au/page/johnson_ian_william_geddes.html| title = Johnson, Ian William Geddes| work = Legends and past players - Victorian Premier Cricket| publisher = [[Cricket Victoria]]| accessdate = 2008-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
 
As a schoolboy, Ian Johnson excelled at a variety of sports. He participated in athletics and [[Australian rules football]], as well as playing as a [[wicket-keeper]] for [[Middle Park, Victoria|Middle Park]] State School.  In 1936, he became the Victorian amateur [[squash (sport)|squash]] champion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Derriman&quot;&gt;Derriman (1987), pp. 150&amp;ndash;153.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, he found his vocation in cricket. In 1934&amp;ndash;35, aged only 16, and still a schoolboy at [[Wesley College, Melbourne|Wesley College]], Johnson played his first match for the [[Casey-South Melbourne Cricket Club|South Melbourne Cricket Club]] [[First XI]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Robinson&quot;/&gt; 
[[Image:JohnsonWesleyCollege.jpg|thumb|left|The Wesley College First XI in 1936. Johnson is in the middle row, centre.]]
He was given the opportunity to play first-class cricket the following season, playing [[Tasmanian Tigers|Tasmania]]&amp;mdash;not then involved in the [[Sheffield Shield]] competition&amp;mdash;just 23&amp;nbsp;days past his seventeenth birthday.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robinson&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;FCDebut&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/15/15667.html| title = Tasmania v Victoria: Other First-Class matches 1935/36| publisher = CricketArchive |accessdate = 2008-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He scored 34 and 26 and took two wickets in each innings as Tasmania won by six wickets.&lt;ref name=&quot;FCDebut&quot;/&gt;  He was retained for the next game, scoring 15&amp;nbsp;runs in his only innings and taking 3&amp;nbsp;wickets for 40&amp;nbsp;runs (3/40) in the Tasmanian first innings and 1/27 in the second.&lt;ref name=&quot;FCsecond&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/15/15674.html| title = Tasmania v Victoria: Other First-Class matches 1935/36| publisher = Cricinfo| accessdate = 2008-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He did not play first-class cricket again for three years, finally returning to the Victorian side to play another two games against Tasmania in 1938&amp;ndash;39, making his highest first-class score to date, 88&amp;nbsp;runs, in the second game.&lt;ref name=&quot;FCLaun&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/16/16863.html| title = Tasmania v Victoria: Other First-Class matches 1938/39| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate = 2008-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;FCHobart&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/16/16865.html| title = Tasmania v Victoria: Other First-Class matches 1938/39| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate = 2008-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; He secured his place in the Victorian team in the 1939&amp;ndash;40 season, making his [[Sheffield Shield]] debut against [[Southern Redbacks|South Australia]] in Adelaide in November 1939.&lt;ref name=&quot;PremierCricket&quot;/&gt;  Batting at [[Batting order (cricket)|number five]], Johnson scored 33&amp;nbsp;runs in the first innings and 41 in the second, but was unable to take a wicket.&lt;ref name=&quot;FCSA&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/17/17218.html| title = South Australia v Victoria: Sheffield Shield 1939/40| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate = 2008-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  That season, Johnson scored 313&amp;nbsp;runs at an average of 26.08 and took 13&amp;nbsp;wickets at an average of 39.92.&lt;ref name=&quot;SeasonBatting&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/0/736/f_Batting_by_Season.html| title =  First-class Batting and Fielding in Each Season by Ian Johnson| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate = 2008-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SeasonBowling&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/0/736/f_Bowling_by_Season.html| title =  First-class Bowling in Each Season by Ian Johnson| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate = 2008-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a season truncated because of the Second World War, Johnson played five matches in 1940&amp;ndash;41, scoring 292&amp;nbsp;runs at an average of 32.44 and taking 25&amp;nbsp;wickets at 27.60.&lt;ref name=&quot;SeasonBatting&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SeasonBowling&quot;/&gt;

Johnson's cricket career was interrupted by the war and he enlisted in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) in March 1941.&lt;ref name=&quot;WWIINominalRoll&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/script/veteran.asp?ServiceID=R&amp;VeteranID=1052591|title = Johnson, Ian William|work = World War II nominal roll| publisher = Commonwealth of Australia| accessdate = 2008-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He flew [[Bristol Beaufighter]]s with [[No. 22 Squadron RAAF]] and, by 1944, was serving as a [[Flight Lieutenant]] in the [[South West Pacific theatre of World War II|South West Pacific theatre]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Perry&quot;&gt;Perry (2000), pp. 192&amp;ndash;199.&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1945, Johnson was awarded the [[Queen's Commendation for Valuable Service|Commendation for Valuable Service in the Air]] for his work as a flight instructor with No. 11 Elementary Flying Training School, based at [[Benalla, Victoria|Benalla]] in rural Victoria.&lt;ref name=&quot;CVSA&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=1066917&amp;search_type=quick&amp;showInd=true| title = JOHNSON, Ian William: Commendation for Valuable Service in the Air| work = Search Australian Honours|publisher = Australian Government|accessdate = 2008-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;RAAFMuseum&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.airforce.gov.au/raafmuseum/research/units/efts.htm|title = Elementary Flying Training Schools|publisher = RAAF Museum|accessdate = 2008-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was discharged in December 1945 and resumed his first-class cricket career in the 1945&amp;ndash;46 season.&lt;ref name=&quot;WWIINominalRoll&quot;/&gt;

==Test career==
===Debut and early Test career===
Following his discharge from service, Johnson returned to first-class cricket in the 1945&amp;ndash;46 season, winning a place on the [[Australian cricket team in New Zealand in 1945-46|Australian tour of New Zealand]]. The only Test match&amp;mdash;the first between the two nations&amp;mdash;was played at the [[Basin Reserve]] in [[Wellington]]. Johnson scored 7&amp;nbsp;[[not out]] and he was not needed to bowl as New Zealand collapsed for an aggregate of just 96&amp;nbsp;runs in their two innings; Australia won by an [[result (cricket)#Statement of result|innings and 103 runs]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Testdebut&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/17/17590.html| title = New Zealand v Australia: Australia in New Zealand 1945/46 (Only Test)| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate = 2008-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Test cricket resumed in Australia with the visit of the [[English cricket team in Australia in 1946-47|English team in 1946&amp;ndash;47]]. Before the Test matches started, the [[MCC tour of Australia in 1946–47#Victoria vs MCC|touring team played Victoria]] in a warm-up match. Johnson took 4&amp;nbsp;wickets for 38&amp;nbsp;runs in the English second innings but was unable to prevent the tourists from winning by 244&amp;nbsp;runs.&lt;ref name=&quot;MCCvVic&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/17/17883.html| title = Victoria v Marylebone Cricket Club: Marylebone Cricket Club in Australia 1946/47| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate = 2008-05-27}} Note: Until 1977, outside Test matches, touring England teams played as Marylebone Cricket Club.&lt;/ref&gt;  He was included in the Australian team for the [[1946-47 Ashes series#First Test – Brisbane|First Test at Brisbane]], scoring 47&amp;nbsp;runs in the Australian total of 645.

Johnson met with less success in the [[1946-47 Ashes series#Third Test – Melbourne|Third Test]] in his home town of Melbourne.  Batting at [[batting order (cricket)|number six]], Johnson was dismissed by [[Norman Yardley]] for a [[duck (cricket)|golden duck]] and, in the second innings, [[run out]], again without scoring, giving him an unwanted [[List of cricket terms#P|pair]]. With the ball, Johnson took one wicket in the English first innings.

The next summer, the [[West Indian cricket team in Australia in 1951-52|West Indian team visited Australia]] to play five Tests.

When the [[South African cricket team in Australia in 1952-53|South Africans toured in 1952&amp;ndash;53]], Johnson was selected for Australia ahead of Queenslander [[Colin McCool]].

==Captaincy==
===Selection===
[[Image:KeithMiller1954.jpg|thumb|Keith Miller, Johnson's team mate, rival and fierce critic]]
While the Australian team lost the Ashes for the first time in twenty years, Johnson spent the winter of 1953 [[Play-by-play|calling]] [[Australian rules football]] matches for local radio station [[3AW]] and writing columns for ''[[The Argus (Australia)|The Argus]] newspaper.''&lt;ref name=&quot;Haigh&quot;&gt;Haigh (2006), pp. 83&amp;ndash;85.&lt;/ref&gt;  Later that year, the [[Cricket Victoria|Victorian Cricket Association]] appointed him to succeed the retired Hassett as captain of Victoria.&lt;ref name=&quot;Haigh&quot;/&gt;  In the middle of the season, at a mutual friend's [[New Year's Eve]] party, Hassett approached Johnson to discuss his form.  Taking a confrontational approach, Hassett said to Johnson, &quot;The problem is that you are not getting stuck in.  You're not trying.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Haigh&quot;/&gt;  When Johnson protested, Hassett continued &quot;If you have got any brains, you will start taking this game seriously.  Because if you do you will end up [[Australian cricket captains|captaining Australia]] next year.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Haigh&quot;/&gt;

The other contender for the vacant national captaincy position was [[Keith Miller]], the fast-bowling all-rounder and captain of [[New South Wales Blues|New South Wales]].  Miller had led his team to victory in the 1953&amp;ndash;54 [[Sheffield Shield]] and was recognised as an intuitive captain.&lt;ref name=&quot;Haigh&quot;/&gt;  Based solely on cricketing merit, Miller, a regular selection at international level, was seen as the superior candidate.&lt;ref name=&quot;SuperiorCandidate&quot;&gt;Haigh (2006), p. 84. &quot;On cricketing merits, Miller was vastly Johnson's superior.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;  However, inter-state rivalries and a perception that Miller would be a poor disciplinarian saw him passed over. This perception was partly based on an incident when Miller, as captain of New South Wales, allowed his team-mate [[Sid Barnes]] to serve [[List of cricket terms#D|drinks]] on the field dressed in a three-piece suit rather than standard cricket [[whites (cricket)|whites]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Haigh&quot;/&gt;  Johnson, on the other hand, was part of the cricket establishment: he was an alumnus of the exclusive [[Wesley College, Melbourne|Wesley College]] and the son of a former Test selector.&lt;ref name=&quot;Haigh&quot;/&gt;  He had also returned to form, taking 37&amp;nbsp;wickets in the 1953&amp;ndash;54 Sheffield Shield&amp;mdash;more than any other player&amp;mdash;at an average of 16.37.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shield53&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Events/AUS/Sheffield_Shield_1953-54/Bowling_by_Wickets.html| title = Bowling in Sheffield Shield 1953/54 (Ordered by Wickets)| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate = 2008-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In what cricket writer [[Dick Whitington]] speculated was a vote split between the New South Wales and Victorian factions, the [[Cricket Australia|Australian Board of Control]] appointed Johnson as Australian captain.&lt;ref name=&quot;Haigh&quot;/&gt; His appointment was not universally applauded.  {{quote|There is strong feeling amongst cricket enthusiasts that horse trading on a state basis rather than objective evaluation of cricket skills has dominated selectors' discussions.

===Ashes defeat===
Johnson's first challenge as captain was [[English cricket team in Australia in 1954-55|the Ashes series against England in 1954&amp;ndash;55]].

With Miller also injured, [[Arthur Morris]] was asked to lead the Australian team against an English [[fast bowling]] attack including [[Frank Tyson]] and [[Brian Statham]].

With the Fifth and final Test ending in a draw, England won the series 3&amp;ndash;1.&lt;ref name=&quot;EvAWisden1955&quot;/&gt;

===Caribbean success===
In March 1955, Johnson led Australia's first Test tour of the [[West Indies cricket team|West Indies]]. The Australian Board of Control was concerned about the team's relations with the West Indian public.&lt;ref name=&quot;Perry&quot;/&gt; Against a background of rising anti-colonial feeling and resentment, [[English cricket team in West Indies in 1953-54|England's tour of the West Indies the year before]] had been marred by riots and violent disturbances. With the [[White Australia policy]] in place at the time, the Australians feared an unpleasant reception from the Caribbean public.&lt;ref name=&quot;Haigh&quot;/&gt;  However, the Australian team proved very popular throughout the West Indies; ''Wisden'' reported that &quot;much credit belonged to the tact displayed by Ian Johnson, who proved a most able captain&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;WIvA1955Wisden&quot;&gt;{{cite web| year = 1956| url = http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/152608.html?from=login| title = Australians in West Indies, 1954–55|work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack - online archive|publisher = John Wisden &amp; Co|accessdate = 2008-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson cultivated a relaxed manner with the locals; in one instance at [[Sabina Park]] in [[Jamaica]], he stopped to pick up a toddler who had run on to the playing field during the change of innings. Smiling and chatting to the boy, he then carried him safely off the ground.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robinson&quot;/&gt;  Team mate [[Alan Davidson (cricketer)|Alan Davidson]] claimed, &quot;Ian did the best PR job of any captain I've ever seen&quot;.&lt;ref name=WisdenObit/&gt;
[[Image:Neil Harvey.jpg|thumb|left|Neil Harvey scored a double century for Australia in the Fifth Test against the West Indies in 1954&amp;ndash;55.]]
As well as being popular, the Australian team was successful on the field, winning the series three Tests to nil.&lt;ref name=&quot;WIvA1955Wisden&quot;/&gt;  The series was dominated by batsmen; in the five Test matches played the Australians scored 12&amp;nbsp;[[century (cricket)|centuries]] while for the West Indies, [[Clyde Walcott]] alone scored five centuries&amp;mdash;including centuries in both innings in the Tests at Sabina Park and [[Queens Park Oval]].

A major rift between Johnson and Miller&amp;mdash;erstwhile rivals for the Australian captaincy&amp;mdash;developed during the Fourth Test, played at [[Kensington Oval]] in [[Barbados]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Robinson&quot;/&gt; During the third day, Miller, bowling [[swing bowling|fast-medium swingers]], had dismissed [[Everton Weekes]] and [[Collie Smith]] in quick succession to leave the West Indies at 6/147 with [[Denis Atkinson]] and [[Clairmonte Depeiaza]] batting.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robinson&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WIvA4thTest1955&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/21/21502.html|title = West Indies v Australia: Australia in West Indies 1954/55 (4th Test)|publisher = CricketArchive|accessdate = 2008-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson, thinking that the two batsmen would be vulnerable to express pace, asked Miller to increase his bowling speed.  When Miller refused, Johnson remonstrated with him: &quot;I'll say who bowls and what they bowl&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robinson&quot;/&gt; With Miller refusing to bowl as directed, Johnson replaced him in the attack with Ray Lindwall.  Walking off the field at the end of the day's play and continuing in the dressing room, Miller provoked Johnson, telling him he &quot;couldn't captain a team of schoolboys&quot;, among other insults.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robinson&quot;/&gt; Finally Johnson responded, asking &quot;If you want to go on like that why don't we go around the back and thrash it out?&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Robinson&quot;/&gt; The much larger Miller declined the offer and the pair travelled back to the team hotel together.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robinson&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Perry&quot;/&gt;  The next day, Atkinson and Depeiaza batted throughout the entire day's play.

In the Fifth and final Test, the Australians scored 758&amp;nbsp;runs in their only innings&amp;mdash;including maiden Test centuries for Benaud and [[Ron Archer]], centuries for Miller and [[Colin McDonald (cricketer)|Colin McDonald]], and a double century for Neil Harvey&amp;mdash;to win the match by an innings and 83&amp;nbsp;runs.&lt;ref name=&quot;WIvA5thTest1955&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/21/21579.html|title = West Indies v Australia: Australia in West Indies 1954/55 (5th Test)|publisher = CricketArchive|accessdate = 2008-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Overall, despite the team's victory in the series, Johnson's on-field contribution was inconsistent.&lt;ref name=&quot;WisdenObit&quot;/&gt;  While he took 14&amp;nbsp;wickets in the Test series, seven  came in just one innings.&lt;ref name=&quot;WIvA1955BowlAvg&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Events/WI/Australia_in_West_Indies_1954-55/t_Australia_Bowling.html|title = Test Bowling for Australia: Australia in West Indies 1954/55|publisher = CricketArchive|accessdate = 2008-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His inconsistent form saw internal team tensions develop over whether his place in the team was justified; ''Wisden'' claimed that &quot;some malcontents called him '[[myxomatosis]]' because he only bowled when the [[List of cricket terms#R|rabbit]]s were in&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;WisdenObit&quot;/&gt;  {{quote|Ian was starting to wane as a player.

Donald Bradman wrote to [[Prime Ministers of Australia|Prime Minister]] [[Robert Menzies]] after the tour, recommending an honour for Johnson in recognition of his contribution to the tour's success.&lt;ref name=&quot;Haighp95&quot;/&gt;  The next year, both Johnson and Miller were appointed as [[Order of the British Empire|Members of the Order of the British Empire]] (MBE).&lt;ref name=&quot;Haighp95&quot;/&gt;

===&quot;Lakered&quot;===
Johnson led his [[Australian cricket team in England in 1956|Australian team to England in 1956]].

The First Test, at [[Nottingham]], was affected by rain and, despite England [[Declaration and forfeiture|declaring]] twice, the match ended in a draw.&lt;ref name=&quot;EvA1stT56Wisden&quot;&gt;{{cite web|year = 1957|url = http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/152626.html|title = First Test Match: England v Australia 1956|work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack - online archive|publisher = John Wisden &amp; Co|accessdate = 2008-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Injuries to Lindwall and Davidson meant an under-strength Australian team was forced to take the field in the Second Test at Lord's.&lt;ref name=&quot;EvA1956Wisden&quot;/&gt;  In what ''Wisden'' described as a &quot;triumph of teamwork&quot;, the Australians won the match by 185&amp;nbsp;runs.&lt;ref name=&quot;EvA2ndT56Wisden&quot;&gt;{{cite web|year = 1957|url = http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/152627.html|title = Second Test Match: England v Australia 1956|work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack - online archive|publisher = John Wisden &amp; Co|accessdate = 2008-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson was unlucky to lose the toss in the Third Test at Leeds, because Lock and Laker were able to take maximum advantage of a pitch conducive to spin.

The Fourth Test at Manchester proved controversial. The Old Trafford pitch had little grass, perhaps as a result of earlier wet weather.&lt;ref name=&quot;Frith&quot;&gt;Frith (2007), p. 238.&lt;/ref&gt;  Again, Johnson lost the toss and England chose to bat first. Johnson and his spinning partner, [[Richie Benaud]] were unable to exploit the spin-friendly conditions and the English made 459&amp;nbsp;runs.  In reply, the Australians could not come to grips with the conditions; Laker took nine of the ten wickets, Lock the other, as Australia were brushed away for just 84.&lt;ref name=&quot;EvA4thT56Wisden&quot;&gt;{{cite web|year = 1957|url = http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/152629.html|title = Fourth Test Match: England v Australia 1956|work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack - online archive|publisher = John Wisden &amp; Co|accessdate = 2008-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amid wild weather, the Australians were asked to [[follow-on]].  A determined batting performance was not enough to prevent an English victory by an innings and 170&amp;nbsp;runs.&lt;ref name=&quot;EvA4thT56Wisden&quot;/&gt;  Laker's performance was historic.

Playing down the discontent felt by the Australians, he said: &quot;When the controversy and side issues of the match are forgotten, Laker's wonderful bowling will remain.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;EvA4thT56Wisden&quot;/&gt;  The media reported that Australia had been &quot;Lakered&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lakered&quot;&gt;{{cite news|first = Doug|last = Gillon|title = Jim Laker: cricket's master of spin|url = http://www.theherald.co.uk/sport/thearchive/display.var.2279641.0.Jim_Laker_crickets_master_of_spin.php|publisher = [[The Herald (Glasgow)]]|date = 2008-05-19|accessdate = 2008-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Fifth and final Test was drawn and Australia lost the series two Tests to one.  Australia had now lost three Ashes series in a row, the last two with Johnson as captain.  His own form was modest; he took only six wickets in the Tests at an average of over 50&amp;nbsp;runs per wicket.&lt;ref name=&quot;1956bowling&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Events/ENG/Australia_in_England_1956/t_Australia_Bowling.html|title = Test Bowling for Australia: Australia in England 1956|publisher = Cricinfo|accessdate = 2008-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; His performance with the bat was worse, scoring just 61&amp;nbsp;runs at an average of only 7.62.&lt;ref name=&quot;1956batting&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Events/ENG/Australia_in_England_1956/t_Australia_Batting.html|title = Test Batting for Australia: Australia in England 1956|publisher = Cricinfo|accessdate = 2008-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Once again, Johnson's place in the team was questioned. Acerbic cricket pundit [[Sid Barnes]]&amp;mdash;a former team mate&amp;mdash;joked that Johnson was &quot;Australia's non-playing captain&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barnes&quot;&gt;Smith (1999), p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt;  Bill Ferguson, the Australian team's scorer, was also critical: &quot;Had Johnson been told by his friends in the press that he was, in fact, a passenger, he might have pondered on the advisability of standing down. [...] There would have been no shame in standing down.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Robinson&quot;/&gt;  Writing after the tour, Miller&amp;mdash;a tour selector&amp;mdash;stated &quot;Privately I thought that [Johnson] was not a form selection.

===Home and retirement===
On the return journey from England, the Australians toured [[India]] and [[Pakistan]] for the first time, with mixed results. On a [[cricket pitch|matting pitch]], unfamiliar to the Australians, Johnson's team lost the inaugural Test against [[Pakistan national cricket team|Pakistan]] at [[Karachi]].&lt;ref name=&quot;PvA1956wisden&quot;&gt;{{cite web|year = 1957|url = http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/152645.html|title = Test Match: The unplayable Mahmood|work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack - online archive|publisher = John Wisden &amp; Co|accessdate = 2008-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Responding to the loss, a cartoon drawn by Norman Mitchell of the Adelaide ''[[The News (Adelaide)|News]]'' newspaper suggested island planters might be able to scrape together a team that would be a match for the Australians.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robinson&quot;/&gt;  Returning to turf pitches in India, the Australians restored some pride.

[[S. K.

When the team finally arrived home, Johnson announced his retirement from all cricket at the age of 39.&lt;ref name=&quot;Perry&quot;/&gt;  In all, he played 45&amp;nbsp;Tests, capturing 109&amp;nbsp;wickets at an average of 29.19, including three five-wicket hauls.  He scored exactly 1,000&amp;nbsp;runs, making him one of only eleven Australians to achieve ''[[double (cricket)|the double]]'' of 1,000&amp;nbsp;runs and 100&amp;nbsp;wickets in Test cricket.&lt;ref name=&quot;double&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://stats.cricinfo.com/ci/content/records/282786.html|title = Records - Test matches: 1000 runs and 100 wickets|publisher = Cricinfo|accessdate = 2008-06-09}} Correct as at June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In all first-class cricket, Johnson had taken 619&amp;nbsp;wickets and scored 4,905&amp;nbsp;runs. 

His record as the Australian captain was mixed; he had captained Australia in 17 Tests, winning seven and losing five.&lt;ref name=&quot;captain&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://stats.cricinfo.com/australia/engine/records/individual/most_matches_as_captain.html?class=1;id=2;type=team|title = Records - Most matches as captain: Australia - Test matches|publisher = Cricinfo|accessdate = 2008-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he was better known as the first captain to lead Australia to successive Ashes defeats in the 20th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;PerryAshes&quot;&gt;Perry (2000) p. 192. &quot;Losses to England in the mid-twentieth century received more publicity. They are better recalled than the jubilant tours to far-off lands that allowed Johnson to end with two more Test wins than losses.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Reviewing Johnson's time as captain, ''Wisden'' said, &quot;Unfortunately for him, he took over in the mid-1950s, when Australian cricket was decidedly inferior to England's for the first time since before the Bradman era&quot; but &quot;he was a fine cricketer and, in some respects, a visionary&quot;.&lt;ref name=WisdenObit/&gt;

==Personal life==
&lt;!--[[Image:Johnson and family.jpg|thumb|Johnson, with his wife and sons]]--&gt;
In 1942, aged 24, Johnson married 19-year-old Lal Park, the daughter of former Test cricketer, Dr [[Roy Park (sportsman)|Roy Park]].  They were married for 56&amp;nbsp;years and had two sons, Bill and Bob.&lt;ref name=&quot;Perry&quot;&gt;Perry (2000), p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt;  After the war, when cricket commitments allowed, Johnson worked as a salesman.&lt;ref name=&quot;Salesman&quot;&gt;Haigh (2006), p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;  Immediately following his retirement, Johnson spent some time as one of the first television sporting commentators in Australia, covering the [[1956 Summer Olympics]], held in his home town of Melbourne.&lt;ref name=&quot;Olympics&quot;&gt;Haigh (2006), p. 265.&lt;/ref&gt;  He wrote a book; ''Cricket at the crossroads'', published in 1957.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robinson&quot;/&gt;

The following year, Johnson was chosen from a group of 44&amp;nbsp;candidates for the position of secretary of the [[Melbourne Cricket Club]].&lt;ref name=WisdenObit/&gt;  The position&amp;mdash;previously held by Test cricketers [[Hugh Trumble]] and [[Vernon Ransford]]&amp;mdash;is one of the most prestigious jobs in Australian cricket.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, pp. 182&amp;ndash;183. While the source is discussing Donald Bradman's candidacy in 1939, it states &quot;Nevertheless, the job was, and indeed still is, one of the most attractive jobs in the world of Australian cricket&amp;nbsp;...&quot; and &quot;The job was one of the most prestigious in Australian cricket.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;  During a time of &quot;dramatic change&quot;, he helped to maintain the Melbourne Cricket Ground's (&quot;MCG&quot;) pre-eminence as a sporting arena.&lt;ref name=WisdenObit/&gt; Johnson managed the club and the ground through some major redevelopment, keeping a balance between the competing interests of [[Australian rules football]] and cricket. For services to sports administration, he was appointed an Officer in the [[Order of the British Empire]] (OBE) in 1976.&lt;ref name=&quot;OBE&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=1109588&amp;search_type=quick&amp;showInd=true|title =  Johnson, Ian William: Award: The Order of the British Empire - Officer (Civil)|work = Search Australian Honours|publisher = Australian Government|accessdate = 2008-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; He played a leading part in organising the [[Centenary Test#Centenary Test, 1977 at the Melbourne Cricket Ground|Centenary Test]], held at the MCG in 1977.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pollard&quot;&gt;Pollard (1988), pp. 603&amp;ndash;604.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style and personality==
Unusually for an Australian, Johnson bowled [[off-spin]] rather than the [[wrist spin]] normally associated with countrymen of his day.&lt;ref name=WisdenObit/&gt;  Johnson had an atypical bowling action, with a &quot;rather staccato swing&quot; of his bowling arm.&lt;ref name=&quot;CMJ&quot;&gt;Martin-Jenkins (1980), p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt; He bowled with a high degree of [[flight (cricket)|flight]], causing opposing batsmen difficulties in judging where the ball would land.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robinson&quot;/&gt; Making intelligent use of the wind, Johnson was able to make his deliveries float away from the batsman, changing from his standard off-break.&lt;ref name=&quot;CMJ&quot;/&gt; According to [[E. W. Swanton]], Johnson was &quot;probably the slowest bowler to achieve any measure of success in Test cricket&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;WisdenObit&quot;/&gt;  His action was compared to a corkscrew; writer Ray Robinson saying that &quot;to coax turn from firm Australian pitches he twisted the ball almost hard enough to screw a doorknob off&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robinson&quot;/&gt;  There were doubts about the legality of his bowling action; his English rival, [[Trevor Bailey]] claimed Johnson [[throwing (cricket)|threw]] every delivery.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robinson&quot;/&gt;  Johnson was never [[no-ball]]ed for throwing, having played cricket in front of umpires from Australia, England, New Zealand, South Africa, the West Indies, India and Pakistan.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pollard&quot;/&gt; {{quote|[Johnson was] at his best on dry crumbling wickets&amp;mdash;the wet ones made him too slow.  It always looked like he could be hit by a fast-footed batsman.  That he wasn't may be put down to his straight ball, which was hard to detect, and often left the striker down the wicket. A most intelligent bowler, always scheming.|[[Donald Bradman]]|&lt;ref name=&quot;Bradman&quot;&gt;Bradman (1994), p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Jack Pollard]] described Johnson as a &quot;dour middle order batsman&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pollard&quot;/&gt; He had a sound defence and when necessary could hit the ball with power.&lt;ref name=&quot;CMJ&quot;/&gt; Bradman was full of praise for Johnson's batting after the ''Invincibles'' tour in 1948: &quot;Splendid batsman&amp;mdash;most valuable about number&amp;nbsp;7&quot;, also describing him as a &quot;very good slip field&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bradman&quot;/&gt;

[[Image:JohnsontoHutton.JPG|thumb|right|Johnson bowling to [[Len Hutton]] in the Fifth Test in 1950&amp;ndash;51]]
As captain, Johnson was noted for his public relations skills and his gift for public speaking.&lt;ref name=&quot;PRman&quot;&gt;Haigh (2006), p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt;  He was optimistic by nature, with a belief in &quot;guts and determination&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;G&amp;D&quot;&gt;Robinson (1996), p. 245. &quot;With his slogan 'Guts and determination', Johnson had too much fire to lose heart, even when on the ropes.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;  However, he was seen as insensitive at times; Bill Johnston took offence when Johnson attempted to rouse him during a practise session: &quot;Just cos you are one of the old blokes in the side doesn't mean you don't have to bloody well put in you know.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Haighp95&quot; /&gt; At times his optimism could appear artless and naive. [[Ian Craig]]&amp;mdash;his successor as Australian captain&amp;mdash;was critical of Johnson's attitude during the 1956 tour of England: &quot;I don't think [Johnson] was ever realistic about the situation. [...] I supposed he felt obliged to make rallying speeches, but the team knew what was going on.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Haighp99&quot;/&gt; [[Pat Crawford]] felt &quot;Johnson couldn't get anything out of the players, whereas the guys would have busted a gut for [Miller]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Haighp99&quot;/&gt;  He was seen by some of his team mates as &quot;dictatorial&quot; with  Benaud and Harvey particularly resenting Johnson's insistence on the entire touring party attending every lead-in match before 1956 Test series in England.&lt;ref name=&quot;WisdenObit&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Haighp99&quot;/&gt;  

Johnson was sportsmanlike; on one occasion in South Africa, when [[Eastern Province cricket team|Eastern Province]] batsman [[Ray Connell]] was bowled after the ball deflected from his head, Johnson replaced the [[bail (cricket)|bails]], allowing him to continue batting.&lt;ref name=&quot;Haighp28&quot;&gt;Haigh (2006), p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;  During the Adelaide Test in 1950&amp;ndash;51 he &quot;[[List of cricket terms#W|walked]]&quot;, ensuring that the unlucky [[John Warr]] took at least one wicket for the series. {{quote|I got the faintest of faint touches and Godfrey [Evans] went up, half-heartedly.  John followed him, but the umpire said not out.  Well I saw John's shoulders sag, and he looked so crestfallen that on the spur of the moment I nodded to the umpire and walked.|Ian Johnson|&lt;ref name=&quot;Haighp41&quot;&gt;Haigh (2006), p. 41. This was Warr's only wicket in Test cricket.&lt;/ref&gt;}}  Johnson was not above some gamesmanship, resorting to time-wasting tactics to avoid defeat in the final Test of the 1956 series against England.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robinson&quot;/&gt;  He was willing to have some fun on occasion; when in the West Indies he convinced a local pilot to allow him to fly the plane carrying the Australian team between Trinidad and nearby [[Tobago]], to the later displeasure of the Australian Board of Control.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robinson&quot;/&gt;
