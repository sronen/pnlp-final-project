'''Benjamin Edwin''' &quot;'''Ben'''&quot; '''Paschal''' (October 13, 1895 – November 10, 1974) was an American baseball [[outfielder]] who played eight seasons in [[Major League Baseball]] from 1915 to 1929, mostly for the [[New York Yankees]]. After two &quot;[[cup of coffee]]&quot; stints with the [[Cleveland Indians]] in 1915 and the [[Boston Red Sox]] in 1920, Paschal spent most of his career as the fourth outfielder and right-handed [[pinch hitter]] of the Yankees' [[Murderers' Row]] championship teams of the late 1920s. Paschal is best known for [[batting average|hitting]] .360 in the [[1925 New York Yankees season|1925 season]] while standing in for [[Babe Ruth]], who missed the first 40 games with a stomach ailment.

During his time in baseball, Paschal was described as a [[five-tool player]], who excelled at running, throwing, fielding, hitting for average and power.&lt;ref name=starter&gt;{{cite news |title=Trading Season Opens as Phils, Giants Act |author=Brian Bell |page=13|newspaper=[[St. Petersburg Times|St. Petersburg Evening Independent]] |date=October 31, 1928 |accessdate=January 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, his playing time with the Yankees was limited because they already had future [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Baseball Hall of Famers]] Ruth and [[Earle Combs]], and star [[Bob Meusel]], in the outfield. Paschal was considered one of the best bench players in baseball during his time with the Yankees, and sportswriters wrote how he would have [[games played|started]] for most other teams in the [[American League]].&lt;ref name=starter/&gt; He was one of the best pinch hitters in the game during the period, at a time when the term was still relatively new to baseball.&lt;ref name=bestpinch&gt;{{cite news |title=Yanks Win In Tenth, 3 To 2; Lead Series|author=James R.

The New York Yankees bought Paschal from the Crackers near the end of the [[1924 New York Yankees season|1924 season]] and he played in four games.
