'''Donald''' &quot;'''Don'''&quot; '''Tallon''' (17 February 1916 &amp;ndash; 7 September 1984) was an Australian [[cricket]]er who played 21 [[Test cricket|Test matches]] as a [[wicket-keeper]] between 1946 and 1953. He was widely regarded by his contemporaries as Australia's finest ever wicket-keeper and one of the best in Test history,&lt;ref name=&quot;ci&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Players and Officials - Don Tallon |url=http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/ci/content/player/7913.html |publisher=[[Cricinfo]] |accessdate=2008-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; with an understated style, an ability to anticipate the [[flight (cricket)|flight]], [[line and length|length]] and [[spin bowling|spin]] of the ball and an efficient [[Stump (cricket)#Manner of dismissing a batsman|stumping]] technique.  Tallon toured England as part of [[Don Bradman]]'s ''[[The Invincibles (cricket)|Invincibles]]'' of 1948 and was recognised as one of the [[Wisden Cricketers of the Year]] in 1949 for his performances during that season.   During his Test career, Tallon made 58 [[dismissal (cricket)|dismissal]]s comprising 50 [[caught (cricket)|catches]] and 8 stumpings. 

His early cricket was played in [[Bundaberg, Queensland|Bundaberg]] where he was selected to represent Queensland Country against the [[England cricket team]] during the infamous ''[[Bodyline]]'' tour.  Aged 17, he made his [[first-class cricket]] debut for [[Queensland Bulls|Queensland]] against [[Victorian Bushrangers|Victoria]] in December 1933.  By the 1935&amp;ndash;36 season, Tallon was an established player and he topped the Queensland [[batting average]]s for the season, however he was a surprise non-inclusion for the [[Australian cricket team in England in 1938|1938 Australian team]] to tour England.  Following the [[World War II|Second World War]] and the retirement or unavailability of other candidates, he was finally given an opportunity to play Test cricket, making his debut against [[New Zealand cricket team|New Zealand]] in 1946 aged 30. 

Following the ''Invincibles'' tour, poor health dogged Tallon, causing him to miss the 1949&amp;ndash;50 tour of [[South African national cricket team|South Africa]].  He recovered his spot for the Ashes series in 1950&amp;ndash;51, catching well but failing with the [[batting (cricket)|bat]].  Tallon missed selection for the 1951&amp;ndash;52 Test season but recovered his spot for the [[Australian cricket team in England in 1953|1953 Australian team]] to tour England.  He played in the first Test before being replaced by [[Gil Langley]], this time permanently. He retired from first-class cricket in 1953 and returned to Bundaberg, assisting his brother in running a [[Milk bar|corner store]].  He died in Bundaberg aged 68.

== Early years ==
Tallon was born and raised in the Queensland coastal sugar and rum town of [[Bundaberg]], {{convert|400|km|mi|0}} north of [[Brisbane]]. He learned to play cricket on a [[cricket pitch|backyard wicket]] with his three brothers and father Les, an [[iron moulder]] at the Bundaberg [[foundry]], who played as a [[Spin bowling|slow bowler]] in the local cricket competition.&lt;ref name=&quot;l99&quot;&gt;Lemmon, p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;wisden&quot;/&gt; Often the matches would stretch past the daylight hours, and the brothers would play inside the house after moving the furniture to create some open space.&lt;ref name=&quot;l99&quot;/&gt; Tallon was formally trained as a wicket-keeper at North Bundaberg State School where he and his brothers were coached by [[Tom O'Shea]], a teacher and former [[Sheffield Shield]] wicket-keeper.&lt;ref name=&quot;l100&quot;&gt;Lemmon, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; He became the primary school's wicket-keeper at the age of seven, playing with and against boys aged 11 and 12. He learned to keep to the [[leg spin]] of his brother [[Bill Tallon|Bill]], who also went on to represent Queensland. Tallon later said of his decision to become a wicket-keeper, &quot;You are never out of the game, and that suits me fine&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;p187&quot;/&gt; He was captain of his school team at the age of 11 and rose to become captain of Queensland Schoolboys aged 13. He played in Bundaberg's [[division (sport)|A grade]] adult team at 14, and came to the attention of state selectors when Bundaberg played a team captained by Test player [[Alan Kippax]] in 1931.&lt;ref name = &quot;p187&quot;/&gt; 

The following season, he played in the Country trials in [[Brisbane]]. He was selected for the Queensland [[youth system|Colts]] in 1932&amp;ndash;33 and represented Queensland Country against [[Douglas Jardine]]'s [[England cricket team]] during the [[Bodyline]] tour.&lt;ref name=&quot;p187&quot;/&gt; In England's innings of 376, Tallon conceded only five [[bye (cricket)|byes]] and stumped [[Herbert Sutcliffe]], regarded as one of the finest batsmen in Test history.&lt;ref name=&quot;wisden&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;l100&quot;/&gt; He did not get a chance to display his batting prowess as the Bodyline spearhead [[Harold Larwood]] rattled him with a series of deliveries aimed at the throat,&lt;ref name=l100/&gt;&lt;ref name=p_early/&gt; before [[bowled|bowling]] him for two.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; Tallon's fast and efficient skills behind the stumps further caught the eye of cricket officials in early 1933 at the Country Week Carnivals. Tallon distinguished himself with his tidy keeping to the express [[fast bowling|pace bowling]] of [[Eddie Gilbert (cricketer)|Eddie Gilbert]], whose [[throwing (cricket)|suspect action]] and [[Indigenous Australians|indigenous]] heritage were later the subject of controversy.&lt;ref name=&quot;l100&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p early&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt;

== First-class debut ==
[[Image:Don Tallon.jpg|left|thumb|Tallon wearing the maroon cap of Queensland]]
He made his [[first-class cricket|first-class]] debut for Queensland at 17 against [[Victorian Bushrangers|Victoria]] in December 1933,&lt;ref name=&quot;az&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Cashman, Franks, Maxwell, Sainsbury, Stoddart, Weaver, Webster | year = 1997 | title = The A-Z of Australian cricketers|pages =289&amp;ndash;290|isbn=0-19550-604-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; having never previously attended a first-class match as a spectator. He conceded only six byes and took a catch in an innings of 542 in a tidy performance,&lt;ref name=&quot;l100&quot;/&gt; and made 17 and three in an innings defeat,&lt;ref name=o/&gt; but was dropped after the match.&lt;ref name=l100/&gt; Queensland officials had ruled that it was not advisable to take such a young player on away trips to [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[South Australia]] and [[New South Wales]]. Tallon reclaimed his position when Queensland returned for their home games and from then on was the first-choice wicket-keeper for the state.&lt;ref name=&quot;l100&quot;/&gt; He played in only one other first-class match for the 1933&amp;ndash;34 season, scoring 13 and taking a catch and a stumping in an eight-wicket win over [[Southern Redbacks|South Australia]].&lt;ref name=o&gt;{{cite web| title=Player Oracle D Tallon |url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/cgi-bin/player_oracle_reveals_results2.cgi?playernumber=744&amp;opponentmatch=exact&amp;playername=Meckiff&amp;resulttype=All&amp;matchtype=All&amp;teammatch=exact&amp;startwicket=&amp;homeawaytype=All&amp;opponent=&amp;endwicket=&amp;wicketkeeper=&amp;searchtype=InningsList&amp;endscore=&amp;playermatch=contains&amp;branding=cricketarchive&amp;captain=&amp;endseason=&amp;startscore=&amp;team=&amp;startseason= |accessdate=2009-05-14 |publisher=[[CricketArchive]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In his second first-class match in the 1934&amp;ndash;35 season, and his fourth overall,&lt;ref name=o/&gt; he confirmed his batting ability with 58 and 86 against the [[Southern Redbacks|South Australian]] bowling attack led by [[Clarrie Grimmett]], the world's leading [[leg spin]]ner at the time,&lt;ref name=&quot;wisden&quot;/&gt; but was unable to prevent an eight-wicket defeat.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; Tallon played in five matches for the season, and Queensland lost four and won none.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; He took four catches, made two stumpings and scored 216 runs at 24.00 in innings, although he did score four ducks.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;

Towards the end of 1934, Tallon moved to Brisbane, where he worked as a storeman for a car company.&lt;ref name=&quot;p early&quot;/&gt; In 1935&amp;ndash;36, Tallon was Queensland's top batsman in terms of both runs and [[batting average]], scoring 569&amp;nbsp;runs at an average of 51.72.&lt;ref name=&quot;po296&quot;&gt;Pollard (1988), p. 296.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Australian First-Class Season 1935/36: Highest Batting Averages |publisher=[[Cricinfo]] |accessdate=2008-03-28| url=http://aus.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1930S/1935-36/AUS_LOCAL/STATS/FC_1935-36_BAT_HIGHEST_AVS.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Australian First-Class Season 1935/36: Most runs |publisher=[[Cricinfo]] |accessdate=2008-03-28| url=http://aus.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1930S/1935-36/AUS_LOCAL/STATS/FC_1935-36_BAT_MOST_RUNS.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; He started well with 58 in a drawn match against [[New South Wales Blues|New South Wales]], and then scored 45 and made six dismissals in an innings as Queensland fell to an innings defeat against the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] (MCC), including five stumpings.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; He then made four dismissals in an innings in the next match against [[Victorian Bushrangers|Victoria]].&lt;ref name=o/&gt;

Tallon was prominent in the next match against South Australia in [[Adelaide Oval|Adelaide]]. The hosts included Australia captain [[Don Bradman]] in their ranks, making a comeback from illness. The match was mainly noted for Bradman's 233 but Tallon impressed him by taking two particularly difficult catches, one of which dismissed the Australian captain himself. Bradman also praised Tallon for conceding only seven byes in a total of 642, particularly his ability to [[caught|take]] balls passing down the [[leg side]].&lt;ref name=&quot;p189&quot;/&gt; Tallon then scored 88 in Queensland's reply. Bradman opined that he had a &quot;clean-hitting crisp style ... attacking, positive, and with a technique to rival most first-class batsmen&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;p189&quot;/&gt; Despite this, Queensland fell to defeat by an innings and 226 runs.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; He followed this with 51 in a defeat to New South Wales.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; The highlight of Tallon's season was his highest first-class score of 193,&lt;ref name=&quot;po296&quot;/&gt; against Victoria in Brisbane, in the last fixture of the season,&lt;ref name=o/&gt; a match in which he also took five catches in an [[innings]].&lt;ref name=o/&gt; Tallon's innings played a large part in the hosts' saving of the match after conceding a lead of 252 on the first innings.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; As he continued his consistent form with both bat and gloves, he came into strong consideration for Test selection.&lt;ref name=&quot;wisden&quot;/&gt; While Tallon was performing strongly in Australia, the national team were in South Africa and defeated their hosts 4&amp;ndash;0.&lt;ref name=&quot;auslist&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stats.cricinfo.com/guru?sdb=team;team=AUS;class=testteam;filter=basic;opposition=0;notopposition=0;decade=0;homeaway=0;continent=0;country=0;notcountry=0;groundid=0;season=0;startdefault=1877-03-15;start=1877-03-15;enddefault=2007-11-20;end=2007-11-20;tourneyid=0;finals=0;daynight=0;toss=0;scheduledovers=0;scheduleddays=0;innings=0;followon=0;result=0;seriesresult=0;captainid=0;recent=;viewtype=resultlist;runslow=;runshigh=;wicketslow=;wicketshigh=;ballslow=;ballshigh=;overslow=;overshigh=;bpo=0;batevent=;conclow=;conchigh=;takenlow=;takenhigh=;ballsbowledlow=;ballsbowledhigh=;oversbowledlow=;oversbowledhigh=;bpobowled=0;bowlevent=;submit=1;.cgifields=viewtype |title=Statsguru - Australia - Tests - Results list |publisher=[[Cricinfo]] |accessdate=2007-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, it was another unsuccessful season for Queensland; Tallon did not experience a win and suffered losses in three of his six matches.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;

== Pre-war non-selection ==
During the 1930s, Queensland was a weak cricketing state, having only been admitted to the Sheffield Shield in 1926&amp;ndash;27, and the [[Australian Board of Control|national]] selectors tended to choose Australia teams composed entirely of New South Welshmen, Victorians and South Australians.&lt;ref name=&quot;p190&quot;/&gt; New South Wales' [[Bert Oldfield]] was the incumbent wicket-keeper and had no plans to retire, while Victoria's [[Ben Barnett]] had been the reserve keeper on the 1934 tour of England. South Australia's [[Charlie Walker (cricketer)|Charlie Walker]] was also talked of as a possible Test player.&lt;ref name=&quot;p190&quot;/&gt;

Tallon was scrutinised as a Test candidate when England toured for the 1936&amp;ndash;37 Ashes series.&lt;ref name=auslist/&gt; He was selected in Bradman's XI for a one-off match against [[Victor Richardson]]'s XI at the start of the season.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; It was a testimonial for Richardson and such matches were used as Test trials for the top players in Australia.&lt;ref name=l101&gt;Lemmon, p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt; Tallon took three catches but was unable to capitalise with the bat. He made three and was unbeaten without scoring in the second innings as Bradman's men reached their target.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; In the next match against New South Wales, Tallon took four catches and scored 100 to bring his team back into contention after conceding a 190-run lead. However, New South Wales scraped home to win by one wicket.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; It continued a winless streak for Tallon in Queensland colours that had lasted for over two and a half years.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; Tallon had a final chance to push for selection in two matches for an Australian XI and Queensland respectively, against [[Gubby Allen]]'s Englishmen before the Tests. He made a total of seven dismissals but scored only 49 runs in three innings.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;

When the Test team was announced, Tallon was overlooked as the selectors persisted with Oldfield. Tallon remained consistent for Queensland, making 22 dismissals in total for the season.&lt;ref name=&quot;p190&quot;/&gt; With the bat, he once again topped his state's averages, scoring 434&amp;nbsp;runs at 36.16.&lt;ref&gt;Pollard (1988), p. 330.&lt;/ref&gt; He scored 101 against South Australia and 96 against Victoria, but both matches were lost.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; Queensland defeat New South Wales to record their first win in three years, but the remaining five Sheffield Shield matches were all lost.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;

The 1937&amp;ndash;38 season was purely domestic, with no international matches, but it was an opportunity for all players to push for selection in the squad for the [[australian cricket team in England in 1938|1938 Ashes tour]].&lt;ref name=auslist/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p190&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt; It was another disappointing season for Queensland, who were again winless;&lt;ref name=o/&gt; they lost three matches, hung on a for a draw, eight wickets down in another, and the other two fixtures were washed out before the second innings.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; Tallon scored 204 runs at 22.66 without managing a half-century and made 17 dismissals.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;

Tallon's non-selection for the 1938 Ashes touring party surprised commentators.&lt;ref name=&quot;l99&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p191&quot;/&gt; In selection deliberations, Bradman had lobbied for Tallon and Walker, asserting that Oldfield was past his best. The other two selectors, [[Chappie Dwyer]] from New South Wales and [[William Johnson (cricketer)|Bill Johnson]] from Victoria, outvoted Bradman. They selected Barnett, because of his previous tour to England, and Walker. Tallon's omission was overshadowed by that of Grimmett,&lt;ref name=&quot;p191&quot;/&gt; regarded alongside [[Bill O'Reilly (cricketer)|Bill O'Reilly]] as the world's leading legspinner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ponsford, Bradman and the spin triplets|url=http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/australia/content/story/212770.html |accessdate=2007-01-08| first=Kenneth |last=Gregory|publisher=[[Cricinfo]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; No official reason was given for Tallon's non-selection.&lt;ref name=&quot;p191&quot;/&gt; A leak revealed that the reason for his omission was that he was not familiar with the bowling of Australia's three [[spin bowling|spinners]]: O'Reilly, [[Chuck Fleetwood-Smith]] and [[Frank Ward (cricketer)|Frank Ward]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Pollardpg335&quot;&gt;Pollard (1988), p. 335.&lt;/ref&gt;  Another was Tallon's preference in standing back to [[fast bowling|medium pacers]]. In reality, Tallon stood back and stood up to the stumps depending on the situation. While the medium pacers were [[swing bowling|swinging]] the ball, he would stand back to avoid the risk of missing an [[List_of_cricket_terms#E|edge]]. When the ball was old, he would stand up to the stumps when a medium pacer was operating and effect many stumpings with his fast reflexes.&lt;ref name=&quot;p191&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pollardpg335&quot;/&gt; 

During the series, Barnett made two notable errors. With Australia leading the series 1&amp;ndash;0 going into the Fifth Test at [[The Oval]], Barnett dropped [[Len Hutton]] and [[Maurice Leyland]] when both were on 40.&lt;ref name=&quot;p191&quot;/&gt; Leyland went on to post 187 while Hutton set a Test world record of 364. In effect, England were gifted an extra 461&amp;nbsp;runs as they set a world record score of 7/903.&lt;ref name=&quot;p191&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;i.e. 7 batsmen dismissed for 903 runs. Score notation is in the Australian style, where wickets precede runs&lt;/ref&gt; Bradman injured himself during the marathon innings in a rare stint at the bowling crease after the specialist bowlers had failed to break the Englishmen. With [[Batting_order_%28cricket%29#Opening_batsmen_or_openers|opener]] [[Jack Fingleton]] also injured, Australia were down to nine men and fell to the heaviest defeat in Test history (an innings and 579 runs) and the series was drawn.&lt;ref name=auslist/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p191&quot;/&gt; 

Tallon responded during the 1938&amp;ndash;39 season by equalling two world records.&lt;ref name=l101/&gt;&lt;ref name=po352/&gt; The season started poorly for Queensland, not winning any of their first three matches. Tallon made eight dismissals in the opening match of the Sheffield Shield campaign against New South Wales, but the visitors hung on for a draw with one wicket in hand.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; After two consecutive losses, Tallon set the first of his world records.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; Against [[New South Wales Blues|New South Wales]] in Sydney, he dismissed 12 batsmen, six in each innings, a feat performed only once before, in 1868 by [[Surrey County Cricket Club|Surrey]]'s [[Ted Pooley]].&lt;ref name=&quot;l101&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;po352&quot;&gt;Pollard (1988), p. 352.&lt;/ref&gt; Tallon's dozen included three stumpings and he was at the crease when Queensland hit the winning runs to complete their first victory in two years.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; After nine innings during the season without passing 36, Tallon returned to form with the bat, scoring 115 against South Australia, but was unable to take the field in the second innings due to injury as the match ended in a ten-wicket defeat.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; In the final match of the season, Tallon became the fourth keeper to make seven dismissals in an innings, in a match against Victoria.&lt;ref name=&quot;l101&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;po352&quot;/&gt; He did not concede a bye in the innings of 348,&lt;ref name=&quot;wisden&quot;/&gt; and scored 44 as Queensland completed an innings win.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; Tallon finished the season with 34 dismissals in six matches, setting a new Australian season record.&lt;ref name=&quot;l101&quot;/&gt; He took more than five dismissals in an innings in four of the ten innings in which he kept wicket. Observers noted Tallon to be more motivated than ever; his catching and stumping style became more animated, and his [[appeal (cricket)|appeal]]ing reached new levels of sound.&lt;ref name=&quot;p192&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt; He passed 100 first-class dismissals during the season, achieved in just 32 matches&amp;mdash;the fastest Australian to reach the mark.&lt;ref name=&quot;p192&quot;/&gt; Tallon ended the season with 305 runs at 30.50.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;

== World War II ==
[[Image:ColinMcCool.jpg|right|thumb|Colin McCool, with whom Tallon had a noted cricketing partnership]]
Following his form in 1938&amp;ndash;39, Tallon eagerly awaited the arrival of England for the 1940&amp;ndash;41 tour of Australia. He was only 23 and regarded as an almost certain selection following his record-breaking performance with both bat and gloves.&lt;ref name=&quot;l101&quot;/&gt; However, the outbreak of the [[World War II|Second World War]] called a halt to his rise and robbed him of the opportunity to represent his country while in his prime as a cricketer;&lt;ref name=&quot;l101&quot;/&gt; official international cricket did not resume until he was 29.&lt;ref name=&quot;l101&quot;/&gt; In the meantime, domestic cricket continued in 1939&amp;ndash;40.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; It was another poor season for Queensland, who won only once and lost their remaining five matches.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; Tallon scored two fifties before scoring 154 in his last Sheffield Shield innings of the season. This set Victoria a target of 230, but they reached it for the loss of only one wicket.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; Tallon was selected for The Rest of Australia in a one-off match against New South Wales at the end of the season, but managed only a duck and eight. He ended the summer with 401 runs at 28.62 and 17 dismissals.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;

Upon the resumption of competitive cricket, Tallon's chances of selection had improved due to the fates of his pre-war wicket-keeping rivals. Oldfield had long retired.

The performance was to herald the start of a prolific bowler-wicket-keeper partnership.&lt;ref name=&quot;p194&quot;/&gt; Tallon then scored 74 to guide Queensland to the target of 270 with four wickets in hand.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; Queensland won two of their seven matches and Tallon scored 305 runs at 30.50 and completed 27 dismissals to finally gain national selection.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;&lt;ref name=az/&gt;

[[Image:Don Tallon batting.jpg|thumb|left|Tallon batting in 1946&amp;ndash;47]]
Tallon made his Test debut in a one-off Test against [[New Zealand national cricket team|New Zealand]] at [[Wellington]] in March 1946, although the match was only given Test accreditation two years later.&lt;ref name=&quot;l102&quot;&gt;Lemmon, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; On a [[sticky wicket|wet wicket]], New Zealand were dismissed for 42 and 54 against the [[spin bowling|slow bowling]] of [[Bill O'Reilly (cricketer)|Bill O'Reilly]] and [[Ernie Toshack]]. Tallon made a stumping, a [[run out]] and took a catch. He scored only five runs as Australia won by an innings and 103&amp;nbsp;runs. Tallon had rarely kept to O'Reilly's leg spin and impressed the bowler, who compared him with Oldfield.&lt;ref name=&quot;p194&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;testlist&quot;&gt;{{cite web

The following season saw Australia's first Test series since the end of [[World War II]], with five matches scheduled against [[Wally Hammond]]'s touring [[English cricket team in Australia in 1946-47|Englishmen]] in the [[1946-47 Ashes series]].&lt;ref name=auslist/&gt; Tallon staked his claim for the Test wicket-keeping position in Queensland's second match of the season,&lt;ref name=o/&gt; which was against [[MCC tour of Australia in 1946–47#Queensland vs MCC|MCC]]. Tallon combined with McCool in four stumpings and two catches,&lt;ref&gt;Pollard (1988), p. 383.&lt;/ref&gt; and in the process took his first-class tally to 170 dismissals his 50th first-class match.&lt;ref name=&quot;p194&quot;/&gt; He also scored 26 and 35.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; Tallon's proficiency keeping wicket to McCool's bowling was now a major factor in his favour for national selection, because McCool had established himself as Australia's first-choice spinner since the retirement of O'Reilly.&lt;ref name=&quot;p194&quot;/&gt; Tallon was duly selected for the First Test of the series in Brisbane.&lt;ref name=&quot;testlist&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p195&quot;/&gt; 

In [[1946-47 Ashes series#First Test – Brisbane|First Test at Brisbane]] Tallon took two catches but scored only 14 in a victory. Tallon was worried that his poor batting might lead to him being replaced, but he was retained as Australia secured an innings victory in Sydney.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;&lt;ref name=testlist/&gt; He put in a polished performance with the gloves, with four catches and two stumpings, in addition to 30&amp;nbsp;runs. The only negative aspect of the match for Tallon was that he dislocated his finger.&lt;ref name=&quot;l102&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p195&quot;/&gt; Beyond the raw statistics, two of the catches that Tallon made in the first innings were regarded as among his finest ever and turned the tide of the match.&lt;ref name=&quot;pd&quot;/&gt; [[Len Hutton]] and [[Bill Edrich]]&amp;mdash;two of England's leading batsmen&amp;mdash;had seen their team to lunch with only the loss of one wicket. Tallon declared to Bradman that he intended to dismiss Hutton down the [[leg side]],&lt;ref name=&quot;pd&quot;/&gt; so Bradman brought [[off spin]]ner [[Ian Johnson (cricketer)|Ian Johnson]] into the attack immediately after lunch.&lt;ref name=&quot;pd&quot;/&gt; Johnson was instructed to bowl at Hutton's legs to give him an opportunity to [[Batting (cricket)#Leg glance|glance]] the ball. Hutton obliged and struck the ball from the middle of his bat, expecting a [[four (cricket)|boundary]]. He turned around and was shocked to see that Tallon had intercepted the ball from a blind position at a range of just one metre.&lt;ref name=&quot;pd&quot;/&gt; The score was 2/88 as Hutton, who held the Test world record score was dismissed and replaced at the batting crease by [[Denis Compton]]. Bradman introduced McCool and Compton misjudged a [[Batting (cricket)#Cut|cut shot]] which went wide of Tallon and struck Johnson, fielding at [[Fielding_%28cricket%29#Fielding_position_names_and_locations|slip]], in the chest. The ball rebounded past Tallon's shoulder and was heading for the ground when he spun and dived backwards to catch it just before it landed.&lt;ref name=&quot;pd&quot;/&gt; According to [[Roland Perry]], it was &quot;an acrobatic feat that would put any [[trapeze]] artist in the shade, taking one of the most brilliant catches in Test history&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;pd&quot;/&gt; Tallon took another difficult catch from McCool to dismiss Hammond as England fell to 4/99, with three specialist batsmen to improbable catches. This restricted England and allowed Australia to set up a match-winning lead.&lt;ref name=&quot;pd&quot;&gt;Perry, pp. 185&amp;ndash;186.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tallon now felt secure about his place in the team for the rest of the series. This led to increased confidence in his play in the [[1946-47 Ashes series#Third Test – Melbourne|Third Test at Melbourne]] (MCG). After keeping tidily and scoring 35 in the first innings,&lt;ref name=&quot;p195&quot;/&gt; Tallon combined with [[Ray Lindwall]] in the second innings for a 154-run [[Partnership (cricket)|partnership]] in just 92&amp;nbsp;minutes. Described by ''[[Wisden]]'' as a &quot;hurricane&quot;, the partnership was marked by Tallon's powerful [[Batting (cricket)#Drive|driving]] and [[Batting (cricket)#Cut|cutting]].&lt;ref name=&quot;wisden&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Piesse, p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt; Lindwall reached his century, but Tallon fell for 92 to [[Doug Wright (cricketer)|Doug Wright]].&lt;ref name=&quot;p195&quot;/&gt; Tallon's 92 remained the highest score by an Australian wicketkeeper until [[Rod Marsh]] equalled it with 92 not out in the [[1970-71 Ashes series]] and surpassed it with 132 against New Zealand in 1973–74.&lt;ref&gt;p190, [[Richard Whitington]], ''Captains Outrageous? Cricket in the seventies'', Stanley Paul, 1972&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the [[1946-47 Ashes series#Fourth Test - Adeliade|Fourth Test at Adelaide]] Tallon stumped [[Denis Compton]], but the umpire gave him not out because &quot;the glare of the sun suddenly became so intense that he was unable to see clearly the white line of the popping crease&quot;&lt;ref&gt;p43, [[Ray Lindwall]], ''Flying Stumps'', Marlin Books, 1954&lt;/ref&gt; and Compton made 147. The England openers [[Len Hutton]] and [[Cyril Washbrook]] had put on 100 in the second innings when Tallon caught Washbrook, scooping up a ball from Lindwall. Washbrook &quot;stood there transfixed. Even some of the Australian leg-side fielders expressed amazement&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;p36, [[Clif Cary]], ''Cricket Controversy, Test matches in Australia 1946-47'', T. Werner Laurie Ltd, 1948&lt;/ref&gt; Tallon was known for his impetuous appealing - &quot;he was often roaring before he had studied facts and it was his over-eagerness that brought about the shocking decision&quot;&lt;ref&gt;p215, [[Clif Cary]], ''Cricket Controversy, Test matches in Australia 1946-47'', T. Werner Laurie Ltd, 1948&lt;/ref&gt; - and this caused an [[Umpiring in the 1946–47 Ashes series#Catches and Stumpings|umpiring controversy]]. But Tallon maintained the appeal and Bradman backed him. Washbrook told [[Wally Hammond]] that the ball had gone into the ground just before it went into Tallon's gloves and the England captain tried unsuccessfully to find a press photograph of the ball touching the ground.&lt;ref&gt;p37, p110 and p215, [[Clif Cary]], ''Cricket Controversy, Test matches in Australia 1946-47'', T. Werner Laurie Ltd, 1948&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the match Tallon missed a vital stumping off the England wicketkeeper [[Godfrey Evans]], who stayed put for 95 minutes without making a run. Tallon stumped Compton again, but he was given not out and went on to made an unbeaten 103 in a  match-saving stand of 85 with Evans.

Tallon's keeping was further lauded in the second innings of the [[1946-47 Ashes series#Fifth Test – Sydney|Fifth Test]], when he stumped Edrich, [[Jack Ikin]] and [[Alec Bedser]] from McCool's bowling.&lt;ref name=&quot;p195&quot;/&gt; By series end, Tallon had set an Australian Test record of 20 dismissals in a series and averaged 29 with the bat.&lt;ref name=&quot;wisden&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;l102&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;testlist&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p195&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt; He also scored 54 and claimed seven dismissals in a Queensland win over South Australia.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;

Tallon started the next season by taking five catches and scoring 41 in the second innings and Queensland scraped home to beat New South Wales by two wickets.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; He played in all five Tests against [[India national cricket team|India]] in the Australian summer of 1947&amp;ndash;48, and earned praise from Indian skipper [[Lala Amarnath]] who described him as the &quot;greatest keeper he had seen&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;p196&quot;/&gt; Tallon made 13 dismissals but had an unproductive time with the bat, scoring only 49&amp;nbsp;runs at 12.25.&lt;ref name=&quot;testlist&quot;/&gt; Outside the Tests, Tallon scored 229 runs at 22.90 and made 15 dismissals in six matches for Queensland.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;

Tallon's form saw him selected for the 1948 Ashes tour as part of the side that would become known to cricket history as the ''[[Australian cricket team in England in 1948|Invincibles]]''. Tallon was the first-choice wicket-keeper, with Saggers as his deputy.&lt;ref&gt;Pollard (1990), p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Having spent the majority of his life in sunny Queensland and growing up in tropical Bundaberg, the cold English climate initially caught Tallon off guard. He did not wet his inner gloves as was his custom due to the temperature.&lt;ref name=&quot;p196&quot;/&gt; As England agreed to make a [[cricket_ball#Condition_of_a_cricket_ball|new ball]] available every 55 [[Over (cricket)|overs]], this meant that the ball would more frequently be in a favourable state for fast bowling, since it would [[Swing bowling|swing]] more.&lt;ref name=&quot;p197&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 197.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Australia adopted a pace-oriented strategy and Johnson was the only spinner regularly used in the Test matches. McCool was not to play a Test on the tour, depriving Tallon of an opportunity to show his stumping abilities standing up at the [[stump (cricket)|stump]]s to his Queensland team-mate.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, pp. 197&amp;ndash;198.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early in the tour, Tallon struck an unbeaten 17 on a [[sticky wicket|damp pitch]] in a low-scoring match as Australia defeated [[Yorkshire County Cricket Club|Yorkshire]] by four wickets. It was the closest that the tourists came to defeat for the tour.&lt;ref name=york&gt;{{cite web

Tallon had difficulty with the English conditions early in the season as he sustained a bruised right finger when he lost sight of a [[Ray Lindwall]] [[bouncer (cricket)|bouncer]] on a misty morning during a tour match against [[Surrey County Cricket Club|Surrey]] at [[The Oval]] and was hit as he put hand over his face for protection, with the ball running away for four byes.&lt;ref name=&quot;p197&quot;/&gt; As a result of the injury, Tallon was rested for the following three matches.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;&lt;ref name=sched&gt;{{cite web|title=Matches, Australia tour of England, Apr-Sep 1948 |url=http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/invincibles/engine/series/61329.html |publisher=[[Cricinfo]] |accessdate=2008-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He took four catches, including two difficult ones to dismiss key batsmen at the start of the second innings.&lt;ref&gt;Washbrook and Edrich were the men dismissed.&lt;/ref&gt; He thus helped Australia to seize the initiative by denying England a good start, which was converted into an eight-wicket victory.&lt;ref name=&quot;p199&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt; The teams moved on to [[Lord's Cricket Ground|Lord's]] and Australia compiled 350 in its first innings.

Tallon returned for the Fifth Test at [[The Oval]], taking three catches, including an acrobatic catch of [[Len Hutton]] down the [[leg side]] that was considered the catch of the season.&lt;ref name=&quot;wisden&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title= ''Wisden'' 1949 - Don Tallon |url=http://content-www.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/154630.html| year= 1949 |accessdate=2007-05-31| publisher=[[Wisden]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p200&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;l103&quot;/&gt; He scored 31 as Australia sealed the series 4&amp;ndash;0 with an innings win.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; When the last match of the tour against [[Scotland cricket team|Scotland]] in [[Aberdeen]] became safe, with Australia in an unassailable position, Bradman allowed Tallon to dispense with his wicket-keeping pads and try his luck at bowling [[leg spin]].&lt;ref name=&quot;p201&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt; Tallon never bowled in his Test career and only rarely in first-class cricket, where he delivered 301 balls, the approximate workload of a specialist bowler in one match.&lt;ref name=&quot;ci&quot;/&gt;

Tallon had had moderate success with his batting during the Test series, aggregating 114&amp;nbsp;runs at 28.50.&lt;ref name=&quot;testlist&quot;/&gt; In 14 first-class matches, he scored 283 runs at 25.72.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; The Australian team strategy of primarily depending on pace bowling saw Tallon make 12 catches and no stumpings during the Tests;&lt;ref name=&quot;testlist&quot;/&gt; however, Bradman rested his lead pace bowlers Miller and Lindwall during the tour games to save energy for the Tests and allowed the spinners do more work,&lt;ref name = &quot;p202&quot;/&gt; so that overall Tallon took 29 catches and 14 stumpings for the tour.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; Tallon was preferred over Saggers despite conceding byes at a higher rate;&lt;ref name=york/&gt;&lt;ref name=worcs/&gt;&lt;ref name=leics/&gt;&lt;ref name=surrey/&gt;&lt;ref name=essex/&gt;&lt;ref name=camb/&gt;&lt;ref name=ox/&gt;&lt;ref name=mcc/&gt;&lt;ref name=notts/&gt;&lt;ref name=lancs/&gt;&lt;ref name=hants/&gt;&lt;ref name=sussex/&gt;&lt;ref name=sco2/&gt;&lt;ref name=sco3/&gt;&lt;ref name=sco1/&gt;&lt;ref name=sco4/&gt;&lt;ref name=sco5/&gt;&lt;ref name=northants/&gt;&lt;ref name=york2/&gt;&lt;ref name=surrey2/&gt;&lt;ref name=gloucs/&gt;&lt;ref name=middlesex/&gt;&lt;ref name=derby/&gt;&lt;ref name=glam/&gt;&lt;ref name=warwick/&gt;&lt;ref name=lancs2/&gt;&lt;ref name=durham/&gt;&lt;ref name=kent/&gt;&lt;ref name=gents/&gt;&lt;ref name=soe/&gt;&lt;ref name=somerset/&gt;&lt;ref name=lg/&gt;&lt;ref name=scot1/&gt;&lt;ref name=scot2/&gt; Bradman deemed Tallon to be more agile and better at taking acrobatic catches. Tallon's performances during the English summer saw him named by ''Wisden'' as one of its five [[Wisden Cricketers of the Year|Cricketers of the Year]].&lt;ref name=&quot;p202&quot;/&gt;

== Later career ==

The red bars indicate the runs that he scored in an innings, with the blue line indicating the [[batting average]] in his last ten innings. The blue dots indicate an innings where he remained [[not out]].&lt;ref name=&quot;testlist&quot;/&gt;]]
Upon Tallon's return to Australia, he made an unbeaten 146 in Bradman's Testimonial match at the MCG in December 1948.&lt;ref name=&quot;az&quot;/&gt; He featured in a tenth-wicket partnership of 100 with [[Geff Noblet]], who scored only nine as Tallon [[List of cricket terms#F|farmed the strike]] effectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;az&quot;/&gt; This saw the match scores tied on the last ball of the match.&lt;ref&gt;Pollard (1990), p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Tallon also made seven dismissals for the match.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; Queensland lost more than they won during the season,&lt;ref name=o/&gt; but Tallon continued to be productive, scoring 453 runs at 34.85 and making 26 dismissals in seven matches.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; 

Tallon was selected for but withdrew from the 1949&amp;ndash;50 tour to South Africa due to illness caused by [[stomach ulcer]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Pollard (1990), p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; and employment reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Haigh, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; His place was taken by Saggers, who made 21 dismissals in the five Tests.&lt;ref name=p203/&gt; In the meantime, Tallon recovered and played in the Australian domestic season. After scoring 52 in the opening match for the season, he scored 98 and two scores of 58 not out to help Queensland end the season with consecutive wins.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; He ended with 349 runs at 43.63 and 11 dismissals in six matches.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; Tallon was selected for a brief tour of New Zealand at the end of the season with an Australian Second XI led by [[Bill Brown (cricketer)|Bill Brown]],&lt;ref name=&quot;p203&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pollard (1990), p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; and scored 116 in an unofficial Test in [[Dunedin]].&lt;ref name=&quot;az&quot;/&gt; It was the top-score in Australia's 299 and the hosts led by only eight runs with one wicket in hand in their second innings when the match ended in a draw.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; Many of the matches during the tour were not first-class but in one such game, Tallon scored 70 not out as Australia defeated [[Otago cricket team|Otago]] by an innings.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;

In the [[1950-51 Ashes series]] Tallon was fit once more and available for national selection. Despite making only 37 runs in four innings in the lead-up matches, Tallon was chosen for all five Tests.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; He had a poor time with the bat, making only 39&amp;nbsp;runs at an average of just 6.50. He took only eight catches, but kept tidily to retain his place in the team.&lt;ref name=&quot;testlist&quot;/&gt; His performances for Queensland were hardly more productive; he scored 161 runs at 16.10 and aside from a rain-affected draw, his state lost their remaining six matches.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;

By this time, Tallon was losing his hearing,&lt;ref name=&quot;deaf&quot;&gt;Pollard (1990), p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; and gained the derisive nickname ''Deafy''.&lt;ref name=&quot;p204&quot;/&gt; In one Test, he had been told by captain [[Lindsay Hassett]] before going out to bat that there was to be an appeal for [[List_of_cricket_terms#L|bad light]]. Hassett said &quot;go for the light&quot; but Tallon misheard it as &quot;go for a lash&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;p204&quot;/&gt; Tallon walked out and was dismissed for a low score after attempting to attack the English bowlers, leaving his skipper displeased.&lt;ref name=&quot;p204&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tallon missed selection during the 1951&amp;ndash;52 season due his increasingly error-prone glovework and a combination of health reasons including stomach ulcers and deafness.&lt;ref name=&quot;p204&quot;/&gt; He did not play a first-class match because of lack of his fitness.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; In any case, Tallon had secretly been barred from selection by the Australian Board of Control for making unauthorised comments in the media; this fact was not revealed for half a century.&lt;ref&gt;Haigh and Frith, p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was unable to reclaim his Test place in 1952&amp;ndash;53 despite making 133 against the touring [[South African cricket team|South Africans]] and 84 against New South Wales for Queensland before the Tests.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;az&quot;/&gt; Tallon totalled 508 runs at 33.87 for the season and made 33 dismissals in eight matches, including seven in one fixture against Western Australia, but failed to taste victory in a single Queensland match.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; His omission angered Queensland fans, who relentlessly heckled the Australians during the First Test against the tourists in Brisbane,&lt;ref name=h48/&gt; making fun of the mistakes made by Tallon's replacement [[Gil Langley]] in particular.&lt;ref name=h48&gt;Haigh, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was selected for the 1953 tour of England, and scored 76 against Tasmania before the tourists departed.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; Despite making only 35 runs at 7.00 in the lead-up matches,&lt;ref name=o/&gt; Tallon was selected for the First Test at Trent Bridge, his first match at the top level in more than two years.&lt;ref name=testlist/&gt; He took two catches and scored a [[Duck (cricket)|duck]] and 15.&lt;ref name=&quot;testlist&quot;/&gt; Hassett and his deputy [[Arthur Morris]] then made the decision to replace Tallon with Langley.&lt;ref name=&quot;deaf&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p204&quot;/&gt; Still troubled by stomach ulcers,&lt;ref&gt;Haigh, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; Tallon played in another eight first-class matches for the tour, scoring 119 runs at 19.83. His most notable effort was an unbeaten 83 in an innings win over [[Kent County Cricket Club|Kent]]. He was unable to regain his Test position.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;

Tallon retired in dramatic circumstances after the first match of the 1953&amp;ndash;54 Sheffield Shield season. During the match, he suddenly took off his gloves and handed the keeping duties to [[Peter Burge (cricketer)|Peter Burge]].&lt;ref name=&quot;l105&quot;&gt;Lemmon, p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; He scored 21 and 54 not out in a drawn match against New South Wales.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; Two months later, he played for [[Arthur Morris]]'s XI against Hassett's XI, a testimonial match for the latter. Tallon made 17 not out and nine in a 121-run win.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; Tallon continued to play local cricket in Bundaberg for another decade.&lt;ref name=&quot;az&quot;/&gt;

== Style ==
[[Image:Don Tallon stumping.jpg|thumb|Tallon has just executed a stumping in textbook style, removing one [[bail (cricket)|bail]] without disturbing the [[stump (cricket)|stumps]].]]
Regarded as one of Australia's finest ever wicket-keepers, Tallon was lean and relatively tall for a wicket-keeper, standing 180&amp;nbsp;cm.&lt;ref name=&quot;p187&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt; Tallon's high acclaim among cricket pundits derived from his style, rather than raw statistics. In 21 Tests, Tallon kept wicket in 41 innings, making 58 dismissals at an average of 1.41 per innings. Modern Australian glovemen such as [[Rod Marsh]] and [[Ian Healy]], both of whom held the Test world record for dismissals,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Test matches - Most dismissals in career|url=http://stats.cricinfo.com/ci/content/records/283791.html |publisher=[[Cricinfo]] |accessdate=2007-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; averaged closer to two. Tallon's Test batting average of 17.13 pales in comparison to that of contemporary wicket-keepers such as Australia's [[Adam Gilchrist]] and [[Sri Lanka national cricket team|Sri Lanka's]] [[Kumar Sangakkara]], both of whom have made a double century and more than ten centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Players and Officials - Adam Gilchrist |url=http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/ausvnz/content/current/player/5390.html |publisher=[[Cricinfo]] |accessdate=2007-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Players and Officials - Kumar Sangakkara |url=http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/slveng/content/current/player/50710.html |publisher=[[Cricinfo]] |accessdate=2007-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; English wicket-keepers from two decades after World War II such as [[Godfrey Evans]] and [[Jim Parks junior|Jim Parks]] scored two Test centuries apiece and averaged substantially more than Tallon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Players and Officials - Jim Parks |url=http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/england/content/player/18435.html |publisher=[[Cricinfo]] |accessdate=2008-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Players and Officials - Godfrey Evans |url=http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/england/content/player/12543.html |publisher=[[Cricinfo]] |accessdate=2008-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tallon had an understated style, which was without flourish or flamboyancy.&lt;ref name=&quot;l103&quot;/&gt; He was known for his anticipation of the [[Flight (cricket)|flight]], [[Line and length|length]] and [[Spin bowling|spin]] of the ball. He was particularly regarded for his stumping efficiency and his ability to catch balls down the leg side.&lt;ref name=&quot;wisden&quot;/&gt; Tallon often stood up to the stumps for medium pace bowlers and his stumping was highlighted by his textbook technique of lifting the [[bail (cricket)|bails]] without disturbing the [[stump (cricket)|stumps]] (pictured).&lt;ref name=&quot;p191&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt; Tallon's crouch was more pronounced than most other keepers and he rebounded upwards further and faster than others.&lt;ref name=&quot;p198&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 198.&lt;/ref&gt; He had a particularly smooth and graceful catching technique that left his hands undamaged from the ball's impact, the injury in England in 1948 being a notable exception that proved the rule. In recognising him as one of their five Cricketers of the Year in the 1949 ''Wisden'', the Almanack noted that his hands resembled those of a [[violin]]ist, while Bradman noted that all his &quot;fine, longer fingers were intact&quot; as though he had not played much cricket.&lt;ref name=&quot;l103&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p202&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt; According to his English counterpart [[Godfrey Evans]], Tallon was the &quot;best and most nimble keeper ever&quot; while Australian team-mate [[Alan Davidson (cricketer)|Alan Davidson]] called him the &quot;Bradman of keepers&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;p196&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to financial reasons, Tallon could not afford new equipment and he used an outdated pair of [[gauntlet (glove)|iron-coated gloves]] for most of his career.&lt;ref&gt;Haigh, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

Strong driving and quick scoring were hallmarks of his batting, made possible by his swift footwork.&lt;ref name=&quot;wisden&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;az&quot;/&gt; According to Bradman, Tallon's batting was &quot;attacking, positive and with a technique to rival most first-class batsmen&quot;. This led Bradman to select Tallon in his all-time best XI.&lt;ref name=&quot;p189&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt; Tallon was a vociferous and frequent [[appeal (cricket)|appealer]] behind the stumps, something that led to complaints from opposition batsmen who felt that the pressure he exerted was unfair.&lt;ref name=&quot;p190&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;l103&quot;/&gt;

== Outside cricket ==

Tallon married his first wife Marjorie Beattie in 1946.&lt;ref name=&quot;p194&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt; The constant travel, interstate and overseas, took a toll on his marriage and the pair divorced in 1950.&lt;ref name=&quot;p203&quot;/&gt; In 1954, he married Lynda Kirchner from his native Bundaberg, with whom he had two daughters. In retirement, Tallon helped his younger brother Mat in running a corner store in Bundaberg.&lt;ref name=&quot;p205&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 205.&lt;/ref&gt; His nephew Ross played one match for Queensland Colts in 1967&amp;ndash;68.&lt;ref name=&quot;az&quot;/&gt; The Tallon bridge, built in 1955 in Bundaberg was named after the famous Bundabergian which links west &amp; north Bundaberg.
