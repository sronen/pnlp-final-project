'''Wayne Douglas Gretzky''', [[Order of Canada|CC]] ({{IPA-en|ˈɡrɛtski|pron}}; born January 26, 1961) is a Canadian former professional [[ice hockey]] player and former head coach. He played 20 seasons in the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) for four teams from 1979 to 1999. Nicknamed &quot;The Great One&quot;, he has been called &quot;the greatest hockey player ever&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Greatest&quot;/&gt; by many sportswriters, players, and the NHL itself. He is the leading point-scorer in NHL history, as well as the only NHL player to total over 200&amp;nbsp;points in one season – a feat he accomplished four times. In addition, he tallied over 100&amp;nbsp;points in 16 professional seasons, 14 of them consecutive. At the time of his retirement in 1999, he held 40 regular-season records, 15 playoff records, and six [[NHL All-Star Game|All-Star]] records. In addition to being its greatest scorer, Gretzky was the most gentlemanly superstar in the modern history of the NHL. He won the [[Lady Byng Trophy]] for sportsmanship and performance five times,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

| quote = Once upon a time, Wayne Gretzky opposed fighting in hockey as passionately as Sinden, suggesting soon after he arrived in Los Angeles that hockey would never be a mainstream sport as long as fighting was condoned the way it was. Ultimately, as Gretzky’s voice was ignored for years and years, he stopped contributing to the conversation. People can only be shouted down for so long before they figure it’s somebody else’s turn to carry the torch.

Born and raised in [[Brantford]], Ontario, Gretzky honed his skills at a backyard rink and regularly played [[List of ice hockey leagues#Amateur|minor hockey]] at a level far above his peers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Young&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Schwartz|first=Larry|url=http://espn.go.com/sportscentury/features/00014218.html|title='Great' and 'Gretzky' belong together|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=October 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his unimpressive stature, strength and speed, Gretzky's intelligence and reading of the game were unrivaled. He was adept at dodging checks from opposing players, and he could consistently anticipate where the puck was going to be and execute the right move at the right time. Gretzky also became known for setting up behind his opponent's net, an area that was nicknamed &quot;Gretzky's office&quot; because of his adept skills in that area.&lt;ref name=&quot;sptimes.com&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Sullivan|first=Tim|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2004/06/03/hockeyschool/graphic.shtml|title=Gretzky's office|work=[[St. Petersburg Times]]|accessdate=April 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978, he signed with the [[Indianapolis Racers]] of the World Hockey Association (WHA), where he briefly played before being traded to the [[Edmonton Oilers]]. When the WHA folded, the Oilers joined the NHL, where he established many scoring records and led his team to four [[Stanley Cup]] championships. His trade to the [[Los Angeles Kings]] on August 9, 1988, had an immediate impact on the team's performance, eventually leading them to the [[1993 Stanley Cup Finals]], and he is credited with popularizing hockey in California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Allen |first=Kevin |url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/hockey/nhl/2008-08-07-gretzky-trade-anniversary_N.htm |title=Gretzky trade remembered for 'seismic impact' |work=USA Today |date=August 10, 2008 |accessdate=February 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gretzky played briefly for the [[St. Louis Blues]] before finishing his career with the [[New York Rangers]]. Gretzky captured nine [[Hart Trophy|Hart Trophies]] as the most valuable player, ten [[Art Ross Trophy|Art Ross Trophies]] for most [[point (ice hockey)|points]] in a season, five Lady Byng Trophies, five [[Lester B. Pearson Award]]s, and two [[Conn Smythe Trophy|Conn Smythe Trophies]] as playoff MVP.

After his retirement in [[1998–99 NHL season|1999]], he was immediately inducted into the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]], making him the most recent player to have the waiting period waived. The NHL [[List of NHL retired numbers|retired]] his [[jersey number]] 99 league-wide, making him the only player to receive this honor. He was one of six players voted to the [[International Ice Hockey Federation]]'s (IIHF) [[IIHF Centennial All-Star Team|Centennial All-Star Team]]. Gretzky became executive director for the [[Canadian national men's hockey team]] during the [[2002 Winter Olympics]], in which the team won a gold medal. In [[1999–2000 NHL season|2000]], he became part owner of the Phoenix Coyotes, and following the [[2004–05 NHL lockout]] he became the team's head coach. In September 2009, following the [[Phoenix Coyotes bankruptcy|franchise's bankruptcy]], Gretzky resigned as coach and relinquished his ownership share.

== Early years ==
Prior to World War I, Gretzky's paternal grandfather Anton (Tony) Gretzky immigrated along with his family to Canada via the United States from the [[Russian Empire]] (what is now [[Grodno|Grodno, Belarus]]).{{sfn|Kukushkin|2007|p=132}} Following the war, Anton would marry his wife, Mary, who immigrated from [[Pidhaitsi]], [[Second Polish Republic|interwar Poland]] (now [[Ukraine]]).{{sfn|Redmond|1993|p=11}} Tony and Mary owned a {{convert|25|acre|ha|sing=on}} [[cucumber]] farm in Canning, Ontario{{sfn|Gretzky|2001|p=13}} where [[Walter Gretzky]] was born and raised and where he met Wayne's mother, Phyllis Hockin.{{sfn|Gretzky|2001|p=31}} They married in 1960, and lived in an apartment in [[Brantford]], Ontario,  where Walter worked for [[Bell Canada|Bell Telephone Canada]].{{sfn|Redmond|1993|p=11}} The family moved into a house on Varadi Avenue in Brantford seven months after Wayne was born, chosen partly because it was flat enough to make an ice rink on every winter.{{sfn|Gretzky|2001|p=33}} Wayne was joined by a sister, Kim (b. 1963), and brothers [[Keith Gretzky|Keith]], Glen and [[Brent Gretzky|Brent]]. The family would regularly visit Tony and Mary's farm and watch ''[[Hockey Night in Canada]]'' together. By age two, Wayne was trying to score [[goal (ice hockey)|goals]] against Mary using a souvenir stick.{{sfn|Redmond|1993|p=12}} The farm was where Wayne skated on ice for the first time, aged two years, 10 months.{{sfn|Redmond|1993|p=12}}

Gretzky's ancestry is typically described as English on his mother's side and either Belarusian, [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]], or [[Poles|Polish]] on his father's side.{{sfn|Czuboka|1983|p=147}} In a 1999 [[List of members of the Hockey Hall of Fame|Hockey Hall of Fame Inductee]] press conference, Gretzky stated &quot;Thank God I'm Polish&quot; when another inductee made a joke about his Scottish kilt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Happy|first=Michael J.|title=Despite the accolades, Gretzky's still as humble as ever|publisher=[[CBS Sports]]|date=November 22, 1999 |url=http://www.cbssports.com/u/ce/multi/0,1329,1618511_60,00.html|accessdate=November 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In interviews, Gretzky's father Walter has stated that his parents' ethnicity was [[Belarusians|Belarusian]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jones|first=Terry|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Hockey/NHL/Phoenix/2008/02/13/4843850-sun.html|title=Family comes first|work=Ottawa Sun|date=February 13, 2008 |accessdate=April 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; while on other occasions he has mentioned his family's [[Poles|Polish]] ancestry.{{sfn|McKenzie|1999|p=43}} Anton Gretzky has been described as having &quot;been born in Russia with [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] forebears&quot;, while &quot;the only Slavic language spoken in the Gretzky family [was] [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]]&quot;.{{sfn|Czuboka|1983|p=148}} Gretzky's mother Phyllis is of English descent{{sfn|Czuboka|1983|p=148}} and she is related to British General [[Isaac Brock|Sir Isaac Brock]], a hero of the [[War of 1812]].{{sfn |Gretzky |2001 |p=31}}

Walter taught Wayne, Keith, Brent, Glen and their friends hockey on a rink he made in the back yard of the family home, nicknamed the &quot;Wally Coliseum&quot;.{{sfn|MacGregor|1999|pp=19–20}} Drills included skating around Javex bleach bottles and tin cans, and flipping pucks over scattered hockey sticks to be able to pick up the puck again in full flight.{{sfn|MacGregor|1999|p=19}} Additionally, Walter gave the advice to &quot;skate where the puck's going, not where it's been&quot;.{{sfn|MacGregor|1999|p=19}} Wayne was a classic [[child prodigy|prodigy]] whose extraordinary skills made him the target of jealous parents.&lt;ref name=&quot;CBCten&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/greatest/top_ten/nominee/gretzky-wayne.html|title=Top Ten Greatest Canadians&amp;nbsp;– Wayne Gretzky|publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=February 19, 2007 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20061118073910/http://www.cbc.ca/greatest/top_ten/nominee/gretzky-wayne.html |archivedate = November 18, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gretzky's first team, at age six, was a team of ten-year-olds, starting a pattern where Gretzky always played at a level far above his peers through his minor hockey years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Saraceno|first=Jon|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/hockey/gretzky/hall04.htm|title=Gretzky nurtured for hockey fame|work=USA Today|date=November 22, 1999 |accessdate=April 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first coach, Dick Martin, remarked that he handled the puck better than the ten-year-olds.{{sfn|Gretzky|Reilly|1990|p=15}} According to Martin, &quot;Wayne was so good that you could have a boy of your own who was a tremendous hockey player, and he'd get overlooked because of what the Gretzky kid was doing.&quot;{{sfn|Gretzky|Reilly|1990|p=17}} The sweaters for ten-year-olds were far too large for Gretzky, who coped by tucking the sweater into his pants on the right side. Gretzky continued doing this throughout his NHL career.{{sfn|Gretzky|Reilly|1990|pp=18–19}}

By the age of ten, Gretzky had scored 378&amp;nbsp;goals and 139&amp;nbsp;[[assist (ice hockey)|assists]] in just one&amp;nbsp;season with the Brantford Nadrofsky Steelers.&lt;ref name=&quot;greatness&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Falla|first=Jack|editor=Dan Diamond|chapterurl=http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=381966|chapter=Wayne Gretzky: Greatness Ascendant |title=Total Hockey: The Official Encyclopedia of the National Hockey League|publisher=Total Sports |accessdate=September 9, 2010 |isbn=978-1-892129-85-7|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; His play now attracted media attention beyond his hometown of Brantford, including a profile by John Iaboni in the ''[[Toronto Telegram]]'' in October 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Iaboni|first=John|url=http://www.canoe.ca/GretzkyHall/nov22_hkygen.html|title=No. 9 with big No. 9 aspirations|work=[[Toronto Telegram]]|date=October 18, 1971 |accessdate=April 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; By age 13, he had scored over 1,000&amp;nbsp;goals.{{sfn|Redmond|1993|p=16}} His play attracted considerable negative attention from other players' parents, including those of his teammates, and he was often booed.{{sfn|Redmond|1993|p=15}} According to Walter, the &quot;capper&quot; was being booed on &quot;Brantford Day&quot; at Toronto's [[Maple Leaf Gardens]] in February 1975.{{sfn|Redmond|1993|p=16}}

When Gretzky was 14, his family arranged for him to move to and play hockey in Toronto, partly to further his career, and partly to remove him from the uncomfortable pressure he faced in his hometown. The Gretzkys had to legally challenge the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association to win Wayne the right to play elsewhere, which was disallowed at the time.{{sfn|Redmond|1993|pp=16–18}} The Gretzkys won, and Wayne played Junior B hockey with the [[Toronto Nationals (1970–1980)|Toronto Nationals]]. He earned Rookie of the Year honours in the [[Metro Junior A Hockey League|Metro Junior B Hockey League]] in 1975–76, with 60&amp;nbsp;points in 28&amp;nbsp;games. The following year, as a 15-year-old, he had 72&amp;nbsp;points in 32&amp;nbsp;games with the same team, then known as the Seneca Nationals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/LegendsMember.jsp?mem=p199901&amp;type=Player&amp;page=statsawards&amp;list=ByName|title=Wayne Gretzky Career Statistics|publisher=[[Hockey Hall of Fame]]|accessdate=September 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; That year, he also played three games with the Peterborough Petes in the Ontario Hockey Association as an emergency call-up, and even then ''the Great One'' impressed scouts with his abilities despite his small stature and youth.  In addition, he signed with his first agent, Bob Behnke.

Despite his offensive statistics, two teams bypassed him in the 1977 [[Ontario Hockey League|OMJHL]] Midget Draft of 16-year-olds. The [[Oshawa Generals]] picked [[Tom McCarthy (ice hockey b. 1960)|Tom McCarthy]], and the [[Niagara Falls Flyers]] picked [[Steve Peters (ice hockey)|Steve Peters]] second overall. With the third pick, the [[Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds]] selected Gretzky, even though Walter Gretzky had told the team that Wayne would not move to [[Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario|Sault Ste. Marie]], a [[northern Ontario]] city that inflicts a heavy traveling schedule on its junior team. The Gretzkys made an arrangement with a local family they knew and Wayne played a season in the [[Ontario Hockey League]] at the age of 16 with the Greyhounds.&lt;ref name=&quot;Orr&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Orr|first=Frank|url=http://www.sportingnews.com/archives/gretzky/greatone.html|title=Gretzky, only 16, carries a 'Gold-Orr' label|work=[[The Sporting News]]|date=January 17, 1978 |accessdate=December 18, 2011 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080119052653/http://www.sportingnews.com/archives/gretzky/greatone.html|archivedate=January 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was with the Greyhounds that Wayne first wore the number&amp;nbsp;99 on his jersey. He originally wanted to wear number&amp;nbsp;9—for his hockey hero [[Gordie Howe]]—but it was already being worn by teammate Brian Gualazzi. At coach [[Murray MacPherson|Muzz MacPherson]]'s suggestion, Gretzky settled on 99.&lt;ref name=&quot;99reasons&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=384579|title=99 Reasons Why Wayne Gretzky is &quot;The Great One&quot;|publisher=National Hockey League|accessdate=November 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At 16, in his single year at the major junior level, Gretzky surpassed the OMJHL single-season scoring record, winning the OMJHL [[Emms Family Award|Rookie of the Year]] and [[William Hanley Trophy|Most Sportsmanlike]] awards.

== World Hockey Association ==
In 1978, the [[World Hockey Association]] (WHA) league was in competition with the established NHL. The NHL did not allow the signing of players under the age of 20, but the WHA had no rules regarding such signings. Several WHA teams courted Gretzky, notably the [[Indianapolis Racers]] and the [[Birmingham Bulls]]. Birmingham Bulls owner John F. Bassett wanted to confront the NHL by signing as many young and promising superstars as possible and saw Gretzky as the most promising young prospect,{{sfn|Willes|2004|p=221}} but it was Racers owner [[Nelson Skalbania]] who signed 17-year-old Gretzky to a seven-year personal services contract worth $1.75&amp;nbsp;million US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gretzky scored his first professional goal against [[Dave Dryden]] of the [[Edmonton Oilers]]{{sfn|Willes|2004|p=219}} in his fifth game, and his second goal four seconds later.{{sfn|Davis|1999|p=51}} Skalbania opted to have Gretzky sign a personal-services contract rather than a standard player contract in part because he knew a [[NHL–WHA merger|deal]] to take some WHA teams into the NHL was in the works. He also knew that the Racers could not hope to be included among those teams, and hoped to keep the Racers alive long enough to collect compensation from the surviving teams when the WHA dissolved, as well as any funds earned from selling the young star.{{sfn|Hunter|1997|p=192}}

Gretzky only played eight games for Indianapolis. The Racers were losing $40,000 per game. Skalbania told Gretzky he would be moved, offering him a choice between Edmonton and Winnipeg. On the advice of his agent, Gretzky picked Edmonton, but the move was not that simple. Gretzky, [[goaltender]] [[Eddie Mio]] and forward [[Peter Driscoll]] were put on a private plane, not knowing where they would land and what team they would be joining. While in the air, Skalbania worked on the deal. Skalbania offered to play a game of [[backgammon]] with Winnipeg owner Michael Gobuty, the stakes being if Gobuty won, he would get Gretzky and if he lost, he had to give Skalbania a share of the Jets. Gobuty turned down the proposal and the players landed in Edmonton.{{sfn|Gretzky|Reilly|1990|pp=34–35}} Skalbania sold Gretzky, Mio and Driscoll to his former partner, and then-owner of the Edmonton Oilers, [[Peter Pocklington]]. Although the announced price was $850,000, Pocklington actually paid $700,000.{{sfn|Willes|2004|p=219}} Mio paid the $4,000 bill for the flight with his credit card.{{sfn|Gretzky|Reilly|1990|p=35}} The money was not enough to keep the Racers alive; they folded that December.{{sfn|Hunter|1997|p=192}}

One of the highlights of Gretzky's season was his appearance in the 1979 WHA All-Star Game. The format was a three-game series between the WHA All-Stars against [[HC Dynamo Moscow|Dynamo Moscow]]. The WHA All-Stars were coached by [[Jacques Demers]], who put Gretzky on a line with his boyhood idol Gordie Howe and his son, [[Mark Howe]].{{sfn|Willes|2004|p=234}} In game one, the line scored seven points, and the WHA All-Stars won by a score of 4–2.{{sfn|Willes|2004|p=234}} In game two, Gretzky and Mark Howe each scored a goal and Gordie Howe picked up an assist as the WHA won 4–2.{{sfn|Willes|2004|p=234}} The line did not score in the final game, but the WHA won by a score of 4–3.{{sfn|Surgent|2004|p=289}}

On Gretzky's 18th birthday, January 26, 1979, Pocklington signed him to a 10-year personal services contract (the longest in hockey history at the time) worth [[Canadian dollar|C$]]3&amp;nbsp;million, with options for 10 more years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=[[San Diego Union-Tribune]]

After the World Hockey Association folded in 1979, the Edmonton Oilers and three other teams joined the NHL.&lt;ref&gt;The other three teams to join the NHL were the [[New England Whalers]], [[Quebec Nordiques]] and Jets.&lt;/ref&gt; Gretzky's success in the WHA carried over into the NHL, despite some critics suggesting he would flounder in what was considered the bigger, tougher, and more talented league.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cigar&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shouler|first=Kenneth|url=http://www.winespectator.com/Cigar/CA_Profiles/People_Profile/0,2540,13,00.html|title=Lord of the Rink|journal=[[Cigar Aficionado]]|year=1997|accessdate=April 15, 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071012162817/http://www.winespectator.com/Cigar/CA_Profiles/People_Profile/0,2540,13,00.html |archivedate = October 12, 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Oilers, like the other surviving WHA teams, were allowed to protect two goaltenders and two skaters from being reclaimed by the established NHL teams.  Under normal circumstances, Gretzky would have been removed from the Oilers and placed in the pool for the [[1979 NHL Entry Draft]], but his personal services contract prevented this.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=McCurdy |first=Bruce |url=http://www.coppernblue.com/2010/1/26/1270163/happy-birthday-wayne-the-21-year |title=&quot;Happy birthday, Wayne&quot;: the 21-year, personal services contract |publisher=The Copper and Blue |date=January 26, 2010 |accessdate=November 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his first NHL season, [[1979–80 NHL season|1979–80]], Gretzky proved his critics wrong. He was awarded the [[Hart Memorial Trophy]] as the League's [[Most Valuable Player]] (the first of eight in a row) and tied for the scoring lead with [[Marcel Dionne]] with 137&amp;nbsp;points.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hart&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/SilverwareTrophyWinners.jsp?tro=HMT|title=Hart Memorial Trophy Winners|publisher=[[Hockey Hall of Fame]] |accessdate=April 10, 2008 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080429223641/http://www.legendsofhockey.net/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/SilverwareTrophyWinners.jsp?tro=HMT |archivedate = April 29, 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Matheson|first=Jim|title=Gretzky is a bargain|work=The Sporting News |date=November 1, 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Gretzky played 79&amp;nbsp;games to Dionne's 80, Dionne was awarded the [[Art Ross Trophy]] since he scored more goals (53 vs. 51).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net/LegendsofHockey/jsp/SilverwareTrophyWinner.jsp?tro=ART&amp;year=1979=80|title=1979–80 Art Ross Trophy Winner|publisher=Hockey Hall of Fame |accessdate=September 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The season still stands as the highest point total by a first year player in NHL history. Gretzky became the youngest player to score 50&amp;nbsp;goals but was not eligible for the [[Calder Memorial Trophy]], given to the top NHL rookie, because of his previous year of WHA experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=June 6, 1980 |title=Gretzky wins Two NHL honours in first year|work=Globe and Mail |location=Canada |page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Calder was awarded to [[Boston Bruins]] defenceman [[Ray Bourque]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/SilverwareTrophyWinner.jsp?tro=CMT&amp;year=1979-80|title=1979–80 Calder Memorial Trophy Winner|publisher=Hockey Hall of Fame |accessdate=April 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his second season, Gretzky won the Art Ross (the first of seven consecutive) with a then-record 164&amp;nbsp;points, breaking both [[Bobby Orr]]'s record for assists in a season (102) and [[Phil Esposito]]'s record for points in a season (152).&lt;ref name=&quot;99reasons&quot;/&gt; He won his second straight Hart Trophy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hart&quot;/&gt; In the first game of the 1981 playoffs versus the Montreal Canadiens, Gretzky had five assists. This was a single game playoff record.{{sfn|Jenish|2009|p=243}}

During the [[1981–82 NHL season|1981–82]] season, he surpassed a record that had stood for 35&amp;nbsp;years: [[50 goals in 50 games]]. Set by [[Rocket Richard|Maurice &quot;Rocket&quot; Richard]] during the [[1944–45 NHL season]] and tied by [[Mike Bossy]] during the [[1980–81 NHL season]], Gretzky accomplished the feat in only 39&amp;nbsp;games. His 50th goal of the season came on December 30, [[1981–82 NHL season|1981]] in the final seconds of a 7–5 win against the [[Philadelphia Flyers]] and was his fifth of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=50 goals in 39 games Gretzky does it|work=Globe and Mail |location=Canada  |date=December 31, 1981 |page=S1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that season, Gretzky broke Esposito's record for most goals in a season (76) on February 24, 1982, scoring three goals to help beat the [[Buffalo Sabres]] 6–3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Clarity|first=James F.|url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F3091FFC385F0C768EDDAB0894DA484D81|title=Gretzky, scoring three goals, sets season record at 79|work=The New York Times|date=February 25, 1982 |accessdate=April 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He ended the 1981–82 season with records of 92&amp;nbsp;goals, 120&amp;nbsp;assists, and 212&amp;nbsp;[[Point (ice hockey)|points]] in 80&amp;nbsp;games, becoming the first and only player in NHL history to break the two hundred–point mark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Wayne's Top 10|work=[[The Calgary Herald]]|page=C5|date=April 17, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; That year, Gretzky became the first hockey player and first Canadian to be named [[Associated Press Male Athlete of the Year]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gretzky wins Ontario honour|work=Globe and Mail |location=Canada |page=S5 |date=January 26, 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also named 1982 &quot;[[Sportsman of the Year]]&quot; by ''[[Sports Illustrated]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/cover/featured/8830/index.htm |date=December 27, 1982 |title=Wayne Gretzky, Sportsman of the Year|journal=[[Sports Illustrated]]|accessdate=April 11, 2008 |pages=(cover)}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Canadian Press]] also named Gretzky [[Canadian Newsmaker of the Year|Newsmaker of the Year]] in 1982.

The Edmonton Oilers finished first overall in their last WHA regular season. The same success was not immediate when they joined the NHL, but within four seasons, the Oilers were competing for the [[Stanley Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/teamseasons.php?tid=41|title=Edmonton Oilers (NHL)|publisher=The Internet Hockey Database |accessdate=April 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Oilers were a young, strong team featuring, in addition to Gretzky, future [[Hockey Hall of Fame|Hall of Famers]] including forwards [[Mark Messier]], [[Glenn Anderson]] and [[Jari Kurri]], [[Defenceman (ice hockey)|defenceman]] [[Paul Coffey]], and goaltender [[Grant Fuhr]]. Gretzky was its [[Captain (hockey)|captain]] from 1983–88. In 1983, they made it to the [[1983 Stanley Cup Finals|Stanley Cup Final]], only to be swept by the three-time defending champion [[New York Islanders]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/playoffdisplay.php3?league=nhl1927&amp;season=1983&amp;leaguenm=NHL|title=1982–83 NHL Playoff Results|publisher=The Internet Hockey Database|accessdate=April 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following season, the Oilers met the Islanders in the [[1984 Stanley Cup Finals|Final]] again, this time winning the Stanley Cup, their first of five in seven years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/playoffdisplay.php3?league=nhl1927&amp;season=1984&amp;leaguenm=NHL|title=1983–84 NHL Playoff Results|publisher=The Internet Hockey Database|accessdate=April 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gretzky was named an officer of the [[Order of Canada]] on June 25, 1984, for outstanding contribution to the sport of hockey.

=== &quot;The Trade&quot; ===
Two hours after the Oilers won the Stanley Cup in 1988, Gretzky learned from his father that the Oilers were planning to deal him to another team.{{sfn|Gretzky|Reilly|1990|pp=177–179}} Walter had known for months, but kept it from Gretzky so as not to upset him. According to Walter, Gretzky was being &quot;shopped&quot; to Los Angeles, Detroit, New York and Vancouver. According to Gretzky, Pocklington needed money as his other business ventures were not doing well (a similar reason to the cause of [[Babe Ruth]] being sold to the [[New York Yankees]]), and had gone &quot;sour&quot; on Gretzky and wanted to move him.{{sfn|Gretzky|Reilly|1990|pp=182–183}} At first, Gretzky did not want to leave Edmonton, but he later received a call from [[Los Angeles Kings]] owner [[Bruce McNall]] while on his honeymoon asking permission to meet and discuss the deal. Gretzky informed McNall that his prerequisites for a deal to take place were that [[Marty McSorley]] and [[Mike Krushelnyski]] join him as teammates in Los Angeles. After the details of the trade were finalized by McNall and Pocklington, one final condition had to be met: Gretzky had to call Pocklington and request a trade.{{sfn|Gretzky|Reilly|1990|p=183}} When Pocklington revealed his plans to trade Gretzky to Oilers general manager and head coach [[Glen Sather]], Sather went to work trying to stop the trade, but, when he found out Gretzky played a part in it, he changed his attitude to GM as he requested [[Luc Robitaille]] in exchange. The Kings refused, instead offering [[Jimmy Carson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

On August 9, 1988, in a move that heralded significant change in the NHL, the Oilers traded Gretzky, along with McSorley and Krushelnyski, to the Kings for Carson, [[Martin Gelinas]], $15&amp;nbsp;million in cash, and the Kings' first-round draft picks in [[1989 NHL Entry Draft|1989]] (later traded to the [[New Jersey Devils]] – New Jersey selected [[Jason Miller (ice hockey)|Jason Miller]]), [[1991 NHL Entry Draft|1991]] ([[Martin Ručínský|Martin Rucinsky]]), and [[1993 NHL Entry Draft|1993]] ([[Nick Stajduhar]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;NHLnotes&quot;/&gt; &quot;The Trade&quot;, as it came to be known,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oilersheritage.com/history/transformation_transformed_after_trade.html|title=After the Trade|publisher=OilersHeritage.com|accessdate=July 13, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; upset Canadians to the extent that [[New Democratic Party]] [[House Leader]] [[Nelson Riis]] demanded that the government block it,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=20 Years Ago: Gretzky Deal Shocked the Hockey World|publisher=The Sports Network|date=August 9, 2008 |url=http://www.tsn.ca/nhl/story/?id=245714 |accessdate=February 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Pocklington was burned in effigy outside the [[Rexall Place|Northlands Coliseum]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CBCten&quot;/&gt; Gretzky himself was considered a &quot;traitor&quot; by some Canadians for turning his back on his adopted hometown, and his home country; his motivation was widely rumoured to be the furtherance of [[Janet Jones|his wife]]'s acting career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jones|first=Terry|title=Telling it like it is|work=[[Edmonton Sun]]|date=August 12, 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Gretzky's first appearance in Edmonton after the trade—a game that was nationally televised in Canada—he received a four-minute standing ovation.{{sfn|Redmond|1993|p=66}} The arena was sold out, and the attendance of 17,503 was the Oilers' biggest crowd ever to that date.{{sfn|Redmond|1993|p=66}} Large cheers erupted for his first shift, his first touch of the puck, his two assists, and for [[Mark Messier]]'s body check of Gretzky into the boards.{{sfn|Redmond|1993|p=66}} After the game, Gretzky took the opportunity to confirm his patriotism: &quot;I'm still proud to be a Canadian. I didn't desert my country. I moved because I was traded and that's where my job is. But I'm Canadian to the core. I hope Canadians understand that.&quot;{{sfn|Redmond|1993|p=66}} After the 1988–89 season, a life-sized bronze statue of Gretzky was erected outside the Northlands Coliseum, holding the Stanley Cup over his head (picture shown above, to the right).{{sfn|Redmond|1993|p=67}}

=== Los Angeles Kings (1988–1996) ===
The Kings named Gretzky their [[Captain_(ice_hockey)#Alternate_captains|alternate captain]]. He made an immediate impact on the ice, scoring on his first shot on goal in the first regular-season game.{{sfn|Gretzky|Reilly|1990|p=202}} The Kings got off to their best start ever, winning four straight on their way to qualifying for the playoffs. Despite being [[Underdog (competition)|underdogs]] against the defending Stanley Cup Champion Edmonton Oilers in the [[Smythe Division]] semifinals, Gretzky led the Kings to a shocking upset of his old squad, spearheading the Kings' return from a 3–1 series deficit to win the series 4–3.  He was nervous that Edmonton would greet him with boos, but they were eagerly waiting for him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Murphy|first=Austin|url=http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1068306/1/index.htm|title=Dynasty Undone|journal=Sports Illustrated|date=April 24, 1989 |accessdate=April 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; For only the second time in his NHL career, Gretzky finished second in scoring, but narrowly beat out [[Pittsburgh Penguins|Pittsburgh]]'s [[Mario Lemieux]] (who scored 199&amp;nbsp;points) for the Hart Trophy as MVP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/SilverwareTrophyWinner.jsp?tro=HMT&amp;year=1988-89|title=1988–89 Hart Memorial trophy Winner|publisher=Hockey Hall of Fame|accessdate=April 15, 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20050829112445/http://www.legendsofhockey.net/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/SilverwareTrophyWinner.jsp?tro=HMT&amp;year=1988-89 |archivedate = August 29, 2005|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, the [[Associated Press]] named him Male Athlete of the Decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Verdi|first=Bob|title=Hockey's Babe Ruth is athlete of the '80s|journal=The Sporting News|date=January 22, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gretzky's first season in Los Angeles saw a marked increase in attendance and [[Fan (aficionado)|fan]] interest in a city not previously known for following hockey. The Kings now boasted of numerous sellouts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fichtenbaum |first=Paul

Gretzky was sidelined for much of the [[1992–93 NHL season|1992–93 regular season]] with an upper back injury, the only year in which he did not lead his team in scoring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/hockey/gretzky/bio.htm|title=The Wayne Gretzky file|publisher=USA Today.com |date=November 22, 1999 |accessdate=April 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he performed very well in the playoffs, notably when he scored a [[hat trick]] in game&amp;nbsp;seven of the [[Western Conference (NHL)|Campbell Conference]] Finals against the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]].&lt;ref name=&quot;99reasons&quot;/&gt; This victory propelled the Kings into the Stanley Cup Finals for the first time in franchise history, where they faced the [[Montreal Canadiens]]. After winning the first game of the series by a score of 4–1, the team lost the next three games in overtime, and then fell 4–1 in the deciding fifth game where Gretzky failed to get a shot on net.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/playoffdisplay.php3?league=nhl1927&amp;season=1993&amp;leaguenm=NHL|title=1992–93 NHL Playoff Results|publisher=The Internet Hockey Database|accessdate=April 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next season, Gretzky broke [[Gordie Howe]]'s career goal-scoring record and won the scoring title,&lt;ref name=&quot;99reasons&quot;/&gt; but the team began a long slide, and despite numerous player and coaching moves, they failed to qualify for the playoffs again until [[1997–98 NHL season|1998]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kings.nhl.com/club/page.htm?bcid=4183|title=The History of the Los Angeles Kings|publisher=[[Los Angeles Kings]]|accessdate=April 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Long before then, running out of time and looking for a team with which he could win again, Gretzky had been traded from the Kings at his request.

During the [[1994–95 NHL lockout]], Gretzky and some friends (including [[Mark Messier]], [[Marty McSorley]], [[Brett Hull]], and [[Steve Yzerman]]) formed the [[Ninety Nine All Stars Tour]] and played some exhibition games in various countries.

=== St. Louis Blues (1996) ===
On February 27, 1996, Gretzky joined the [[St. Louis Blues]] in a trade for [[Patrice Tardif]], [[Roman Vopat]], [[Craig Johnson (ice hockey)|Craig Johnson]], and two draft picks.&lt;ref name=&quot;NHLnotes&quot;/&gt; He partially orchestrated the trade after reports surfaced that he was unhappy in Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=After 99 trial balloons, Gretzky traded; Wayne gets his wish—if Blues are indeed contenders|work=The Ottawa Citizen|page=B1 |date=February 28, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the trade, the Blues and New York Rangers emerged as front-runners, but the Blues met his salary demands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hickey|first=Pat|date=February 28, 1996 |title=Gretzky's image suffers; Everyone's a big loser in this deal|work=[[The Gazette (Montreal)|The Gazette]]|page=E1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gretzky was immediately named the team's captain.

In 1997, prior to his retirement, ''[[The Hockey News]]'' named a committee of 50&amp;nbsp;hockey experts (former NHL players, past and present writers, broadcasters, coaches and hockey executives) to select and rank the 50&amp;nbsp;greatest players in NHL history. The experts voted Gretzky number one.&lt;ref name=&quot;greatness&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Gretzky 1997 Corrected.jpg|thumb|Gretzky in 1997 with [[New York Rangers]]]]
The [[1998–99 NHL season|1998–99]] season was his last season. He reached one milestone in this last season, breaking the professional total (regular season and playoffs) goal-scoring record of 1,071, which had been held by Gordie Howe. Gretzky was having difficulty scoring this season and finished with only nine goals, contributing to this being the only season in which he failed to average at least a point per game, but his last goal brought his scoring total for his combined NHL/WHA career to 1,072, one more than Howe.{{sfn|Gretzky|Davidson|1999|p=216}} As the season wound down, there was media speculation that Gretzky would retire, but he refused to announce his retirement.

The final game of Gretzky's career was a 2–1&amp;nbsp;overtime loss to the Pittsburgh Penguins on April 18, 1999, in [[Madison Square Garden]].

Gretzky made his first international appearance as a member of the [[Canada men's national junior ice hockey team|Canadian national junior team]] at the [[1978 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships|1978 World Junior Championships]] in [[Montreal]], Quebec. He was the youngest player to compete in the tournament at the age of 16. He went on to lead the tournament in scoring with 17 points to earn All-Star Team and [[List of IIHF World Under 20 Championship Directorate award winners|Best Forward]] honours. Canada finished with the bronze medal.&lt;ref name=intl&gt;{{cite web

Gretzky debuted with the [[Canada national men's ice hockey team|Team Canada's men's team]] at the [[1981 Canada Cup]].  He led the tournament in scoring with 12 points en route to a second-place finish to the [[Soviet national ice hockey team|Soviet Union]],&lt;ref name=intl/&gt; losing 8–1 in the final.  Seven months later, Gretzky joined Team Canada for the [[1982 World Ice Hockey Championships|1982 World Championships]] in Finland.  He notched 14 points in 10 games, including a two-goal, two-assist effort in Canada's final game against [[Sweden national men's ice hockey team|Sweden]] to earn the bronze.&lt;ref name=intl/&gt;  Gretzky did not win his first international competition until the [[1984 Canada Cup]], when Canada defeated Sweden in a best-of-three finals.  He led the tournament in scoring for the second consecutive time and was named to the All-Star Team.&lt;ref name=intl/&gt;

Gretzky's international career highlight arguably came three years later at the [[1987 Canada Cup]]. Gretzky has called the tournament the best hockey he had played in his life.{{sfn|Willes|2007|p=1}}  Playing on a line with [[Pittsburgh Penguins]] superstar [[Mario Lemieux]], he recorded a tournament-best 21 points in nine games.  After losing the first game of a best-of-three final series against the Soviets, Gretzky propelled Canada with a five-assist performance in the second game, including the game-winning pass to Lemieux in overtime, to extend the tournament.{{sfn|Willes|2007|p=1}}  In the deciding game three, Gretzky and Lemieux once again combined for the game-winner.  With the score tied 5–5 and 1:26 minutes to go in regulation, Lemieux one-timed a pass from Gretzky on a 3–on–1 with defenceman [[Larry Murphy (ice hockey)|Larry Murphy]].  Lemieux scored to win the tournament for Canada; the play is widely regarded as one of the most memorable plays in Canadian international competition.{{sfn|Willes|2007|p=149}}

The [[1991 Canada Cup]] marked the last time the tournament was played under the &quot;Canada Cup&quot; moniker.  Gretzky led the tournament for the fourth and final time with 12 points in seven games.  He did not, however, compete in the final against the [[United States national men's ice hockey team|United States]] due to a back injury.&lt;ref name=intl/&gt;  Canada nevertheless won in two games by scores of 4–1 and 4–2.  Five years later, the tournament was revived and renamed the [[World Cup of Hockey|World Cup]] in [[1996 World Cup of Hockey|1996]].  It marked the first time Gretzky did not finish as the tournament's leading scorer with seven points in eight games for fourth overall.&lt;ref name=intl/&gt;  The 1996 World Cup also ended Canada's winning streak at the tournament (including the Canada Cups), losing in three games of a best-of-three final.

Leading up to the [[Ice hockey at the 1998 Winter Olympics|1998 Winter Olympics]] in [[Nagano]], Japan, it was announced that NHL players would be eligible to play for the first time.  Gretzky was named to the club on November 29, 1997.&lt;ref name=intl/&gt;  However, Gretzky, was passed over for the captaincy, along with several other Canadian veterans including [[Steve Yzerman]] and [[Ray Bourque]] in favour of the younger [[Eric Lindros]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lapointe|first=Joe|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9506E2D6153AF932A35751C0A96E958260|title=Nagano '98; Wearing C, for Canada|work=The New York Times

== Influences and skills ==
Gretzky's size, strength, and basic athletic abilities were not considered impressive. As an 18-year-old NHL rookie in 1979, he was conspicuously underweight at just {{convert|160|lb}}. Many critics opined at that time that Gretzky was &quot;too small, too wiry, and too slow to be a force in the NHL&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web
 |url=http://www.oilersheritage.com/history/big_players_waynegretzky.html
 |title=Wayne Gretzky—The Great One |publisher=OilersHeritage.com |accessdate=April 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he managed to increase his weight to {{convert|185|lb}} by the end of his career in 1999, that was still much less than the NHL average. During his years with the Oilers, the team  conducted individual strength and stamina tests twice per year. According to Gretzky himself, he always finished dead last in peripheral vision, flexibility and strength, and could only bench press {{Convert|140|lbs|kg}}.{{sfn|Gretzky|Reilly|1990|p=87}} On the other hand, his intelligence and reading of the game was unrivaled, and he could consistently anticipate where the puck was going to be and execute the right move at the right time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Orr&quot;/&gt; Hall of Fame defenceman Bobby Orr said of Gretzky, &quot;He passes better than anybody I've ever seen. And he thinks so far ahead.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Swift|first=E. M.|url=http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1126259/index.htm

He was considered one of the most creative players in hockey. &quot;You never knew what he was going to do,&quot; said hockey Hall of Famer Igor Larionov. &quot;He was improvising all the time. Every time he took the ice, there was some spontaneous decision he would make. That’s what made him such a phenomenal player.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gretzky’s ability to improvise came into the spotlight at the 1998 Olympics in Japan. Then an older player in the sunset of his career, he had been passed over for the captaincy of the team. But as the series continued, his unique skills made him the team’s real leader. 

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;The Canadians had trouble with the big ice. They had trouble with the European patterns and the lateral play and the endless, inventive cycling.  . . . . Slowly, as game after game went by and the concern continued to rise, Wayne Gretzky began climbing through the lineup. He, almost alone among the Canadians, seemed to take to the larger ice surface as if it offered more opportunity instead of obligation . . . . His playing time soared, as he was being sent on not just for power plays but double shifts and even penalty kills. By the final round . . . it was Wayne Gretzky who assumed the leadership both on and off the ice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Gretzky had such an uncanny ability to judge the position of the other players on the ice that many suspected he enjoyed some kind of extrasensory perception. Sports commentators said that he played like he had &quot;eyes in the back of his head.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
 |url=http://archives.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/clips/1093-6030/
 |title=Ordinary guy with extraordinary talent
 |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation
 |date=November 8, 1977 |accessdate=April 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gretzky said he sensed other players more than he actually saw them. &quot;I get a feeling about where a teammate is going to be,&quot; he said. &quot;A lot of times, I can turn and pass without even looking.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Young&quot;/&gt; One author said, &quot;He could envision the whole rink in his mind and how players were moving within it.&quot; Because of this &quot;vision,&quot; Gretzky was sometimes called the &quot;Einstein of Hockey.&quot;{{sfn|Morrison|2011|p=49}}

Veteran Canadian journalist Peter Gzowski says that Gretzky also seemed to be able to, in effect, slow down time. Gzowski explains that the most elite athletes have &quot;more room in the flow of time&quot; than ordinary athletes.{{sfn|Gzowski|2004|pp=203–204}} Of Gretzky he said, &quot;There is an unhurried grace to everything Gretzky does on the ice. Winding up for the slapshot, he will stop for an almost imperceptible moment at the top of his arc, like a golfer with a rhythmic swing.&quot;  &quot;Gretzky uses this room to insert an extra beat into his actions. In front of the net, eyeball to eyeball with the goaltender . . . he will . . . hold the puck one . . . extra instant, upsetting the anticipated rhythm of the game, extending the moment. . . He distorts time, and not only by slowing it down. Sometimes he will release the puck before he appears to be ready, threading the pass through a maze of players precisely to the blade of a teammate’s stick, or finding a chink in a goaltender’s armour and slipping the puck into it . . . before the goaltender is ready to react.&quot;{{sfn|Gzowski|2004|pp=174–175}}

However, Gretzky denied that he had any exotic innate abilities. He said that many of his advantages were a result of his father's brilliant coaching. 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Some say I have a 'sixth sense' . . . Baloney. I've just learned to guess what's going to happen next. its anticipation. It's not God-given, its Wally-given. He used to stand on the blue line and say to me, 'Watch, this is how everybody else does it.' Then he'd shoot a puck along the boards and into the corner and then go chasing after it. Then he'd come back and say, 'Now, this is how the smart player does it.' He'd shoot it into the corner again, only this time he cut across to the other side and picked it up over there. Who says anticipation can't be taught?{{sfn|Gretzky|Reilly|1990|p=87}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Gretzky learned his skills from his father on a backyard rink at his home. Walter Gretzky had played Junior B hockey, but was slowed by [[chicken pox]] and failed in a tryout for the Junior A Toronto Marlboros, ending his playing career.{{sfn|MacGregor|1999|p=20}} Walter cultivated a love of hockey in his sons and provided them with a backyard rink and drills to enhance their skills.{{sfn|MacGregor|1999|p=19}} &lt;!-- Asked about Wayne's development, Walter and replied, &quot;Wayne always did like hockey. Even when he was three years old—and it just kind of happened.&quot;{{sfn|MacGregor|1999|p=18}} Wayne was asked about how it happened. Where it happened was &quot;right in my own backyard.&quot;{{sfn|MacGregor|1999|p=19}} --&gt; On the backyard rink, nicknamed the &quot;Wally Coliseum&quot;, winter was total hockey immersion with Walter as mentor-teacher as well as teammate. According to Brent Gretzky, &quot;It was definitely pressed on us, but we loved the game. Without the direction of the father, I don't know where I'd be.&quot;{{sfn|MacGregor|1999|p=22}}

The rink itself was built so that Walter could keep an eye on his boys from the warmth of his kitchen, instead of watching them outdoors on a neighbourhood rink, as Wayne put in long hours on skates.{{sfn|Gretzky|Davidson|1999|p=19}} Walter's drills were his own invention, but were ahead of their time in Canada. Gretzky would later remark that the Soviet National Team's practice drills, which impressed Canada in 1972, had nothing to offer him: &quot;I'd been doing these drills since I was three. My Dad was very smart.&quot;{{sfn|Gretzky|Davidson|1999|p=2}} 

In his autobiography, Gretzky describes how at practices, his Dad would drill him on the fundamentals of smart hockey:

:Him: ‘Where's the last place a guy looks before he passes it?’
:Me: ‘The guy he's passing to.’
:Him: ‘Which means...’
:Me: ‘Get over there and intercept it.’
:Him: ‘Where do you skate?’
:Me:  ‘To where the puck is going, not where it's been.’
:Him: ‘If you get cut off, what are you gonna do?’
:Me: ‘Peel.’
:Him: ‘Which way?’
:Me: ‘Away from the guy, not towards him.’ {{sfn|Gretzky|Reilly|1990|p=88}}

Much has been written about Gretzky’s highly developed hockey instincts, but he once explained that what appeared to be instinct was, in large part, the effect of his relentless study of the game. As a result, he developed a deep understanding of its shifting patterns and dynamics. Peter Gzowski says that elite athletes in all sports understand the game so well, and in such detail, that they can instantly recognize and capitalize upon emerging patterns of play. Analyzing Gretzky’s hockey skills, he says, &quot;What we take to be creative genius is in fact a reaction to a situation that he has stored in his brain as deeply and firmly as his own phone number.&quot; Gzowski presented this theory to Gretzky, and he fully agreed. &quot;Absolutely,&quot; Gretzky said. &quot;That’s a hundred percent right. It’s all practice. I got it from my Dad. Nine out of ten people think it’s instinct, and it isn’t. Nobody would ever say a doctor had learned his profession by instinct; yet in my own way I’ve put in almost as much time studying hockey as a medical student puts in studying medicine.&quot;{{sfn|Gzowski|2001|pp=203–204}}

But Gretzky’s skill as an athlete was not all mental. Like Gordie Howe, he possessed &quot;an exceptional capacity to renew his energy resources quickly.&quot; In 1980, an exercise physiologist tested all of the Edmonton Oilers, and when he saw the results of Gretzky’s test of recuperative abilities, he said &quot;he thought the machine had broken.&quot; {{sfn|Gzowski|2004|p=176}} He was, in fact, an exceptional all-around athlete. Growing up, he was a competitive runner and also [[batting average|batted]] .492 for the Junior Intercounty Baseball League's Brantford CKCP Braves in the summer of 1980. As a result, he was offered a contract by the [[Toronto Blue Jays]].{{sfn|Gzowski|2004|p=176}} History repeated itself in June 2011, when Gretzky’s 17-year-old son, Trevor, was drafted by the [[Chicago Cubs]]. Trevor signed with the Cubs the next month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Where Gretzky differed from others in his development was in the extraordinary commitment of time on the ice. In his autobiography, he wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;All I wanted to do in the winters was be on the ice. I'd get up in the morning, skate from 7:00 to 8:30, go to school, come home at 3:30, stay on the ice until my mom insisted I come in for dinner, eat in my skates, then go back out until 9:00. On Saturdays and Sundays we'd have huge games, but nighttime became my time. It was a sort of unwritten rule around the neighbourhood that I was to be out there myself or with my dad.{{sfn|Redmond|1993|pp=12–13}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Gretzky would prod next-door neighbour Brian Rizzetto to play in goal after sundown in order to practice his backhand.{{sfn|Gretzky|Davidson|1999|p=2}} He not only enthusiastically practised long hours every day, but he also started working on his skills at an extraordinarily young age. When asked how he managed, at age ten, to score 378 goals in a single season, Gretzky explained,

&lt;blockquote&gt;See, kids usually don’t start playing hockey until they’re six or seven. Ice isn’t grass. It’s a whole new surface and everybody starts from ground zero. . . . By the time I was ten, I had eight years on skates instead of four, and a few seasons’ worth of ice time against ten-year-olds. So I had a long head start on everyone else.{{sfn|Gretzky|Reilly|1990|p=19}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Gretzky also excelled at baseball and [[box lacrosse]], which he played during the summer. At age ten, after scoring 196 goals in his hockey league, he scored 158 goals in lacrosse.{{sfn|Redmond|1993|p=14}} According to him, lacrosse was where he learned to protect himself from hard [[Checking (ice hockey)|checks]]: &quot;In those days you could be hit from behind in lacrosse, as well as cross-checked, so you had to learn how to roll body checks for self-protection.&quot;{{sfn|Gretzky|Davidson|1999|p=27}} Gretzky, who weighed far less than the NHL average, adroitly applied this technique as a professional player, avoiding checks with such skill that a rumour circulated that there was an unwritten rule not to hit him.{{sfn|Gretzky|Reilly|1990|p=95}} But Gretzky himself dispelled the rumor at the end of one grueling season with the Edmonton Oilers, in which he had suffered a mild concussion as a result of what writer Michael Benson called a &quot;cheap shot&quot; from [[Winnipeg Jets (1972–96)|Winnipeg Jets]] star [[Centre (ice hockey)|centre]] [[Dale Hawerchuk]]. &quot;People say there is an unwritten rule that you can’t hit Gretzky,&quot; he said, &quot;but that is not true.&quot;{{sfn |Benson |2004| pp=54–55}}

Still, Gretzky was a most elusive target. Fellow Hockey Hall of Famer [[Denis Potvin]] compared attempting to hit Gretzky to &quot;wrapping your arms around fog. You saw him but when you reached out to grab him your hands felt nothing, maybe just a chill.&quot; The 205-pound (93 kg) Potvin, a three-time winner of the [[Norris Trophy]] for best defenseman, added that part of the problem in hitting Gretzky hard was that he was &quot;a tough guy to dislike... what was there to hate about Gretzky? It was like running [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi|Gandhi]] into a corner.&quot;{{sfn|Potvin|1999|p=89}}

Gretzky became known for setting up with the puck behind the net, an area that was nicknamed &quot;Gretzky's Office&quot; because of his great prowess there.&lt;ref name=&quot;sptimes.com&quot;/&gt; He could pass to an open teammate, jump out for his own shot on a wraparound, or even try to shoot the puck over the goal to bounce it off the goaltender's back and into the net. Gretzky became accustomed to the position after watching and studying [[Bobby Clarke]] play in that zone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://youtube.com/watch?v=DbbWJHhzLVY|title=Legends of Hockey: Wayne Gretzky&amp;nbsp;– A Biography|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=January 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In honour of his abilities, a large &quot;99&quot; was painted on the ice behind the goal at each end of the rink for his final game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/hockey/gretzky/full35.htm|title=Gretzky bids farewell to hockey|work=USA Today |date=April 18, 1999 |accessdate=January 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Phoenix Coyotes ===
Almost immediately after retirement, several NHL teams approached him about an ownership role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Gretzky turns down offers ; Six NHL teams court him for ownership role| last=Campbell |first=Kent |work=Toronto Star |location=Toronto |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2000, he agreed to buy a 10% stake in the [[Phoenix Coyotes]] in a partnership with majority owner Steve Ellman, taking on the roles of alternate governor, managing partner and head of hockey operations.&lt;ref name=&quot;gallagher&quot;&gt;{{cite news |work=The Province |page=A81 |title=Great One saves hockey in Phoenix |last=Gallagher |first=Tony |date=May 28, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Coyotes were in the process of being sold and Ellman convinced Gretzky to come on board, averting a potential move to [[Portland, Oregon]].&lt;ref name=&quot;gallagher&quot;/&gt; The sale was not completed until the following year, on February 15, 2001, after two missed deadlines while securing financing and partners before Ellman and Gretzky could take over.

On May 5, 2009, the Coyotes' holding company, Dewey Ranch Hockey LLC, filed for [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 11]] bankruptcy.  An ownership dispute involving [[Research in Motion]]'s [[Jim Balsillie]] (with the intention of relocating the team) and the NHL itself arose, which eventually ended up in Court.  Gretzky did not attend the Coyotes' training camp, leaving associate head coach [[Ulf Samuelsson]] in charge, due to an uncertain contractual status with the club, whose bankruptcy hearings were continuing. Bidders for the club had indicated that Gretzky would no longer be associated with the team after it emerged from bankruptcy, and on September 24, 2009, Gretzky stepped down as head coach and head of hockey operations of the Coyotes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

=== Winter Olympics ===
Gretzky was Executive Director of the Canadian men's hockey team at the [[2002 Winter Olympics]] in [[Salt Lake City]], Utah. On February 18, he lashed out at the media at a [[News conference|press conference]], frustrated with media and fan comments regarding his team's uninspiring 1–1–1 start.&lt;ref name=&quot;record-lash-report&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=It's us against the world, emotional Gretzky says; The Great One even lashes out against 'American propaganda'|work=The Record|page=D1|date=February 19, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; His temper boiled over after Canada's 3–3&amp;nbsp;draw versus the Czech Republic, as he launched a tirade against the perceived negative reputation of Team Canada amongst other national squads, and called rumours of dissent in the dressing room the result of &quot;American propaganda&quot;. &quot;They're loving us not doing well&quot;, he said, referring to American hockey fans.&lt;ref name=&quot;record-lash-report&quot;/&gt; American fans online began calling Gretzky a &quot;crybaby&quot;; defenders said he was merely borrowing a page from former coach [[Glen Sather]] to take the pressure off his players. Gretzky addressed those comments by saying he spoke out to protect the Canadian players, and the tirade was not &quot;staged&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Scanlan|first=Wayne|date=February 20, 2002 |title=Gretzky: No regrets: The Canadian hockey team boss says he spoke out, loudly, to 'protect' his players|work=The Ottawa Citizen|page=C1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Canadian team won the gold medal, its first in 50&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/olympics/2002/ice_hockey/news/2002/02/24/usa_canada_ap|title=Stand on guard for thee|journal=Sports Illustrated|date=February 25, 2002 |accessdate=April 27, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gretzky again acted as Executive Director of Canada's men's hockey team at the [[2006 Winter Olympics]] in [[Turin, Italy]], though not with the success of 2002; the team was eliminated in the quarterfinals and [[Ice hockey at the 2006 Winter Olympics|failed to win a medal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.torino.olympics.com.au/news.cfm?ArticleID=6443|title=Gretzky moved to tears as Russia beats Canada 2–0|publisher=[[Australian Olympic Committee]] |date=February 23, 2006 |accessdate=April 27, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was asked to manage Canada's team at the 2005 [[Ice Hockey World Championships]], but declined due to his mother's poor health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tsn.ca/canadian_hockey/story/?id=119130|title=Statement from Wayne Gretzky|publisher=The Sports Network |date=March 21, 2005 |accessdate=April 27, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:2010 Opening Ceremonies - Lighting Interior Cauldron.jpg|thumb|right|Gretzky, [[Steve Nash]], [[Nancy Greene]] and [[Catriona LeMay Doan]] participate in the lighting of the Olympic cauldron.]]

Gretzky also served as an ambassador and contributor in Vancouver winning the [[Bids for the 2010 Winter Olympics|bidding process]] to host the [[2010 Winter Olympics]]. He went to [[Prague]], Czech Republic and was part of the presentation team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0307/02/lol.05.html|title=Transcripts-Vancouver Ecstatic Over Winning Olympic Bid|publisher=CNN|date=July 2, 2003 |accessdate=November 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gretzky was the final Olympic torchbearer at the 2010 Winter Olympics. He was one of four who lit the cauldron at [[BC Place Stadium]] during the [[2010 Winter Olympics opening ceremony|opening ceremony]] (although one was unable to due to technical difficulties with one of the cauldron's &quot;arms&quot; which failed to raise) and then jogged out of the stadium, where he was then driven by police escorts through the streets of downtown Vancouver to light a second, outdoor cauldron near the [[Vancouver Convention Centre]] located in the city's downtown waterfront district.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|title=2010 Winter Olympics opening ceremony|medium=television|publisher=NBC Sports |date=February 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Under [[International Olympic Committee|IOC]] rules, the lighting of the Olympic cauldron must be witnessed by those attending the opening ceremony, implying that it must be lit at the location where the ceremony is taking place. Although another IOC rule states that the cauldron should be witnessed outside by the entire residents of the entire host city, this was not possible since the ceremony took place indoors. However, [[VANOC]] secretly built a second outdoor cauldron next to the West Building of the Vancouver Convention Centre, and Gretzky was secretly chosen to light this permanent cauldron.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

=== Heritage Classic ===
{{main|2003 Heritage Classic}}
Although Gretzky had previously stated he would not participate in any &quot;old-timers exhibition games&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://static.espn.go.com/nhl/news/2003/0603/1562539.html|title=Oilers will play Canadiens in outdoor game|publisher=ESPN|date=June 3, 2003 |accessdate=March 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; on November 22, 2003, he took to the ice one last time to help celebrate the Edmonton Oilers' 25th anniversary as an NHL team.

=== Business ventures ===
Gretzky has owned or partnered in the ownership of two sports teams before becoming a partner in the Phoenix Coyotes. In 1985, Gretzky bought the [[Gatineau Olympiques|Hull Olympiques]] of the [[Quebec Major Junior Hockey League]] for $175,000&amp;nbsp;CA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=The Montreal Gazette |date=March 8, 1985 |title=Gretzky buys Hull juniors|page = C9}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his ownership, the team's colours were changed to silver and black, presaging the change in team jersey colours when he played for the Los Angeles Kings. For the first season that Gretzky played in Los Angeles, the Kings had their training camp at the Olympiques' arena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Gretzky brings Kings to Hull |last=Morrissey |first=Bob |work=Montreal Gazette |date=September 12, 1989 |page=F1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gretzky eventually sold the team in 1992 for $550,000&amp;nbsp;CA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Junior Hockey; Gretzky sells his team; There will be at least another three Olympiques years in Hull; Senators want to train in Hull, but Henry not big on idea|page= E3 |date=May 15, 1992 |last=Warren |first=Ken |last2=Mayoh |first2=Rick |work=Ottawa Citizen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, Gretzky purchased the [[Toronto Argonauts]] of the [[Canadian Football League]] with [[Bruce McNall]] and [[John Candy]]. The club won the [[Grey Cup]] championship in the first year of the partnership but struggled in the two following seasons, and the partnership sold the team before the 1994 season. Only McNall's name was engraved on the Grey Cup as team owner, but in November 2007, the [[Canadian Football League|CFL]] corrected the oversight, adding Gretzky's and Candy's names.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
