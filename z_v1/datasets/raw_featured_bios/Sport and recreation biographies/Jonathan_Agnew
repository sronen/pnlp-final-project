'''Jonathan Philip Agnew''' (born 4 April 1960) is an [[English (people)|English]] [[cricket]] broadcaster and former professional cricketer. He was born in [[Macclesfield]], [[Cheshire]], and educated at [[Uppingham School]]. He is nicknamed &quot;Aggers&quot;, and, less commonly, &quot;Spiro&quot; – the latter, according to ''Debrett's Cricketers' Who's Who'', after former US Vice President [[Spiro Agnew]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | editor1-first= Iain | editor1-last= Sproat | title = Debrett's Cricketers' Who's Who | edition = 1980 | publisher = Debrett's Peerage Ltd | isbn = 0-905649-26-5 | page = 10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Agnew had a successful [[First-class cricket|first-class]] career as a [[fast bowler]] for [[Leicestershire County Cricket Club|Leicestershire]] from 1979 to 1990, returning briefly in 1992. He took 666 [[Wicket#Dismissing a batsman|wickets]] at an [[bowling average|average]] of 29.25 and won three [[Test cricket|Test caps]] for [[England cricket team|England]], as well as playing three [[One Day International]]s in the mid 1980s. His entire international career lasted just under a year. In [[county cricket]], Agnew's most successful seasons came toward the end of his career, after his last international match, when he had learned to [[swing bowling|swing the ball]]. He was second and third leading wicket-taker in 1987 and 1988 respectively, including the achievement of [[100 wickets in a season]] in 1987. He was named as one of the five [[Wisden Cricketers of the Year|Cricketers of the Year]] by ''[[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack]]'' in 1988.

While still a player, Agnew began a career in cricket journalism and commentary. Since his retirement as a player, he has become a leading voice of cricket on radio, as the [[BBC radio]] cricket correspondent and as a commentator on ''[[Test Match Special]]''.  He has also contributed as a member of Australian broadcaster [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]'s [[ABC Radio Grandstand |''Grandstand'']] team.  Agnew's on-air &quot;leg over&quot; comment on ''Test Match Special'', made to fellow commentator [[Brian Johnston]] in 1991, provoked giggling fits during a live broadcast and reaction from across England. The incident has been voted &quot;the greatest sporting commentary ever&quot; in a BBC poll;&lt;ref name=&quot;legwin&quot;&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2005/aug/20/sport.andrewculf|  work = [[guardian.co.uk]] | publisher= [[Guardian Media Group]] | location= London | title = The incident which led to the greatest sporting commentary of all time (according to 5 Live listeners): 'He just couldn't get his leg over' | first = Andrew | last = Culf | date = 20 August 2005 | accessdate = 4 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Henderson (writer)|Michael Henderson]], one of Agnew's peers and rivals, has described him as &quot;a master broadcaster&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;the pick of the sports correspondents at the BBC.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hend&quot;&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/blog/2009/feb/24/england-cricket-jonathan-agnew-giles-clarke|work = [[guardian.co.uk]] | publisher = [[Guardian Media Group]] | title = Aggers puts Radio Halfwit in its place| accessdate = 25 January 2011| date = 24 February 2009 | authorlink=Michael Henderson (writer)| first = Michael | last=Henderson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Playing career==
===Background and early years===
Agnew was born on 4 April 1960 at West Park Hospital in [[Macclesfield]], [[Cheshire]], to Philip and Margaret Agnew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = Births | newspaper = The Times |issue = 54739 | page = 1 | location = London | date = 6 April 1960 | accessdate = 16 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cricinfo&quot;&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/player/8501.html| title = Jonathan Agnew|publisher= ESPN |work=[[Cricinfo]]|accessdate= 3 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; His parents' forthcoming marriage was announced in ''[[The Times]]'' in 1957: Philip Agnew was described as &quot;the only son of Mr and Mrs Norris M. Agnew of [[Dukenfield Hall]], [[Mobberley]], [[Cheshire]]&quot; and Margaret as &quot;youngest daughter of Mr and Mrs A.F.V. McConnell of [[Hampton Hall, Worthen|Hampton Hall]], [[Worthen]], [[Shropshire]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = Forthcoming marriages | newspaper = The Times |issue = 53806 | page = 12 | location = London | date = 3 April 1957 | accessdate = 16 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Agnews had a second son in June 1962 and were recorded as living at &quot;Bainton near Stamford, Lincs&quot;; in April 1966, a daughter, Felicity, was born and was announced as &quot;a sister for Jonathan and Christopher&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = Births | newspaper = The Times |issue = 55423 | page = 1 | location = London | date = 21 June 1962 | accessdate = 16 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = Births | newspaper = The Times |issue = 56607 | page = 1 | location = London | date = 16 April 1966 | accessdate = 16 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Agnew's paternal grandmother, Lady Mona Agnew, died aged 110 years and 170 days in 2010 and is on the [[List of British supercentenarians|list of the 100 longest-lived British people ever]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://announcements.telegraph.co.uk/deaths/117930/agnew |  work = [[Daily Telegraph ]] | location= London | title = Death Announcements | accessdate = 20 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jonathan Agnew recalls growing up on the family farm in [[Lincolnshire]] and first becoming aware of cricket aged &quot;eight or nine&quot;; his father would carry a radio around and listen to ''[[Test Match Special]]'':&lt;/blockquote&gt; &quot;The programme sparked an interest in me, in the same way it has in so many tens of thousands of children down the years, igniting a passion that lasts a lifetime.&quot;&lt;ref name=page7&gt;Agnew. ''Thanks, Johnners''. p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Driven by early enjoyment of the media coverage of cricket, Agnew developed a love for playing the game. At the end of days spent watching cricket on television in a blacked-out room with the commentary provided by the radio, Agnew would go into the garden and practise his bowling for hours, trying to imitate the players he had seen.&lt;ref&gt;Agnew. ''Thanks, Johnners''. p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Agnew's father, an amateur cricketer, taught him the rudiments of the sport, including an [[offspin]] bowling action, as he wanted his son to develop into a bowler like him.&lt;ref name=page7/&gt; Another family connection to cricket was his first cousin, [[Mary Duggan]], who was a women's Test player for [[England women's cricket team|England]] from 1948 to 1963.&lt;ref name=&quot;Who&quot;&gt;{{Cite book | editor1-first= Iain | editor1-last= Sproat | title = The Cricketers' Who's Who | edition = 1991 | publisher = Collins Willow | isbn = 0-00-218396-X | page = 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the age of eight, Agnew [[boarding school|boarded]] at Taverham Hall School near [[Norwich]].&lt;ref&gt;Agnew. ''Thanks, Johnners''. p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; His first cricket coach was Eileen Ryder but, according to Agnew, after &quot;a couple of years&quot;&lt;ref name=page11/&gt; a professional arrived at the school: [[Ken Taylor (cricketer)|Ken Taylor]], a former batsman for [[Yorkshire County Cricket Club|Yorkshire]] who had played three Tests for [[England cricket team|England]] in the late 1950s and early 1960s.&lt;ref name=page11&gt;Agnew. ''Thanks, Johnners''. p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

Agnew attended [[Uppingham School]] for his secondary education,&lt;ref name=&quot;Cricinfo&quot;/&gt; and left in 1978 with nine [[O levels]] and two [[A levels]] in German and English.&lt;ref name=&quot;Who&quot;/&gt; From the age of 16 he developed his skills as a right-arm [[Fast bowling|fast bowler]] out of school hours at [[Alf Gover]]'s cricket school at [[Surrey County Cricket Club|Surrey]].&lt;ref name=&quot;COY&quot;&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.espncricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/154442.html | publisher = ESPN| work=[[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack]] | title= Cricketer of the Year, 1988 |subtitle = Jonathan Agnew| accessdate=3 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; That summer, he saw fast bowler [[Michael Holding]] take 14 [[Wicket#Dismissing a batsman|wickets]] in the [[West Indian cricket team in England in 1976#Fifth Test|1976 Oval Test match]], a performance of pace bowling referred to as &quot;devastating&quot; by cricket writer [[Norman Preston]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/story/152088.html|work = [[Cricinfo]] | publisher = ESPN | accessdate = 23 November 2011 | title = England v West Indies | first = Norman | last = Preston}}&lt;/ref&gt; which made a lasting impression on Agnew.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| url = http://books.google.com/?id=1Aqvrj1YuggC&amp;pg=PA273&amp;dq=jonathan+agnew#v=onepage&amp;q=jonathan%20agnew&amp;f=false| title = Pommies: England Cricket Through an Australian Lens|first=William|last=Buckland|page=273|isbn=978-1-906510-32-9| publisher=Matador| date = 14 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 30 years later he wrote of his bowling during his schooldays:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;For an eighteen-year-old bowler I was unusually fast, and enjoyed terrorising our opponents, be they schoolboys (8 wickets for 2 runs and 7 for 11 stick in the memory) or, better still, the teachers in the annual staff match. This, I gather, used to be a friendly affair until I turned up, and I relished the chance to settle a few scores on behalf of my friends – for whom I was the equivalent of a hired assassin – as well as for myself.&quot;&lt;ref name=page35&gt;Agnew. ''Thanks, Johnners''. p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He began playing for [[Surrey County Cricket Club]]'s [[second XI]] in 1977,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/1/1759/Second_Eleven_Championship_Matches.html |publisher = CricketArchive | accessdate = 3 August 2011 | title =Second Eleven Championship Matches played by Jonathan Agnew }}&lt;/ref&gt; but Surrey made no move to sign him as a player. [[Leicestershire County Cricket Club]] did however take note of Agnew's impressive performances in local club cricket and for Uppingham School, for whom he took 37 wickets at a [[bowling average]] of 8 in 1977,&lt;ref name=&quot;Cricinfo&quot;/&gt; and signed him while he was still a schoolboy in time for the [[1978 English cricket season|1978 season]].&lt;ref name=page35/&gt;

===County cricket===
On his [[first-class cricket|first-class]] debut against [[Lancashire county cricket club|Lancashire]] in August 1978,&lt;ref name=&quot;list&quot;&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/1/1759/First-Class_Matches.html| publisher=CricketArchive| accessdate = 3 August 2011| title = First Class matches played by Jonathan Agnew}}&lt;/ref&gt; the 18-year-old Agnew bowled to [[England cricket team|England international]] [[David Lloyd (cricketer)|David Lloyd]], an [[opening batsman]] with nine [[Test cricket|Test]] [[caps (sport)|caps]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/player/16318.html|title = David Lloyd| publisher = ESPN| work = [[Cricinfo]]| accessdate = 2 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Reported in ''[[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack]]'', Lloyd &quot;was halfway through a forward defensive push when his [[stump (cricket)|off stump]] was despatched halfway towards the Leicestershire [[wicket-keeper]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;COY&quot;/&gt; Agnew took one [[Wicket#Dismissing a batsman|wicket]] in each innings of the match, and did not bat; Leicestershire won by an innings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/38/38493.html| publisher= CricketArchive| accessdate = 3 August 2011 | title = Leicestershire v Lancashire in 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Agnew won a [[Whitbread Brewery]] award at the end of his debut season, an achievement he ascribes to the influence of his county captain, [[Ray Illingworth]]:&lt;ref&gt;Agnew. ''Thanks, Johnners'', p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; he had taken only six first-class wickets at an average of 35.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/1/1759/f_Bowling_by_Season.html| title = First-class Bowling in each season by Jon Agnew|accessdate= 11 November 2011| publisher = CricketArchive}}&lt;/ref&gt; Illingworth was quoted in ''The Times'' as saying that Agnew was &quot;the second fastest bowler&quot; in England in 1978, behind only [[Bob Willis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tyson&quot;&gt;{{cite news| title = Young fast bowler to be coached by Tyson | newspaper = The Times |issue = 60416 | page = 13 | location = London | date = 26 September 1978 | accessdate = 17 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The award afforded him the opportunity to spend a winter in Australia developing his skills, alongside fellow winners [[Mike Gatting]], [[Wayne Larkins]] and [[Chris Tavaré]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.espncricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/154183.html | publisher = ESPN| work=[[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack]] | title = Curbing the bouncer, and more 1979 – Notes by the Editor| first=Norman|last=Preston|accessdate= 3 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to be coached by former England fast bowler, [[Frank Tyson]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tyson&quot;/&gt; All four went on to play Test cricket.{{#tag:ref|Agnew played three times for England.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;He struck the captain, [[Mike Brearley]], a nasty blow in the face. It was, Agnew recalls, merely a gentle delivery off two paces that flew off a wet patch; but it did not deter the headline writers. Such early publicity did him no favours, but when a bowler arrives who is young, fast and English, a quiet settling-in period to one of the more difficult apprenticeships in sport is often denied him.&quot; – ''[[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack|Wisden]]''&lt;ref name=&quot;COY&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Agnew's 1979 season was disrupted by injury. The Editor's Notes of the 1980 ''[[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack]]'' reported, under the heading &quot;England's Promising Youngsters&quot;, that Agnew had strengthened himself over the winter by felling trees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.espncricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/154185.html|  publisher = ESPN| work=[[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack]] | title = Recodification of the laws and more, 1980 – Notes by the Editor| accessdate = 3 August 2011|first=Norman|last=Preston}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agnew's own account is that 1979–80 was &quot;the worst winter of his life&quot;, although his recollection is that he spent it working as a lorry driver.&lt;ref name=&quot;media&quot;&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/jonathan-agnew-my-life-in-media-500072.html |title=Jonathan Agnew: My Life In Media | work=[[The Independent]] | location = London | accessdate = 10 August 2011 | date = 25 July 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; He did, however, make his [[List A cricket|List A]] [[limited overs cricket|limited overs]] debut in 1979, playing just once, against the [[Sri Lankan cricket team in England in 1979|Sri Lanka touring team]] – his competitive List A debut followed in 1980, in the [[Benson &amp; Hedges Cup]] against [[Scotland cricket team|Scotland]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = List A Matches played by Jon Agnew| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate= 11 November 2011  | url = http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/1/1759/List_A_Matches.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; he bowled just three overs (for five runs) and did not bat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Scotland v Leicestershire  – Benson and Hedges Cup 1980 (Group A) | publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate= 11 November 2011  | url =http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/40/40070.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Agnew's career did not initially live up to his early promise.

Don't pitch a single ball up at him. Have two men back for the hook, and bowl short every ball.' This I did for three overs or so, by which time Viv was looking a little exasperated, but was definitely on the back foot. Finally I pitched one up, the great man missed it and umpire [[David Constant]] ruled that Richards was [[leg before wicket|LBW]] for 15.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Agnew. ''Thanks, Johnners''. p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; ''Wisden'' called the pair of batsmen Agnew's &quot;first illustrious victims in Test cricket&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;first&quot;/&gt;

England's next match was [[Sri Lankan cricket team in England in 1984|a one-off home Test]] against [[Sri Lankan national cricket team|Sri Lanka]] and Agnew retained his place in the England team. At the time, Sri Lanka were regarded as the minnows of world cricket:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.espncricinfo.com/srilanka/content/story/99888.html | title = CricInfo talks to Ravi Ratnayeke | first=Ragavan |last= Thuraisingam |accessdate = 2 December 2011 | publisher = ESPN | work = [[Cricinfo]] | date = 3 January 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; this was only their 12th Test match and their first at [[Lord's cricket ground|Lord's]],&lt;ref name=&quot;rep&quot;&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.espncricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/152308.html| work = [[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack]]| publisher = ESPN | accessdate = 8 August 2011| title = England v Sri Lanka 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; but they dominated the match, taking a 121-run lead on first innings and declaring twice.&lt;ref name=&quot;lank&quot;&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/45/45189.html| accessdate=8 August 2011| publisher = CricketArchive | title = England v Sri Lanka in 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a disappointment for England and, in a batsman-friendly match in which the Sri Lankans racked up 785 runs for just 14 wickets, Agnew suffered.  ''Wisden'' described England's pacemen as ineffective;&lt;ref name=&quot;rep&quot;/&gt; Agnew's  match figures were 2–177 off 43 overs.&lt;ref name=&quot;lank&quot;/&gt; Poor performance and a muscle injury limited him to bowling a single over on the last day; later, Agnew reflected on other negative aspects of this match: &quot;I felt a complete outsider, not part of the set-up.

England [[English cricket team in India in 1984-85|toured India and Sri Lanka]] that winter,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.espncricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/151943.html |work = [[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack]]| publisher = ESPN | accessdate = 10 August 2011| title = England in India and Sri Lanka, 1984–85}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Agnew was included in the tour party.  However, he failed to be selected for a Test match, with England's decision to field two [[spin bowling|spinners]] ([[Pat Pocock]] and [[Phil Edmonds]]) in each Test playing a part in limiting Agnew's opportunities.&lt;ref name=&quot;IndT&quot;&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Events/IND/England_in_India_1984-85/t_England_Batting.html |publisher = CricketArchive|accessdate=10 August 2011 | title = Test batting and fielding for England – England in India 1984/85}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agnew played just one first-class match on the tour,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://www.cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Events/IND/England_in_India_1984-85/f_England_Batting.html |publisher = CricketArchive|accessdate=10 August 2011| title = First class batting and fielding for England – England in India 1984/85 }}&lt;/ref&gt; achieving match figures of seven wickets at an average of 29,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Events/IND/England_in_India_1984-85/f_England_Bowling.html |publisher = CricketArchive|accessdate=4 August 2011| title = First class bowling for England – England in India 1984/85}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he did play in three [[One Day International]]s (ODIs), two in India and one in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/player/8501.html?class=2;template=results;type=allround;view=match | title = Statistics / Statsguru / JP Agnew / One-Day Internationals | accessdate = 4 November 2011 | publisher = ESPN | work = [[Cricinfo]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; His debut ODI was promising, as he took 3–38 in a losing cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/45/45564.html| title = India v England – Charminar Challenge Cup 1984/85 (4th ODI) | publisher = CricketArchive | accessdate = 4 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in his remaining two ODIs, he proved very expensive, taking no further wickets and conceding more than seven runs an over in each.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/45/45585.html| title = India v England – Charminar Challenge Cup 1984/85 (5th ODI) | publisher = CricketArchive | accessdate = 4 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/45/45647.html| publisher = CricketArchive | accessdate = 4 November 2011 | title = Australia v England – Benson and Hedges World Championship of Cricket 1984/85 (Group A)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Agnew began the [[1985 English cricket season|1985 season]] vying with the established England fast bowlers to get back into the Test side. Over the winter, the side had been settled, with [[Norman Cowans]] and [[Chris Cowdrey]] playing all five Tests.  [[Neil Foster]] and Richard Ellison shared the third spot alongside the spinners, playing two and three Tests respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;IndT&quot;/&gt; Cowdrey and Ellison had struggled with the ball, both averaging more than 70.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Events/IND/England_in_India,_Sri_Lanka_and_Australia_1984-85/t_England_Bowling.html| publisher = CricketArchive | accessdate = 11 August 2011 | title =Test bowling for England – England in India, Sri Lanka and Australia 1984/85}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the side was extensively remodelled for the first Test of that summer's [[Australian cricket team in England in 1985|Ashes series]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.espncricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/151938.html | title= England v Australia, 1985| publisher = ESPN | work = [[Cricinfo]]| accessdate = 11 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the bowlers who had played the last Test in India, only Cowans had survived the cull and it set the tone for the series. England won the first Test, yet dropped Cowans and [[Peter Willey]], replacing them with Phil Edmonds and Foster. After losing the second Test, and struggling with the ball in the third Test, when Australia made 539 [[all out]] in their only [[innings]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/46/46197.html|publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate= 14 September 2011| title = England v Australia in 1985 – Australia in British Isles 1985 (3rd Test)}}&lt;/ref&gt; England decided to make further changes.

Agnew had performed consistently in county cricket through June and July,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://www.cricketarchive.com/cgi-bin/player_oracle_reveals_results2.cgi?playernumber=1759&amp;testing=0&amp;opponentmatch=exact&amp;playername=agnew&amp;resulttype=All&amp;matchtype=All&amp;teammatch=exact&amp;startwicket=&amp;homeawaytype=All&amp;opponent=&amp;endwicket=&amp;wicketkeeper=&amp;searchtype=MatchList&amp;howout=All&amp;endscore=&amp;playermatch=contains&amp;branding=cricketarchive&amp;captain=&amp;endseason=1985&amp;startscore=&amp;team=&amp;startseason=1985| title = Jonathan Agnew from 1985 to 1985 | publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate = 14 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; culminating in what was to be, statistically, his finest moment as a bowler. Playing against [[Kent County Cricket Club|Kent]], he took 9–70 in the first innings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title = Leicestershire v Kent| publisher = CricketArchive|accessdate=4 August 2011| url = http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/46/46266.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; His timing was perfect and he was called up for the Fourth Test against Australia.  The match finished as a draw, and Agnew failed to take a wicket.  He was relegated from an [[opening bowler]] in the first innings, to fifth bowler in the second, in which he only bowled nine overs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/46/46295.html |publisher = CricketArchive|accessdate= 14 September 2011|title = England v Australia in 1985 – Australia in British Isles 1985 (4th Test)}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was subsequently dropped again from the side, only for Richard Ellison to cement his place with match-winning performances that helped claim the Ashes for England.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2005/sep/06/ashes2005.ashes1| date = 6 September 2005 | work = [[The Guardian]] | location = London| accessdate= 4 November 2011 | title = A swinging success that provides the perfect precedent | first = David | last = Hopps}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later playing career and retirement===
In the [[1987 English cricket season|1987 season]], Agnew achieved the feat of [[100 wickets in a season|100 first-class wickets in an English cricket season]] when he took 101 wickets for his county.&lt;ref name=page55/&gt; He was the first Leicestershire player to achieve this milestone since [[Jack Birkenshaw]] in 1968,&lt;ref name=&quot;COY&quot;/&gt; which was the season before the county programme was greatly reduced, making the feat much less common.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://static.ecb.co.uk/files/hitting-the-seam-issue-3-page-3-269.pdf| title =Hitting the Seam – issue 3| format =pdf | accessdate = 3 November 2011 | publisher =[[England and Wales Cricket Board]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|Between 1969 and 2011, the feat was achieved 50 times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=KDIxbom3Wb4C&amp;pg=PT137&amp;dq=agnew+100+wickets&amp;hl=en#v=snippet&amp;q=100%20wickets%20%22accomplished%2050%20times%22&amp;f=false | title = Bats, Balls: The Essential Cricket Book | first=Les |last=Scott |isbn=978-0593061466| publisher = Bantam Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=&quot;note&quot;}} By this stage, he was working on local radio during the winters and he found the reassurance of the additional income and career path a major factor in his improved form.&lt;ref name=page55&gt;Agnew. ''Thanks, Johnners''. p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; ''Wisden'' preferred to attribute his success to &quot;bowling off a shorter run and ... a wicked slower ball added to his armoury&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;COY&quot;/&gt; The achievement led to him being selected as one of the five [[Wisden Cricketer of the Year|''Wisden'' Cricketers of the Year]].&lt;ref name=&quot;COY&quot;/&gt;

Agnew's form remained good: he followed his 1987 feat of taking the second-most wickets in the County Championship&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Events/ENG/Britannic_Assurance_County_Championship_1987/Bowling_by_Wickets.html| publisher =CricketArchive| accessdate = 10 November 2011 | title = Bowling in the Brtiannic Assurance County Championship 1987 (ordered by wickets)}}&lt;/ref&gt; by taking the third-most in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Events/ENG/Britannic_Assurance_County_Championship_1988/Bowling_by_Wickets.html | publisher =CricketArchive| accessdate = 10 November 2011 | title = Bowling in the Brtiannic Assurance County Championship 1988 (ordered by wickets)}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, with two years of good form behind him and England losing 4–0 in the [[1989 Ashes series]],{{#tag:ref|In ''Thanks, Johnners'', Agnew erroneously calls this &quot;the following year&quot; to 1987.&lt;ref name=page55/&gt;|group=&quot;note&quot;}} Agnew &quot;came frustratingly close to the recall to the England team that I had set my heart on.&quot;&lt;ref name=page55/&gt;

County captain and friend of Agnew, [[David Gower]] was England captain, and a number of fast bowlers from around the country called the telephone in the Leicestershire dressing room, to tell Gower that they were injured and unavailable for the [[1989 Ashes series#Sixth Test|Sixth Test]].&lt;ref name=page55/&gt; According to Agnew's account, Gower was at a loss as to whom to call into the squad.&lt;ref name=page55/&gt;

Agnew recalls that county colleague [[Peter Willey]] made a suggestion:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;'What about Agnew?' suggested Peter Willey&amp;nbsp;... 'He's bowling pretty well at the moment.' David's face lit up. 'Of course!' he said. 'Jonathan, you're in. Go home, get your England stuff ready, and I'll call first thing tomorrow&amp;nbsp;...' Even though I was approximately the seventeenth choice, this was still fantastic news&amp;nbsp;... After three disappointing Test appearances, this was my second chance, and the opportunity to set the record straight&amp;nbsp;... [The following day] the telephone finally rang. 'Got some bad news, I'm afraid,' David began. 'I couldn't persuade [[Ted Dexter]] or [[Mickey Stewart]], so you're not in any more. They've gone for [[Alan Igglesden]]. Know anything about him?' With that, David must have known his influence as England captain was over – and indeed Graham Gooch succeeded him after that Test. I felt utterly devastated, and knew I would never play for England again, which had been my main motivating force. So when the ''Today'' newspaper offered me the post of cricket correspondent the following summer, it was an easy decision to make. I might have been only thirty, which was no age to retire from professional cricket, and I could easily have played for another five years. But it was definitely time to move on.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Agnew. ''Thanks, Johnners''. pp. 55–56&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Agnew formally retired from playing professional cricket at the end of the following season: Leicestershire's last match of the [[1990 English cricket season|1990 Championship season]] was his last first-class game.&lt;ref name=&quot;last score&quot;&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Seasons/ENG/1990_ENG_Britannic_Assurance_County_Championship_1990.html| title = Britannic Assurance County Championship 1990| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate = 2 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aged 30,&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/england/content/player/8501.html|first=Martin|last= Williamson|title=Jonathan Agnew|publisher=ESPN| work=[[Cricinfo]]| accessdate= 3 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agnew took 1–42 in [[Derbyshire County Cricket Club|Derbyshire]]'s only innings and scored 6 in his only turn to bat.&lt;ref name=&quot;list&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;last score&quot;/&gt;  In 1992, two years after retirement, Leicestershire experienced an injury crisis before their [[NatWest Trophy]] semi-final against [[Essex County Cricket Club|Essex]]. Agnew answered a request to assist and played, finishing the match with [[Bowling analysis|figures]] of 12–2–31–1 (bowling twelve overs, including two maiden overs, and taking one wicket for 31 runs). Leicestershire won the match and progressed to the final, but Agnew chose not to play.&lt;ref name=&quot;lessons in life&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/england/content/story/244713.html |first=Steve|last= Pittard |title=The XI last-minute call-ups |work=[[Cricinfo]] |publisher=ESPN|date=May 2006| accessdate= 3 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Playing style and career summary===
Agnew's best first-class bowling figures were 9 for 70 and he took six ten-wicket hauls in 218 matches. In the 1988 Cricketer of the Year editorial on Agnew,{{#tag:ref|Written in 1989, while he was still playing|group=&quot;note&quot;}} ''Wisden'' noted that &quot;his pace comes from a whippy wrist action and co-ordination&amp;nbsp;... In the field, Agnew has at times appeared to be moving with his bootlaces tied together, but his long run-up was one of the more graceful in the game. However, it was the shortening of that run-up, and a cutting-down of pace, which led to&amp;nbsp;... achievements [late in his career]&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;COY&quot;/&gt;

As a batsman, Agnew had some highs, but it was his weaker suit. His highest first-class batting score was 90, starting initially as [[Nightwatchman (cricket)|nightwatchman]] in 1987 against [[Yorkshire County Cricket Club|Yorkshire]], at [[North Marine Road Ground, Scarborough]]. ''Wisden'' commented, &quot;Agnew hit a spectacular, career-best 90 from 68 balls, including six sixes and eight fours, and then took the first five Yorkshire wickets to fall&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Ask Bearders |last=Frindall  |first=Bill |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2009 |publisher=BBC Books|location= |isbn=978-1-84607-880-4 |page=20|pages= |url= |accessdate=11 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Wisden'' commented that Agnew was no [[all-rounder]], but he could &quot;certainly bat&amp;nbsp;... on his day he can destroy anything pitched up around off stump.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;COY&quot;/&gt; The same piece noted his usual playing style, &quot;playing hard but always with a sense of fun&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;COY&quot;/&gt; 

Agnew reflects on his playing career as having had two periods:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;My career could be divided up into two sections: the first being when I was an out-and-out fast bowler and played for England when I probably should not have done; and the second being when I slowed down a bit, learned how to swing the ball and did not play for England when I probably should have done.&lt;ref&gt;Agnew. ''Thanks, Johnners''. p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; His final Test was only twelve months after his England debut, and his first and last ODIs were played less than a month apart. Cricket commentator [[Colin Bateman]] opined, &quot;his fleeting taste of Test cricket should have been added to in 1987 and 1988 when he was the most consistent fast bowler in the country, taking 194 wickets, but in 1989, when England were desperate for pace bowlers, his omission amounted to wanton neglect by a regime which questioned his desire&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cap&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=If The Cap Fits |last=Bateman |first=Colin |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1993 |publisher=Tony Williams Publications |location= |isbn=1-869833-21-X |page=9 |pages= |url= |accessdate=20 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988, when Agnew was selected as a ''Cricketer of the Year'', ''Wisden'' recorded this verdict on the contrariness of Agnew's Test career: &quot;Asked about Agnew's omission, the chairman of selectors, [[Peter May|P. B. H. May]], expressed concern about his fitness – rather a baffling statement to make about someone who bowled more overs than any other fast bowler in the Championship.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;COY&quot;/&gt;

== Media and broadcasting career ==
[[File:Christopher Martin-Jenkins.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Agnew succeeded ''[[Test Match Special]]'' colleague [[Christopher Martin-Jenkins]] as BBC Cricket Correspondent in 1991.|alt= A man in a tweed jacket and a wide-brimmed hat, with his arms crossed holding some papers]]
Agnew began gaining experience as a journalist in 1987, while still playing cricket, when at the invitation of [[John Rawling]] he took off-season employment with [[BBC Radio Leicester]] as a sports producer.&lt;ref name=&quot;media&quot;/&gt; It was during this period that he &quot;fell in love with radio&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;media&quot;/&gt; and following his retirement, he had a short stint as chief cricket writer of ''[[Today (UK newspaper)|Today]]'' newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;Agnew. ''Thanks, Johnners''. p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; While covering the [[1990–91 Ashes series]] for ''Today'', he was approached by [[Peter Baxter]] about joining ''[[Test Match Special]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;p61&quot;&gt;Agnew. ''Thanks, Johnners''. p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; Unhappy at certain editorial decisions that had been taken during his time with the newspaper, Agnew agreed to attend an interview after the tour.&lt;ref name=&quot;p61&quot;/&gt;

Agnew joined Test Match Special in 1991,&lt;ref name=tmsprofile&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/tms/6098364.stm | work = BBC Sport |publisher = British Broadcasting Corporation | accessdate = 10 November 2011 | title = Jonathan Agnew | date=30 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; in time for the first Test match of the summer.&lt;ref&gt;Agnew. ''Thanks, Johnners''. p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; He was initially a junior member of the ''Test Match Special'' team, learning at close quarters from figures such as [[Brian Johnston]], [[Henry Blofeld]] and [[Bill Frindall]]. The same year, he was also appointed the [[BBC]]'s cricket correspondent,&lt;ref name=tmsprofile/&gt; taking over from ''Test Match Special'' colleague, [[Christopher Martin-Jenkins]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AggersAshes&quot;&gt;Agnew. ''Aggers' Ashes'', p. 249&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, when asked which sports journalist he most respected, Martin-Jenkins named Agnew, because he &quot;combines astute journalism with apparently effortless communication skills.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url = http://books.google.com/?id=DLvxA8l8e_UC&amp;pg=PA61&amp;dq=jon+agnew#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title= Sports journalism: a multimedia primer| first=Rob|last=Steen|accessdate=3 August 2011| publisher =Routledge| isbn= 978-0-415-39423-9| page=61|date=31 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also commentated for the Australian [[ABC Radio (Australia)|ABC radio]] network during Ashes series in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://www.abc.net.au/local/stories/2010/11/22/3073236.htm | title = The 2010/11 Ashes Series | first=Andrea |last=Williamson |date = 22 November 2010 | accessdate = 8 February 2012 | publisher = [[ABC Radio (Australia)|ABC radio]]| location = Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Channel 4]] won the broadcasting rights to television coverage of England's home Test matches in 1998, Agnew was approached by the broadcaster and offered a job on the commentary team.&lt;ref name=page30&gt;Agnew. ''Thanks, Johnners''. p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; Agnew declined the opportunity, opting to remain BBC cricket correspondent, in part because he was a &quot;radio man&quot; and in part out of loyalty.&lt;ref name=page30/&gt; The following year, England hosted the [[1999 Cricket World Cup]]. The BBC had the UK television rights, but with so many specialist TV cricket presenters now at Channel 4 and therefore unavailable to the BBC, Agnew was asked to present the coverage.&lt;ref&gt;Agnew. ''Thanks, Johnners''. p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; His recollections of the experience are that it was something of a trial, helped only by the experienced [[Richie Benaud]] alongside him:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;I really had no option but to agree to do it, despite my reservations about working in television. Coming so quickly after my decision to stay on the radio, this was quite an irony. I was given one day of training&amp;nbsp;... [Transmission ended with the presenter being given a countdown] from one minute to zero, at which point you have to say goodbye. I did not find that easy at all&amp;nbsp;... I made a real hash of it after one of the early games&amp;nbsp;... [Richie]&amp;nbsp;... very kindly,&amp;nbsp; suggested a plan&amp;nbsp;... as soon as the count started in our earpieces I would ask him a question, and he would talk until the count reached eight seconds to go. I would then thank him, turn to the camera and tell the audience briefly about the next game to be televised. Miraculously, for the rest of the tournament I always heard 'zero' in my ear at the moment I said goodbye&amp;nbsp;... the whole experience served to confirm my belief that my decision to stick with ''Test Match Special'' was the right one.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Agnew. ''Thanks, Johnners''. pp. 31–32&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In addition to his writing and broadcasting work, Agnew's commentary has been recorded for several computer games, including the [[International Cricket Captain]] and [[Brian Lara Cricket]] series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uk.pc.gamespy.com/pc/international-cricket-captain/ |title=International Cricket Captain |publisher=Gamespy |accessdate=8 November 201}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.videogamer.com/pc/brian_lara_international_cricket/news/brian_lara_returns_to_videogames.html|title=Brian Lara returns to videogames|work=[[VideoGamer.com]] | publisher = Pro-G Media|accessdate=2 December 2011|date=3 February 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is a shareholder in TestMatchExtra.com Ltd, a company which runs the website of the same address and acquired ''[[The Wisden Cricketer]]'' magazine from [[BSkyB]] in December 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;TWC&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/digitaltv/news/a294646/sky-sells-wisden-cricketer-to-consortium.html |first=Andrew |last=Laughlin |title=Sky sells 'Wisden Cricketer' to consortium |publisher=[[Digital Spy]] |date=23 December 2010|accessdate=3 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;TWC2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/england/content/story/493843.html |title=Wisden Cricketer magazine sold|publisher=ESPN|work=[[Cricinfo]] |date=23 December 2010| accessdate = 3 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Agnew has won many awards for his broadcasting, including two [[Sony Awards]] for Best Reporter (1992 and 1994), and Best Radio Broadcaster of the Year (2010), an award from the [[Association of Sports Journalists]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AggersAshes&quot; /&gt; Agnew was made an Honorary Doctor of Arts by [[De Montfort University]], [[Leicester]] in November 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.dmu.ac.uk/about-dmu/events/honorands/honorands-2008.aspx| publisher = [[De Montfort University]]| accessdate = 9 February 2012| title = Honorands 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and an Honorary Doctor of Letters by [[Loughborough University]] in July 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.lboro.ac.uk/service/publicity/news-releases/2011/92_Graduation.html | publisher = [[Loughborough University]] | date=20 July 2011 | accessdate = 10 August 2011 | title = Lord Robert Winston among those to be honoured by Loughborough University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His peers in sports journalism have frequently commented on Agnew's skills as a broadcaster and writer. As well as the praise of Christopher Martin-Jenkins, Agnew has been described by Lucy Elkins in ''[[The Daily Mail]]'' as &quot;the voice of cricket&quot; and &quot;one of the most highly regarded cricket ­commentators in the world.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;chop&quot;/&gt;. [[Michael Henderson (writer)|Michael Henderson]], in the aftermath of the [[Allan_Stanford#Cricket|Stanford cricket controversy]], wrote of Agnew as a &quot;master broadcaster&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;the pick of the sports correspondents at the BBC&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;Agnew's is a sane, reasonable voice in a game that is going potty. Fair-minded, even-tempered, he has become one of the finest specialists the BBC has ever had. In his understated way he speaks for the game: not the people who play it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hend&quot;/&gt;

=== Notable broadcasting incidents===
[[File:Galle Dutch Fort cricket ground.jpg|left|thumb|View of [[Galle International Stadium]], as seen from Agnew's ramparts commentary position|alt=A panoramic view of a cricket stadium]]
In 2001, Agnew was part of the BBC team that was sent to [[Sri Lanka]] to cover [[English cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2000-01|England's Test match series]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Galle&quot;&gt;{{Cite news | url =http://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/bbc-commentary-team-refuses-to-be-stumped-by-sri-lanka-test-ban-692903.html | title = BBC commentary team refuses to be stumped by Sri Lanka test ban | first=Derek | last=Pringle | authorlink=Derek Pringle | accessdate=4 August 2011 | date = 24 February 2001| work = [[The Independent]] |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result of confusion and a row over broadcasting rights, the BBC team found itself barred from the [[Galle International Stadium]], where the first Test was to take place.&lt;ref name=&quot;Galle&quot;/&gt; Agnew and [[Pat Murphy (sports journalist)|Pat Murphy]] refused to be defeated and &quot;decamped to the fort ramparts overlooking the ground and broadcast their programme from there. With both team and equipment protected from the sun by an umbrella held by Mr Agnew's driver, Simmons, it made a colourful scene.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Galle&quot;/&gt; The [[England and Wales Cricket Board]] (ECB) chief executive, [[Tim Lamb]] became involved in discussions and the ''Test Match Special'' team were allowed to return to the ground.&lt;ref name=&quot;Galle&quot;/&gt;

''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' called Agnew and Murphy's effort, &quot;new heights of ingenuity&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Teleg&quot;&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1323898/Test-match-lock-out-fails-to-stump-BBC.html| work = [[The Daily Telegraph]] |location = London | accessdate = 4 August 2011| date =24 February 2001 |title =Test match lock-out fails to stump BBC|first=Tom|last=Leonard }}&lt;/ref&gt; Agnew's reaction to the event was, &quot;It's a sad day for everyone involved in English cricket. Is it really that cricket is getting so greedy that everyone who wants to come and report on the game for the good of the game is going to have to be charged for it?&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Teleg&quot;/&gt; However, he remained upbeat about the situation: &quot;Actually I get rather more of a panoramic view of it from up here than I did yesterday in my commentary box. There's a little road that runs round the back of the ground. All manner of people are trundling up and down – buses, bikes and little three wheeled [[tuk-tuk]]s – it's rather fun.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Teleg&quot;/&gt;
[[File:Lily Allen @ INmusic festival.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Agnew's interview with Allen provoked a row.|alt=A woman with dark hair, wearing jeans and a cropped white top with black stripes, singing into a microphone]]
In 2004, the Zimbabwe government banned media from following the [[History of cricket in Zimbabwe from 1992 to 2006#England_2004-05|England cricket team tour of the country]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Controv&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/someone-needs-to-question-crickets-whiter-than-whites-534974.html |title=Someone needs to question cricket's whiter than whites.. |work=[[The Independent]] |date=29 November 2004 |accessdate=21 September 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agnew's reaction was combative, appearing on [[BBC Breakfast]] and giving his opinion that the ban presented the ECB with a chance to withdraw from the controversial tour and that they should take the opportunity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Controv&quot;/&gt;

In the summer of 2008, then England captain [[Michael Vaughan]] reacted testily on-air to questions by Agnew about his batting form. When Vaughan resigned shortly thereafter, [[Michael Atherton]], writing in ''[[The Times]]'', commented that it had been an out-of-character outburst that was a portent of the resignation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/sport/cricket/article2255590.ece| title = Michael Vaughan bows out with dignity intact| work = [[The Times]] | location = London | accessdate = 25 January 2011 | date = 4 August 2008 | first = Michael | last = Atherton | authorlink = Michael Atherton}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Atherton had himself been England captain, Agnew had led the calls for Atherton to resign over a controversy known as the [[Ball_tampering#Michael_Atherton_in_1994|&quot;dirt in the pocket&quot;]] affair.&lt;ref name=&quot;Controv&quot;/&gt; Fellow BBC commentator, [[Jack Bannister]] felt that Agnew's comments were inappropriate, but only to the extent that he had referred to his friendship with Atherton: Bannister advised Agnew that he should continue to be honest and forthright as a reporter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last1 = Illingworth | first1 = Ray|last2 =Bannister |first2 = Jack |title = One-Man Committee: The controversial reign of England's cricket supremo| year = 1996| publisher =Headline Book Publishing | location = London |isbn = 0747215154| pages = 95–96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Agnew was involved in a minor controversy regarding an appearance by [[Lily Allen]] on ''Test Match Special'' in 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;Allen&quot;&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/cricket/international/theashes/6087537/Lily-Allen-defends-Jonathan-Agnew-over-pervert-slur.html | work = [[Daily Telegraph]] | location = London | accessdate = 4 August 2011| title = Lily Allen defends Jonathan Agnew over 'pervert' slur| first=Mike|last=Norrish|date=25 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Daily Telegraph'' reported that &quot;the cricket-loving Allen struck up an instant rapport with Agnew, and the BBC received largely positive feedback for the 30-minute interview&quot;, but [[Will Buckley (journalist)|Will Buckley]], writing for ''[[The Observer]]'', described Agnew's &quot;amorous ambitions&quot; as &quot;positioned&amp;nbsp;... firmly on the pervy side of things&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;perv&quot;&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/global/2009/aug/23/lily-allen-jonathan-agnew-test-match-special| title=When Aggers met Lily: an unrequited love affair for the middle-aged| work = [[The Observer]] |location = London |accessdate = 4 August 2011 | first=Will | last=Buckley | date=23 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agnew was furious, noting he &quot;gave&amp;nbsp;... Will Buckley 24&amp;nbsp;hrs to apologise for calling me a pervert, and he has declined&amp;nbsp;... As you can imagine, I have taken being called a pervert quite badly.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Allen&quot;/&gt; Allen herself supported Agnew: &quot;[I] really think this Will Buckley guy should apologise to&amp;nbsp;... [Agnew], he was nothing but kind and gentlemanly to me during our interview. I don't know 1 person that agrees with The Observer on this one.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Allen&quot;/&gt; Buckley eventually apologised.&lt;ref name=&quot;perv&quot;/&gt;

=== &quot;Leg over&quot; incident ===
Agnew has been known to laugh at or include occasional sexual innuendo, while on-air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/funny_old_game/1594019.stm |title=Funny old game – Super bloopers |work=BBC News |publisher = British Broadcasting Corporation|date=11 October 2001 |accessdate=3 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00hf8wq |work=BBC Radio 5 |publisher = British Broadcasting Corporation|title = The Tuffers and Vaughan Cricket Show|date = 6 June 2011| accessdate = 3 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most notable of these occurences took place in August 1991, when Agnew was commentating with [[Brian Johnston]]. In a review of the day, Johnston was describing how [[Ian Botham]], while batting, had overbalanced and tried, but failed, to step over his stumps. Botham was consequently given out [[hit wicket]]. Agnew's comment on this action was: &quot;He just didn't quite get his leg over.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Barry&quot;&gt;{{Cite book | title = The Wit of Cricket |first= Barry |last=Johnston | url= http://books.google.com/?id=ygNa9iKqu2oC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22jonathan+agnew%22+stewart+test#v=onepage&amp;q=He%20just%20didn't%20quite%20get%20his%20leg%20over!&amp;f=false| publisher = Hodder &amp; Stoughton| isbn=978-1-4447-1502-6 | date = 27 May 2010| page=267}}&lt;/ref&gt; Botham had attracted a number of headlines during his career for his sexual exploits and in [[British English]], &quot;[[wikt:get one's leg over|getting one's leg over]]&quot; is a euphemism for having [[sexual intercourse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/osm/story/0,,1476497,00.html|title=Sporting kiss and tell's|date=8 May 2005| accessdate= 3 August 2011|work=[[The Observer]] | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The comment led to &quot;Johnston, a lover of schoolboy innuendo to rival [[Frankie Howerd]], erupting in a [[Krakatoa]] of snorts, whimpers, sneezes and, finally, uncontrollable laughter.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Krakatoa&quot;&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/bbc/8081602/Jonathan-Agnew-on-Johnners.html|title = Jonathan Agnew on Johnners| work = [[Daily Telegraph]] | location = London| accessdate = 4 August 2011| date = 22 October 2010|first=Andrew|last=Pettle}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnston tried to continue his summary, despite being almost unable to speak for laughing. He did manage to say &quot;Aggers, for goodness' sake, do stop it&quot; between convulsions of mirth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/player/nol/newsid_6960000/newsid_6961100/6961129.stm?bw=bb&amp;mp=wm&amp;news=1&amp;nol_storyid=6961129&amp;bbcws=1|title=Johnston's leg over giggles file|accessdate=3 August 2011|work=BBC News |publisher = British Broadcasting Corporation| date=31 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The incident was heard by thousands of commuters driving home from work, many of whom were forced to stop driving because they were laughing so much:&lt;ref name=&quot;Barry&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Krakatoa&quot;/&gt; a two-mile traffic jam at the entrance to the [[Dartford Tunnel]] was reportedly caused by drivers unable to pay the toll due to laughter.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barry&quot;/&gt; Fourteen years later, in 2005, Agnew's line, &quot;Just didn't quite get his leg over&quot; was voted &quot;the greatest sporting commentary of all time&quot; by listeners to BBC Radio 5 Live.&lt;ref name=&quot;legwin&quot;/&gt; The other eight finalists included [[Kenneth Wolstenholme]]'s &quot;[[They think it's all over]] – it is now!&quot; and [[Ian Robertson (rugby commentator)|Ian Robertson]]'s &quot;This is the one. He drops for World Cup glory&amp;nbsp;... It's up! It's over! He's done it! [[Jonny Wilkinson]] is England's hero yet again&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;legwin&quot;/&gt; Agnew and Johnston secured 78% of the votes.&lt;ref name=&quot;legwin&quot;/&gt;

==Private life and personality==
In 1992, a year after he became BBC cricket correspondent, Agnew's first marriage to Beverley, to whom he was married in 1983,&lt;ref name=&quot;Who&quot;/&gt; ended in divorce.&lt;ref name=&quot;wife&quot;&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/sport/article-602393-how-cricket-ruined-my-own-marriage-just-like-thorpe.do|work= [[London Evening Standard]]|title = How cricket ruined my own marriage&amp;nbsp;... just like Thorpe | first=Jonathan|last=Agnew|accessdate= 4 August 2011 |date = 1 August 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has written about the role that cricket played in the collapse of the relationship, comparing his circumstances with those of then England batsman [[Graham Thorpe]].&lt;ref name=&quot;wife&quot;/&gt; He also found that his job interfered with his relationship with his children: &lt;blockquote&gt;I had two young children, aged seven and five&amp;nbsp;... it was quickly evident that for me to have custody of my daughters – or even to form a relationship with them – was made impossible by my job. What chance do you have when, be it playing Test cricket or commentating on it, you are away for months at a time each and every winter?&amp;nbsp;... There was one occasion when I did not recognise my eldest, Jennifer, when I returned from one tour&amp;nbsp;... my children continue to ask me why I did not resign and take a job that would have kept me in the country and allowed me to see them more often. I find that one especially hard to answer.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;wife&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Agnew has subsequently remarried: he met Emma Agnew, current editor of BBC East Midlands Today,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.meltontimes.co.uk/sport/former_notts_ccc_skipper_bicknell_signs_for_belvoir_cc_1_475618| title = Former Notts CCC skipper Bicknell signs for Belvoir CC | date = 16 December 2008 | accessdate = 4 August 2011| work = Melton Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; when they worked together on BBC Radio Leicestershire.&lt;ref&gt;Agnew. ''Thanks, Johnners''. p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Dupuytren's2010.JPG|thumb|right|An example of [[Dupuytren's contracture]]|alt=A human hand, suffering from Dupuytren's contracture, causing it to contract into a claw-like position]]
Agnew suffers from [[Dupuytren's contracture]], a medical condition that affects many former cricketers. The condition is causing Agnew's right hand to contract into a claw-like position.&lt;ref name=&quot;chop&quot;&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-1336253/Why-voice-cricket-Jonathan-Aggers-Agnew-wants-chop-finger.html#ixzz1U3TE5GF1| accessdate = 4 August 2011| work = [[Daily Mail]] | location = London | title = Why the voice of cricket Jonathan 'Aggers' Agnew wants to chop off his finger| first=Lucy|last=Elkins|date=6 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has had multiple operations, but it continues to degenerate and he finds the condition so upsetting he has considered having one of his fingers amputated. However, Agnew enjoys playing the piano and amputation would make worse his already impaired ability on the instrument.&lt;ref name=&quot;chop&quot;/&gt;

During Agnew's playing career, a dispute with team-mate [[Philip DeFreitas]] attracted media attention: when DeFreitas poured salt over Agnew's lunch, Agnew responded by throwing DeFreitas' cricket bag and kit from the balcony of the dressing room.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leics&quot;&gt;{{Cite book | pages = 474–75| last=Hunt| first= James | title = Leicestershire in 1987| title = [[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack]] |edition = 1988 | publisher = John Wisden &amp; Co}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former England cricketer [[Derek Pringle]] has written about Agnew's sense of humour, describing him as &quot;hysterical&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;hot&quot;&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/columnists/derekpringle/2325781/Heat-is-on-for-England-in-Sri-Lanka.html | accessdate = 4 August 2011| date = 15 November 2007|first=Derek|last=Pringle|authorlink=Derek Pringle | title = Heat is on for England in Sri Lanka | work = [[The Daily Telegraph]] | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pair toured Sri Lanka together on [[England Lions cricket team|England B]]'s 1986 tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://stats.thecricketer.com/Events/England_B_in_Sri_Lanka_1985-86/f_England_B_Bowling.html|accessdate = 5 August 2011 | title = First-class bowling for England B – England in Sri Lanka 1985/86| work= [[The Cricketer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pringle recalls that one hot day when England were in the field, Agnew came in for lunch: &quot;It's ****ing [sic] red hot on the field, and when you come off it's ****ing red hot in the dressing-room,&quot; Agnew screamed. &quot;Then, what do you get for lunch, ****ing red hot curry?&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;hot&quot;/&gt;
