'''Rogers Hornsby, Sr.''' (April 27, 1896 – January 5, 1963), nicknamed &quot;'''The [[Rajah]]'''&quot;, was an American [[baseball]] [[infielder]], [[manager (baseball)|manager]], and [[coach (baseball)|coach]] who played 23 seasons in [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB). He played for the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] (1915–1926, 1933), [[San Francisco Giants|New York Giants]] (1927), [[Atlanta Braves|Boston Braves]] (1928), [[Chicago Cubs]] (1929–1932), and [[Baltimore Orioles|St. Louis Browns]] (1933–1937). Hornsby had 2,930&amp;nbsp;[[Hit (baseball)|hits]], 301&amp;nbsp;[[home run]]s, and a .358&amp;nbsp;[[batting average]] during his career; he was named the [[National League]] (NL)'s [[Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player]] (MVP) twice, and was a member of one [[World Series]] championship team.

Born and raised in [[Texas]], Hornsby played for several semi-professional and minor league teams. In 1915, he began his major league career with the St. Louis Cardinals and remained with the team for 12&amp;nbsp;seasons; in this time, Hornsby won his first MVP Award and the Cardinals won the [[1926 World Series]]. After that season, he spent one season at the New York Giants and another with the Boston Braves before being traded to the Chicago Cubs. He played with the Cubs for four years and won his second MVP Award before the team released him in 1932. Hornsby re-signed with the Cardinals in 1933, but was released partway through the season and was picked up by the St. Louis Browns. He remained there until his final season in 1937. From 1925 to 1937, Hornsby was intermittently [[player-manager|his own manager]]. After retiring as a player, he managed the Browns in 1952 and the [[Cincinnati Reds]] from 1952 to 1953.

Sportswriters consider Hornsby to be one of the best hitters of all time. His career batting average of .358 is second only to [[Ty Cobb]] in MLB history. He also won two [[Major League Baseball Triple Crown|Triple Crowns]] and batted .400 or more three times during his career. He is the only player to hit 40 home runs and bat .400 in the same year (1922). His batting average for the 1924 season was .424, a mark that no player has matched since. He was elected into the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|National Baseball Hall of Fame]] in 1942.

Hornsby married three times during his life, in 1918, 1924, and 1957, and had two children, one from each of his first two marriages. Known as someone difficult to get along with, he was not well-liked by fellow players. He never smoked, drank, or went to the movies, but frequently gambled on horse races during his career.

==Early life==
Hornsby was born in [[Winters, Texas]], the last of Ed and Mary (Rogers) Hornsby's six children.&lt;ref name=&quot;12 Hornsby&quot;&gt;Alexander, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; When Hornsby was two years old, his father died of unknown causes.&lt;ref name=&quot;12 Hornsby&quot;/&gt; Four years later, the surviving Hornsbys moved to [[Fort Worth, Texas]], so Hornsby's brothers could get jobs in the [[meat packing industry]] to support the family.&lt;ref name=&quot;page 13&quot;/&gt;

Hornsby started playing [[baseball]] at a very young age; he once said, &quot;I can't remember anything that happened before I had a baseball in my hand.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;page 13&quot;&gt;Alexander, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; He took a job with the Swift and Company meat industry plant as a messenger boy when he was 10 years old, and he also served as a substitute infielder on its baseball team.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; By the age of 15, Hornsby was already playing for several semi-professional teams.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; He also played baseball for North Side High School until 10th grade, when he dropped out to take a full-time job at Swift and Company.&lt;ref name=&quot;page 16&quot;&gt;Alexander, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; While he was in high school, Hornsby also played on the football team, alongside future [[College Football Hall of Fame]]r [[Bo McMillin]].&lt;ref name=&quot;page 16&quot;/&gt;

==Minor league career==
In 1914, Hornsby's older brother Everett, a minor league baseball player for many years,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/player.cgi?id=hornsb001edw|title=Edward Hornsby Minor League Statistics &amp; History|work=[[Baseball-Reference]]|publisher=Sports Reference, LLC|accessdate=July 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; arranged for Rogers to get a tryout with the [[Texas League]]'s [[Dallas Steers]]. He made the team, but did not play in any games for the Steers; he was released after only two weeks.&lt;ref name=&quot;page 18&quot;&gt;Alexander, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; Following his dismissal, he signed with the Hugo Scouts of the [[Minor league baseball#Class B, C and D|Class D]] [[Texas-Oklahoma League]] as their [[shortstop]] for $75 per month (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|75|1914|r=0}}}} today). The Scouts went out of business a third of the way through the season, and Hornsby's contract was sold to the [[Denison Railroaders|Denison Champions]] of the same league for $125 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|125|1914|r=0}}}} today).&lt;ref name=&quot;page 18&quot;/&gt; With both teams in 1914, Hornsby [[batting average|batted]] .232 and committed 45&amp;nbsp;[[Error (baseball)|errors]] in 113&amp;nbsp;games.&lt;ref name=&quot;page 18&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=brm&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/player.cgi?id=hornsb001rog|title=Rogers Hornsby Minor League Statistics &amp; History|work=Baseball-Reference|publisher=Sports Reference, LLC|accessdate=July 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Denison team changed its name to the Denison Railroaders and joined the [[Western Association]] in 1915. They raised Hornsby's salary to $90 per month (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|90|1915|r=0}}}} today).&lt;ref name=&quot;page 18&quot;/&gt; Hornsby's average improved that season to .277 in 119&amp;nbsp;games, but he made 58&amp;nbsp;errors. Nonetheless, his contributions helped the Railroaders win the Western Association [[pennant (sports)|pennant]].&lt;ref name=&quot;page 20&quot;&gt;Alexander, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the season, a writer from ''[[The Sporting News]]'' said that Hornsby was one of about a dozen Western Association players to show any major league potential.&lt;ref name=&quot;page 20&quot;/&gt;

==St. Louis Cardinals==
===1915–1919===
[[File:Rhornsby.jpg|upright|thumb|left|Rogers Hornsby with the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] in 1917]]
Hornsby came to the attention of the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] during an exhibition series between that team and the Railroaders in [[spring training]] in 1915. Cardinals' manager [[Miller Huggins]] told his only [[scout (sport)|scout]], Bob Connery, to look for minor league players to fill the roster of their financially struggling team. In September, the Cardinals purchased Hornsby's contract from Denison and added him to their major league roster, although his only professional baseball experience had been in [[minor league baseball#Class B, C and D|Class D]].&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, pp. 19–22&lt;/ref&gt; Hornsby's first game came on September&amp;nbsp;10, when he relieved [[Art Butler]] at shortstop in a 7–1 loss to the [[Cincinnati Reds]].&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; Three days later he started a game, and he got his first [[hit (baseball)|hit]] the next day against [[Rube Marquard]] of the [[Brooklyn Robins]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Alexander, pp. 25-26&quot;&gt;Alexander, pp. 25–26&lt;/ref&gt; Hornsby finished the season with a .246&amp;nbsp;average in 57&amp;nbsp;[[at-bat]]s while the Cardinals finished in sixth place in the [[National League]] (NL). At only 19 years old, Hornsby was the fourth-youngest player in the NL that year.&lt;ref name=br&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/h/hornsro01.shtml|title=Rogers Hornsby Statistics and History|work=Baseball-Reference|publisher=Sports Reference, LLC|accessdate=January 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cardinals picked up [[Roy Corhan]] from the [[San Francisco Seals (baseball)|San Francisco Seals]] of the [[Pacific Coast League]] to play at shortstop in 1916, making Hornsby one of three candidates for the position.  Hornsby's great performance in spring training, a shoulder injury to Corhan and poor hitting by Butler meant Hornsby was the starting shortstop on [[Opening Day]].&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, pp. 27, 30–31&lt;/ref&gt; He had both [[Run batted in|runs batted in]] (RBIs) in the Cardinals' 2–1 victory over the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] that day.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alexander, p. 31&quot;&gt;Alexander, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; On May&amp;nbsp;14, he hit his first major league [[home run]] against [[Jeff Pfeffer]] of Brooklyn.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alexander, p. 31&quot;/&gt; He rotated amongst infield positions before finally settling in at [[third baseman|third base]] for much of the second half of the year.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; Late in the season, he missed 11&amp;nbsp;games with a sprained ankle.&lt;ref name=&quot;p. 33&quot;&gt;Alexander, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; He finished 1916 with a .313&amp;nbsp;average, fourth in the NL, and he was one short of the league lead in [[triple (baseball)|triples]] with 15.&lt;ref name=br/&gt;

Hornsby returned to the shortstop position in 1917 after Corhan returned to San Francisco and Butler was released.&lt;ref name=&quot;p. 33&quot;/&gt; After playing nearly every game throughout the first month of the season, Hornsby was called away from the team on May&amp;nbsp;29 after his brother William was shot and killed in a [[Western saloon|saloon]]. Rogers attended the funeral on June&amp;nbsp;1 and returned to the Cardinals on June&amp;nbsp;3, finishing the season without missing any more playing time.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; His batting statistics improved from the previous season; his .327&amp;nbsp;batting average was second in the league, and he led the league in triples (17), [[total bases]] (253), and [[slugging percentage]] (.484).&lt;ref name=br/&gt;

Many baseball players were drafted to fight in [[World War I]] in 1918, but Hornsby was given deferment status by the government because he was supporting his family.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, pp. 45–46&lt;/ref&gt; During the offseason, Miller Huggins, unhappy with the Cardinals' management, left the team to manage the [[New York Yankees]]. He was replaced by [[Jack Hendricks]], who had managed the [[Indianapolis Indians]] to a pennant in the [[American Association (20th century)|American Association]] the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; Hornsby lacked confidence in Hendricks's ability to run the Cardinals, and the two men developed animosity towards each other due to Hornsby's growing ego and fondness for former manager Huggins.&lt;ref&gt;D'Amore, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; Under Hendricks, Hornsby's batting average dipped to .281.&lt;ref name=&quot;page43-48&quot;&gt;Alexander, pp. 43–48&lt;/ref&gt; He had problems off the field as well; on June&amp;nbsp;17, Hornsby hit St. Louis citizen Frank G. Rowe with his [[Buick]] when Rowe stepped out in front of traffic to cross an intersection. Rowe sued Hornsby for $15,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|15000|1918|r=0}}}} today), but Hornsby eventually settled for a smaller, undisclosed amount, and the case was dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, pp. 52–53&lt;/ref&gt; He was still among the league leaders in triples and slugging percentage in 1918, but after the season ended with the Cardinals in last place, he announced that he would never play under Hendricks again.&lt;ref name=&quot;page43-48&quot;/&gt; Partially due to Hornsby's complaints, Hendricks was fired after the season and replaced by [[Branch Rickey]], then-president of the Cardinals.&lt;ref&gt;D'Amore, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1919, after the Cardinals acquired shortstop [[Doc Lavan]], Rickey tried converting Hornsby into a [[second baseman]] in spring training. Hornsby played third base for most of the year.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, pp. 51–52&lt;/ref&gt; His batting average was low at the beginning of the season but improved by June.&lt;ref name=&quot;page 52&quot;&gt;Alexander, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; At season's end, his average of .318 was second-highest in the league, and he also finished second in total bases and runs batted in.&lt;ref name=&quot;page 52&quot;/&gt;

===1920–1926===

In 1920, Rickey moved Hornsby to second base, where he remained for the rest of his career.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; He started the year with a 14-game [[hitting streak]].&lt;ref name=&quot;page 60&quot;&gt;Alexander, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; On June&amp;nbsp;4, he had two triples and two RBIs as the Cardinals defeated the [[Chicago Cubs]] 5–1, a game that ended future [[National Baseball Hall of Fame|Hall of Famer]] [[Grover Cleveland Alexander]]'s 11-game winning streak.&lt;ref name=&quot;page 60&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1920/B06040SLN1920.htm|title=St. Louis Cardinals 5, Chicago Cubs 1|publisher=[[Retrosheet]]|accessdate=February 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hornsby finished the season with the first of seven batting titles by hitting .370, and he also led the league in [[on-base percentage]] (.431), slugging percentage (.559), hits (218), total bases (329), [[double (baseball)|doubles]] (44), and RBIs (94).

The rise of the [[live-ball era]] led to a spike in hitting productivity throughout the majors, which helped Hornsby to hit with increased power during the 1921 season. He hit .397 in 1921, and his 21&amp;nbsp;home runs were second in the league, more than twice his total in any previous season. He also led the league in on-base percentage (.458), slugging percentage (.639), [[run (baseball)|runs scored]] (131), RBIs (126), doubles (44), and triples (18).&lt;ref name=br/&gt; The Cardinals held a special day in Hornsby's honor on September&amp;nbsp;30 before a home game against the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]], and they presented Hornsby with multiple awards before the game, including a baseball autographed by [[President of the United States]] [[Warren G. Harding]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=FB0916FB3E5A1B7A93C5A81782D85F458285F9|title=Souvenir For Hornsby; Baseball Autographed by President Harding for St. Louis Star.|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=September 17, 1921|accessdate=July 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cardinals beat the Pirates 12–4 that day as Hornsby hit a home run and had two doubles.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, pp. 66–67&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1922 season, Hornsby was considered a big star, having led the league in batting average, hits, doubles, and runs batted in multiple times.&lt;ref name=br/&gt; As a result, he sought a three-year contract for $25,000 per season. After negotiating with Cardinals management, he settled for a three-year, $18,500 contract (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|18500|1922|r=0}}}} today), which made him the highest-paid player in league history to that point.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, pp. 69–70&lt;/ref&gt; He then became the only player in history to hit over 40&amp;nbsp;home runs and bat over .400 in the same season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lemire|first=Joe|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2010/writers/joe_lemire/09/07/triple.crown.ranking/index.html|title=Ranking the Triple Crown seasons in modern baseball history|work=[[Sports Illustrated]]|date=September 8, 2010|accessdate=January 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 5, Hornsby set a new NL record when he hit his 28th home run of the season off of [[Jimmy Ring]] of the [[Philadelphia Phillies]].&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1922/B08050PHI1922.htm|title=Philadelphia Phillies 9, St. Louis Cardinals 1|publisher=Retrosheet|accessdate=February 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; From August&amp;nbsp;13 through September&amp;nbsp;19, he had a 33-game hitting streak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1922/Ihornr1010081922.htm|title=The 1922 STL N Regular Season Batting Log for Rogers Hornsby|publisher=Retrosheet|accessdate=February 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He finished the year with a new record of 42&amp;nbsp;home runs, and he also set NL records in hits (250) and slugging percentage (.722). He won the first of his two [[Major League Baseball Triple Crown|Triple Crowns]] that year, and he led the league in batting average (.401), RBIs (152), on-base percentage (.459), doubles (46), and runs scored (141). His 450&amp;nbsp;total bases was the highest mark for any NL player during the 20th century. On defense, Hornsby led all second basemen in [[putout]]s, [[double play]]s, and [[fielding percentage]].&lt;ref name=br/&gt;

[[File:Rogers Hornsby swing.jpg|upright|thumb|left|Rogers Hornsby (pictured on a 1922 baseball card) takes a swing.]]
On May&amp;nbsp;8, 1923, Hornsby suffered an injury to his left knee in a game against the Phillies when he turned to make a throw.&lt;ref name=&quot;p. 78&quot;&gt;Alexander, p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; He returned 10 days later, but the injury lingered, and he was removed from a game against the Pirates on May&amp;nbsp;26 to be examined by Robert Hyland, the Cardinals' physician.&lt;ref name=&quot;p. 78&quot;/&gt; Hyland had Hornsby's knee placed in a cast for two weeks, after which he returned to the Cardinals.&lt;ref name=&quot;p. 78&quot;/&gt; During a game in August, Hornsby was on third base late in the game and threw up his hands in disgust in response to a sign flashed by Rickey; he had given the current batter the [[Glossary of baseball (T)#take_sign|take sign]], and Hornsby felt the batter should have hit the ball.&lt;ref&gt;Lowenfish, p. 146&lt;/ref&gt; After the game, he and Rickey fought in the clubhouse, but teammates quickly broke it up. Hornsby missed several games late in the year with injuries that the Cardinals (and Hyland) did not believe to be serious; as a result he was fined $500 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|500|1923|r=0}}}} today) and suspended for the last five games of the year.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, pp. 80–82&lt;/ref&gt; However, Hornsby still won his fourth consecutive NL batting title with a batting average of .384. He also repeated as the leader in on-base percentage (.459) and slugging percentage (.627).&lt;ref name=br/&gt;

Hornsby raised his average to .424 in 1924, which is the sixth-highest batting average in a single season in MLB history, and the [[live-ball era]] batting average record. He led the league with 89&amp;nbsp;[[base on balls|walks]], producing a .507&amp;nbsp;on-base percentage. His slugging percentage of .696 again led the league, as did his 121&amp;nbsp;runs scored, 227&amp;nbsp;hits, and 43&amp;nbsp;doubles; he hit 25&amp;nbsp;home runs as well.&lt;ref name=br/&gt; That year, the NL reintroduced its [[Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player]] (MVP) award. Although Hornsby was expected to win the award, it went to [[Dazzy Vance]] instead. [[Cincinnati, Ohio|Cincinnati]] voter [[Frederick Bushnell &quot;Jack&quot; Ryder|Jack Ryder]] left Hornsby's name off his ballot altogether because he believed Hornsby was an MVP on the stat sheet, but was not a team player.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, pp. 90–91&lt;/ref&gt; In 1962, the [[Baseball Writers Association of America]] presented Hornsby with an award retroactively recognizing him as the 1924 MVP.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, p. 298&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1925, [[Sam Breadon]], the owner of the Cardinals, wished to replace Rickey as manager. Hornsby initially declined the job. After discovering that Rickey planned to sell his stock in the Cardinals if he was replaced as field manager, Hornsby agreed to take the job as long as Breadon would help him purchase the stock. Breadon agreed, and Hornsby became the Cardinals' manager.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, pp. 98–101&lt;/ref&gt; Hornsby finished the year with his second Triple Crown, when he combined a .403&amp;nbsp;batting average with 39&amp;nbsp;home runs and 143&amp;nbsp;RBIs. He bested teammate [[Jim Bottomley]] in the batting title race by nearly 40&amp;nbsp;points.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, p. 104&lt;/ref&gt; That year, he won the MVP Award, receiving 73 out of 80 possible votes.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, p. 106&lt;/ref&gt; His .756&amp;nbsp;slugging percentage set an NL record.&lt;ref&gt;Nemec and Wisnia, p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt; The Cardinals finished in fourth place in 1925, finishing one game over .500, though the team won 64&amp;nbsp;games and lost 51 under Hornsby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/STL/1925.shtml|title=1925 St. Louis Cardinals Batting, Pitching, &amp; Fielding Statistics|work=Baseball-Reference|publisher=Sports Reference, LLC|accessdate=January 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=manager&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/managers/hornsro01.shtml|title=Rogers Hornsby Managerial Record|work=Baseball-Reference|publisher=Sports Reference, LLC|accessdate=March 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the year, his wife Jeanette had a son, Billy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alexander, p. 103&quot;&gt;Alexander, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt;

Hornsby had an off-year offensively in 1926, as he hit only .317 with 11&amp;nbsp;home runs. Nonetheless, St. Louis won its first NL pennant. In the [[1926 World Series]], the Cardinals defeated the Yankees in a seven-game series; Hornsby tagged out [[Babe Ruth]] on a [[stolen base]] attempt, ending the Series and giving St. Louis its first undisputed world championship.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; During post-season negotiations for a new contract,  Hornsby demanded $50,000 per year for three years. Breadon agreed to a one-year contract for $50,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|50000|1926|r=0}}}} today). When Hornsby refused to give way, the Cardinals traded him to the [[San Francisco Giants|New York Giants]] for [[Frankie Frisch]] and [[Jimmy Ring]] on December&amp;nbsp;20, 1926.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, pp. 124–126&lt;/ref&gt; The trade was briefly postponed as NL president [[John Heydler]] stated that Hornsby could not play for the Giants while he held stock in the Cardinals. Hornsby wanted $105 per share for his stock, a price Breadon was unwilling to pay. In early 1927, Hornsby was able to sell his shares at $105 each, enabling him to officially become a Giant.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, pp. 127–132&lt;/ref&gt;

==New York Giants==
Hornsby enjoyed a better season in 1927, as he hit .361 and led the league in runs scored (133), walks (86), and on-base percentage (.448). He managed the Giants for part of the year as well, as manager [[John McGraw]] dealt with health problems.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, p. 136&lt;/ref&gt; Hornsby's performance helped guide the Giants to a 92–62 [[Winning percentage|win–loss record]] during the season, which was good enough for third place in the NL. However, Hornsby's gambling problems at the racetrack and distrust of Giants' management annoyed team owner [[Charles Stoneham]].&lt;ref&gt;D'Amore, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, pp. 137, 141&lt;/ref&gt; During the offseason he was traded to the [[Atlanta Braves|Boston Braves]] for [[Jimmy Welsh]] and [[Shanty Hogan]].&lt;ref name=br/&gt;

[[File:Rogers Hornsby 1928.jpg|thumb|right|Rogers Hornsby with the [[Atlanta Braves|Boston Braves]] in 1928]]
With the Braves in 1928, Hornsby was again the league's most productive hitter; he won his seventh batting title with a .387&amp;nbsp;average, also leading the league in on-base percentage (.498), slugging percentage (.632), and walks (107). One month into the season, manager [[Jack Slattery]] resigned, and the Braves hired Hornsby to be his replacement.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, p. 145&lt;/ref&gt; The Braves, however, lost 103&amp;nbsp;games and finished in seventh place out of eight teams in the NL. They were struggling financially as well, and when the [[Chicago Cubs]] offered $200,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|200000|1928|r=0}}}} today) and five players for Hornsby, the Braves found the offer too good to pass up.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, p. 148-149&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chicago Cubs==
Hornsby hit .380 in 1929 for Chicago while recording 39&amp;nbsp;home runs and leading the league with a .679&amp;nbsp;slugging percentage and 156 runs scored; the .380&amp;nbsp;batting average set a Cubs team record.&lt;ref&gt;Nemec and Wisnia, p. 126&lt;/ref&gt; He also collected another MVP Award, and the Cubs won the NL pennant. However, they lost in the [[1929 World Series]] to the [[Philadelphia Athletics]] in five games, and Hornsby batted just .238 with one RBI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1929/Ihornr1013261929.htm |title=The 1929 CHI N World Series Batting Log for Rogers Hornsby |publisher=Retrosheet|accessdate=January 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also set a World Series record for [[strikeout]]s with eight.&lt;ref&gt;Kavanagh, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;

After the first two months of the 1930 season, Hornsby was batting .325 with two home runs.  In the first game of a doubleheader against the Cardinals, Hornsby broke his ankle while advancing to third base.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, p. 161&lt;/ref&gt; He did not return until August&amp;nbsp;19, and he was used mostly as a pinch-hitter for the rest of the season.  When [[Joe McCarthy (manager)|Joe McCarthy]] was fired with four games remaining in the season Hornsby became the team's manager.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, p. 163&lt;/ref&gt; Hornsby finished the year with a .308&amp;nbsp;batting average and two home runs.&lt;ref name=br/&gt;

On April 24, 1931, Hornsby hit three home runs and drove in eight runs in a 10–6 victory over Pittsburgh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1931/B04240PIT1931.htm|title=Chicago Cubs 10, Pittsburgh Pirates 6|publisher=Retrosheet|accessdate=January 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hornsby played in 44 of the first 48&amp;nbsp;games, but after a disappointing performance he only played himself about half the time for the rest of the year.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, p. 168&lt;/ref&gt; In 100&amp;nbsp;games, he had 90&amp;nbsp;RBIs, 37&amp;nbsp;doubles, and a batting average of .331. He also led the league in on-base percentage (.421) for the ninth time in his career.&lt;ref name=br/&gt; The team finished 84–70, 17&amp;nbsp;games back of the pennant-winning Cardinals, and four games back of the Giants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/NL/1931.shtml|title=1931 National League Season Summary|work=Baseball-Reference|publisher=Sports Reference, LLC|accessdate=August 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1931 season was Hornsby's last as a full-time player.  [[Boil]]s on his feet bothered him during the start of the 1932 season,&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, p. 173&lt;/ref&gt; and he did not play his first game until May&amp;nbsp;29.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hornsby 1932&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1932/Ihornr1010181932.htm |title=The 1932 CHI N Regular Season Batting Log for Rogers Hornsby |publisher=Retrosheet |accessdate=January 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hornsby played right field from May&amp;nbsp;29 to June&amp;nbsp;10, appeared in two games as a pinch hitter, played third base from July&amp;nbsp;14 through July&amp;nbsp;18, and played one last game as a Cub when he pinch-hit on July&amp;nbsp;31.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hornsby 1932&quot;/&gt;

William Veeck, Sr., who was running the team, was unhappy with Hornsby's management of the team.  Hornsby maintained strict rules, and Veeck thought his managing style hurt team morale.&lt;ref name=purdy/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Alexander, p. 177&quot;/&gt;  Veeck believed Hornsby broke a cardinal rule of baseball in one particular incident.  Hornsby disagreed with a call made by the [[umpire]].  Instead of disputing the call himself, as was the manager's job, Hornsby sent another player to argue with the umpire.  That player was ejected from the game.&lt;ref&gt;Veeck, pp. 233–234&lt;/ref&gt; On August&amp;nbsp;2, although the Cubs were in second place, Hornsby was released, and [[Charlie Grimm]] replaced him as manager.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alexander, p. 177&quot;&gt;Alexander, p. 177&lt;/ref&gt; Hornsby had played 19&amp;nbsp;games, batting .224 with one home run and seven RBIs.&lt;ref name=br/&gt; Although the Cubs advanced to the [[1932 World Series]], the players voted not to give Hornsby any of the World Series money.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, p. 180&lt;/ref&gt;

==St. Louis Cardinals and Browns==
Hornsby did not play for the rest of 1932, but the Cardinals signed him as a player on October&amp;nbsp;24 for the 1933 season.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alexander, p. 177&quot;/&gt; He played regularly at second base from April&amp;nbsp;25 through May&amp;nbsp;5, but he was used mostly as a [[pinch hitter]] with the Cardinals. On July&amp;nbsp;22, he had his final NL hit in a 9–5 loss to the Braves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1933/B07220SLN1933.htm|title=Boston Braves 9, St. Louis Cardinals 5|publisher=Retrosheet|accessdate=January 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through July&amp;nbsp;23, Hornsby was batting .325 with two home runs and 21&amp;nbsp;RBIs. However, the Cardinals chose to place him on [[Major League Baseball transactions#Waivers|waivers]].&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, p. 187&lt;/ref&gt;

Hornsby was claimed by the last place [[St. Louis Browns]] of the [[American League]] (AL) on July&amp;nbsp;26 as player-manager. [[Bill Killefer]] had just resigned as Browns manager, and Browns owner [[Phil Ball (baseball)|Phil Ball]] wanted Hornsby as a replacement.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, pp. 187–188&lt;/ref&gt; Hornsby appeared in 11&amp;nbsp;games for the Browns. He had three hits, including a home run, in nine at-bats. The Browns finished in last place in the AL. That year, Hornsby began operating a baseball school in [[Hot Springs, Texas]], which he ran on and off between 1933 and 1951 with various associates.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, pp. 183–184, 237, 258&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1934, Hornsby started only two games, one at third base, and the other in [[right fielder|right field]]. In all of his other appearances, he was a pinch hitter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1934/Ihornr1010211934.htm |title=The 1934 STL A Regular Season Batting Log for Rogers Hornsby |publisher=Retrosheet |accessdate=January 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the season, he batted .304 with one home run and 11&amp;nbsp;RBIs.&lt;ref name=br/&gt; The Browns improved on their previous season, finishing in sixth place out of eight teams in the AL.

Hornsby played in 10 games in the 1935 season, starting in 4. From April&amp;nbsp;16 through April&amp;nbsp;21, he started at [[first baseman|first base]], and he started at third base on May&amp;nbsp;22.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1935/Ihornr1010221935.htm |title=The 1935 STL A Regular Season Batting Log for Rogers Hornsby |publisher=Retrosheet |accessdate=January 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He finished the year with five hits and a .208&amp;nbsp;average, while the Browns slipped to seventh place.&lt;ref name=br/&gt;

Hornsby only appeared in two games with the team during the 1936 season. On May&amp;nbsp;31, his pinch-hit single in the ninth inning gave the Browns an 11–10 win over the [[Detroit Tigers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1936/B05310DET1936.htm |title=St. Louis Browns 11, Detroit Tigers 10 |publisher=Retrosheet |accessdate=January 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his other appearance on June&amp;nbsp;9, he played first base in a 5–3 win over the Yankees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1936/B06090NYA1936.htm |title=St. Louis Browns 5, New York Yankees 3 |publisher=Retrosheet |accessdate=January 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Browns again finished in seventh place.

In 1937, Hornsby played in 20&amp;nbsp;games. On April 21, in his first game of the year, Hornsby hit the final home run of his career in a 15–10 victory over the [[Chicago White Sox]].&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, p. 211&lt;/ref&gt; On July&amp;nbsp;5, he had the final hit of his career in a 15–4 loss in the second game of a [[doubleheader (baseball)|doubleheader]] with the [[Cleveland Indians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1937/B07052SLA1937.htm|title=Cleveland Indians 15, St. Louis Browns 4 (2)|publisher=Retrosheet|accessdate=January 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 20, Hornsby appeared in what would be his final game, a 5–4 loss to the Yankees. A day later, Hornsby was fired as manager and released as a player by the Browns, who were in last place at the time of his release. His release was partly due to an incident with Browns owner [[Donald Barnes]]. On July&amp;nbsp;15, Hornsby won $35,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|35000|1937|r=0}}}} today) from betting on a horse race. When he tried to use $4,000 of this money to pay off a debt to Barnes, Barnes refused it, since it had come from a bookmaker. Hornsby protested to Barnes, &quot;The money is as good as the money you take from people in the loan-shark business. It's better than taking interest from widows and orphans... &quot;; that made his release five days later an easy decision for Barnes.&lt;ref name=&quot;gambling&quot;&gt;Alexander, pp. 212–214&lt;/ref&gt; Hornsby finished the 1937 season with a .321&amp;nbsp;batting average and 18&amp;nbsp;hits in 20&amp;nbsp;games, and was the oldest player in the AL that season.&lt;ref name=br/&gt;

==Later baseball career==
Following his release from the Browns, Hornsby was unable to retire because he had lost so much money gambling over the years.&lt;ref name=&quot;gambling&quot;/&gt; He signed as a player-coach with the [[Baltimore Orioles (minor league)|Baltimore Orioles]] of the [[International League]] in 1938 before leaving them to play for and manage the [[Chattanooga Lookouts]] of the [[Southern Association]] for the rest of the season. Hornsby then returned to the Orioles to manage them for 1939, but he did not return to the club following the season.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, pp. 219–223&lt;/ref&gt; Halfway through 1940, he signed to manage the [[Oklahoma City Indians]] of the [[Texas League]]. He led them from last place to the Texas League playoffs, where they fell to the [[Houston Buffaloes]] in four games. Hornsby began 1941 managing the Indians once again, but he resigned in the middle of the season. In November, he became the general and field manager of the [[Fort Worth Cats]], also of the Texas league.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, pp. 224–226&lt;/ref&gt; Fort Worth finished in third place and made the playoffs in 1942, but they were eliminated in the first round by the [[Shreveport Sports]].&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, pp. 219–229&lt;/ref&gt;

Hornsby went unsigned by any team in 1943, but he signed as a player-manager with the Vera Cruz Blues of ''La Liga Mexicana'' in [[Mexico]] in 1944. After hitting a game-winning [[grand slam (baseball)|grand slam]] for the second win of a series in March, he resigned when the team owner complained that the win would diminish the crowd for the third game of the series.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, pp. 230–232&lt;/ref&gt; Following his release, he did some commentary for radio station WTMV, assisted the [[Cleveland Indians]] in spring training in 1947,&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, pp. 232–237&lt;/ref&gt; and became a TV announcer for Chicago Cubs games in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;Kavanagh, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;

Hornsby did not become a manager or coach again until 1950, when he was hired to manage the Texas League's [[Beaumont Exporters|Beaumont Roughnecks]]. Beaumont won the pennant, but they were swept in the first round of the playoffs by the [[San Antonio Missions]].&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, pp. 241, 247&lt;/ref&gt; The next year, in 1951, Hornsby managed the [[Seattle Rainiers]] of the [[Pacific Coast League]]. Under Hornsby's leadership, the Rainiers won the pennant.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, pp. 248, 253&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1952, Hornsby was again hired to manage the St. Louis Browns, his first major league job in 16 years. The Browns' owner, [[Bill Veeck]], was the son of former Cubs president and general manager William Veeck, Sr. Hornsby was not well received by the players, however. On June&amp;nbsp;9, he was fired due to a disagreement with Veeck over an incident against the Yankees the day before. During the game, a fan prevented [[Gil McDougald]] of the Yankees from catching a fly ball, and the umpire ruled that it was [[fan interference]]. Hornsby did not initially argue the call, and a few minutes later Veeck forced him to do it (when it was already too late to do anything about it). This led to Hornsby and the Browns parting ways. The Browns players were so happy about Hornsby's firing that they gave Veeck an engraved trophy to thank him.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, pp. 254–266&lt;/ref&gt;

A little over a month later, on July&amp;nbsp;26, Hornsby was hired to replace [[Luke Sewell]] as manager of the [[Cincinnati Reds]]. After Hornsby completed two mediocre seasons with the club, the Reds announced that he would not return for 1954.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, pp. 269–281&lt;/ref&gt; He finished his MLB managerial career with a record of 701–812.&lt;ref name=manager/&gt; Following his dismissal, Hornsby worked as a coach for the [[Chicago Cubs]] from 1958 to 1960 before becoming a scout and third base coach for the [[New York Mets]] in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, pp. 290–297&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963, Hornsby died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]]. He was buried in the Hornsby family cemetery in Hornsby Bend, Texas.&lt;ref name=br/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, pp. 302, 305&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Baseball experts and sportswriters have considered Hornsby to be one of the greatest hitters of all time. His lifetime batting average of .358 is only exceeded by [[Ty Cobb]]'s career mark of .367. He won seven batting titles in total, a feat tied or exceeded by only five players (Cobb (11), [[Tony Gwynn]] (8), [[Honus Wagner]] (8), [[Rod Carew]] (7), and [[Stan Musial]] (7)). Hornsby led the National League in slugging percentage nine times, a record that still stands. He also hit more home runs, drove in more runs, and had a higher batting average than any other National League player during the 1920s, which makes him one of four players in baseball history (along with Honus Wagner, [[Ted Williams]], and [[Albert Pujols]]) to win a &quot;decade&quot; triple crown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kurkjian|first=Tim|authorlink=Tim Kurkjian|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/columns/story?columnist=kurkjian_tim&amp;id=4753935|title=Selecting the All-Decade team|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=December 18, 2009|accessdate=December 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He hit a career total of 301&amp;nbsp;home runs and was the first National League player to hit 300.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hall of Fame&quot;/&gt; His 264&amp;nbsp;home runs as a second baseman was a major league record for that position until [[Joe Morgan]] surpassed him in 1984. Hornsby was also a very consistent hitter whether he was playing at home or on the road. His lifetime home batting average was .359, and his lifetime away batting average was .358. Ted Williams said that Hornsby was the greatest hitter for power and average in baseball,&lt;ref&gt;Williams and Underwood, p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Frankie Frisch]] said of him, &quot;He's the only guy I know who could hit .350 in the dark.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hall of Fame&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://baseballhall.org/hof/hornsby-rogers |title=Hornsby, Rogers |publisher=Baseball Hall of Fame |accessdate=December 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hornsby also holds second place on the unofficial major league record list of &quot;consecutive games with two or more hits&quot; with 13&amp;nbsp;games,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.mathaware.org/mam/2010/essays/RothmanLeStreaking.pdf|title=Streaking:Finding the Probability for a Batting Streak|first = Stanley| last = Rothman|coauthors=Le, Quoc|publisher=American Mathematical Society|work=Math Awareness Month/Mathematics and Sports (www.mathaware.org)|date=April 2010|page=13|accessdate=January 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; first place honors going to [[Count Campau]]'s 15-game streak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sabr.org/cmsFiles/Files/records_FEB2010.pdf|title=Most Consecutive Multi-Hit Games|editor=Spatz, Lyle|publisher=Society for American Baseball Research (Baseball Records Committee)|date=February 2010|page=1|accessdate=January 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hornsby is the only right-handed batter in history to hit over .400 three times&lt;ref&gt;Nemec and Wisnia, p. 107&lt;/ref&gt; and is considered, according to the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', to be the greatest right-handed hitter in history.&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite news|title=Hornsby, 66, Dies of Heart Attack|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=January 6, 1963|page=C1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He led the National League in batting average, on-base percentage, slugging percentage, and total bases every year from 1920 to 1925.&lt;ref name=br/&gt;

Hornsby was also renowned for his speed, and was considered to be the fastest player in the National League in his prime.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; He did not try to steal very often but used his speed to take extra bases. Between 1916 and 1927 Hornsby had 30&amp;nbsp;[[inside-the-park home run]]s, and he led the league with 17&amp;nbsp;triples in 1917 and 18&amp;nbsp;triples in 1921; he had 20&amp;nbsp;triples in 1920.&lt;ref name=br/&gt;

However, Hornsby was often hard to get along with, a major reason he changed teams so frequently in the last decade of his career.  He usually left due to falling out with the front office. Most of the players he managed did not like him due to his insistence that others follow his lifestyle, although some (like [[Woody English]] and [[Clint Courtney]]) did.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander pp. 152, 266&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kavanaugh, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; Hornsby never played cards, but he did bet frequently on horse races, and he lost more than he won.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, pp. 6, 309&lt;/ref&gt; His gambling was often a factor in his dismissal from a team.&lt;ref name=&quot;gambling&quot;/&gt; By most contemporary accounts, he was at least as mean and nasty as Cobb, who was known in his time for his aggressive attitude and dirty play.&lt;ref name=purdy&gt;{{cite book |title=The Team-by-Team Encyclopedia of Major League Baseball|last=Purdy|first=Dennis|year=2006|page=936|publisher=[[Workman Publishing Company|Workman]]|location=[[New York City]]|isbn=0-7611-3943-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/page2/s/list/readers/dirtiest/players.html|title=Page 2 mailbag – Readers: Dirtiest pro players|accessdate=September 12, 2011|publisher=[[ESPN.com]]|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He never went to movies, convinced that it would harm a batter's eyesight, and he never smoked or drank.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

Hornsby was elected into the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|National Baseball Hall of Fame]] in 1942. In 1999, Hornsby was ranked ninth on ''[[The Sporting News]]'' list of Baseball's Greatest Players.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|year=April 1999|title=Baseball's 100 Greatest Players|work=The Sporting News|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, he was named to the [[Major League Baseball All-Century Team]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |agency=Associated Press |url=http://static.espn.go.com/mlb/news/1999/1023/129008.html |title=All-Century Team final voting |publisher=ESPN |accessdate=December 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, writer [[Bill James]] ranked him as the 22nd-greatest player and the third-greatest second baseman in baseball history.&lt;ref&gt;James, pp. 361, 485.&lt;/ref&gt; He is also tied for eighth overall with [[Stan Musial]] in [[wins above replacement]] for position players.&lt;ref name=br/&gt; Hornsby has also been recognized on the [[St. Louis Walk of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stlouiswalkoffame.org/inductees/?view=achievement |title=St. Louis Walk of Fame Inductees |publisher=St. Louis Walk of Fame|accessdate=December 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
On September&amp;nbsp;23, 1918, Hornsby married Sarah Elizabeth Martin in [[Philadelphia]], whom he had known since he played for the Denison Railroaders.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, pp. 41, 48&lt;/ref&gt; They had a son, Rogers Hornsby, Jr., on November&amp;nbsp;15, 1920.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; However, during 1922, he began seeing Jeanette Pennington Hine, who was married to an automobile-supply salesman named John Hine.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, pp. 74–75&lt;/ref&gt; On June&amp;nbsp;12, 1923, Hornsby divorced Sarah, and Hine divorced her spouse in 1923 as well; the two were married on February&amp;nbsp;28, 1924. As a result of the divorce, Sarah took custody of Rogers Jr.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, pp. 79, 87&lt;/ref&gt;

Hornsby and Jeanette had a son, Billy, on June&amp;nbsp;2, 1925.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alexander, p. 103&quot;/&gt; Billy played baseball for several years in the minor leagues, but never reached the majors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/player.cgi?id=hornsb002wil|title=Bill Hornsby Minor League Statistics &amp; History|work=Baseball-Reference|publisher=Sports Reference, LLC|accessdate=January 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hornsby and Jeanette became estranged in December 1944,&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, p. 233&lt;/ref&gt; and Hornsby began seeing a woman named Bernadette Harris, whom he called his &quot;personal good friend and secretary&quot;, in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, p. 234&lt;/ref&gt; They lived together after 1948, until Harris committed suicide by jumping out of a third-story window on September&amp;nbsp;7, 1953. The suicide was attributed to depression.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, pp. 234, 279–280&lt;/ref&gt; Following Jeanette's death on June&amp;nbsp;1, 1956, Hornsby married Marjorie Bernice Frederick Porter on January&amp;nbsp;27, 1957.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, p. 287&lt;/ref&gt; They remained together until Hornsby's death in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, p. 304&lt;/ref&gt;
