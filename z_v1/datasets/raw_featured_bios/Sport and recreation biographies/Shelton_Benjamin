Benjamin's next storyline began on the December 5, 2005 episode of ''Raw'', when [[Shawn Michaels]] was scripted to give Benjamin a speech to get him &quot;psyched&quot; for their tag match together later in the night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/051205.html|title=RAW Results – December 5, 2005|accessdate=2007-06-17|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a part of the scripted ending to the match, Michaels was preparing to finish the match when Benjamin tagged himself in and missed a crossbody, allowing Carlito to pin Benjamin.&lt;ref name=&quot;oww&quot; /&gt; Benjamin was then depicted as having a &quot;losing streak&quot; over the next several weeks,&lt;ref name=&quot;oww&quot;/&gt; which led to Benjamin's noisy, scolding, and domineering &quot;[[Mammy archetype|Momma]]&quot; (played by comedian/actress [[Thea Vidale]]) coming to ''Raw'' to confront Benjamin.

In 2006, Benjamin had a staged on-screen rivalry with then-Intercontinental Champion [[Ric Flair]]. On the February 20 episode of ''Raw'', Benjamin defeated Flair to regain the Intercontinental Championship after Momma faked a heart problem, causing enough of a distraction to allow Benjamin to cheat and win the title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/060220.html|title=RAW Results – February 20, 2006|accessdate=2007-06-17|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt; Benjamin continued to feud with Flair, but Momma no longer accompanied him to ringside. As part of the scripted events, Benjamin stated that she was undergoing heart surgery in the hospital and that he held Flair responsible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/060313.html|title=RAW Results – March 13, 2006|accessdate=2007-06-17|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Benjamin competed in the second [[Money in the Bank ladder match]] at [[WrestleMania 22]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wwf/mania.html#22|title=WrestleMania 22 – April 2, 2006|accessdate=2007-06-17|publisher=Pro Wrestling History}}&lt;/ref&gt; Benjamin then had an on-screen rivalry with the winner of that match, [[Rob Van Dam]], in an attempt to take Van Dam's Money in the Bank contract. During this time, Benjamin emphasized his new heel persona with a new [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#G|gimmick]]: wearing shades, jewelry, and occasional colored shirts while entering the ring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/pictures/s/sheltonbenjamin/15.jpg|title=Picture of Shelton Benjamin|accessdate=2007-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; At one point, Benjamin was defeated by his former tag team partner, the returning [[Charlie Haas]], during an episode of ''Raw''. A predetermined stipulation added to this loss meant that Benjamin had to defend the Intercontinental Title in the same match as his shot at Van Dam's contract,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/060417.html|title=RAW Results – April 17, 2006|accessdate=2007-06-17|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning at [[Backlash (2006)|Backlash]] it would be a &quot;Winner Takes All&quot; match.

Benjamin got to Van Dam first, picking up the pin and his third Intercontinental Championship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/060515.html|title=RAW Results – May 15, 2006|accessdate=2007-06-17|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, Benjamin feuded with Carlito and others for his Intercontinental Championship before losing the title to [[John Morrison (wrestler)|Johnny Nitro]] in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic non-elimination matches|Triple Threat match]] also involving Carlito at [[Vengeance (2006)|Vengeance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wwf/venge.html#2006|title=Vengeance 2006 – June 25, 2006|accessdate=2007-06-17|publisher=Pro Wrestling History}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the February 22 episode of ''SmackDown!'', Benjamin defeated [[James Yun|Jimmy Wang Yang]] in a qualifying match for the [[Money in the Bank ladder match]] at [[WrestleMania XXIV]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/archive/02222008/mainarticle/|title=Results: Two roads diverge|last=DiFino|first=Lennie|publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]]|accessdate=2008-03-12| date=2008-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was won by [[CM Punk]]. After WrestleMania, Benjamin briefly feuded with Punk, before he began an on-screen rivalry with [[Kofi Kingston]], who defeated Benjamin on the April 22 episode of ''ECW''. On ECW's 100th episode, however, Benjamin defeated Kingston, thus ending the latter's undefeated streak. To end the feud, Kingston then defeated Benjamin in an ECW Extreme Rules match.
