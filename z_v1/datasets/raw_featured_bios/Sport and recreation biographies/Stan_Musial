'''Stanley Frank &quot;Stan&quot; Musial''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|m|juː|z|i|ə|l}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|juː|ʒ|əl}}; born November 21, 1920) is a retired professional baseball player who played 22 seasons in [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) for the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] (1941–1963). Nicknamed '''&quot;Stan the Man&quot;''', Musial was a record 24-time [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]] selection (tied with [[Willie Mays]]), and is widely considered to be one of the greatest hitters in baseball history.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stan Musial: An American Life&quot;&gt;[http://www.amazon.com/dp/product-description/0345517067 &quot;Stan Musial: An American Life&quot;], Amazon.com, review of George Vecsey's &quot;Stan Musial: An American Life&quot; ([[ESPN]]: May 10, 2011), accessed May 18, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; He compiled 3,630 [[hit (baseball)|hits]] (ranking fourth all-time and most in a career spent with only one team). With 1,815 hits at home and 1,815 on the road, he is also considered to be the most consistent hitter of his era.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stan Musial: An American Life&quot;/&gt; He also compiled 475 [[home run]]s during his career, was named the [[National League]]'s (NL) [[Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player]] (MVP) three times, and won three [[World Series]] championship titles. Musial was a first-ballot inductee to the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Baseball Hall of Fame]] in 1969 and is currently the longest tenured living Hall of Famer.

Musial was born in [[Donora, Pennsylvania]], where he frequently played baseball in both informal and organized settings, eventually playing on the baseball team at Donora High School. Signed to a professional contract by the St. Louis Cardinals as a [[pitcher]] in 1938, Musial was converted into an [[outfielder]] prior to his major league debut in 1941. Noted for his unique batting stance, he quickly established himself as a consistent and productive hitter. In his first full season, 1942, the Cardinals won the World Series. The following year, he led the National League in six different offensive categories and earned his first MVP award. He was also named an All-Star for the first time; he would be selected to every All-Star Game in every subsequent season he played. Musial won his second World Series ring in 1944, then missed the entire 1945 season while serving with the [[United States Navy]].

On his return to baseball in 1946, Musial resumed his consistent hitting. That year he earned his second MVP award and third World Series title. His third MVP award came in 1948, when he finished one home run shy of winning baseball's [[Major League Baseball Triple Crown|Triple Crown]]. After struggling offensively in 1959, Musial used a personal trainer to help maintain his productivity until he decided to retire in 1963. At the time of his retirement, he held or shared 17 major league records, 29 National League records, and 9 All-Star Game records. In addition to overseeing businesses such as a restaurant both before and after his playing career, Musial served as the Cardinals' [[General manager (baseball)|general manager]] in 1967, winning the pennant and [[1967 World Series|World Series]] and then quitting that position. He also became noted for his harmonica playing, a skill he acquired during his playing career. Known for his modesty and sportsmanship, Musial was selected for the [[Major League Baseball All-Century Team]] in 1999. President Barack Obama presented Musial with [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]], the highest honor that can be bestowed on a civilian, at the White House on Feb. 15, 2011.

==Early life==
Musial was born in [[Donora, Pennsylvania]], the fifth of Lukasz and Mary (Lancos) Musial's six children (four girls and two boys).&lt;ref name=&quot;Musial6&quot;&gt;[[#Mus64|Musial and Broeg 1964]]: 6&lt;/ref&gt; His mother was of Czech descent and his father was a [[Polish-American]]  immigrant who chose the name Stanisław Franciszek Musiał ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|uː|ʃ|aʊ}}) (Moo-shiau) for his first son, though his father always referred to Musial using the Polish nickname &quot;Stashu&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Musial6&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://pabook.libraries.psu.edu/palitmap/bios/Musial__Stan.html&lt;/ref&gt; Musial frequently played baseball with his brother Ed and other friends during his childhood, and considered [[Lefty Grove]] his favorite ballplayer.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lan94|Lansche 1994]]: 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mus64|Musial and Broeg 1964]]: 10–11&lt;/ref&gt; Musial also had the benefit of learning about baseball from his neighbor Joe Barbao, a former [[Minor league baseball|minor league]] pitcher.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mus64|Musial and Broeg 1964]]: 10&lt;/ref&gt; When he enrolled in school, his name was formally changed to Stanley Frank Musial.&lt;ref name=&quot;Musial6&quot;/&gt; 

At the age of 15, Musial joined the Donora Zincs, a semi-professional team managed by Barbao.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lansche7&quot;&gt;[[#Lan94|Lansche 1994]]: 7&lt;/ref&gt; In his Zincs debut, he pitched 6 [[inning#Baseball|innings]] and [[strikeout|struck out]] 13 batters, all of them adults.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lansche7&quot;/&gt; Musial also played one season on the newly revived Donora High School baseball team, where one of his teammates was Buddy Griffey, father of MLB player [[Ken Griffey, Sr.]] and grandfather to MLB player [[Ken Griffey, Jr.]]&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gig01|Giglio 2001]]: 23–24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/wire?section=mlb&amp;id=1825227 |title=Reds star hits 500th career home run |accessdate=February 28, 2009 |author=Associated Press |date=June 20, 2004 |publisher=ESPN.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baseball statistician [[Bill James]] described Griffey Jr., in comparison to Musial, as &quot;the second-best left-handed hitting, left-handed throwing outfielder ever born in Donora, Pennsylvania on November 21.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Jam01|James 2001]]: 727&lt;/ref&gt; His exploits as a rising player in Pennsylvania earned him the nickname '''&quot;The Donora Greyhound &quot;'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thebaseballpage.com/players/musiast01.php |title=Stan Musial player page |accessdate=March 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Musial also played basketball, for which he was offered a scholarship by the [[University of Pittsburgh]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Lansche7&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mus64|Musial and Broeg 1964]]: 14&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] had scouted Musial as a pitcher and, in 1937, offered him a professional contract after a workout with their [[Minor league baseball|Class D]] Penn State League affiliate.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lan94|Lansche 1994]]: 8&lt;/ref&gt; Musial's father initially resisted the idea of his son pursuing a baseball career, but reluctantly gave his consent after lobbying by both Musial and his mother.&lt;ref name=&quot;Giglio2627&quot;&gt;[[#Gig01|Giglio 2001]]: 26–27&lt;/ref&gt;  Musial also credited his school librarian Helen Kloz for pointing out that baseball was his dream and advising him to pursue it professionally.&lt;ref name=Giglio2627/&gt; In what was then a common practice, the Cardinals did not file the contract with the [[Commissioner of Baseball (MLB)|baseball commissioner]]'s office until June 1938. This preserved Musial's amateur eligibility, and he was still able to participate in high school sports, leading Donora High School's basketball team to a playoff appearance.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mus64|Musial and Broeg 1964]]: 21&lt;/ref&gt; He then reported to the Cardinals' Class D affiliate in [[West Virginia]], the [[Williamson Red Birds]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mus64|Musial and Broeg 1964]]: 24–25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gig01|Giglio 2001]]: 27–29&lt;/ref&gt;

==Baseball career==
Musial's rookie year with Williamson was a period of adjustment, both on and off the field. He began gaining more in-depth knowledge about baseball strategy&lt;ref name=&quot;Musial2728&quot;&gt;[[#Mus64|Musial and Broeg 1964]]: 27–28&lt;/ref&gt; while posting a 6–6 [[Win–loss record (pitching)|win–loss record]] and a 4.66 [[earned run average]] (ERA), to go along with a .258 [[batting average]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mus64|Musial and Broeg 1964]]: 28&lt;/ref&gt; Off the field, he confronted feelings of [[homesickness]], while learning to live comfortably and independently on his $65-per-month salary.&lt;ref name=Musial2728/&gt; Musial finished his high school education before returning to Williamson in spring 1939. That season, his numbers improved to a 9–2 record, a 4.30 ERA, and a .352 batting average.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lan94|Lansche 1994]]: 12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mus64|Musial and Broeg 1964]]: 31&lt;/ref&gt;

Musial spent the 1940 season with the Cardinals' other Class D team, the [[Daytona Beach Islanders]], where he developed a lifelong friendship with manager [[Dickie Kerr]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gig01|Giglio 2001]]: 35–38&lt;/ref&gt; His pitching skills improved under the guidance of Kerr, who also recognized his [[Hit (baseball)|hitting]] talent, playing him in the [[outfielder|outfield]] between pitching [[Starting pitcher|starts]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Vec11|Vecsey 2011]]: 72–74&lt;/ref&gt; On May 25, 1940, Musial married fellow Donora resident Lillian &quot;Lil&quot; Labash in Daytona Beach, and the couple's first child followed in August.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gig01|Giglio 2001]]: 36–37&lt;/ref&gt; During late August, Musial suffered a shoulder injury while playing in the outfield, and later made an early exit as the starting pitcher in a 12–5 playoff game loss.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mus64|Musial and Broeg 1964]]: 33–35&lt;/ref&gt; For a while, Musial considered leaving baseball entirely, complaining that he could not afford to support himself and his wife on the $16 a week pay. Kerr talked him out of it and even took the Musials into his own home to relieve the financial burden. To repay the debt, Musial in 1958 bought Kerr a $20,000 home in Houston.&lt;ref&gt;[[Newsweek, June 2, 1958]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 113 games in 1940, he hit .311, while compiling an 18–5 pitching record that included 176 strikeouts and 145 [[base on balls|walks]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mus64|Musial and Broeg 1964]]: 32&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lan94|Lansche 1994]]: 15&lt;/ref&gt;  

Musial was assigned to the Class AA [[Columbus Red Birds]] to begin 1941, though manager [[Burt Shotton]] and Musial himself quickly realized that the previous year's injury had considerably weakened his arm.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mus64|Musial and Broeg 1964]]: 37–38&lt;/ref&gt; He was reassigned to the Class C [[Springfield Cardinals]] as a full-time outfielder, and he later credited manager [[Ollie Vanek]] for displaying confidence in his hitting ability.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mus64|Musial and Broeg 1964]]: 40&lt;/ref&gt; During 87 games with Springfield, Musial hit a league-leading .379, before being promoted to the [[Rochester Red Wings]] of the [[International League]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lan94|Lansche 1994]]: 16–17&lt;/ref&gt; He was noted for his unique batting stance, a crouch in which his back was seemingly square to the pitcher.&lt;ref name=espnclassic/&gt; This stance was later described by pitcher [[Ted Lyons]] as &quot;a kid peeking around the corner to see if the cops were coming&quot;.&lt;ref name=sabr/&gt; According to a 1950 description by author Tom Meany, &quot;The bent knees and the crouch give him the appearance of a coiled spring, although most pitchers think of him as a coiled rattlesnake.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Meany, Tom, &quot;Baseball's Greatest Hitters: Stan Musial&quot;, ''Baseball Digest'', June 1950, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; Musial continued to play well in Rochester—in one three-game stretch, he had 11 hits. He was called up to the Cardinals for the last two weeks of the 1941 season.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mus64|Musial and Broeg 1964]]: 43–44&lt;/ref&gt;

===1941–1945===
[[File:Musial statue.JPG|right|thumb|upright|Musial's statue outside of [[Busch Stadium]] captures his signature batting stance.|alt=A bronze statue of baseball great Stan Musial]]
Musial made his [[Major League Baseball|major league]] debut during the second game of a [[Doubleheader (baseball)|doubleheader]] at [[Sportsman's Park]] on September 17, 1941.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lan94|Lansche 1994]]: 24–25&lt;/ref&gt; The Cardinals were in the midst of a pennant race with the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]]; in 12 games, Musial collected 20 hits for a .426 batting average.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lan94|Lansche 1994]]: 19, 27&lt;/ref&gt; Despite Musial's late contributions, the [[1941 St. Louis Cardinals season|Cardinals]] finished two and one-half games behind the [[1941 Brooklyn Dodgers season|100-game-winning Dodgers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1941/Y_1941.htm |title=The 1941 Season |accessdate=March 22, 2009 |publisher=Retrosheet.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cardinals manager [[Billy Southworth]] used Musial as a [[left fielder]] to begin [[1942 St. Louis Cardinals season|1942]], sometimes lifting him for a [[pinch-hitter]] against left-handed pitching.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mus64|Musial and Broeg 1964]]: 54–55&lt;/ref&gt; Musial was hitting .315 by late June,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mus64|Musial and Broeg 1964]]: 56&lt;/ref&gt; as the Cardinals resumed battling the Dodgers for first place in the [[National League]] (NL).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mus64|Musial and Broeg 1964]]: 56–57&lt;/ref&gt; The Cardinals took sole possession of first place on September 13, and when Musial caught a fly ball to end the first game of a doubleheader on September 27 they clinched the [[List of National League pennant winners|pennant]] with their 105th win.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lan94|Lansche 1994]]: 38&lt;/ref&gt; He finished the season with a .315 batting average and 72 [[runs batted in]] (RBI) in 140 games. Musial received national publicity when he was named by ''[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]'' sports editor J. Roy Stockton as his choice for Rookie of the Year in a ''[[Saturday Evening Post]]'' article.&lt;ref name=stats1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lan94|Lansche 1994]]: 40&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cardinals played the [[American League]] champion [[New York Yankees]] in the [[1942 World Series]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sch90|Schoor 1990]]: 187&lt;/ref&gt; Representing the winning run in the bottom of the ninth inning of Game 1 at Sportsman's Park, Musial grounded out with the [[bases loaded]] to seal a Yankees victory.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sch90|Schoor 1990]]: 188&lt;/ref&gt; Musial's first hit of the Series was an RBI [[Single (baseball)|single]] that provided the margin of victory in Game 2, allowing the Cardinals to tie the Series.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lan94|Lansche 1994]]: 41&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next three games at [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]], Musial had three more hits as the Cardinals defeated the Yankees in the Series four games to one.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sch90|Schoor 1990]]: 190&lt;/ref&gt; Musial batted .222 for the Series, with two [[Run (baseball)|runs scored]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sch90|Schoor 1990]]: 403&lt;/ref&gt;

Musial's [[1943 St. Louis Cardinals season|1943 season]] started with a brief contract holdout in [[spring training]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;[[#Mus64|Musial and Broeg 1964]]: 74–76&lt;/ref&gt; He was selected to his first [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Game]]&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; and finished the regular season leading the NL in hits (220), [[Double (baseball)|doubles]] (48), [[Triple (baseball)|triples]] (20), [[total bases]] (347), [[on-base percentage]] (.425), and [[slugging percentage]] (.562).&lt;ref name=&quot;Giglio86&quot;&gt;[[#Gig01|Giglio 2001]]: 86&lt;/ref&gt; This performance earned him his first [[Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award|NL Most Valuable Player award]], ahead of teammate [[Walker Cooper]].&lt;ref name=Giglio86/&gt; After romping to another NL pennant by 18 games, the Cardinals again faced the Yankees in the [[1943 World Series]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Giglio87&quot;&gt;[[#Gig01|Giglio 2001]]: 87&lt;/ref&gt; Musial had a single in the Cardinals' Game 1 loss, and scored a run in a Game 2 win.&lt;ref name=Giglio87/&gt; The Cardinals did not win another game in the Series, but the loser's bonus share paid to each Cardinals player ($4,321.99) still amounted to nearly two-thirds of Musial's regular season salary.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gig01|Giglio 2001]]: 88&lt;/ref&gt; 

United States involvement in World War II began to impinge on Musial's baseball career in [[1944 St. Louis Cardinals season|1944]], as he underwent a physical examination in prelude to possible service in the armed forces.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gig01|Giglio 2001]]: 89&lt;/ref&gt; He ultimately remained with the Cardinals for the entire season, posting a .347 batting average with 197 hits.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lan94|Lansche 1994]]: 60&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/M/Pmusis101.htm |title=Stan Musial |accessdate=February 24, 2009 |publisher=Retrosheet.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cardinals claimed the NL pennant for the third consecutive season, and faced St. Louis's other major league team, the [[Baltimore Orioles|Browns]], in the [[1944 World Series]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lan94|Lansche 1994]]: 63–64&lt;/ref&gt; The Browns took a 2–1 lead, while Musial hit .250 with zero RBI.&lt;ref name=&quot;Giglio93&quot;&gt;[[#Gig01|Giglio 2001]]: 93&lt;/ref&gt; He broke out in Game 4 with a two-run [[home run]], single, double, and a walk as part of a 5–1 Cardinals win.&lt;ref name=Giglio93/&gt; The Cardinals went on to defeat the Browns in six games, and Musial posted a .304 batting average for the Series.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gig01|Giglio 2001]]: 93–94&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sch90|Schoor 1990]]: 404&lt;/ref&gt;  

Musial entered the [[United States Navy]] on January 23, 1945, and was initially assigned to noncombat duty at the Naval Training Station in [[Bainbridge, Maryland]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lan94|Lansche 1994]]: 66&lt;/ref&gt; On ship repair duty at [[Pearl Harbor]] later in the year, he was able to play baseball every afternoon in the naval base's eight-team league.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lansch67&quot;&gt;[[#Lan94|Lansche 1994]]: 67&lt;/ref&gt; After being granted emergency leave to see his ailing father in January 1946, he was briefly assigned to the [[Philadelphia Navy Yard]] before his honorable discharge from the Navy in March.&lt;ref name=Lansch67/&gt;

Rejoining the Cardinals under new manager [[Eddie Dyer]], Musial posted a .388 batting average by the middle of May [[1946 St. Louis Cardinals season|1946]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lan94|Lansche 1994]]: 69, 72&lt;/ref&gt; He also became close friends with new teammate [[Red Schoendienst]], who had joined the Cardinals during Musial's absence in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gig01|Giglio 2001]]: 123&lt;/ref&gt; During the season, Musial (who was under contract to the Cardinals for $13,500 in 1946) was offered a five-year, $125,000 contract, plus a $50,000 bonus, to join the Mexican League.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mus64|Musial and Broeg 1964]]: 90&lt;/ref&gt; He declined the offer, and after manager Dyer spoke to club owner [[Sam Breadon]], Musial was given a $5,000 raise later in 1946.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lan94|Lansche 1994]]: 73&lt;/ref&gt;

It was also during the 1946 season that Musial acquired his nickname of &quot;The Man&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lansche75&quot;&gt;[[#Lan94|Lansche 1994]]: 75&lt;/ref&gt; During the June 23 game against the Dodgers at [[Ebbets Field]], ''St. Louis Post-Dispatch'' sportswriter [[Bob Broeg]] heard Dodger fans chanting whenever Musial came to bat, but could not understand the words.&lt;ref name=Lansche75/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The 1946 St. Louis Cardinals Regular Season Game Log |url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1946/VSLN01946.htm |publisher=Retrosheet.org |accessdate=May 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that day over dinner, Broeg asked Cardinals traveling secretary Leo Ward if he had understood what the Dodger fans had been chanting.&lt;ref name=Lansche75/&gt; Ward said, &quot;Every time Stan came up they chanted, 'Here comes the man!'&quot; &quot;'That man,' you mean&quot;, Broeg said. &quot;No, ''the'' man&quot;, replied Ward.&lt;ref name=Lansche75/&gt; Broeg mentioned this story in his ''Post-Dispatch'' column, and Musial was thereafter known as Stan &quot;The Man&quot;.&lt;ref name=Lansche75/&gt;

In June 1946, Dyer began to use Musial as a [[first baseman]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mus64|Musial and Broeg 1964]]: 91–92&lt;/ref&gt; The Cardinals finished the season tied with the Dodgers,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lan94|Lansche 1994]]: 77&lt;/ref&gt; prompting a [[1946 National League tie-breaker series|three-game playoff]] for the pennant. Musial's Game&amp;nbsp;1 triple and Game&amp;nbsp;2 double contributed to the Cardinals' two-games-to-none series victory.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lan94|Lansche 1994]]: 78–79&lt;/ref&gt; Facing the [[Boston Red Sox]], the Cardinals won the [[1946 World Series]] four games to three,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sch90|Schoor 1990]]: 204&lt;/ref&gt; as Musial had six hits and four RBI.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sch90|Schoor 1990]]: 207, 405&lt;/ref&gt; He won his second MVP Award, receiving 22 out of a possible 24 first-place votes, finishing ahead of Brooklyn's [[Dixie Walker]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lan94|Lansche 1994]]: 84&lt;/ref&gt;

Musial began the [[1947 St. Louis Cardinals season|1947 season]] by hitting .146 in April.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lan94|Lansche 1994]]: 90&lt;/ref&gt; On May 9, team doctor Dr. Robert Hyland confirmed a previous diagnosis of [[appendicitis]], while discovering that Musial was concurrently suffering from [[tonsilitis]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lan94|Lansche 1994]]: 89&lt;/ref&gt; He received treatment, but did not have either his appendix or tonsils surgically removed until after the season ended.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lan94|Lansche 1994]]: 89, 93&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his health woes, he finished the year with a batting average of .312.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bro81|Broeg 1981]]: 116&lt;/ref&gt; 

Fully recovered from his ailments, Musial recorded his 1,000th career hit on April 25, [[1948 St. Louis Cardinals season|1948]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lan94|Lansche 1994]]: 93–94&lt;/ref&gt; After a May 7 ''[[St. Louis Globe-Democrat]]'' article criticized baseball players for appearing in [[Tobacco advertising|cigarette advertisements]], he made a personal decision to never again appear in such ads.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lan94|Lansche 1994]]: 94&lt;/ref&gt; By June 24, his batting average was .408, prompting Brooklyn pitcher [[Preacher Roe]] to comically announce his new method for retiring Musial: &quot;Walk him on four pitches and [[Pickoff|pick him off]] [[first base|first]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lan94|Lansche 1994]]: 95–96&lt;/ref&gt; Given a mid-season pay raise by new Cardinals owner [[Robert E.

Musial finished 1948 leading the major leagues in batting average (.376), hits (230), doubles (46), triples (18), total bases (429), and slugging percentage (.702).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gig167&quot;&gt;[[#Gig01|Giglio 2001]]: 167&lt;/ref&gt; Winning the NL batting title by a 43-point margin, with an on-base percentage lead of 27 points and a 138-point slugging margin—the latter being the largest gap since [[Rogers Hornsby]]'s 1925 season—Musial became the first player to win the NL MVP award for a third time.&lt;ref name=Gig167/&gt; If a home run he hit during a [[rainout (sports)|rained out]] game had been counted in his season totals, he would have won the [[Triple Crown (baseball)|Triple Crown]] by leading the NL in batting average, home runs, and runs batted in.&lt;ref name=Gig167/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bro81|Broeg 1981]]: 121&lt;/ref&gt;

Anticipating life after his baseball career, Musial began the first of several business partnerships with Julius &quot;Biggie&quot; Garagnani in January 1949, opening &quot;Stan Musial &amp; Biggie's&quot; restaurant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=That Man |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,933898-6,00.html |date=September 5, 1949 |publisher=''Time Inc.'' |accessdate=August 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lan94|Lansche 1994]]: 101&lt;/ref&gt; He approached the [[1949 St. Louis Cardinals season|1949 season]] with the intent to try to hit more home runs, stating he had hit 39 the previous season &quot;without trying&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gig174&quot;&gt;[[#Gig01|Giglio 2001]]: 174&lt;/ref&gt; His new focus on hitting for power backfired, as pitchers began using the outside part of the plate to induce him to ground out to the first or [[second base]]man.&lt;ref name=Gig174/&gt; Musial soon stopped focusing on hitting home runs and resumed his consistent offensive production by the end of May.&lt;ref name=Gig174/&gt; He earned his sixth consecutive All-Star Game selection, and led the NL in hits (207) while playing in every game.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gig01|Giglio 2001]]: 180&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Cardinals, with 96 wins, finished one game behind the Dodgers.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gig01|Giglio 2001]]: 179&lt;/ref&gt;

===1950–1954===
Musial began the 1950s by posting a .350 batting average before participating in the 1950 All-Star Game, where in fan balloting he was the NL's number two vote getter.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gig87&quot;&gt;[[#Gig01|Giglio 2001]]: 187&lt;/ref&gt; He had the longest hitting streak of his career during the [[1950 St. Louis Cardinals season|1950 season]]—a 30-game stretch that ended on July 27.&lt;ref name=Gig87/&gt; With the Cardinals falling 14 games out of first place by September, manager Dyer used him at first base and all three outfield positions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gig87&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lan94|Lansche 1994]]: 112–113&lt;/ref&gt; New Cardinals manager [[Marty Marion]] led the team to a third place finish in [[1951 St. Louis Cardinals season|1951]], while Musial was named ''[[The Sporting News]]'' Major League Player of the Year.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lan94|Lansche 1994]]: 116&lt;/ref&gt;

|quote=&quot;No man has ever been a perfect ballplayer. Stan Musial, however, is the closest to being perfect in the game today.... He plays as hard when his club is away out in front of a game as he does when they're just a run or two behind.&quot;

National media attention inadvertently turned to Musial a month before the [[1952 St. Louis Cardinals season|1952 season]] began, after [[Ty Cobb]] wrote an article regarding modern baseball players that was published in [[Life (magazine)|''Life'' magazine]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Lansche118&quot;&gt;[[#Lan94|Lansche 1994]]: 118&lt;/ref&gt; Cobb singled out Musial and [[Phil Rizzuto]] as the only players &quot;who can be mentioned in the same breath with the oldtime greats&quot;.&lt;ref name=Lansche118/&gt; Cobb went on to refer to Musial as &quot;a better player than [[Joe DiMaggio]] was in his prime.&quot;&lt;ref name=Lansche118/&gt; In response, Musial displayed his characteristic modesty, saying, &quot;Cobb is baseball's greatest. I don't want to contradict him, but I can't say that I was ever as good as Joe DiMaggio.&quot;&lt;ref name=Lansche118/&gt;

[[File:Stan Musial 1953.jpg|thumb|170px|Musial, as depicted on his 1953 Bowman baseball trading card.]]
The only major league pitching appearance of Musial's career occurred as a publicity stunt during the last Cardinals home game of the 1952 season.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gig231&quot;&gt;[[#Gig01|Giglio 2001]]: 231&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lan94|Lansche 1994]]: 119&lt;/ref&gt; Manager [[Eddie Stanky]] had a reluctant Musial pitch to [[Frank Baumholtz]], the runner-up to Musial for the best batting average in the NL that season.&lt;ref name=Gig231/&gt; With Baumholtz batting right-handed for the first time in his career, Musial's first pitch was hit so hard it ricocheted off the shin of third baseman [[Solly Hemus]] and into the left field corner.&lt;ref name=Gig231/&gt; The play was ruled an [[Error (baseball)|error]], and Musial was embarrassed enough by his complicity in the gimmick to avoid pitching again for the remainder of his career.&lt;ref name=Gig231/&gt;

The Cardinals franchise was up for sale in early [[1953 St. Louis Cardinals season|1953]], and Musial and Schoendienst advised their friend and fellow duck-hunter [[Gussie Busch]] to consider buying the team.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gig184&quot;&gt;[[#Gig01|Giglio 2001]]: 184&lt;/ref&gt; Busch used the resources of the [[Anheuser-Busch]] company to purchase the Cardinals, keeping Musial in St. Louis by averting the possibility of a move by the team to another city.&lt;ref name=Gig184/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lan94|Lansche 1994]]: 121&lt;/ref&gt; The 1953 season marked Musial's 10th All-Star selection, and the 12th consecutive time he finished a major league season with a batting average above .300.&lt;ref name=stats1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gig01|Giglio 2001]]: 194&lt;/ref&gt;    

Musial accomplished another historical feat on May 2, [[1954 St. Louis Cardinals season|1954]], in a doubleheader in St. Louis against the [[San Francisco Giants|New York Giants]]: he hit three home runs in the first contest, then added two more in the second to become the first major leaguer to hit five home runs in a doubleheader.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gig195&quot;&gt;[[#Gig01|Giglio 2001]]: 195&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to his five home runs, he also hit a single in the first game, setting a new record of 21 total bases for a doubleheader.&lt;ref name=Gig195/&gt; The only player besides Musial to hit five home runs in a doubleheader is [[Nate Colbert]], who achieved the feat in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lan94|Lansche 1994]]: 131&lt;/ref&gt;

===1955–1959===
Musial made his 12th All-Star appearance in [[1955 St. Louis Cardinals season|1955]] as a reserve, when Cincinnati's [[Ted Kluszewski]] outpolled him by 150,000 votes to win the start at first base.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lan94|Lansche 1994]]: 136&lt;/ref&gt; Musial entered the game as a pinch hitter in the fourth inning, and played left field as the game entered extra innings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lansche137&quot;&gt;[[#Lan94|Lansche 1994]]: 137&lt;/ref&gt; Leading off the bottom of the 12th, he hit a home run to give the NL a 6–5 victory.&lt;ref name=Lansche137/&gt; 

[[File:Stan Musial 1957.png|thumb|left|upright|Musial in 1957.]]
The [[1956 St. Louis Cardinals season|1956 season]] marked another milestone for Musial, when he broke [[Mel Ott]]'s NL record for extra-base hits on August 12.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mus64|Musial and Broeg 1964]]: 180&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier that season, Cardinals general manager [[Frank Lane|&quot;Trader Frank&quot; Lane]] began negotiations to trade him for Philadelphia pitcher [[Robin Roberts (baseball)|Robin Roberts]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lan94|Lansche 1994]]: 141–143&lt;/ref&gt; When Cardinals owner Gussie Busch learned of the possible move, he made it clear that Musial was not available for any trade.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lan94|Lansche 1994]]: 143&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, Lane dealt Musial's close friend Schoendienst to the New York Giants; an upset Musial made no immediate comment to the press.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lan94|Lansche 1994]]: 143–144&lt;/ref&gt; 

On June 11, [[1957 St. Louis Cardinals season|1957]], Musial tied the NL record for consecutive games played with his 822nd, a streak that began on the last day of the 1951 season.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lan94|Lansche 1994]]: 147–148&lt;/ref&gt; Despite [[ballot stuffing]] by Cincinnati Reds fans, he appeared in the All-Star Game, held at Sportsman's Park.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lan94|Lansche 1994]]: 149&lt;/ref&gt; When he overextended his swing while batting during a game on August 23, Musial fractured a bone in his left shoulder socket and tore muscles over his [[Clavicle|collarbone]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Lansche151&quot;&gt;[[#Lan94|Lansche 1994]]: 151&lt;/ref&gt; He was unable to play again until September 8, ending his [[MLB consecutive games played streaks|consecutive games-played streak]] at 895.&lt;ref name=Lansche151/&gt; He finished 1957 as ''[[Sports Illustrated]]''{{'}}s &quot;[[Sportsman of the Year]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1133593/index.htm |title=For 1957 The Editors of Sports Illustrated Choose Stan Musial |accessdate=December 13, 2009 |last=O'Neil |first=Paul |date=December 23, 1957 |publisher=''Sports Illustrated''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Musial signed one of the first $100,000 contracts in NL history on January 29, 1958. (According to Baseball Almanac, Hank Greenberg was the first with Pittsburgh in 1947.)&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lan94|Lansche 1994]]: 155&lt;/ref&gt; Approaching the 3,000-hit milestone in his major league career, he expressed a desire to record the hit in St. Louis.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lan94|Lansche 1994]]: 156–157&lt;/ref&gt; He ultimately reached the mark with a pinch-hit, sixth inning RBI double at Chicago's [[Wrigley Field]] on May 13.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Rei93|Reidenbaugh 1993]]: 214&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lan94|Lansche 1994]]: 157–158&lt;/ref&gt; The eighth major league player to reach 3,000 hits, and the first to reach the milestone with an extra-base hit, Musial was greeted at [[St. Louis Union Station]] that evening by roughly 1,000 fans.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lan94|Lansche 1994]]: 158–159&lt;/ref&gt; Finishing the season in sixth place, the Cardinals embarked on an exhibition tour of Japan, winning 14 of 16 games against top players from the [[Central League|Central]] and [[Pacific League|Pacific]] Japanese Leagues.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lan94|Lansche 1994]]: 162–163&lt;/ref&gt; 

Taking a new approach to preparation for the [[1959 St. Louis Cardinals season|1959 season]], Musial was given permission to report late to spring training so that he might conserve his energy for the duration of the year.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lan94|Lansche 1994]]: 165–166&lt;/ref&gt; Musial, {{convert|6|ft|m}} tall, had maintained a weight of around {{convert|175|lb|kg}} throughout his career.

Stan Musial was the batter in one of baseball history's weirdest plays. It took place during a game played on June 30, 1959, between the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] and [[Chicago Cubs]]. Musial was at the plate, with a count of 3–1. [[Bob Anderson (baseball)|Bob Anderson's]] next pitch was errant, evading catcher [[Sammy Taylor (baseball)|Sammy Taylor]] and rolling all the way to the backstop. Umpire [[Vic Delmore]] called ball four on the pitcher, however Anderson and Taylor contended that Musial [[foul tip]]ped the ball. Because the ball was still in play, and because Delmore was embroiled in an argument with the catcher and pitcher, Musial took it upon himself to try for second base. Seeing that Musial was trying for second, [[Alvin Dark]] ran to the backstop to retrieve the ball. The ball wound up in the hands of field announcer [[Pat Pieper]], but Dark ended up getting it back anyway. Absentmindedly, however, Delmore pulled out a new ball and gave it to Taylor. Anderson finally noticed that Musial was trying for second, took the new ball, and threw it to second baseman [[Tony Taylor]]. Anderson's throw flew over Tony Taylor's head into the outfield. Dark, at the same time that Anderson threw the new ball, threw the original ball to shortstop [[Ernie Banks]]. Musial, though, did not see Dark's throw and only noticed Anderson's ball fly over the second baseman's head, so he tried to go to third base. On his way there, he was tagged by Banks, and after a delay he was ruled out.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=tTtSAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=_3YDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4767,261477&amp;dq=bob+anderson+stan+musial&amp;hl=en Musial Is First in History Put Out By 2 Baseballs!]&lt;/ref&gt;

===1960–1963===
Based on his 1959 performance, Musial accepted a pay cut in [[1960 St. Louis Cardinals season|1960]] from his previous $100,000 salary to $80,000.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Vec11|Vecsey 2011]]: 230&lt;/ref&gt; Eager to prove his mediocre performance was the result of improper physical conditioning, he enlisted the help of Walter Eberhardt, [[St. Louis University]]'s director of physical education.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mus64|Musial and Broeg 1964]]: 211&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1960, newspaper articles began speculating that Musial would soon retire, yet he finished the season with a .275 batting average.&lt;ref name=stats1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lan94|Lansche 1994]]: 171&lt;/ref&gt; He addressed the speculation in September, confirming that he would play again in [[1961 St. Louis Cardinals season|1961]]. His .288 batting average that season reaffirmed his decision.&lt;ref name=stats1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lan94|Lansche 1994]]: 173&lt;/ref&gt; In 1962, Musial posted a .330 batting average, good for third in the batting race, with 19 homers and 82 RBI. As a pinch-hitter, he had 14 base hits in 19 at-bats (.615).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bro81|Broeg 1981]]: 167&lt;/ref&gt; Along the way, he established new NL career marks for hits, RBI, and runs scored. That same year, on July 8, the 41-year-old Musial became the oldest player ever to hit three home runs in one game.

In Musial's 3,026 major league appearances, he was never ejected from a game.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lansche 1994: 14&quot;&gt;[[#Lan94|Lansche 1994]]: 14&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking about his quiet reputation within the sport's history, sportscaster [[Bob Costas]] said, &quot;He didn't hit a homer in his last at-bat; he hit a single. He didn't hit in 56 straight games. He married his high school sweetheart and stayed married to her. ... All Musial represents is more than two decades of sustained excellence and complete decency as a human being.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;espnclassic&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Schwartz |first=Larry |title=Musial was gentleman killer |url=http://espn.go.com/classic/biography/s/Musial_Stan.html |year=2007 |publisher=ESPN.com |accessdate=November 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-playing career and family life==
Musial was named a vice president of the St. Louis Cardinals in September 1963, and he remained in that position until after the 1966 season.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lansche199&quot;&gt;[[#Lan94|Lansche 1994]]: 199&lt;/ref&gt; From February 1964 to January 1967, he also served as President [[Lyndon Johnson]]'s physical fitness adviser, a part-time position created to promote better fitness among American citizens.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gig01|Giglio 2001]]: 275–278&lt;/ref&gt; Before the 1967 season began, the Cardinals named Musial the team's [[General manager (baseball)|general manager]], and he oversaw the club's [[1967 St. Louis Cardinals season|World Series championship that year]].&lt;ref name=Lansche199/&gt; He won the allegiance of Cardinals players by making fair offers from the outset of player-contract negotiations and creating an in-stadium babysitting service so players' wives could attend games.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gig01|Giglio 2001]]: 285&lt;/ref&gt; His longtime business partner Biggie Garagnani died in June 1967, prompting Musial to devote more time to managing his restaurant and other business interests.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lansche200&quot;&gt;[[#Lan94|Lansche 1994]]: 199–200&lt;/ref&gt; He came to realize that the detail-oriented desk job was not his forte.  He consequently decided to step down as general manager, before even completing a full year on the job.&lt;ref name=Lansche200/&gt;

Musial is father to four children from his marriage to wife Lillian; the couple was married in [[St. Paul|St. Paul's]] Roman Catholic Church in [[Daytona Beach]] on May 25, 1940.  Their children were son Richard and daughters Gerry, Janet, and Jeanie.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lansche 1994: 14&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mus64|Musial and Broeg 1964]]: 229&lt;/ref&gt; He is noted for his harmonica playing, including his rendition of &quot;[[Take Me Out to the Ball Game]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://baseballhall.org/news/history/take-me-out-ball-game |title=Take Me Out to the Ball Game |accessdate=July 9, 2010 |last=Wiles |first=Tim |date=May 18, 2010 |publisher=National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the 1990s, he frequently played the harmonica at public gatherings, such as the annual Baseball Hall of Fame induction ceremony and various charity events.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gig299&quot;&gt;[[#Gig01|Giglio 2001]]: 298–299&lt;/ref&gt; He performed on the television show ''[[Hee Haw]]'' and in 1994 recorded 18 songs that were sold in tandem with a harmonica-playing instruction booklet.&lt;ref name=Gig299/&gt;

In early 1953 the [[Dapper Dan Charities]] in his hometown of [[Pittsburgh]] honored Musial as &quot;Sportsman of the Year&quot; for 1952.  

On August 4, 1968, a statue of Musial was erected outside of [[Busch Memorial Stadium]] on the northeast grounds of the St. Louis stadium.&lt;ref name=Lansche200/&gt; The statue was moved from its original location to the west side of the new [[Busch Stadium]] for its first season in 2006, where it became a popular meeting place for generations of Cardinals fans.&lt;ref&gt;[[#O'ne05|O'Neill 2005]]: 222&lt;/ref&gt; Musial's statue is inscribed with a quote attributed to former baseball commissioner [[Ford Frick]]: &quot;Here stands baseball's perfect warrior. Here stands baseball's perfect knight.&quot;&lt;ref name=Lansche200/&gt;

Musial was elected to the [[Baseball Hall of Fame]] in his first year of eligibility in 1969, named on 93.2&amp;nbsp;percent of the ballots.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lan94|Lansche 1994]]: 200–201&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, he was inducted into the [[St. Louis Walk of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stlouiswalkoffame.org/inductees/stan-musial.html |title=St. Louis Walk of Fame – Stan Musial |accessdate=December 13, 2009 |publisher=St. Louis Walk of Fame}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five years later, a baseball field was named after him in his hometown of Donora.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gig01|Giglio 2001]]: 306&lt;/ref&gt; He was ranked tenth on ''The Sporting News''{{'}} list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players published in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Smi98|Smith 1998]]: 28&lt;/ref&gt; He was also one of the 30 players selected to the [[Major League Baseball All-Century Team]], added by a special committee after he finished 11th in fan voting among outfielders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mlb.com/mlb/history/mlb_history_moreinfo.jsp?story=2 |title=The All-Century Team |accessdate=March 3, 2009 |year=1999 |publisher=MLB.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, he was inducted into the [[Hall of Famous Missourians]], and a bronze bust depicting him is on permanent display in the rotunda of the [[Missouri State Capitol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.house.mo.gov/famous.aspx?fm=30 |title=Hall of Famous Missourians |accessdate=November 24, 2009 |publisher=Missouri House of Representatives}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nearly two decades after Musial retired, baseball statistician [[Bill James]] and the [[sabermetrics]] movement began providing new ways of comparing players across baseball history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1720044-1,00.html |title=Q &amp; A: Baseball Guru Bill James |accessdate=July 9, 2010 |date=March 6, 2008 |publisher=Time Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, James ranked Musial the tenth-greatest baseball player in history, and the second-best left fielder of all time.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Jam01|James 2001]]: 358,653&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Baseball-Reference]].com, he ranks fifth all-time among hitters on the Black Ink Test, and third all-time on the Gray Ink Test—measures designed to compare players of different eras.&lt;ref name=stats1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Jam95|James 1995]]: 65–67&lt;/ref&gt; He ranks first on Baseball-Reference's Hall of Fame Monitor Test, and is tied for second in the Hall of Fame Career Standards Test.&lt;ref name=stats1/&gt; Despite his statistical accomplishments, he is sometimes referred to as the most underrated or overlooked athlete in modern American sports history.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stark07&quot;&gt;[[#Sta07|Stark 2007]]: 150&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://espn.go.com/page2/s/list/alltimeunderrated.html |title=The List: Underrated all-time athletes |accessdate=February 28, 2009 |last=Merron |first=Jeff |year=2007 |publisher=ESPN.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, in his analysis of baseball's under and overrated players in 2007, sportswriter Jason Stark said, &quot;I can't think of any all-time great in any sport who gets left out of more who's-the-greatest conversations than Stan Musial.&quot;&lt;ref name=Stark07/&gt;

Musial threw out the first pitch in Game 5 of the [[2006 World Series]] and delivered the [[ceremonial first pitch]] ball to President [[Barack Obama]] at the [[2009 Major League Baseball All-Star Game]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Leach |first= Matthew |url=http://stlouis.cardinals.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20090714&amp;content_id=5877144&amp;vkey=news_stl&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=stl |title=Musial part of special moment at Classic: Cards' great hands ball to Obama after entering field on cart |publisher=MLB.com |date=July 14, 2009 |accessdate=July 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A &quot;Stan the Man&quot; day was held in his honor by the Cardinals on May 18, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://stlouis.cardinals.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080518&amp;content_id=2725475&amp;vkey=news_stl&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=stl |title=Musial honored before Rays finale: Hall of Famer memorialized with statue at Busch Stadium |accessdate=February 25, 2009 |last=Hurwitz |first=Lee |date=May 18, 2008 |publisher=MLB.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the Cardinals launched a campaign to build support for awarding Musial the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] for his lifetime of achievement and service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://stlouis.cardinals.mlb.com/stl/fan_forum/standforstan_index.jsp |title=St. Louis Cardinals Stand for Stan |accessdate=May 30, 2009 |publisher=MLB Advanced Media}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign realized its goal, and on February 15, 2011, Musial was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Barack Obama.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2010/11/17/president-obama-names-presidential-medal-freedom-recipients |title=President Obama Names Presidential Medal of Freedom Recipient |author=Office of the Press Secretary |date=November 17, 2010 |publisher=The White House |accessdate=July 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://stlouis.cardinals.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20110214&amp;content_id=16635394&amp;vkey=news_stl&amp;c_id=stl |title=Musial receives high honor from President: 'A beloved pillar,' Obama says while awarding Medal of Freedom |first=Barry M. |last=Bloom |publisher=MLB.com |date=February 15, 2011 |accessdate=February 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
