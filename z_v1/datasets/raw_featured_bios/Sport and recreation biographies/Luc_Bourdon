'''Luc Bourdon''' (February 16, 1987 – May 29, 2008) was a [[Canada|Canadian]] professional [[Ice Hockey]] [[Defenceman]] who played for the [[Vancouver Canucks]] of the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) and their [[American Hockey League]] (AHL) affiliate, the [[Manitoba Moose]], from 2006 until 2008. After overcoming [[childhood arthritis]], he was selected third overall in the 2003 [[Quebec Major Junior Hockey League]] (QMJHL) draft and played for the [[Val-d'Or Foreurs]], [[Moncton Wildcats]], and [[Cape Breton Screaming Eagles]], spending four seasons in the QMJHL. The Canucks drafted Bourdon with their first selection, tenth overall, in the [[2005 NHL Entry Draft]]. Noted as a strong defenceman who could contribute on offence, Bourdon represented [[Canada national junior hockey team|Canada]] in three international tournaments, winning two gold medals at the [[IIHF World U20 Championship]] and a silver medal at the [[IIHF World U18 Championship]]. Bourdon died at the age of 21 near his hometown of [[Shippagan, New Brunswick|Shippagan]], [[New Brunswick]], when his motorcycle collided with a tractor trailer.

==Early life==
Born on February 16, 1987, Bourdon was an only child raised by his mother, Suzanne Boucher, in the small French-speaking community of [[Shippagan, New Brunswick|Shippagan]], [[New Brunswick]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Life&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Life and times of Bourdon|url=http://www.canada.com/theprovince/news/sports/story.html?id=7d0ede20-8ced-4a67-af98-50ddec616fcc|author=The Province|work=The Province|location=Vancouver|date=2008-05-30|accessdate=2008-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he was nine, he was diagnosed with [[juvenile arthritis]] and needed to use a wheelchair, which he later overcame.&lt;ref name=&quot;Life&quot;/&gt; As a teenager, he attended École Marie-Esther Secondary, where he was a straight-A student.&lt;ref name=&quot;Botchford&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Botchford|first=Jason|title=Not forgotten in hometown|url=http://www.canada.com/theprovince/news/sports/canucks/story.html?id=195e7305-5acf-4a2b-a237-d8cd8a82da3d|work=The Province|location=Vancouver|date=2008-05-30|accessdate=2008-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Growing up in a fishing town, he worked summers on his uncle's crab fishing boat.&lt;ref name=&quot;Life&quot;/&gt;

He played as a 13- and 14-year-old with the Peninsule Acadien Lynx, and with the Miramichi Rivermen from ages 15–16, both local [[Minor hockey#Canada|minor ice hockey]] teams.&lt;ref name=&quot;Life&quot;/&gt; After being the third overall choice in the 2003 QMJHL draft, Bourdon left home when he was 16, returning in the off-season to live with his mother.&lt;ref name=&quot;Life&quot;/&gt; Upon turning professional and signing his first contract, he anonymously donated [[Canadian dollar|C$]]10,000 to the local minor hockey association for families who could not afford equipment. His donation was posthumously revealed by his former bantam hockey coach, Gilles Cormier, who managed the local arena at the time of Bourdon's death.&lt;ref name=&quot;Botchford&quot;/&gt;

Bourdon joined the [[Val-d'Or Foreurs]] for the [[2003–04 QMJHL season|2003–04 season]], registering eight points in 64 regular season games and scoring one goal in seven playoff games.

He finished the [[2006–07 QMJHL season]] with 20 points in 36 games. When the Canucks did not qualify for the playoffs, they sent Bourdon to play five games for the [[Manitoba Moose]], who were in the middle of the AHL playoffs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Luc of the draw|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Hockey/NHL/Vancouver/2007/11/06/4634885-sun.html|publisher=CANOE|author=Mackin, Bob|accessdate=2008-07-19|date=2007-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was held pointless through five AHL playoff games. Including his participation in the [[2007 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships|2007 World Junior Championships]], Bourdon played for five different teams throughout the 2006–07 season.

Initially failing to make the Canucks starting roster out of training camp, Bourdon began the [[2007–08 NHL season|2007–08 season]] with the Manitoba Moose; however, because of a series of injuries among the Canucks' defencemen throughout the season, Bourdon was called up on several occasions.

He appeared in 27 games for the Canucks over the season, scoring two goals, as well as scoring 14 points during 41 games with the Moose.

As a young and promising defenceman, Bourdon was regularly mentioned in rumours of trades for more offence at the forward positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Capital calamity for Leafs|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Hockey/NHL/Toronto/2008/01/25/4793379-sun.html|publisher=CANOE|last=Hornby|first=Lance|accessdate=2008-07-19|date=2008-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Consider Bourdon&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Canucks to consider Bourdon|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Hockey/NHL/Vancouver/2006/11/06/2253473-sun.html|publisher=CANOE|last=Wiebe|first=Ken|accessdate=2008-11-14|date=2006-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most significantly, he was speculated to be part of a package in exchange for [[Tampa Bay Lightning]] forward [[Brad Richards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Canucks were unwilling to mortgage|url=http://www.sportingnews.com/yourturn/viewtopic.php?t=362557|author=Canadian Press|publisher=Sporting News|accessdate=2008-07-19|date=2008-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Bourdon had a powerful shot, he did not play defence responsibly enough to earn a regular spot on the roster.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Bourdon puts worries behind him|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Hockey/NHL/Vancouver/2007/11/09/4643065-sun.html|publisher=CANOE|author=Sportak, Randy|accessdate=2008-07-19|date=2007-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began to show signs of improvement and maturity as the Canucks used him more in the 2007–08 season.&lt;ref name=willes/&gt;
