[[Neil Harvey]] was a member of [[Donald Bradman]]'s famous [[Australian cricket team in England in 1948|Australian cricket team, which toured England in 1948]] and was undefeated in their 34 matches. This unprecedented feat by a Test side touring England earned them the sobriquet ''The Invincibles''.  

Aged 19, Harvey was the youngest player of the touring party. An attacking left-handed [[batting order (cricket)|middle-order batsman]], he had become the youngest Australian to score a Test [[century (cricket)|century]] by compiling 153 in the Fifth Test against [[India national cricket team|India]] in the preceding Australian summer of 1947&amp;ndash;48. However, Harvey struggled early on in the tour, having difficulty adapting to English conditions. After being omitted from the first-choice team in the first half of the tour, Harvey's performances improved with his increasing familiarity with local conditions and he was called into the team for the Fourth Test at [[Headingley Stadium|Headingley]] after an injury to [[Sid Barnes]]. Harvey scored 112 in a first innings counter-attack to keep Australia in contention after they had suffered a top-order collapse. Harvey hit the winning [[boundary (cricket)|boundary]] in the second innings as Australia won the match with a Test world record  successful run-chase of 3/404. He retained his place for the Fifth Test, ending the series with 133 runs at a [[batting average]] of 66.50. 

Overall, Harvey ended with 1,129 runs at 53.76 in the [[first-class cricket|first-class matches]] with four centuries, placing him sixth on the run-scoring aggregates and seventh in the batting averages for Australia. Harvey was an acrobatic fielder, regarded as the best in the Australian team. He was [[List of cricket terms#T|twelfth man]] in the Tests before he broke into the playing XI, and took several acclaimed catches throughout the tour. He took 17 catches for the tour and claimed a solitary [[wicket]] with his occasional [[off spin]].

== Background ==
A diminutive left-handed middle-order batsman, Harvey made his debut in [[first-class cricket]] in the 1946&amp;ndash;47 Australian season for his state [[Victorian Bushrangers|Victoria]]. The following year, at the age of 19, Harvey made his debut in the Fourth Test against [[Indian cricket team|India]] in Australia in 1947&amp;ndash;48 after a series of impressive performances at domestic level. In the Fifth Test at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]], he hit 153 to break [[Archie Jackson]]'s record for the youngest Australian to make a Test century.&lt;ref name=az/&gt; The innings ensured him a place on the 1948 ''Invincibles'' tour of England as the youngest member of the 17-man squad. He was more than six and a half years younger than the next youngest players of the team, [[Arthur Morris]] and [[Bill Johnston (cricketer)|Bill Johnston]].&lt;ref&gt;Cashman, pp. 118, 153, 174, 176, 215&amp;ndash;216.&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking about Harvey's selection, his captain and one of three selectors [[Donald Bradman]] opined &quot;He has the brilliance and daring of youth, and the likelihood of rapid improvement&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;p101&quot;/&gt;

== Early tour ==

Australia traditionally fielded its first-choice team in the tour opener, which was customarily against [[Worcestershire County Cricket Club|Worcestershire]].&lt;ref name=haigh&gt;{{cite news| title=Gentrifying the game| first=Gideon | last=Haigh| authorlink=Gideon Haigh| url=http://www.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/295893.html |publisher=[[Cricinfo]] |date=2007-05-26| accessdate=2007-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite scoring a century in Australiaâ€™s most recent Test, Harvey was made [[List of cricket terms#T|12th man]] and it appeared that he was not initially in Bradman's Test plans.

To make matters worse, [[Sam Loxton]] was injured and could not bat, so Australia were effectively six wickets down and faced their first loss to an English county since 1912.&lt;ref name=f55&gt;Fingleton, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; Harvey had scored a solitary run when he hit a ball to [[Len Hutton]] at [[Fielding (cricket)#Fielding position names and locations|short leg]], who dived forwards and grabbed it with both hands before dropping it.

The Australians travelled to London to play [[Surrey County Cricket Club|Surrey]] at [[The Oval]]. Harvey scored seven and struggled in contrast to the rest of the Australians, who prospered to total 632, laying the foundation for an innings victory. Harvey took three catches in the match,&lt;ref name=surrey&gt;{{cite web

It was a chance to gain a psychological advantage, and given Harvey's early struggles in English conditions and his failure to pass 25 in his first six innings,&lt;ref name=p101/&gt; he was overlooked as Australia amassed 552 and won by an innings.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;&lt;ref name=sched/&gt;  

After asking Bradman about the reason for his difficulties with the bat, Harvey was told that these were caused by rash shot selection and a tendency to hit the ball in the air. Bradman said &quot;He was technically perfect in his shot production. He was batting well enough and simply getting out early.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;p101&quot;/&gt; Harvey adapted his style and improved his performance.

Harvey had one last chance to make his case for Test selection in the match at [[Hove]] against [[Sussex County Cricket Club|Sussex]]. It was the final county fixture before the First Test at [[Trent Bridge]]. He came to the crease at 3/360 and put on stands of 93 and 97 with [[Ray Lindwall]] and Hamence respectively to finish unbeaten on 100 in only 115 minutes.

Up to this point, the reserve opener Brown had scored 800 runs on tour at an average of 72.72, with a double century, three other centuries and 81 not out,&lt;ref name=o/&gt; and was on his third tour of England.&lt;ref name=times&gt;{{cite web| title=Bill Brown: Accomplished batsman who scored handsomely for Australia before and after the war &amp;#124; |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article3570490.ece | first=Derek |last=Hodgson |date=2008-03-18 |accessdate=2008-06-24 |work = [[The Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, Harvey had totalled only 296 runs at 42.29 despite his unbeaten 100 against Sussex.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;

Despite his omission, Harvey spent a large amount of the Test substituting as [[List of cricket terms#T|twelfth man]] for paceman [[Ray Lindwall]], who succumbed to a hamstring injury in the first innings. Lindwall was nevertheless able to jog between the wickets when Australia batted, without needing a [[runner (cricket)|runner]], but he did not take the field in the second innings.

{{main|Fourth Test, 1948 Ashes series}} 

During the drawn Third Test, Barnes was injured and [[Ian Johnson (cricketer)|Ian Johnson]] was used as a makeshift opener because Morris was the only specialist opener left in the team after the omission of Brown.&lt;ref name=&quot;report3&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title= Third Test Match England v Australia |work= [[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack]] |year=1949  |url=http://www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/152896.html |accessdate=2008-07-02 |publisher=[[Wisden]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=report4/&gt; In the meantime, Barnes's injury had opened up a vacancy for the Fourth Test. Harvey managed only ten and Brown only eight as Australia defeated [[Middlesex County Cricket Club|Middlesex]] by ten wickets in their only county match between Tests.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;&lt;ref name=sched/&gt;&lt;ref name=middle&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate = 2008-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Despite his low score in the preceding match against Middlesex, Harvey was called into the team for the Fourth Test at [[Headingley Stadium|Headingley]] at the expense of Barnes.&lt;ref name=&quot;p101&quot;&gt;Perry (2002), p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt; The selectors had overlooked Brown as a replacement for Barnes's opening position. Instead, vice-captain Hassett would move from the middle-order to accompany Morris at the top of the innings, while Harvey would slot into the middle-order.&lt;ref name=sco3/&gt;&lt;ref name=sco4/&gt; 

England batted first and amassed 496. Australia began their reply on the second afternoon and Bradman and Hassett saw the tourists [[List of cricket terms#S|to stumps]] at 1/63.&lt;ref name=&quot;sco4&quot;/&gt; The next morning, Hassett and Bradman fell in one [[Dick Pollard]] over to leave Australia at 3/68 with two new batsmen at the crease.&lt;ref name=report4/&gt; Harvey came in bareheaded at No. 5 to join cavalier [[all rounder]] [[Keith Miller]]. Australia were more than 400 behind and if England were to remove the pair, they would expose Australia's lower order and give themselves an opportunity to take a large first innings lead. Upon arriving in the middle, Harvey told his senior partner &quot;What's going on out here, eh? Let's get stuck into 'em&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;p245&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 245.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=f161&gt;Fingleton, p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt; Harvey got off the mark by forcing the ball [[Fielding (cricket)#Fielding position names and locations|behind point]] for a single.&lt;ref&gt;Fingleton, pp. 161&amp;ndash;162.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The pair launched a counterattack, with Miller taking the lead. He hoisted [[off spin]]ner [[Jim Laker]]'s first ball over [[Fielding (cricket)#Fielding position names and locations|square leg]] for six. Miller shielded Harvey from Laker, as the young batsman was struggling against the [[off break]]s that were turning away from him, especially one ball that spun and bounced, beating his outside edge.&lt;ref name=f162&gt;Fingleton, p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt; Miller drilled an [[Batting (cricket)#Drive|off-drive]] from Laker for four, and then hit another flat over his head, almost for six into the sightscreen.&lt;ref name=f162/&gt; This allowed Australia to seize the initiative, and Harvey joined the fightback during the next [[over (cricket)|over]], hitting consecutive boundaries against Laker, the second of which almost cleared the playing area. He then took another boundary to reach 44, with Miller on 42.&lt;ref name=f163&gt;Fingleton, p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; Miller then lifted Laker for a six over long off, and a four over long on from Yardley to reach 54. Miller [[Batting (cricket)#Drive|drove]] the next ball [[Fielding (cricket)#Fielding position names and locations|through cover]] for four. Yardley responded by stacking the [[leg side|on side]] with outfielders and [[leg theory|bowling outside leg stump]], challenging Miller to another hit for six. The batsman obliged, but edged the ball and was caught at [[Fielding (cricket)#Fielding position names and locations|short fine leg]] for 58.&lt;ref name=f163/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p246&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 246.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arlott, pp. 108&amp;ndash;109.&lt;/ref&gt; The partnership yielded 121 runs in 90 minutes, and was likened by ''[[Wisden]]'' to a &quot;hurricane&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;wisden&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title= Wisden 1954 &amp;mdash; Neil Harvey|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/australia/content/story/154608.html| publisher=[[Wisden]] |year=1954|accessdate=2007-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fingleton said that he had never &quot;known a more enjoyable hour&quot; of &quot;delectable cricket&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Fingleton, pp. 162&amp;ndash;163.&lt;/ref&gt; O'Reilly said that Miller and Harvey had counter-attacked with &quot;such joyful abandon that it would have been difficult, if not absolutely impossible, to gather from their methods of going about it that they were actually retrieving a tremendously difficult situation&quot;.&lt;ref name=o124&gt;O'Reilly, p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; Arlott said that &quot;two of the greatest innings of all Test cricket were being played&quot; during the partnership.&lt;ref name=a108&gt;Arlott, p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt; 

&lt;!-- [[Image:Harvey and Loxton.jpg|thumb|Harvey and Loxton departing Australia in 1948. Their partnership helped to turn the Fourth Test.|300px]] --&gt;At 4/189 Loxton came in to join Harvey,&lt;ref name=sco4/&gt; who continued to attack the bowling, unperturbed by Miller's demise. [[Ken Cranston]] came on to bowl and Harvey [[Batting (cricket)#Types of batting shots|square drove and then hooked]] to [[Fielding (cricket)#Fielding position names and locations|deep square leg]] for consecutive boundaries. Yardley then moved a man from fine leg to where the hook had gone; Harvey responded by [[Batting (cricket)#Leg glance|glancing a ball]] to the fielderâ€™s former position, collecting three more runs. Australia thus went to lunch at 4/204, with Harvey on 70.&lt;ref name=f164&gt;Fingleton, p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt; 

After lunch, Australia scored slowly as Loxton struggled. Yardley took the [[cricket ball|new ball]] in an attempt to trouble the batsmen with livelier bowling, but instead, Loxton began to settle in. He lofted Pollard to the leg side, almost for six, and then hit three boundaries off another over. Harvey accelerated as well, and 80 minutes into the middle session, reached his century to a loud reception as Australia passed 250. Harveyâ€™s knock had taken 177 minutes and included 14 fours.&lt;ref name=f165&gt;Fingleton, p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt; Loxton then dominated the scoring and brought up his 50 with a six.&lt;ref name=f165/&gt; The partnership yielded 105 in only 95 minutes. Harvey was eventually out for 112 from 183 balls, bowled by Laker while playing a cross-batted sweep. His shot selection prompted Bradman to throw his head back in disappointment.&lt;ref name=f166&gt;Fingleton, p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, it was an innings noted for powerful driving on both sides of the wicket and the high rate of scoring helped to swing the match back from England's firm control.&lt;ref name=&quot;az&quot;&gt;Cashman, pp. 117&amp;ndash;119.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;report4&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;wisden&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p247&quot;&gt;Perry (2005), p. 247.&lt;/ref&gt; Harvey fell at 5/294,&lt;ref name=&quot;sco4&quot;/&gt; and Australia slumped to 8/355 before a counterattack by [[Ray Lindwall]] saw them to 458, restricting England's lead to 38.&lt;ref name=&quot;sco4&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;report4&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title= Fourth Test Match England v Australia |work= [[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack]] |year=1949  |url=http://www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/152897.html |accessdate=2008-07-02 |publisher=[[Wisden]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pol14&quot;&gt;Pollard (1990), p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;  O'Reilly said that Harvey's innings was one of &quot;no inhibitions&quot; and that it was &quot;completely unspoiled by any preconceived plan to eliminate any particular shot&quot;.&lt;ref name=o124/&gt; He added that it was &quot;the very mirror of truth in the batting art&quot;,&lt;ref name=o125/&gt; &quot;delightfully untrammeled by the scourage of good advice or any other handicapping influence&quot;,&lt;ref name=o125/&gt; and that Harvey's innings was the most pleasing he had seen since [[Stan McCabe]]'s 232 at [[Trent Bridge]] in 1938.&lt;ref name=o125&gt;O'Reilly, p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt;

England then progressed to 0/129 in their second innings before Harvey intervened. On 65, [[Cyril Washbrook]] attempted a [[Batting (cricket)#Pull and hook|hook]] from [[Bill Johnston (cricketer)|Bill Johnston]]. Connecting with the middle of the bat, he imparted much power on the ball, which flew flat and never went more than six metres above the ground,&lt;ref name=o134/&gt; but Harvey quickly ran across the ground and bent over to catch the ball at ankle height while still on the run. [[Jack Fingleton]] said that it &quot;was the catch of the season&amp;mdash;or, indeed, would have been had Harvey not turned on several magnificent aerial performances down at [[The Oval]] [against Surrey]&quot;.&lt;ref name=f170&gt;Fingleton, p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt; Oâ€™Reilly doubted &quot;whether any other player on either side could have made the distance to get to the ball, let alone make a neat catch of it&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Oâ€™Reilly, pp. 133&amp;ndash;134.&lt;/ref&gt; He added that the &quot;hook was a beauty and the catch was a classic&quot;.&lt;ref name=o134&gt;O'Reilly, p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the day, captain Yardley was caught by a leaping Harvey while attempting a lofted shot from Johnston.&lt;ref name=f172&gt;Fingleton, p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt; 

After five minutes on the final morning, Yardley [[Declaration and forfeiture|declared]] at 8/365.&lt;ref name=&quot;report4&quot;/&gt; Batting into the final day allowed Yardley to ask the groundsman to use a [[road roller|heavy roller]], which would help to break up the wicket, thereby causing more uneven bounce and making the surface more likely to spin.&lt;ref name=&quot;report4&quot;/&gt; The declaration left Australia to chase 404 runs for victory. At the time, this would have been the highest ever fourth innings score to result in a Test victory for the batting side. Australia had only 345 minutes to reach the target, and the local press wrote them off, predicting that they would be dismissed by lunchtime on a deteriorating wicket expected to favour the spin bowlers.&lt;ref name=&quot;b ashes&quot;&gt;Perry (2001), pp. 84&amp;ndash;89.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Morris partnered Bradman in a stand of 301 in 217 minutes to set up the win, although they were helped by Englandâ€™s fielders, who missed several catching and stumping chances.&lt;ref name=report4/&gt; Harvey came to the crease at 3/396 and got off the mark by hitting the winning boundary.&lt;ref&gt;Perry (2002), pp. 101&amp;ndash;102.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Immediately after the Headingley Test, Harvey made 32 in a fleet-footed cameo attack against the local spinners as Australia amassed 456 and defeated [[Derbyshire County Cricket Club|Derbyshire]] by an innings.&lt;ref name=sched/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Australia's biggest challenge in the post-Test tour matches was against the Leveson-Gower's XI.
