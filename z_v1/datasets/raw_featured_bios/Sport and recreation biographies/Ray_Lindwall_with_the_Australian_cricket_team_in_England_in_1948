[[Ray Lindwall]] was a key member of [[Donald Bradman]]'s famous [[Australian cricket team in England in 1948|Australian cricket team, which toured England in 1948]]. The Australians went undefeated in their 34 matches; this unprecedented feat by a Test side touring England earned them the sobriquet ''The Invincibles''.

Lindwall played as a right-arm [[fast bowling|opening fast bowler]] and right-handed batsman in the [[batting order (cricket)|lower middle-order]]. Along with [[Keith Miller]], Lindwall formed Australia's first-choice pace duo, regarded as one of the best of all time, and Bradman typically used them in short and sharp bursts against the home batsmen with the [[cricket ball|new ball]]. The pair were used to target England's leading batsmen, [[Len Hutton]] and [[Denis Compton]] during the major matches, and subdued Hutton for much of the summer. England had agreed to make a new ball available after every 55 [[over (cricket)|overs]], more often than the usual regulations at the time, thereby allowing the pair more frequent use of a shiny ball that [[swing bowling|swung]] at high pace. Bradman gave the duo lighter workloads in the tour matches in order to preserve their energy for the new ball battles against England’s key batsmen in the Tests. Lindwall was a capable lower-order batsman who made two Test centuries during his career, and he featured in several rearguard actions that boosted Australia's scores during the tour. 

Lindwall was the equal leading wicket-taker in the Tests (27 along with [[Bill Johnston (cricketer)|Bill Johnston]]) and had the best [[bowling average]] (19.62) and [[strike rate]]. In the [[first-class cricket|first-class matches]], he led the averages although he was second in the wicket-taking list with 86 at 15.68 behind Johnston (102), who was assigned more of the workload in order to keep Miller and Lindwall fresh for the Tests. With the bat, Lindwall scored 191 runs at a [[batting average]] of 31.83 in the Tests.

Lindwall's most influential contributions in [[the Ashes]] matches were his 5/70 in the first innings of the Second Test at [[Lord's]], a hard-hitting 77 that limited Australia's first innings deficit in the Fourth Test at [[Headingley Stadium|Headingley]], and most notably, his 6/20 on the first day of the Fifth Test at [[The Oval]]. The performance was a display of extreme pace and swing that earned high praise from pundits and was largely responsible for England being bowled out for 52. Outside the Tests, Lindwall took 11/59 in a match against [[Sussex County Cricket Club|Sussex]], with eight of his victims being [[bowled]] as the ball curved through their defences at high pace. In recognition of his achievements, Lindwall was chosen as one of the five [[Wisden Cricketers of the Year]]. ''[[Wisden]]'' said that &quot;by whatever standard he is judged&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;[Lindwall] must be placed permanently in the gallery of great fast bowlers&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;wisden&quot;/&gt;

== Background ==
A bowler of express pace, Lindwall was a regular member of the Test team and had opened Australia’s attack since the resumption of cricket following [[World War II]]. During the Australian summer of 1946–47, Lindwall played in all five Tests against the touring [[Indian cricket team]]. He played a major part in Australia's 4–0 series win as the leading wicket-taker with 18 scalps at an average of 16.88, ahead of [[Ian Johnson (cricketer)|Ian Johnson]] and [[Bill Johnston (cricketer)|Bill Johnston]] who took 16 apiece at averages of 16.31 and 11.37 respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Test Bowling for Australia India in Australia 1947/48|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Events/AUS/India_in_Australia_1947-48/t_Australia_Bowling.html |accessdate=2008-12-22 |publisher=[[CricketArchive]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Lindwall was selected as part of [[Don Bradman]]'s ''Invincibles'' that toured England without defeat in 1948, with the intention of leading the pace attack. There were two concerns for Lindwall in the lead-up to the tour. Lindwall had been playing with an injured leg tendon and his foot drag during the delivery stride led to discussion in the media and among umpires as to its [[no ball|legality]].&lt;ref name=&quot;wisden&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Cricketer of the Year – 1949| url=http://www.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/154627.html | year=1949 |publisher=[[Cricinfo]] |accessdate=2007-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p222&quot;/&gt;

Bradman arranged for Lindwall to see his Melbourne masseur Ern Saunders, who restored the paceman’s leg to prime condition in a fortnight. On the public relations front, Bradman stated his firm belief in the fairness of Lindwall's delivery. During the lengthy sea voyage to England, Bradman emphasized the importance of caution with respect to his bowling action.&lt;ref name=p222/&gt; Bradman advised Lindwall to ensure that his dragging rear right foot was further behind the [[crease (cricket)|line]] than usual to avoid being no-balled, and to refrain from bowling at full speed until the umpires were satisfied with his delivery stride. The Australian captain guaranteed Lindwall selection for the Tests and told him that his first priority in the lead-in tour matches was passing the umpires' scrutiny.&lt;ref name=&quot;p222&quot;&gt;Perry (2001), p. 222.&lt;/ref&gt; Bradman recalled how paceman [[Ernie McCormick]] had been no-balled 35 times in the traditional tour opener against [[Worcestershire County Cricket Club|Worcester]] during the [[Australian cricket team in England in 1938|1938 campaign]], destroying his confidence for the rest of the season.&lt;ref name=p222/&gt;

== Early tour ==

In the lead-up to the match against Worcestershire, photographers and cameramen constantly followed Lindwall, trying to capture visual evidence of an illegal drag when he was bowling in the [[cricket nets|practice nets]].&lt;ref name=f42&gt;Fingleton, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; Bradman tried to stop the  journalists from taking photographs of the crease as Lindwall came in to bowl, and deflected media questions about his bowler's drag.&lt;ref&gt;Perry (2008), pp. 24, 26.&lt;/ref&gt; The spectators and media were keenly observing the position of his foot in the tour opener,&lt;ref&gt;Perry (2008), pp. 233&amp;ndash;234.&lt;/ref&gt; but Lindwall was not no-balled in the first match at Worcester, and complaints about his drag faded away for the rest of the tour.&lt;ref name=&quot;p222&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fingleton, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; The hosts elected to bat first, and Lindwall took 2/41 in the first innings, bowling and trapping his victims [[leg before wicket]] before delivering three wicketless [[over (cricket)|overs]] for 19 runs in the second innings. Lindwall took a wicket with his second ball in England, trapping [[Don Kenyon]] for a [[duck (cricket)|duck]] to leave the hosts at 1/0.&lt;ref name=worcs/&gt; He was promoted to No. 4 as Bradman rotated his [[batting order (cricket)|batting order]] and he scored a quickfire 32 from 34 balls with six [[four (cricket)|boundaries]] before Australia completed an innings victory.&lt;ref name=worcs&gt;{{cite web

Bradman rested Lindwall for the second tour match against [[Leicestershire County Cricket Club|Leicestershire]], which ended in an innings victory for the Australians.&lt;ref name=sched&gt;{{cite web|title=Matches, Australia tour of England, Apr–September 1948 |url=http://www.cricinfo.com/invincibles/engine/series/61329.html |publisher=[[Cricinfo]] |accessdate=2008-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=o&gt;{{cite web

He made a duck in the first innings on a [[sticky wicket|damp pitch]] favourable to slower bowling, as Australia scraped home by four wickets. Lindwall was due in next when Australia collapsed to 6/31 in pursuit of 60 for victory in the second innings. The tourists were effectively seven wickets down with the injured [[Sam Loxton]] unable to bat, but [[Neil Harvey]] and [[Don Tallon]] saw Australia to the target without further loss.

They batted first and Lindwall managed only four, clean bowled by [[Alec Bedser]],&lt;ref&gt;Fingleton, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; as Australia amassed 632. He then took the first two wickets to reduce Surrey to 2/15 in the first innings.

Lindwall had another light workout in the match against [[Cambridge University Cricket Club|Cambridge University]], taking match figures of 1/33 from nine overs. His solitary wicket was that of [[Doug Insole]], and he was not required to bat as Australia completed another innings victory.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; After the fixture against Cambridge, Lindwall was rested for two consecutive matches. In the first, Australia crushed [[Essex County Cricket Club|Essex]] by an innings and 451 runs, its largest winning margin for the summer.

Lindwall was brought back for the match against the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] (MCC) at [[Lord's]].

Only ten of his balls were scored from and not a single run was taken from his last 30 balls. Fingleton said that Lindwall &quot;absolutely paralysed&quot; the batsmen, with some of his bowling &quot;in the real [[Harold Larwood|Larwood]] manner&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Fingleton, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; Harold Larwood was a Nottinghamshire express pace bowler of the 1920s and 1930s who led the controversial [[Bodyline]] attack in Australia in 1932&amp;ndash;33, and Lindwall modelled his bowling action on Larwood after seeing him in action at the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]] during the tour.&lt;ref&gt;Perry (2001), p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt; Lindwall could only manage eight runs with the bat and was unable to repeat his incisive bowling in the second innings, sending down 14 wicketless overs as the match ended in a draw.&lt;ref name=notts/&gt;

Lindwall was rested for Australia’s eight-wicket win over [[Hampshire County Cricket Club|Hampshire]],&lt;ref name=sched/&gt;&lt;ref name=o/&gt; before returning in the following match against [[Sussex County Cricket Club|Sussex]].

Five of Lindwall's opponents were bowled as he ended with 6/34 from 19.4 overs; the hosts were dismissed for 86. During the tourists' reply, Bradman promoted Lindwall to No. 4 and he came to the wicket at 2/342, scored 57 and put on 93 runs with [[Neil Harvey]], who scored an unbeaten 100 as Australia [[declaration and forfeiture|declared]] at 5/549.&lt;ref name=sussex&gt;{{cite web

Lindwall lined up for the First Test at Trent Bridge, a venue where he had taken six wickets in the tour game against Nottinghamshire. Australia bowled first, and Lindwall delivered the first ball of the match at a moderate pace; Hutton pushed it square of the wicket on the off side for a single to start proceedings.&lt;ref name=a30&gt;Arlott, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;  Lindwall gradually increased his speed and rhythm,&lt;ref name=a30/&gt; and took the wicket of [[Cyril Washbrook]], caught on the run by [[Bill Brown (cricketer)|Bill Brown]] on the [[Cricket fielding positions|fine leg boundary]] after the batsman had attempted a [[Pull shot|hook shot]].&lt;ref name=&quot;sco1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;report1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=f84&gt;Fingleton, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; However, he was forced to leave the field with a groin strain midway through the first day, ending with figures of 1/30.&lt;ref name=&quot;pol9&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;testlist&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stats.cricinfo.com/guru?sdb=player;playerid=737;class=testplayer;filter=basic;team=0;opposition=0;notopposition=0;season=0;homeaway=0;continent=0;country=0;notcountry=0;groundid=0;startdefault=1934-06-08;start=1934-06-08;enddefault=1948-06-29;end=1948-06-29;tourneyid=0;finals=0;daynight=0;toss=0;scheduledovers=0;scheduleddays=0;innings=0;result=0;followon=0;seriesresult=0;captain=0;keeper=0;dnp=0;recent=;viewtype=aro_list;runslow=;runshigh=;batposition=0;dismissal=0;bowposition=0;ballslow=;ballshigh=;bpof=0;overslow=;overshigh=;conclow=;conchigh=;wicketslow=;wicketshigh=;dismissalslow=;dismissalshigh=;caughtlow=;caughthigh=;caughttype=0;stumpedlow=;stumpedhigh=;csearch=;submit=1;.cgifields=viewtype| accessdate=2007-12-10| title=Statsguru – RR Lindwall – Tests – Innings by innings list |publisher=[[Cricinfo]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; After England were out for 165, Lindwall came out to bat at 7/365 without a [[runner (cricket)|runner]] on the third day,&lt;ref name=sco1/&gt; and appeared to be able to run twos and threes without significant difficulty.&lt;ref name=o42&gt;O'Reilly, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; He added 107 runs for the eighth wicket with vice-captain [[Lindsay Hassett]]. Hassett reached his century and proceeded to 137 in almost six hours of batting before Bedser struck his off stump.

Although Lindwall was able to jog between the wickets, he did not take the field in the second innings and the [[List of cricket terms#T|12th man]] [[Neil Harvey]] replaced him. This gave Australia a marked fielding advantage—Fingleton described Harvey as &quot;by far the most brilliant fieldsman of both sides&quot;.&lt;ref name=f96&gt;Fingleton, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; Yardley was sceptical as to whether Lindwall was sufficiently injured to be forced from the field, but he did not formally object to Harvey’s presence on the field.&lt;ref name=f96/&gt; Journalist, former Australian Test cricketer and Lindwall mentor [[Bill O'Reilly (cricketer)|Bill O'Reilly]], said that as Lindwall demonstrated his mobility during his innings, he was in no way &quot;incapacitated&quot; and that the English captain &quot;must be condemned for carrying his concepts of sportsmanship too far&quot; when no substitute was justified.&lt;ref name=o42/&gt; O'Reilly decried the benefit Australia derived through the substitution, agreeing with Fingleton that Harvey was the tourists' best fielder by far.&lt;ref name=o42/&gt; English commentator [[John Arlott]] went further, calling Harvey the best fielder in the world.&lt;ref name=a41&gt;Arlott, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the gains provided by Harvey were outweighed by Lindwall's absence, which severely hampered Australia's bowling and made their eventual victory much more difficult.&lt;ref&gt;Fingleton, pp. 97, 100&amp;ndash;106.&lt;/ref&gt; England made 441 and Australia reached their target of 98 on the final afternoon to complete an eight-wicket victory.&lt;ref name=&quot;p222&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;sco1&quot;/&gt; Due to his injury, Lindwall was omitted from the team for the two matches leading up to the Second Test.

He came in late on the first afternoon with the score at 7/246 and made three runs before stumps were called at 7/258.&lt;ref name=sco2/&gt; The next morning, Lindwall batted confidently from the outset. He hit two cover drives for four from Bedser after the new ball had been taken, prompting O'Reilly to say that Lindwall was playing in the same manner as when he made his maiden Test century in the last Ashes series in 1946&amp;ndash;47. However, he then played around a straight ball from Bedser, and was bowled for 15 to leave the score at 275/8.&lt;ref name=sco2/&gt;&lt;ref name=o67&gt;O'Reilly, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; Australia were out for 350 shortly before lunch on the second morning. In the hosts' reply, Lindwall took the new ball and felt pain in his groin after delivering the first ball of the innings to [[Len Hutton]].&lt;ref name=&quot;p223&quot;&gt;Perry (2001), p. 223.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, the paceman persevered through the pain.&lt;ref name=p223/&gt;

In his fourth over, Lindwall had Washbrook caught behind for eight after needlessly playing at a ball wide outside off stump.&lt;ref name=&quot;p223&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=o69&gt;O'Reilly, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; Before lunch, Lindwall bowled six overs and took 1/7, while [[Bill Johnston (cricketer)|Bill Johnston]] accompanied him from the other end because [[Keith Miller]] had a back injury and was only able to bat.&lt;ref name=sco2/&gt;&lt;ref name=f111/&gt; Neither Hutton nor Washbrook appeared comfortable against the bowling, and the new batsman [[Bill Edrich]] tried to hit Lindwall through the off side, leading to a loud appeal for caught behind, which was turned down.&lt;ref name=o69/&gt; After the lunch break, Hutton fell, and Compton came in, having being dismissed [[hit wicket]] after falling over in the First Test while trying to avoid a [[bouncer (cricket)|bouncer]]. Lindwall delivered a few short balls straight away, but the new batsman was not caught off-guard.&lt;ref name=o70&gt;O'Reilly, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; Lindwall then clean bowled [[Bill Edrich]]—who was playing across the line of the ball—for five. [[Tom Dollery]] was the new batsman and stopped the first ball with his pads before Lindwall’s next delivery broke through his defences and hit the stumps to send him back to the pavilion for a duck.&lt;ref name=&quot;p223&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=f111/&gt;&lt;ref name=o70/&gt; Dollery's bat was about to start its downward swing by the time Lindwall's outswinger had passed him and hit the stumps.&lt;ref name=o70/&gt; O'Reilly said that Dollery's inability to deal with Lindwall was typical of English cricket's lack of answers to express pace bowling.&lt;ref name=o70/&gt; This was part of a six-over post-lunch spell of 2/11 by Lindwall; the batsmen appeared unable to deal with his swing and extreme pace. England were 4/46 and Australia firmly in control, but the home side were given some respite when both Lindwall and Johnston were taken out of the attack.&lt;ref name=f111&gt;Fingleton, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; Australia had the option of taking the new ball just before the tea break, but Bradman decided to wait so his two pacemen could have an extra 20 minutes to replenish their energy levels.&lt;ref name=o71&gt;O'Reilly, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

Once the second new ball was taken after tea, Lindwall returned but appeared to be tired and lacking in spirit in his first over.&lt;ref name=o71/&gt; Johnston removed Compton, and one run later, Lindwall clipped Yardley's off stump with the first ball of the next over to leave England at 134/6; the home skipper had made 44 before an outswinger had evaded his bat as he attempted to play a back foot defensive shot.&lt;ref name=o71/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;report2&quot;/&gt; At the start of the third morning, he bowled [[Alec Bedser]] off an inside edge from a [[bouncer (cricket)|bouncer]] to finish with 5/70 as Australia took a 135-run first innings lead on the third morning.&lt;ref name=sco2/&gt;&lt;ref name=f112&gt;Fingleton, p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; O'Reilly said Lindwall &quot;bowled as well as any fast bowler can bowl. He always seemed to have the situation sized up correctly and he knew just when to put his all into the task&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;and enjoyed a triumph which seldom comes to any bowler.&quot;&lt;ref name=o72&gt;O'Reilly, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; Arlott praised Lindwall for his subtle variations in pace, line and length, and how he kept the batsman guessing as to what was coming to them.&lt;ref name=a63&gt;Arlott, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bradman’s batsmen set about building on their lead and Lindwall was initially not expected to bat; the Australian captain was expected to declare just before lunch on the fourth day so he could attack the English openers for a short period before the adjournment, but a shower deterred him from doing so, as his bowlers would have struggled to grip the ball. Lindwall had also been injured on a slippery surface in earlier times.&lt;ref name=o76&gt;O'Reilly, p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; Lindwall came to the crease to join Miller with Australia at 5/416 on the fourth afternoon.&lt;ref name=sco2/&gt; They attacked at every opportunity before the declaration. Miller fell and Lindwall ran out of his crease in attempt to hit Laker across the line to the boundary. He missed and was stumped for 25. This prompted Bradman to declare at 7/460 immediately upon his dismissal, leaving England to chase a world record 596 for victory.&lt;ref name=sco2/&gt;&lt;ref name=f121/&gt;

Further showers breathed extra life into the pitch at the start of the run chase, and Lindwall and Johnston extracted steep bounce with the new ball, troubling the English batsmen. Lindwall dropped Hutton from Johnston's bowling before he had scored and the English batsmen played and missed multiple times.&lt;ref name=&quot;report2&quot;/&gt; Hutton had trouble seeing and playing Lindwall’s deliveries in the deteriorating light with no [[List of cricket terms#S|sightscreen]] available, and Fingleton described it as &quot;probably Hutton's worst effort in a Test&quot;.&lt;ref name=f121&gt;Fingleton, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; O'Reilly said Hutton &quot;seemed to have lost all power of concentration and looked like a man being led to the gallows&quot;,&lt;ref name=o77/&gt; calling him &quot;little more than a masquerader compared to the Hutton [of 1938]&quot;.&lt;ref name=o77&gt;O'Reilly, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; Hutton took 32 minutes of batting to score his first run of the innings.&lt;ref name=a70&gt;Arlott, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hutton and Washbrook took the score to 42—England's highest opening partnership of the series thus far&lt;ref name=sco1/&gt;&lt;ref name=sco2/&gt;—before the latter edged Lindwall to Johnson [[Cricket fielding positions|in the slips]] and was out for 13.&lt;ref name=&quot;sco2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;report2&quot;/&gt; Edrich and Washbrook were then subjected to repeated [[bouncer (cricket)|short balls]], and the latter was hit several times on the fingers while fending down Lindwall's bouncers, having decided to avoid the hook shot.&lt;ref name=o77/&gt; However, they survived Lindwall's spell of bowling. Late in the day, Lindwall was brought back to put pressure on Dollery, having bowled him for a duck in the first innings, but the batsman had already been in the middle for a short period, and played the pace bowling with more assurance.&lt;ref name=o72/&gt;

Lindwall returned on the final morning with the score at 6/141. Dollery, who had been batting with assurance,&lt;ref name=o79&gt;O'Reilly, p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; shaped to duck under a Lindwall bouncer, but it skidded through low and bowled him. Later in the same over, Lindwall bowled Laker for a duck to leave England at 8/141. The match ended when [[Doug Wright (cricketer)|Doug Wright]] hit [[Ernie Toshack]] to Lindwall and was caught for four.&lt;ref name=&quot;sco2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=report2&gt;{{cite web|title= Second Test Match England v Australia |work= [[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack]] |year=1949  |url=http://www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/152895.html |publisher=[[Wisden]] |accessdate=2008-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lindwall ended with 3/61 as Australia took a 409-run victory.&lt;ref name=&quot;sco2&quot;/&gt; Arlott said that while Toshack (5/40) had the best figures, Lindwall was the pivotal figure. He said that when Lindwall &quot;so patently disturbed Hutton he struck a blow at the morale of the English batting that was never overcome.&quot;&lt;ref name=a75&gt;Arlott, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; In later years, Bradman told Lindwall he pretended not to notice the bowler's pain. Lindwall was worried Bradman had noticed his injury and would be disappointed, but the Australian captain later claimed to have feigned ignorance to allow Lindwall to relax and focus on his bowling.&lt;ref name=&quot;p223&quot;/&gt;

After carrying an injury into the Second Test, Bradman rested Lindwall for the match against Surrey, which started the day after the proceedings at Lord’s ended; Australia took a ten-wicket victory.&lt;ref name=sched/&gt;&lt;ref name=o/&gt; Lindwall returned for the match against [[Gloucestershire County Cricket Club|Gloucestershire]]. Australia batted first and made 7/774, its highest score of the tour and the second highest by any Australian team in England.&lt;ref name=sched/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lindwall was not able to partake in the prolific run-getting, as the tourists declared before he had scored. He bowled a total of 21 overs, taking 0/41 as Australia enforced the follow on and won by an innings and 363 runs.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;

== Third Test ==
{{main|Third Test, 1948 Ashes series}}
When the teams reconvened at [[Old Trafford (cricket ground)|Old Trafford]] for the Third Test, Hutton had been dropped, sparking much acrimony and controversy in the English cricket community. The reason was said to be Hutton's difficulties against Lindwall's short-pitched bowling.&lt;ref name=&quot;p224&quot;&gt;Perry (2001), p. 224.&lt;/ref&gt; Observers noticed Hutton backing away, and the English selectors believed such a sight would have a negative effect on the rest of the side as it was a poor example from a key player.&lt;ref name=gibson&gt;{{cite book |last = Gibson |first = Alan |title = The Cricket Captains of England |publisher = Cassell |year = 1979 |location= London |isbn = 0-304-29779-8 | page=189}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bowes190&gt;Bowes, p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt; The Australians were pleased and believed the England selectors had erred, because they regarded Hutton as the hosts' best batsman.&lt;ref name=p224/&gt; England batted first and Lindwall removed Hutton’s replacement as opener, [[George Emmett]], who fended a short ball to [[Sid Barnes]] at [[Cricket fielding positions|short leg]] to leave England at 2/28. Emmett had been surprised by Lindwall's [[bouncer (cricket)|bouncer]] and took his eyes from the ball, fending with one hand on the bat, while ducking his head below his arms.&lt;ref name=f131&gt;Fingleton, p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=o88&gt;O'Reilly, p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; The ball bounced slowly off the pitch and after hitting Emmett’s bat, rebounded gently up in the air for Barnes to collect. In Australia’s match against Gloucestershire immediately preceding the Test, Lindwall bowled a bouncer to Emmett, who hesitantly parried it away for a single. Lindwall did not bounce Emmett again during the match,&lt;ref name=o88/&gt; and O’Reilly surmised that the paceman was quietly waiting until the Tests to expose his opponent’s weakness against the short ball.&lt;ref name=o88/&gt; O’Reilly concluded that Lindwall and Johnston &quot;had again disposed of the English opening batsmen with the minimum amount of effort&quot;.&lt;ref name=o89&gt;O'Reilly, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lindwall then struck Edrich on the hand with a short ball, provoking angry heckling from spectators who compared him to Larwood. During this period, both Edrich and Compton found it difficult to position themselves quickly enough to play Lindwall.&lt;ref name=f132&gt;Fingleton, p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; The Australian paceman then hit Compton on the arm, and soon after, felled him with a [[bouncer (cricket)|bouncer]] that the batsman top-edged into his face.&lt;ref name=&quot;sco3&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p224&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=report3&gt;{{cite web|title= Third Test Match England v Australia |work= [[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack]] |year=1949  |url=http://www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/152896.html |accessdate=2008-07-02 |publisher=[[Wisden]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This forced Compton to leave the field with a bloodied eyebrow with the score at 2/33.&lt;ref&gt;Pollard, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Upon hearing the umpire’s call of no ball while the ball was travelling towards him, and knowing he was immune from dismissal, Compton decided to change his stroke. Having initially positioned himself to deflect the ball into the leg side, he then attempted to hook the ball, but could not readjust quickly enough. The velocity of the ball was such that after rebounding from his head, it flew more than half-way to the boundary before landing.&lt;ref name=o89/&gt; This was followed by a period of slow play as England tried to regroup.&lt;ref name=o90&gt;O'Reilly, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=o91&gt;O'Reilly, p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lindwall returned to take the second new ball and trapped [[Jack Crapp]], who did not offer a shot, for 37 to leave the score at 3/87.&lt;ref name=sco3/&gt;&lt;ref name=f132/&gt; The batsman misjudged the line of a straight ball and thought it had pitched and struck his leg outside off stump.&lt;ref name=o92&gt;O'Reilly, p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; Lindwall later had Edrich [[List of cricket terms#G|gloving]] a rearing ball to the wicket-keeper to leave England at 5/119.&lt;ref name=report3/&gt; Compton returned upon the fall of the fifth wicket to revive the innings and Lindwall ended with 4/99 after having [[Godfrey Evans]] caught behind from an expansive [[Batting (cricket)#Cut|cut shot]]. England ended on 363 all out on the second day; Compton made an unbeaten 145.&lt;ref name=sco3/&gt;&lt;ref name=report3/&gt; Lindwall had beaten Compton in each of his last three overs before lunch on the second day, but the Englishman survived to add more than 20 further runs.&lt;ref name=f135&gt;Fingleton, p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt; On the third day, Lindwall came to the crease at 6/172 after Barnes&amp;mdash;who had collapsed due to the aftereffects of being hit in the ribs from point blank range when fielding&amp;mdash;had been forced to retire hurt. Australia faced the prospect of being forced to follow on,&lt;ref name=&quot;sco3&quot;/&gt; and Lindwall received five consecutive bouncers from Edrich, one of which hit him in the hand, evoking cheers from the home crowd.&lt;ref name=&quot;p224&quot;/&gt; Lindwall made 23 as Australia struggled to 221 and avoided the follow on by eight runs; he was the last man to be dismissed.&lt;ref name=sco3/&gt;

At the start of England's second innings, Washbrook took a single from Lindwall, who promptly removed Emmett for a duck. Lindwall pitched an [[outswinger]] on the line of off stump and Emmett edged it to wicket-keeper Tallon, who dived and took it in his right hand.&lt;ref name=sco3/&gt;&lt;ref name=f141&gt;Fingleton, p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt; This brought Lindwall’s tormentor Edrich to the crease. Bradman advised Lindwall not to bounce Edrich, fearing this would be interpreted as retaliation and generate negative media attention.&lt;ref name=p224/&gt; However, Miller retaliated with four consecutive bouncers, angering the crowd.&lt;ref name=&quot;p243&quot;&gt;Perry (2005), p. 243.&lt;/ref&gt; He struck Edrich on the body before Bradman and ordered him to stop;&lt;ref name=&quot;p244&quot;&gt;Perry (2005), p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt; the Australian captain apologised to Edrich for the hostile bowling.&lt;ref name=f143&gt;Fingleton, p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt; Lindwall bounced Washbrook and was [[no ball]]ed by umpire [[Dai Davies (cricketer)|Dai Davies]] for dragging his foot beyond the line. After a disagreement, Davies threw Lindwall his jumper, but the tension faded away and the paceman was not no balled again after discussing the matter with Bradman.&lt;ref&gt;Fingleton, pp. 141–142.&lt;/ref&gt; Lindwall bounced Washbrook again and this time the England opener went for the hook shot. The ball flew off the top edge in the air, straight towards Hassett at [[Cricket fielding positions|fine leg]], who dropped the catch after juggling three times. Having received a reprieve on 21, Washbrook settled down and reached 50 in only 70 minutes with England at 1/80.&lt;ref name=f142/&gt;

Lindwall returned for a new spell late on the third day and almost hit Washbrook in the head.&lt;ref name=f142&gt;Fingleton, p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt; Hassett again dropped Washbrook, who was on 78 when he again hooked Lindwall to long leg. The Australian vice-captain responded by borrowing a helmet from a nearby policeman to signify his need for protection from the ball, much to the amusement of the crowd.&lt;ref name=&quot;report3&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=f144&gt;Fingleton, p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt; Lindwall ended with 1/37 as England declared at their stumps score of 3/174 after the entire fourth day and the final morning was washed out. The match petered into a draw with Lindwall not required as Australia safely batted out the final day.&lt;ref name=&quot;sco3&quot;/&gt; Lindwall played in Australia's only match&amp;mdash;against [[Middlesex County Cricket Club|Middlesex]]&amp;mdash;before the Fourth Test, but was not at his best. He and Miller had  been partying heavily in the days before the match, and were out and binge drinking on the night before the match; they did not return until after dawn, when they were caught severely inebriated by Bradman at breakfast time. Miller was rested for the match, but Lindwall was selected for the match.&lt;ref&gt;Perry (2008), pp. 176&amp;ndash;177.&lt;/ref&gt; The home team won the toss and elected to bat, so Lindwall could not rest and sober up in the dressing room while the specialist batsmen were at work. He was asked to bowl a lengthy spell in warm and sunny conditions on the opening morning, and was at times lying on the ground in an attempt to recover during stoppages. Nevertheless, he ended with 1/28 from 16 overs, the opposition still unable to score heavily despite his obvious lethargy.&lt;ref&gt;Perry (2008), pp. 177&amp;ndash;179.&lt;/ref&gt; He took a total of 3/59 from 25 overs and scored one as the tourists won by an innings,&lt;ref name=sched/&gt;&lt;ref name=o/&gt; removing the home team's captain [[George Mann (cricketer)|George Mann]] twice and Edrich once.&lt;ref name=&quot;middlesex&quot;&gt;{{cite web

He bowled a bouncer at opener [[Jack Robertson]], who tried to hook, but missed, suffered a fractured jaw and was forced to retire hurt, prompting angry shouting and booing from sections of the crowd. Robertson defended Lindwall, contending that the delivery was fair and that he had executed his shot incorrectly.&lt;ref&gt;Perry (2008), pp. 179&amp;ndash;180.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fourth Test ==
{{main|Fourth Test, 1948 Ashes series}}
Hutton returned for the Fourth Test at [[Headingley Stadium#Headingley Carnegie Cricket Ground|Headingley]] and played effectively. At one stage he and Washbrook took five boundaries from six Lindwall overs.&lt;ref name=a99&gt;Arlott, p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; An opening partnership of 168 resulted until Lindwall bowled him for 81. The English opener went onto the front foot and was clean bowled, much to the dismay of the home crowd.&lt;ref name=f153&gt;Fingleton, p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; The stand came after Washbrook had decided to refrain from hooking Lindwall's bouncers, which had caused him problems in the earlier Tests.&lt;ref name=report4&gt;{{cite web|title= Fourth Test Match England v Australia |work= [[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack]] |year=1949  |url=http://www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/152897.html |accessdate=2008-07-02 |publisher=[[Wisden]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; England did not lose their second wicket until the last over of the day, when Washbrook hit Johnston into Lindwall’s hands for 143, leaving the total at 2/268.&lt;ref name=sco4/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;report4&quot;/&gt; Both Fingleton and O'Reilly criticised the bowling group as a whole for what they deemed a very lethargic display; the former deemed it the worst day's performance since World War II and the latter accused all the Australian bowlers of operating &quot;without object&quot;.&lt;ref name=f154&gt;Fingleton, p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=o114&gt;O’Reilly, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the innings, Lindwall [[appeal (cricket)|appeal]]ed for lbw four times while wicket-keeper [[Ron Saggers]]—standing in for the injured Tallon—remained silent, not supporting the appeal.&lt;ref name=f157&gt;Fingleton, p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt; England ran up a large score of 496 but squandered a very strong position after losing their last 8 wickets for 73 runs; Lindwall had Compton caught down the leg side to give Saggers his first Test catch, leaving England at 6/473.&lt;ref name=&quot;sco4&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=f158/&gt; Lindwall ended with 2/79 from 38 overs.&lt;ref name=&quot;sco4&quot;/&gt; Fingleton said &quot;this grand fast bowler held the side together splendidly and answered every call&quot;.&lt;ref name=f158&gt;Fingleton, p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt; O’Reilly said that until England collapsed&amp;mdash;mostly due to unforced errors despite favourable conditions&lt;ref name=o121&gt;O’Reilly, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;mdash;only Lindwall appeared capable of threatening the batsmen.&lt;ref name=o117/&gt; He said the paceman &quot;kept slogging away, tirelessly retaining his pace and enthusiasm long after the other members of the attack had lost all signs of hostility&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;Bradman could not afford to spare him from doing much more than his share of the galley-slave work.&quot;&lt;ref name=o117&gt;O’Reilly, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; O’Reilly decried Lindwall’s workload as excessive and potentially harmful to his longevity.&lt;ref name=o118&gt;O’Reilly, p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

In reply, Australia was still some way behind when Lindwall came in at 6/329 on the third afternoon. With the fall of [[Sam Loxton]] and Saggers in quick succession, Bradman’s men were at 8/355 with only Johnston and Toshack remaining.&lt;ref name=sco4/&gt; Lindwall hit out, scoring 77 in an innings marked by powerful driving and pulling;&lt;ref name=&quot;pol14&quot;&gt;Pollard, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; he dominated in stands of 48 and 55 with Johnston and Toshack respectively.&lt;ref name=sco4/&gt; He particularly liked to use his feet to get to the ball on the half-volley to hit lofted drives.&lt;ref name=o132&gt;O’Reilly, p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; Of the 103 runs added for the last two wickets, the two tail-enders managed only 25 between them.&lt;ref name=&quot;sco4&quot;/&gt; Johnston accompanied Lindwall for 80 minutes, before the injured Toshack survived the last 50 minutes until stumps with Johnston [[runner (cricket)|running]] for him. Australia were 9/457 at stumps, with Lindwall on 76 and Toshack on 12.&lt;ref name=sco4/&gt;&lt;ref name=f167&gt;Fingleton, p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt; During Lindwall’s partnership with Johnston, Yardley bowled himself for over an hour, failing to bring on a frontline bowler in his stead despite being unable to dislodge the batsmen.&lt;ref name=o128&gt;O’Reilly, p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt; Lindwall farmed the strike by trying to hit boundaries and twos during the over, but Yardley did not resort to the tactic of setting a deep field to yield a single to Lindwall to get the tailenders on strike.&lt;ref name=o128/&gt; Despite Toshack and Johnston’s lack of familiarity with having and acting as a runner respectively, and the resulting disorders in running between the wickets, Lindwall was able to manipulate the strike and face most of the balls.&lt;ref name=o131&gt;O’Reilly, p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt; O’Reilly speculated that Yardley may have bowled himself in an attempt to contain the Australians rather than dismiss them before the close of play, so his openers would not have to bat for a short period before stumps when the visitors' attack could have made inroads. However, Yardley was neither able to contain Lindwall nor dismiss the Australians.&lt;ref&gt;O'Reilly, pp. 131&amp;ndash;132.&lt;/ref&gt; Sunday was a rest day, and on Monday,&lt;ref name=f168&gt;Fingleton, p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt; the fourth morning, Lindwall was the last man out in the third over of the day, leaving Australia on 458, 38 runs in arrears on the first innings.&lt;ref name=&quot;sco4&quot;/&gt; Lindwall edged Bedser into the slips cordon and Crapp took the catch low down in his left hand.&lt;ref name=f168/&gt;

England made a strong start in their second innings—the openers registered their second century stand for the match. When Australia took the second new ball, Lindwall&amp;mdash;worried by the substantial and hazardous craters in the pitch he and the other bowlers had created while following through on the left-hand side of the crease&lt;ref name=o134&gt;O'Reilly, p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;mdash;changed to bowling from [[List of cricket terms#A|around the wicket]] and was warned for running on the pitch. He reverted to bowling from over the wicket, although he delivered from the edge of the crease to avoid the holes.&lt;ref name=o134/&gt;&lt;ref name=f171&gt;Fingleton, p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt; O’Reilly said the warning to Lindwall played into Australia’s hands as the bowler’s follow through from around the wicket was accentuating a rough patch outside the right-hander’s off stump that the English bowlers target when Bradman’s men had to chase the target.&lt;ref name=o135&gt;O’Reilly, p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt; England reached 2/232 before Lindwall trapped Edrich to end a 103-run partnership. The paceman followed this by bowling [[Jack Crapp]], who inside edged an attempted forcing stroke through the off side from the back foot onto his own stumps.&lt;ref name=a114&gt;Arlott, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; This triggered a collapse of 4/33 from 3/260 to 7/293. Lindwall took 2/84 as the hosts declared on the final day at 8/365,&lt;ref name=sco4/&gt; leaving Australia to chase a world Test record of 404 for victory, with only 345 minutes available. Centuries to Bradman and Morris in a 301-run stand saw Australia seal the series 3–0 with a record-breaking seven-wicket win with 15 minutes in hand.&lt;ref name=&quot;sco4&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=report4/&gt;

The paceman was rested for the match against [[Derbyshire County Cricket Club|Derbyshire]] immediately after the Headingley Test, which Australia won by an innings.&lt;ref name=sched/&gt;&lt;ref name=o/&gt; Lindwall returned for the match against [[Glamorgan County Cricket Club|Glamorgan]] and took 2/36 in a rain-affected draw that did not reach the second innings.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; In the next match against [[Warwickshire County Cricket Club|Warwickshire]], he claimed 3/27 in the first innings, taking three consecutive middle-order wickets—including Test batsmen [[Tom Dollery]] and [[Abdul Hafeez Kardar]]—in the space of 12 balls as the hosts fell for 138.&lt;ref name=warwick/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Perry (2008), p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt; In reply, Australia stumbled to 6/161 when Lindwall joined Hassett. The pair put on 70 for the seventh wicket, the largest partnership in a low-scoring match. Lindwall ended with 45, the second highest score for the entire match, as Australia took a 116-run lead. He took the first wicket and ended with 1/32 as Bradman’s men won by nine wickets.&lt;ref name=warwick&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate = 2008-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Australia proceeded to face Lancashire at Old Trafford for the second time during the season in a match that doubled as Washbrook's [[benefit (sports)|benefit]]. Lindwall made 17 in the tourists’ first innings of 321 and then dismissed the home side's first three batsmen, taking 3/32 as Lancashire fell for 130. Washbrook top-scored with 38 before Lindwall had him caught in the slips by Miller. He also collected several painful bruises from Lindwall on his right hand and thumb. Bradman described his leading paceman as being in &quot;stupendous form ... I have not seen before or since such sustained brilliance from a pace bowler&quot;.&lt;ref name=lancs/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Perry (2008), pp. 217&amp;ndash;218.&lt;/ref&gt; Australia made 3/265 declared in their second innings, leaving the hosts with a target of 457 in less than a day, with Washbrook unable to bat due to Lindwall's bruising bowling. Lindwall bowled both openers with the new ball, but Lancashire appeared to be safely batting out a draw at 5/191 with only eight minutes remaining. Lindwall returned after Bradman took the new ball, and told the slip cordon to move halfway back to the boundary. Bowling with a tailwind, Lindwall was at full pace, in one of the fastest displays Bradman had seen in his long career. He bowled [[Jack Ikin]] for 99 and [[Dick Pollard]]&amp;mdash;who later claimed to have not seen the ball&amp;mdash;for a golden duck. The hosts were in danger of suffering a late collapse and defeat, but [[William Roberts (cricketer)|William Roberts]] successfully defended the hat-trick ball; Lancashire lost no further wickets and were 7/191 when stumps were drawn; Lindwall ended with 4/27. He also caused Washbrook to miss the final Test with a thumb injury.&lt;ref name=lancs2&gt;{{cite web

== Fifth Test ==
{{main|Fifth Test, 1948 Ashes series}}
According to Bradman, Fingleton and O'Reilly, Lindwall's performance in the final Test at [[The Oval]] was one of the best they had ever seen from any player.&lt;ref name=p225/&gt;&lt;ref name=f186/&gt;&lt;ref name=o150&gt;O'Reilly, p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt; English skipper Yardley won the toss and elected to bat on a rain-affected pitch, surprising most observers.&lt;ref&gt;Fingleton, pp. 180–184.&lt;/ref&gt; The damp conditions necessitated the addition of large amounts of sawdust to allow the players to keep their grip. Along with the rain, humidity assisted the bowlers, particularly Lindwall, who managed to make the ball bounce at variable heights.&lt;ref name=&quot;report5&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title= Fifth Test Match England v Australia |work= [[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack]] |year=1949  |url=http://www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/152898.html |accessdate=2008-07-02 |publisher=[[Wisden]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Miller had taken an early wicket, Lindwall bounced Compton, resulting in an edge towards the slips cordon. However, the ball continued to rise and cleared the ring of Australian fielders. Hutton called Compton through for a run, but his surprised partner was watching the ball and dropped his bat in panic. Luckily for Compton, the ball went to Hassett at [[Cricket fielding positions|third man]], who stopped the ball and waited for the batsman to regather his bat and his composure before returning the ball, thereby forfeiting the opportunity to effect a run out.&lt;ref name=&quot;f185&quot;&gt;Fingleton, p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this gesture of sportsmanship cost Australia little, because when Compton was on three, Lindwall bowled another bouncer. Compton attempted a hook shot and [[Arthur Morris]] ran from his position at [[Cricket fielding positions|short square leg]] to take a difficult catch, leaving the hosts at 3/17.&lt;ref name=&quot;p225&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;f185&quot;/&gt; Fingleton described Morris's feat as &quot;one of the catches of the season&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;sco5&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;f185&quot;/&gt;

After the lunch break, England struggled to 4/35, before Lindwall bowled Yardley with a swinging [[yorker]].&lt;ref name=&quot;p225&quot;/&gt; The debutant [[Allan Watkins]] then batted for 16 balls in an attempt to get off the mark with a series of failed hook shots. He missed an attempted hook shot and was hit in the shoulder by another Lindwall bouncer. Soon after, Watkins was dismissed without scoring after playing across the line and being trapped lbw by Johnston, leaving England at 6/42.&lt;ref name=&quot;sco5&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;f186&quot;&gt;Fingleton, p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt; Watkins also collected a bruise on his right shoulder for his troubles with Lindwall; this inhibited his bowling later in the match.&lt;ref name=&quot;report5&quot;/&gt; Following the departure of Watkins, Lindwall removed [[Godfrey Evans]], [[Alec Bedser]] and Young, all yorked in the space of two runs.&lt;ref name=&quot;sco5&quot;/&gt; England fell from 6/45 to 9/47, bringing Hollies in at No. 11 to accompany Hutton, who had batted through the innings. Hutton then hit the only boundary of the innings, lofting a [[Drive (cricket)|straight drive]] back over Lindwall's head. The ball almost went for six, landing just short of the fence.&lt;ref name=&quot;f186&quot;/&gt; The home team’s innings ended on 52 when Hutton—who never appeared to be troubled by the bowling—[[Batting (cricket)#Leg glance|leg glanced]] Lindwall and was caught by wicket-keeper [[Don Tallon]] one-handed, at full stretch to his left. Lindwall described the catch as one of the best he had ever seen.&lt;ref name=&quot;p225&quot;/&gt; In his post-lunch spell, Lindwall bowled a spell of 8.1 overs during which he took 5/8;&lt;ref name=&quot;report5&quot;/&gt; he totalled 6/20 in 16.1 overs.&lt;ref name=&quot;sco5&quot;/&gt; Bradman described the spell as &quot;the most devastating and one of the fastest I ever saw in Test cricket&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;p225&quot;&gt;Perry (2001), p. 225.&lt;/ref&gt; Fingleton, who played against the ''[[Bodyline]]'' attack in 1932–33, said &quot;I was watching a man almost the equal of Larwood [the ''Bodyline'' spearhead] in pace&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;Truly a great bowler&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;f186&quot;/&gt; O'Reilly said that Lindwall's &quot;magnificent performance must go down as one of the greatest bowling efforts in Anglo-Australian Tests. He had two gruelingly long sessions in the innings and overcame each so well that he set the seal on his well-earned reputation as one of the best bowlers ever.&quot;&lt;ref name=o150/&gt;

In Australia's reply, Lindwall came in at 6/304 and attacked immediately, scoring two fours before falling for nine. He played a cover drive from the bowling of Young, but hit the ball too early and thus launched it into the air, and it was caught by Edrich at cover point to leave the score at 7/332.&lt;ref name=sco5/&gt;&lt;ref name=a130&gt;Arlott, p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt; The visitors ended on 389 and England started their second innings late on the second day. Debutant [[John Dewes]] took strike and got off the mark when he aimed a hook shot and was credited with a boundary when the ball came off his shoulder. Lindwall’s steepling bouncer had risen over his bat and narrowly missed his head.&lt;ref name=o154&gt;O'Reilly, p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt; Lindwall made the early breakthrough soon after, bowling Dewes—who offered no shot&lt;ref name=&quot;f188&quot;&gt;Fingleton, p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt;—for 10 to leave England at 1/20.&lt;ref name=&quot;sco5&quot;/&gt; Dewes often committed to playing the ball from the front foot before the bowler delivered the ball, thereby putting himself into difficulty.&lt;ref name=&quot;f199&quot;&gt;Fingleton, p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early on the third day, Lindwall bowled Edrich—who was playing across the line—for 28, hitting the off stump with a ball that cut inwards to leave England’s score at 64,&lt;ref name=&quot;sco5&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;f189&quot;&gt;Fingleton, p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt; before Compton and Hutton consolidated the innings and took the total to 2/121 at lunch. Soon after, with his score on 39, Compton aimed a hard [[Batting (cricket)#Cut|cut shot]] that flew into Lindwall's left hand at [[Cricket fielding positions|second slip]] for a &quot;freak slip catch&quot; from Johnston's bowling; leaving England at 3/125.&lt;ref name=&quot;report5&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;f189&quot;/&gt; Lindwall returned for another spell after lunch and bowled Evans for eight. Evans appeared to not detect Lindwall's yorker in the fading light,&lt;ref name=&quot;report5&quot;/&gt; and the umpires called off play due to [[List of cricket terms#L|poor visibility]] after an appeal by Yardley.&lt;ref name=&quot;f189&quot;/&gt; The next morning, England were bowled out for 188, giving Australia an innings victory and the series 4–0.&lt;ref name=sched/&gt; Lindwall took 3/50 to total 9/70 for the match. He ended the Tests as the leading wicket-taker with 27 wickets at 19.62, and scored 191 runs at 31.83.&lt;ref name=&quot;p226&quot;&gt;Perry (2001), p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Later tour matches ==

Seven matches remained on Bradman's quest to go through a tour of England without defeat.&lt;ref name=sched/&gt; Australia batted first against [[Kent County Cricket Club|Kent]] and Lindwall made only one in a total of 361. The paceman took two wickets with the new ball to help reduce the hosts to 5/16, before they were all out for 51; Lindwall ended with 2/16. Forced to follow on, Kent were reduced to 4/37 by three early Lindwall wickets; the victims included [[Tony Pawson (cricketer)|Tony Pawson]] and former Test wicket-keeper [[Les Ames]]. The hosts were further hampered by the absence of opener [[Leslie Todd]], who had been hit on the foot by a Lindwall swinging yorker in the first innings. The blow caused so much bruising that Todd's foot could not fit inside his cricket boots. Lindwall ended with 4/25 as Kent fell for 124 to lose by an innings. In his match total of 6/41 from 15 overs, Lindwall bowled four of his victims.&lt;ref name=kent&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate = 2008-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Perry (2008), p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt; The Kent fixture was followed by a match against the [[Gentlemen of England cricket team|Gentlemen of England]]. Lindwall was not required to bat, and after taking 1/39 in the first innings, Bradman allowed him to rest as Australia enforced the follow on and completed an innings victory.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; Bradman rested Lindwall for the match against [[Somerset County Cricket Club|Somerset]], which resulted in another innings victory for the tourists.&lt;ref name=sched/&gt;&lt;ref name=o/&gt; The paceman returned against the [[South of England cricket team|South of England]]—a representative team—scoring an unbeaten 17 in an unbroken 61-run stand with [[Sam Loxton]] before Australia declared at 7/522. He then took 1/45 as rain ended the match at the conclusion of the hosts’ second innings.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;

Australia's biggest challenge in the post-Test tour matches was against the [[H. D. G. Leveson-Gower|Leveson Gower's]] XI. During the last Australian tour in 1938, this team was effectively a full-strength England outfit, but this time Bradman insisted that only six current Test players be allowed to represent the hosts. After the hosts had complied, the Australian skipper fielded a full-strength team.&lt;ref&gt;Perry (2005), pp. 253–254.&lt;/ref&gt; In a rain-interrupted match, Lindwall bowled Hutton for a duck with the new ball. He returned and took five of the last six wickets to fall as the hosts lost their last six wickets for 57 runs. His last five victims were former England captain [[Walter Robins]] and Test players [[Freddie Brown (cricketer)|Freddie Brown]], Evans, Bedser and Laker. Lindwall ended with 6/59; four of his wickets were bowled, while the other two were caught by [[Ian Johnson (cricketer)|Ian Johnson]] in the slips. He made five as Australia with 8/489 declared; time ran out in the rain-affected match with Leveson-Gower's XI at 0/75.&lt;ref name=lg&gt;{{cite web

The tour ended with two non-first-class matches against [[Scotland national cricket team|Scotland]]. Lindwall was rested from the first, which Australia won by an innings.&lt;ref name=sched/&gt;&lt;ref name=o/&gt; In the second fixture, Lindwall signed off in a low key manner, scoring 15 and taking a total of 0/28 from 14 overs as Australia ended their campaign with another innings triumph.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;

== Role ==
[[File:Ray Lindwall graph 1948.png|300px|right|thumb|A chart showing Lindwall's batting performance during the tour. The runs scored per innings are represented by the bars, with the red bars being Test innings and the pink bars being other first-class innings. The blue line is the average of the five most recent innings and the dots indicate [[not out]]s.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;]]

When fit, Lindwall opened the bowling with Miller in the Tests, and the pair operated in short and fiery bursts with the new ball. English cricket administrators had agreed to make a new ball available every 55 overs in the Tests; at the time, the norm was to allow a new ball for every 200 runs scored, something which usually took longer than 55 overs. The new regulation played directly into the hands of the Australians, as a new ball is ideal for [[fast bowling]] and the tourists had a vastly superior pace attack. Bradman thus wanted to preserve his two first-choice pacemen for a vigorous attack on the English batsmen every 55 overs.&lt;ref name=st&gt;Perry (2005), pp. 222–223.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Lindwall bowled 224 overs, while Australia's third fast bowler [[Bill Johnston (cricketer)|Bill Johnston]] bowled 306.&lt;ref name=&quot;aus&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://stats.cricinfo.com/ci/engine/records/averages/batting_bowling_by_team.html?id=83;team=2;type=series |publisher=[[Cricinfo]] |title=Batting and bowling averages The Ashes, 1948&amp;nbsp;– Australia |accessdate=2008-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lindwall led the Test bowling averages, with 27 wickets at 19.62, making him the equal leading wicket-taker along with Johnston, who averaged 23.33.&lt;ref name=aus/&gt;&lt;ref name=eng/&gt; The duo’s haul of 27 Test wickets equalled the record for an Australian fast bowler during a tour of England.&lt;ref name=&quot;wisden&quot;/&gt; The Australian pair were substantially ahead the next most successful bowler, England's [[Alec Bedser]], who took 18 wickets at 38.22.&lt;ref name=&quot;aus&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=eng&gt;{{cite web| url=http://stats.cricinfo.com/ci/engine/records/averages/batting_bowling_by_team.html?id=83;team=1;type=series |publisher=[[Cricinfo]] |title=Batting and bowling averages The Ashes, 1948 – England |accessdate=2008-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lindwall's role as the leading strike bowler is borne out in his [[economy rate|economy]] and [[strike rate]] in both the Tests and all first-class matches. He was the least economical of the three pacemen, but took his wickets more frequently than any other frontline bowler.&lt;ref name=aus/&gt;&lt;ref name=fc/&gt;

In all first-class matches, he took 86&amp;nbsp;wickets at 15.68 and held onto 14 catches, fielding in the slips.&lt;ref name=&quot;p256&quot;&gt;Perry (2005), p. 256.&lt;/ref&gt; There were many consecutive matches during the tour with no rest day in between,&lt;ref name=sched/&gt; so Bradman ensured Miller and Lindwall remained fresh for the new ball bursts in the Tests by giving them a lighter workload during the tour matches. During all first-class matches, Johnston bowled 851.1 overs, Johnson 668, Lindwall 573.4, Toshack 502, while Miller bowled only 429.4 overs. Outside the Tests, Lindwall bowled 349.3 overs, only the fifth heaviest workload among the Australians in those matches.&lt;ref name=fc&gt;{{cite web| url=http://stats.cricinfo.com/ci/engine/records/averages/batting_bowling.html?class=4;id=1070;type=tour |publisher=[[Cricinfo]] |title=Batting and bowling averages Australia tour of England, Apr–September 1948 – First-class matches|accessdate=2008-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The local batsmen were unable to cope with Lindwalls high pace and swing; 43 of his wickets came after his opponent had missed the ball and been bowled.&lt;ref name=wisden/&gt; Lindwall scored 411 runs at 24.17 with two fifties in the first-class matches, including 191 at 31.83 in the Tests.&lt;ref name=&quot;p226&quot;/&gt; Lindwall had limited batting opportunities, usually playing from No. 7 to No. 9.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; It was hard for Lindwall to get any higher up the order as Australia's other frontline bowlers, such as [[Colin McCool]], [[Ian Johnson (cricketer)|Ian Johnson]] and [[Doug Ring]], all scored centuries and more than 20 fifties each during their first-class career, and were of similar batting ability.&lt;ref&gt;Cashman et al., pp. 152, 175, 199, 258.&lt;/ref&gt; As Australia often won by an innings, and declared in the first innings on many occasions due to their batting strength, Lindwall only had 20 innings in his 22 matches, and usually batted at Nos. 7, 8 and 9.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#00f&quot;&gt;N-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;{{Ref label|bat|1|a}} However, he was often effective when he did get an opportunity.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cashman et al., p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Wisden]]'' recognised Lindwall by naming him as one of its five [[Wisden Cricketers of the Year|Cricketers of the Year]] in 1949. The publication cited the paceman’s ability to seize the initiative for Australia in all but one of the Tests by taking early wickets. The fast bowler’s success was attributed to a &quot;superb control of length and direction, his change of pace and general skill, the like of which in a slower bowler could be classed as cunning&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;wisden&quot;/&gt; The ferocity of Lindwall's bouncer often prompted opponents to retreat onto the back foot before he had even released the ball.&lt;ref name=&quot;wisden&quot;/&gt; ''Wisden'' said that &quot;by whatever standard he is judged&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;[Lindwall] must be placed permanently in the gallery of great fast bowlers&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;wisden&quot;/&gt;
