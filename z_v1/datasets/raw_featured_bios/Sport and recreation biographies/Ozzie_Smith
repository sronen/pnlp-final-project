'''Osborne Earl &quot;Ozzie&quot; Smith''' (born December 26, 1954) is an American former [[baseball]] [[shortstop]] who played in [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) for the [[San Diego Padres]] and [[St. Louis Cardinals]] from 1978 to 1996. Nicknamed &quot;The Wizard&quot; for his defensive brilliance, Smith set major league records for career [[assist (baseball)|assists]] (8,375) and [[double play]]s (1,590) by a shortstop (the latter since broken by [[Omar Vizquel]]), as well as the [[National League]] (NL) record with 2,511 career games at the position; Smith won the NL [[Gold Glove Award]] for play at shortstop for 13 consecutive seasons (1980–1992). A 15-time [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]], he accumulated 2,460 [[hit (baseball)|hits]] and 580 [[stolen base]]s during his career, and won the NL [[Silver Slugger Award]] as the best-hitting shortstop in 1987. He was elected to the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Baseball Hall of Fame]] in his first year of eligibility in 2002.

Smith was born in [[Mobile, Alabama]], but his family moved to [[Watts, Los Angeles]] when he was six years old. While participating in childhood athletic activities, Smith developed quick reflexes; he went on to play baseball in high school and college, at Los Angeles' [[Locke High School]] and [[California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo|Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo]] respectively. Drafted as an amateur player by the Padres, Smith made his major league debut in [[1978 Major League Baseball season|1978]]. He quickly established himself as an outstanding fielder, and later became known for performing backflips on special occasions while taking his position at the beginning of a game. Smith won his first Gold Glove Award in 1980, and made his first All-Star Game appearance in 1981. When conflict with Padres' ownership developed, he was traded to the Cardinals for shortstop [[Garry Templeton]] in 1982.

Upon joining the Cardinals, Smith helped the [[1982 St. Louis Cardinals season|team]] win the [[1982 World Series]]. Three years later, his game-winning [[home run]] during Game 5 of the [[1985 National League Championship Series]] prompted broadcaster [[Jack Buck]]'s &quot;Go crazy, folks!&quot; play-by-play call. Despite a [[rotator cuff]] injury during the [[1985 Major League Baseball season|1985 season]], Smith posted career highs in multiple offensive categories in [[1987 Major League Baseball season|1987]]. Smith continued to earn Gold Gloves and All-Star appearances on an annual basis until [[1993 Major League Baseball season|1993]]. During 1995 season, Smith had shoulder surgery and was out nearly three months. After tension with his new manager [[Tony La Russa]] developed in [[1996 Major League Baseball season|1996]], Smith retired at season's end, and his uniform number (No. 1) was subsequently retired by the Cardinals. Smith served as host of the television show ''[[This Week in Baseball]]'' from 1997 to 1999, and continues to be an entrepreneur in a variety of business ventures.
	
==Early life==
Smith was born in [[Mobile, Alabama]], the second of Clovis and Marvella Smith's six children (five boys and one girl).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/baseball/news/2002/07/27/ozzie_hall_ap/ |title='Wizard of Oz' on deck for enshrinement |accessdate=2008-03-19 |author=Associated Press |date=2002-07-28 |publisher=Sports Illustrated.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the family lived in Mobile, his father worked as a sandblaster at [[Brookley Air Force Base]].&lt;ref name=&quot;page6&quot;&gt;[[#Smi88|Smith and Rains 1988]]: 6&lt;/ref&gt; When Smith was six his family moved to the [[Watts, Los Angeles, California|Watts]] section of [[Los Angeles, California]].&lt;ref name=page6/&gt; His father became a delivery truck driver for [[Safeway Inc.|Safeway]] stores, while his mother became an aide at a [[nursing home]].&lt;ref name=page9/&gt; His mother was an influential part of his life who stressed the importance of education and encouraged him to pursue his dreams.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eisenbath284&quot;&gt;[[#Eis99|Eisenbath 1999]]: 284–285&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SI87&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1066503/4/index.htm |last=Fimrite |first=Ron |title=No. 1 In His Field |date=1987-09-28 |accessdate=2009-01-03 |publisher=Sports Illustrated.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith played a variety of sports in his youth, but considered baseball to be his favorite.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Smi88|Smith and Rains 1988]]: 8&lt;/ref&gt; He developed quick reflexes through various athletic and leisure activity, such as bouncing a ball off the concrete steps in front of his house, moving in closer to reduce reaction time with each throw.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Smi02|Smith and Rains 2002]]: 24&lt;/ref&gt; When not at the local [[YMCA]] or playing sports, Smith sometimes went with friends to the neighborhood lumberyard, springboarding off inner tubes and doing flips into sawdust piles (a precursor to his famous backflips).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Smi88|Smith and Rains 1988]]: 7&lt;/ref&gt; In 1965, at age ten, he endured the [[Watts Riots]] with his family, recalling that, &quot;We had to sleep on the floor because of all the sniping and looting going on.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Smi88|Smith and Rains 1988]]: 4&lt;/ref&gt;

While Smith was attending [[middle school|junior high school]], his parents divorced.&lt;ref name=&quot;page9&quot;&gt;[[#Smi88|Smith and Rains 1988]]: 9&lt;/ref&gt; Continuing to pursue his interest in baseball, he would ride the bus for nearly an hour to reach [[Dodger Stadium]], cheering for the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] at about 25 games a year.&lt;ref name=&quot;page9&quot;/&gt; Upon becoming a student at [[Locke High School]], Smith played on the basketball and baseball teams.&lt;ref name=&quot;page9&quot;/&gt; Smith was a teammate of future [[National Basketball Association]] player [[Marques Johnson]] on the basketball team, and a teammate of future fellow Hall-of-Fame player [[Eddie Murray]] on the baseball side.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Smi88|Smith and Rains 1988]]: 9–10&lt;/ref&gt; After high school Smith attended [[California Polytechnic State University|Cal Poly San Luis Obispo]] in 1974 on a partial academic scholarship, and managed to [[Walk-on (sport term)|walk-on]] to the baseball team.&lt;ref name=&quot;calpoly&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://polyland.calpoly.edu/topics/recreation/studentsites/2004b/Ozzie%20Smith.htm |title=Ozzie Smith |accessdate=2008-04-26 |publisher=Cal Poly Land}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to his academic education, he learned to [[switch hitter|switch-hit]] from Cal Poly coach Berdy Harr.&lt;ref name=&quot;Yearbook&quot;&gt;Lang, Dave. &quot;There is Only 1 Ozzie Smith.&quot; St. Louis Cardinals Official 1993 Yearbook. 1993. 17&lt;/ref&gt; When Cal Poly's starting shortstop broke his leg midway through the 1974 season, Smith subsequently took over the starting role.&lt;ref name=&quot;SI87&quot;/&gt; Later named an All-American athlete, he established school records in career [[at bat]]s (754) and career [[stolen base]]s (110) before graduating in 1977.&lt;ref name=&quot;calpoly&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gopoly.com/index.php?p=hall_of_fame&amp;id=166 |title=Ozzie Smith |accessdate=2009-01-04 |publisher=California Polytechnic State University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional baseball career==
===San Diego Padres===
Smith was playing semi-professional baseball in [[Clarinda, Iowa]], in June 1976 when he was selected in the seventh round of the [[1976 Major League Baseball Draft|amateur entry draft]] by the [[Detroit Tigers]].&lt;ref name=&quot;aol&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sports.aol.com/moresports/story/_a/still-nothing-in-baseball-gets-past/20070731123009990001 |title=Still, Nothing in Baseball Gets Past Ozzie |accessdate=2007-10-31 |last=Hollander |first=Dave |date=2007-08-08 |publisher=AOL}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;retrosheet1&quot;/&gt; The parties could not agree on a contract; Smith wanted a $10,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|10000|1976|r=0}}}} today) signing bonus, while the Tigers offered $8,500 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|8500|1976|r=0}}}} today).&lt;ref name=&quot;aol&quot;/&gt; Smith returned to Cal Poly for his senior year, then in the [[1977 Major League Baseball Draft|1977 draft]] was selected in the fourth round by the [[San Diego Padres]], ultimately agreeing to a contract that included a $5,000 signing bonus (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|5000|1977|r=0}}}} today).&lt;ref name=&quot;aol&quot;/&gt; Smith spent his first year of professional baseball, 1977, with the Class A [[Walla Walla Padres]] of the [[Northwest League]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hummel85&quot;&gt;[[#Hum07|Hummel 2007]]: 57–61&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith began [[1978 Major League Baseball season|1978]] as a non-roster invitee to the San Diego Padres' spring training camp in [[Yuma, Arizona]]. Smith credited Padres manager [[Alvin Dark]] for giving him confidence by telling reporters the shortstop job was Smith's until he proved he can't handle it.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Smi88|Smith and Rains 1988]]: 17&lt;/ref&gt; Even though Dark was fired in the middle of training camp, Smith made his [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) debut on April 7, 1978.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Smi88|Smith and Rains 1988]]: 18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1978/B04070SFN1978.htm |title=San Diego Padres 3, San Francisco Giants 2 |accessdate=2007-09-27 |publisher=Retrosheet.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It did not take long for Smith to earn recognition in the major leagues, making what some consider his greatest fielding play only ten games into his rookie season.&lt;ref name=&quot;SI87&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1066503/4/index.htm |last=Fimrite |first=Ron |title=No. 1 In His Field |date=1987-09-28 |accessdate=2009-01-03 |publisher=Sports Illustrated.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;USAToday&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/bbw/2002-07-24/cover.htm |title=Go Crazy for the Wizard |last=Colston |first=Chris |date=2002-07-24 |accessdate=2008-05-04 |work=USA Today Baseball Weekly}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Padres played host to the [[1978 Atlanta Braves season|Atlanta Braves]] on April 20, 1978, and with two out in the top of the fourth inning, Atlanta's [[Jeff Burroughs]] hit a ground ball up the middle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1978/B04200SDN1978.htm |title=San Diego Padres 2, Atlanta Braves 0 |accessdate=2007-10-10 |publisher=Retrosheet.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith described the play by saying, &quot;He hit a ball back up the middle that everybody thought was going into center field. I instinctively broke to my left and dove behind second. As I was in the air, the ball took a bad hop and caromed behind me, but I was able to catch it with my bare hand. I hit the ground, bounced back up, and threw Burroughs out at first.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith21&quot;&gt;[[#Smi88|Smith and Rains 1988]]: 21&lt;/ref&gt;

During a roadtrip to [[Houston]], later in the season, Smith met a part-time usherette at the [[Reliant Astrodome|Astrodome]] named Denise while making his way to the team bus outside the stadium.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith2425&quot;&gt;[[#Smi88|Smith and Rains 1988]]: 24–25&lt;/ref&gt; The couple developed a relationship that was sometimes long-distance in nature, and eventually decided to [[marriage|marry]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith2425&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;sportingnews&quot;/&gt;  It was also during the 1978 season that Smith introduced a signature move. Padres promotion director Andy Strasberg knew Smith could perform backflips, but that he only did them during practice before fans entered the stadium.&lt;ref name=&quot;USAToday&quot;/&gt; Strasberg asked Smith to do a backflip for fans during Fan Appreciation Day on October 1, the Padres' last home game of the season.&lt;ref name=&quot;USAToday&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1978/B10010SDN1978.htm |title=San Diego Padres 4, Los Angeles Dodgers 3 |accessdate=2008-06-30 |publisher=Retrosheet.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; After conferring with veteran teammate [[Gene Tenace]], Smith went ahead with the backflip, and it proved to be wildly popular.&lt;ref name=&quot;USAToday&quot;/&gt; Smith finished the 1978 season with a .258 batting average and .970 fielding percentage, placing second in [[Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award|National League Rookie of the Year]] voting to [[Bob Horner]].&lt;ref name=stats1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/awards/awards_1978.shtml#NLroy |title=Baseball Awards Voting for 1978 |accessdate=2007-11-12 |work=[[Baseball-Reference]]|publisher=Sports Reference, LLC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After working with a hitting instructor during the offseason, Smith failed to record a base hit in his first 32 at bats of the [[1979 Major League Baseball season|1979 season]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Smi88|Smith and Rains 1988]]: 28–31&lt;/ref&gt; Among players with enough at-bats to qualify for the 1979 National League Triple Crown, Smith finished the season last in batting average (.211), home runs (0), and RBI (27).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Spa07|Spatz 2007]]: 141&lt;/ref&gt; Off the field, conflict developed between Padres' ownership and the combination of Smith and his agent, Ed Gottlieb. The parties entered into a contract dispute before the [[1980 Major League Baseball season|1980 season]], and when negotiations lasted into spring training, the Padres renewed Smith's contract at his 1979 salary of $72,500&lt;ref&gt;[[#Smi88|Smith and Rains 1988]]: 34&lt;/ref&gt; Angered by the Padres' attitude during those contract talks, Gottlieb took out a help-wanted ad in the [[The San Diego Union-Tribune|''San Diego Union'']], part of which read, &quot;Padre baseball player wants part-time employment to supplement income.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Smi88|Smith and Rains 1988]]: 35&lt;/ref&gt; When Joan Kroc, wife of Padres owner [[Ray Kroc]], publicly offered Smith a job as an assistant gardener on her estate, Smith and Gottlieb's relationship with the organization deteriorated further.&lt;ref name=&quot;wizard3536&quot;&gt;[[#Smi88|Smith and Rains 1988]]: 35–36&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, Smith was winning recognition for his accomplishments on the field. In [[1980 Major League Baseball season|1980]], he set the single-season record for most assists by a shortstop (621), and began his string of 13 consecutive [[Rawlings Gold Glove Award|Gold Glove awards]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Smi88|Smith and Rains 1988]]: 37&lt;/ref&gt; Smith's fielding play prompted the ''Yuma Daily Sun'' to use the nickname &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; in a March 1981 feature article about Smith.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Smi02|Smith and Rains 2002]]: 22&lt;/ref&gt; While &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; nickname was an allusion to the [[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|1939 motion picture]] of the same name, Smith also came to be known as simply &quot;The Wizard&quot; during his playing career, as Smith's Baseball Hall of Fame plaque would later attest.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Smi02|Smith and Rains 2002]]: 25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baseballhalloffame.org/hofers/detail.jsp?playerId=122439 |title=National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum:Hall of Famer detail |accessdate=2008-11-21 |publisher=National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum, Inc.|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080625094109/http://www.baseballhalloffame.org/hofers/detail.jsp?playerId=122439 |archivedate = June 25, 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981, Smith made his first [[1981 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Game appearance]] as a reserve player.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1981/B08090ALS1981.htm |title=National League 5, American League 4 |accessdate=2008-11-21 |publisher=Retrosheet.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Trade ====
While Smith was having problems with the Padres' owners, the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] also found themselves unhappy with their shortstop. During a game at [[Busch Memorial Stadium|Busch Stadium]] on August 26, 1981, [[Garry Templeton]] made obscene gestures at fans before being pulled off the field by manager [[Whitey Herzog]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#O'Neill05|O'Neill 2005]]: 108&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Her87|Herzog and Horrigan 1987]]: 135–136&lt;/ref&gt; Given the task of overhauling the Cardinals by owner [[Gussie Busch]], Herzog was looking to trade Templeton when he was approached by Padres General Manager [[Jack McKeon]] at the 1981 [[Winter meetings|baseball winter meetings]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Her87|Herzog and Horrigan 1987]]: 119–120, 137&lt;/ref&gt; While McKeon had previously told Herzog that Smith was untouchable in any trade, the Padres were now so angry at Smith's agent Gottlieb that McKeon was willing to deal.&lt;ref name=&quot;herzog137&quot;&gt;[[#Her87|Herzog and Horrigan 1987]]: 137&lt;/ref&gt;

McKeon and Herzog agreed in principle to a six-player trade, with Templeton for Smith as the centerpiece.&lt;ref name=&quot;herzog137&quot;/&gt; It was then that Padres manager [[Dick Williams]] informed Herzog that a [[no-trade clause]] had been included in Smith's 1981 contract.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Her99|Herzog and Pitts 1999]]: 92–93&lt;/ref&gt; Upon learning of the trade, Smith's initial reaction was to invoke the clause and stay in [[San Diego]], but he was still interested to hear what the Cardinals had to say.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Smi88|Smith and Rains 1988]]: 51&lt;/ref&gt; While the deal for the players beside Templeton and Smith went through, Herzog flew to San Diego to meet with Smith and Gottlieb over the Christmas holiday.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Her87|Herzog and Horrigan 1987]]: 138&lt;/ref&gt; Smith later recalled that, &quot;Whitey told me that with me playing shortstop for the St. Louis Cardinals, we could win the pennant. He made me feel wanted, which was a feeling I was quickly losing from the Padres. The mere fact that Whitey would come all the way out there to talk to us was more than enough to convince me that St. Louis was the place I wanted to be.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Smi88|Smith and Rains 1988]]: 52&lt;/ref&gt;

=== St. Louis Cardinals ===
==== 1982–1984 ====

After more behind-the-scenes contract wrangling, Smith became a St. Louis Cardinal on February 11, 1982.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Smi88|Smith and Rains 1988]]: 57&lt;/ref&gt; Herzog believed Smith could improve his offensive production by hitting more ground balls, and subsequently created a motivational tool designed to help Smith concentrate on that task.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Smi02|Smith and Rains 2002]]: 28–29&lt;/ref&gt; Approaching Smith one day during spring training, Herzog said, &quot;Every time you hit a fly ball, you owe me a buck. Every time you hit a ground ball, I owe you a buck. We'll keep that going all year.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;page61&quot;&gt;[[#Smi88|Smith and Rains 1988]]: 61&lt;/ref&gt; Smith agreed to the wager, and by the end of the season had won close to $300 from Herzog.&lt;ref name=&quot;page61&quot;/&gt; As the [[1982 St. Louis Cardinals season|1982 season]] got underway, Herzog's newly assembled team won 12 games in a row during the month of April, and finished the season atop the National League East division.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1982/VSLN01982.htm |title=The 1982 St. Louis Cardinals Regular Season Game Log |accessdate=2008-07-18 |publisher=Retrosheet.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lea08|Leach 2008]]: 37&lt;/ref&gt; Herzog would later say of Smith's contributions that, &quot;If he saved two runs a game on defense, which he did many a night, it seemed to me that was just as valuable to the team as a player who drove in two runs a game on offense.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Smi02|Smith and Rains 2002]]: 6&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith became a father for the first time during the [[1982 Major League Baseball season|1982 season]] with the birth of his son O.J., today known as [[Nikko Smith|Nikko]], on April 28.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Smi88|Smith and Rains 1988]]: 65&lt;/ref&gt; Smith also developed a lasting friendship with teammate [[Willie McGee]] during the season, and Smith said he likes to think he &quot;helped Willie get over some of the rough spots of adjusting to the major leagues&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;page66&quot;&gt;[[#Smi88|Smith and Rains 1988]]: 66&lt;/ref&gt; Smith later participated in the postseason for the first time when the [[1982 St. Louis Cardinals season|Cardinals]] faced the [[1982 Atlanta Braves season|Atlanta Braves]] in the best-of-five [[1982 National League Championship Series]] (NLCS). Smith drove in the series' first run by hitting a [[sacrifice fly]] that scored McGee in Game 1, ultimately going five for nine in St. Louis' three-game series sweep.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1982/B10070SLN1982.htm |title=St. Louis Cardinals 7, Atlanta Braves 0 |accessdate=2007-10-15 |publisher=Retrosheet.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Just as Herzog had predicted when he told Smith the Cardinals would win the pennant with him on the team, Smith found himself as the team's starting shortstop in the best-of-seven [[1982 World Series]] against the [[1982 Milwaukee Brewers season|Milwaukee Brewers]].

With the score tied at two runs apiece in the bottom of the ninth inning, Dodgers manager [[Tommy Lasorda]] called upon closer [[Tom Niedenfuer]] to pitch.

After Smith's teammate [[Jack Clark (baseball player)|Jack Clark]] hit a late-inning home run of his own in Game 6 to defeat the Dodgers, the Cardinals moved on to face the [[1985 Kansas City Royals season|Kansas City Royals]] in the [[1985 World Series]]. Once again sportswriters were quick to draw attention to Smith's outstanding defensive play instead of his 2 for 23 effort at the plate.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sch90|Schoor 1990]]: 362&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;#Sch90|Schoor 1990: 418&quot;&gt;[[#Sch90|Schoor 1990]]: 418&lt;/ref&gt; After the Cardinals took a three-games-to-two advantage, a controversial [[1985 World Series#Game 6|Game 6]] call by umpire [[Don Denkinger]] overshadowed the remainder of the Series (which the Royals won in seven games).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Nem02|Nemec and Wisnia 2002]]: 433&lt;/ref&gt;

What was not publicly known during the regular season and playoffs was that Smith had torn his [[rotator cuff]] after suffering an impingement in his right shoulder during the July 11–14 homestand against the Padres.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith121&quot;&gt;[[#Smi88|Smith and Rains 1988]]: 121&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1985/VSLN01985.htm |title=The 1985 St. Louis Cardinals Regular Season Game Log |accessdate=2008-11-08 |publisher=Retrosheet.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; After suffering the impingement diving back into first base on a [[pickoff]] throw, Smith altered his throwing motion to such a degree that the rotator cuff tear subsequently developed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith121&quot;/&gt; The 5'10&quot; (1.78&amp;nbsp;m), 180-pound (82&amp;nbsp;kg) Smith opted to forgo surgery and instead built up his arm strength via weightlifting, playing through whatever pain he encountered.&lt;ref name=&quot;media&quot;/&gt; Said Smith, &quot;I didn't tell anybody about the injury, because I wanted to keep playing and didn't want anybody thinking they could run on me or take advantage of the injury.

On January 8, 2002 Smith learned via a phone call he had been elected to the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Baseball Hall of Fame]] on his first ballot by receiving 91.7% of the votes cast.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Rai02|Rains and Reid 2002]]: 107&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/hallfame/2002-01-08-ozzie.htm |title=Ozzie Smith voted into Hall of Fame |accessdate=2008-03-19 |last=Bodley |first=Hal |date=2002-01-09 |work=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; As it happened, the [[Olympic torch]] was passing through St. Louis on its way to [[Salt Lake City]] for the [[2002 Winter Olympics]], and Smith served as a torchbearer in a ceremony with [[St. Louis Rams]]' quarterback [[Kurt Warner]] that evening.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Smi02|Smith and Rains 2002]]: 18–19&lt;/ref&gt; Smith was inducted into the Hall of Fame during ceremonies on July 28, 2002.
