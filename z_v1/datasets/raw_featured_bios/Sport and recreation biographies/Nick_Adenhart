'''Nicholas James Adenhart''' (August 24, 1986&amp;nbsp;– April 9, 2009) was an American [[Right-handedness|right-handed]] [[baseball]] [[starting pitcher]] who played two seasons in [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) for the [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim]]. In four career games, Adenhart pitched 18 innings and posted a win-loss record of 1–0, with nine [[strikeout]]s and a 6.00 [[earned run average]] (ERA).

A graduate of [[Williamsport High School]], Adenhart was highly touted as a high school prospect until an injury in his final game required [[Tommy John surgery]]. He was drafted by the Angels in the 14th round of the [[2004 Major League Baseball Draft]], and began playing in their minor league system after the surgery was a success. He spent three full years in the minor leagues before making his major league debut on May 1, 2008. After appearing in three games, Adenhart spent the rest of 2008 in the minor leagues developing his skills, and in 2009 he earned a spot in the Angels' starting rotation.

Just after pitching his first start of 2009, Adenhart was killed in a car accident by a drunk driver. Both the Angels and the [[Salt Lake Bees]], for whom Adenhart played in 2008, suspended their next games. There were many tributes to him over the course of the season, including his former teammates spraying champagne and beer on one of his jerseys after they clinched the 2009 [[American League West]] division championship.

==Early years==
Nicholas James Adenhart was born in [[Silver Spring, Maryland]], the only son of Janet and Jim Adenhart, a former [[United States Secret Service]] officer.&lt;ref name=espn4055343/&gt; His parents divorced and Janet later remarried Duane Gigeous, with whom she had a son named Henry, who is a pitcher at the [[University of Oregon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20100115&amp;content_id=7926350|title=Younger brother continues Adenhart's legacy|last=Spencer|first=Lyle|date=January 16, 2010|publisher=MLB.com|accessdate=January 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Smith|first=Marcia C.|title=Adenhart crash survivor remembers|url=http://www.ocregister.com/sports/wilhite-349107-adenhart-day.html|accessdate=April 14, 2012|newspaper=[[The Orange County Register]]|date=April 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Adenhart played Halfway [[Little League Baseball]] for Gehr Construction and attended Springfield Middle School in [[Williamsport, Maryland]].&lt;ref name=pe&gt;{{cite news|title=Town mourns life cut short|first=Michael|last=Becker|newspaper=[[The Press-Enterprise (California)|The Press-Enterprise]]|date=April 27, 2009|accessdate=July 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He pitched for the Hagerstown [[PONY Baseball and Softball|PONY League]] for six years, and was a member of the 1999 team that won the Maryland District 1 title.&lt;ref name=littleleague&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.herald-mail.com/2009-07-01/news/25181541_1_jim-adenhart-nick-adenhart-youth-baseball|title=Adenhart fund donates $5K to Little League|last=Parasiliti|first=Bob|date=July 1, 2009|newspaper=[[The Herald-Mail]]|accessdate=July 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduating from middle school, Adenhart attended [[Saint Maria Goretti High School]] in [[Hagerstown, Maryland]].&lt;ref name=pe/&gt; He played [[shortstop]] and [[outfield]], in addition to pitching. While attending Saint Maria Goretti, Adenhart was a [[guard (basketball)|guard]] on the [[basketball]] team that won the [[Baltimore Catholic League]] championship.&lt;ref name=BaltimoreSun20040508&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/sports/bal-adenhart10408,0,3089213.story|title=Adenhart is pitching to hit the big leagues|last=Kubatko|first=Roch|date=May 8, 2004|newspaper=[[Baltimore Sun]]|accessdate=September 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of 14, Adenhart joined the Oriolelanders, a showcase team composed of Maryland amateur players and sponsored by the [[Baltimore Orioles]], where he would stay for four years.&lt;ref name=BaltimoreSun20090409&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/sports/orioles/bal-nick-adenhart-angels-0409,0,3739238.story|title=Angels pitcher Nick Adenhart, a Md. native, dies in car accident|last=Walker|first=Childs|date=April 9, 2009|newspaper=[[Baltimore Sun]]|accessdate=July 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;deseret20091014&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/705336819/Davidoff-Angels-will-ensure-Nick-Adenhart-wont-be-forgotten.html|title=Davidoff: Angels will ensure Nick Adenhart won't be forgotten|last=Davidoff|first=Ken|date=October 14, 2009|newspaper=[[Deseret News]]|accessdate=July 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, at the age of 16, Adenhart pitched for the [[Youse's Maryland Orioles]], who went on to win the All American Amateur Baseball Association Tournament for that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tribune-democrat.com/aaaba/local_story_100000114.html|title=AAABA team mourns loss of Angels rookie|last=Mastovich|first=Mike|date=April 10, 2009|newspaper=[[The Tribune-Democrat]]|accessdate=September 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adenhart transferred to [[Williamsport High School]] after his sophomore year, where he gave up basketball to focus solely on baseball, as a pitcher. Scouts began closely following him when he was named the top junior prospect by ''[[Baseball America]]''.&lt;ref name=gatorade&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.herald-mail.com/2003-05-23/news/25099450_1_nick-adenhart-rod-steiner-amateur-draft|title=Adenhart earns Gatorade award|first=Dan|last=Kaufmann|newspaper=[[The Herald-Mail]]|date=May 23, 2003|accessdate=July 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adenhart had a 6–0 record with a 1.04 [[earned run average]] during the regular season in his junior year, and as a result was named the [[Gatorade Player of the Year awards|Gatorade Player of the Year]] in Maryland.&lt;ref name=gatorade/&gt; In a 1–0 loss during the playoff quarterfinal matchup, he threw a no-hitter and had 14 strikeouts.&lt;ref name=gatorade/&gt; Entering his final high school season, ''Baseball America'' dubbed Adenhart the top high school prospect in the country.&lt;ref name=BaltimoreSun20040508/&gt; In his senior year, Adenhart threw a [[perfect game]] in his very first outing, [[strikeout|striking out]] 15 of the 21 batters faced.&lt;ref name=BaltimoreSun20040508/&gt;&lt;ref name=signing/&gt; Entering the final regular season game of his high school career, he had a 5–1 record, a 0.73 ERA and an average of 2.2 strikeouts per [[inning]].  During November of his senior year, Adenhart signed a [[National Letter of Intent|letter of intent]] to play with the [[North Carolina Tar Heels baseball|North Carolina Tar Heels baseball team]] at the [[University of North Carolina]], although his chances of being drafted high continued to climb and the North Carolina coaching staff saw their chances of acquiring Adenhart to be slim.&lt;ref name=washingtonpost&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A64417-2004May28.html|title=When you get a good kid...it's sad|last=Steinberg|first=Dan|date=May 29, 2004|newspaper=[[Washington Post]]|accessdate=September 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Baseball career==
In his final high school game, in front of two dozen scouts, Adenhart felt a pop in his elbow after throwing a [[curveball]] to the third batter. The injury, which abruptly ended his season, was a partial ligament tear in his elbow that required [[Tommy John surgery]].&lt;ref name=washingtonpost/&gt; Though he had originally been projected as a first-round draft pick, the injury caused his stock to plummet two weeks before the [[2004 Major League Baseball Draft]].&lt;ref name=washingtonpost/&gt; He fell to the 413th overall pick in the 14th round, selected by the [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim|Anaheim Angels]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/sports/orioles/bal-adenhart20409,0,646234.story|title=Adenhart worth wait for Angels|last=Kubatko|first=Roch|date=August 1, 2004|newspaper=[[Baltimore Sun]]|accessdate=April 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Angels scout Dan Radcliff and director of scouting [[Eddie Bane]] convinced Adenhart to forego a scholarship offer from the University of North Carolina and signed him to a $710,000 bonus (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|710000|2004|2010|r=-4}}}} in 2010) on July 26, 2004.&lt;ref name=signing&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseballamerica.com/today/news/040726adenhart.html|title=Angels Sign Adenhart For $710,000|last=Callis|first=Jim|date=July 26, 2004|publisher=Baseball America|accessdate=November 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; After having [[James Andrews (physician)|Dr. James Andrews]] perform the Tommy John surgery, Adenhart spent the next year rehabilitating his elbow at the Angels' rehab facility in [[Tempe, Arizona]].  During that time, Adenhart also attended classes at [[Arizona State University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseballamerica.com/today/prospects/daily-dish/2006/261345.html|title=Adenhart starring for low Class A Cedar Rapids|last=Kline|first=Chris|date=May 22, 2006|publisher=Baseball America|accessdate=November 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adenhart made his professional debut on June 25, 2005 with the [[Pioneer Baseball League|Pioneer League]]'s [[Orem Owlz]], the Angels' Rookie League affiliate. In his lone appearance for the Owlz, he pitched six innings, allowed one [[unearned run]], struck out seven, and earned the win.&lt;ref name=brm&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/player.cgi?id=adenha001nic|title=Nick Adenhart Minor League Statistics &amp; History|publisher=[[Baseball-Reference.com]]|publisher=Sports Reference, LLC|accessdate=January 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He spent the rest of the 2005 season with the Angels of the [[Arizona League]] that summer.
