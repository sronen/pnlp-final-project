==Early years and personal life==
Trescothick was immersed into cricket from an early age.

==Early domestic career==
Trescothick's first full season at Somerset in 1994 was one of his best, where he scored a total of 925 runs, including two [[century (cricket)|centuries]] and eight half-centuries at an impressive [[batting average]] of 48.63.&lt;ref name=&quot;battingbyseason&quot;&gt;[http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/3/3859/f_Batting_by_Season.html First-class Batting and Fielding in Each Season by Marcus Trescothick], CricketArchive.

Trescothick was not as successful in domestic cricket in 1995,&lt;ref name=&quot;battingbyseason&quot;/&gt; although there were still some highlights including an innings of 151 against [[Northamptonshire County Cricket Club|Northamptonshire]] (a third of his season's total), and a [[Hat-trick (cricket)|hat-trick]], including the wicket of century-maker [[Adam Gilchrist]], for Somerset against Young Australia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/60/60776.html Somerset v Young Australia in 1995], CricketArchive, 7 July 1995. Retrieved on 2007-06-10.&lt;/ref&gt; Trescothick's England Under-19 form was still excellent, averaging 74.62 with the bat in six matches. His Under-19 team mates would often mock him for wearing an England blazer after his matches; Trescothick would reply by saying that &quot;it might be the closest I get to playing for England&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Kidd, Patrick. &quot;[http://timesonline.typepad.com/line_and_length/2006/09/back_to_the_fut.html Line and Length]&quot;, [[The Times]], 26 September 2006.

The following five years were mixed for Trescothick. Averaging about 30 runs per [[innings]], he was often criticised for a lack of foot movement. [[David Gower]] described Trescothick's technique by saying &quot;he does not need to move a long way but needs to move enough. When he is playing well ... he is very good at transferring weight. When he is not playing well, his feet get stuck&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gower&quot;&gt;Gower, David. &quot;[http://content-www.cricinfo.com/wisdencricketer/content/story/250406.html Stand and deliver], Cricinfo, July 2006.

In 1999, Trescothick impressed [[Glamorgan County Cricket Club|Glamorgan]] coach [[Duncan Fletcher]] in a [[County Championship|county match]] at [[County Ground, Taunton|Taunton]], by scoring 167 in a low-scoring match where the next-highest innings was 50.&lt;ref name=&quot;cricinfo&quot;/&gt; When England opening batsman [[Nick Knight]] sustained a finger injury in 2000, Fletcher, who had been appointed England coach, called on Trescothick to make his England debut in the [[NatWest Series]] against [[Zimbabwe national cricket team|Zimbabwe]] and the [[West Indies cricket team|West Indies]].&lt;ref name=&quot;debut&quot;&gt;[http://www.cricinfo.com/link_to_database/ARCHIVE/2000/OD_TOURNEYS/NWS/NEWSWIRE/NWS-09JUL2000.pdf NatWest Series Newswire], Cricinfo, 9 July 2000.

==International career==
===Debut and centuries on maiden tour===
Trescothick participated in two [[England Lions cricket team|England A]] tours during the winter of 1999, but his full One Day International debut came against Zimbabwe at [[The Oval]] on 9 July 2000, when he scored 79.&lt;ref name=&quot;debut&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/70/70133.html England v Zimbabwe, 8 July 2000], CricketArchive, 8 July 2000.

===Captaincy 2010-Present===
Trescothick led Somerset into the 2010 season as captain, and began strongly in the County Championship with a century and four half-centuries from his first eight games, though he struggled in the newly formed [[Clydesdale Bank 40]] with only 95 runs from the first five matches, and in the [[Friends Provident T20]] 173 runs at 21.62 with a best of 50.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Players/3/3859/Current_Season_Averages.html|title=2010 Averages for Marcus Trescothick|work=Cricket Archive|accessdate=26 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This half century came on 25 June, where together with [[Kieron Pollard]] helped secure victory over Sussex, and was scored from 31 balls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/countycricket2010/content/story/464704.html|title=Trescothick and Pollard down Sussex|date=25 June 2010|work=CricInfo|accessdate=26 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite Trescothick's four-day form, however, Somerset struggled early on, with only one victory over Yorkshire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/countycricket2010/content/story/460394.html|title=Hildreth shines in massive run-chase|date=20 May 2010|work=CricInfo|accessdate=26 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a Twenty20 match against Hampshire on 9 July at Taunton, Trescothick hit a half-century from 13 deliveries, including five sixes and five fours – a record fastest fifty in English domestic Twenty20 cricket. He was eventually dismissed for 78 from only 32 balls.&lt;ref name=&quot;Record-breaking Trescothick sets up win&quot; /&gt; He went on to lead Somerset to runners-up position for all three English domestic competitions, losing out to Nottinghamshire in the County Championship, Hampshire in the Twenty20 and Warwickshire in the [[CB40]] competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/counties/somerset/9015517.stm|title=BBC Sport – Cricket – Somerset can be proud – Marcus Trescothick|work=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=22 September 2010 | date=20 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 Trescothick started off the county championship season very strongly and was the first batsman in the country to score 1000 championship runs. He was awarded the 2011 season MVP (Most Valuable Player) award for his performances throughout the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/14991103.stm|title=Somerset captain Marcus Trescothick takes 2011 MVP award|publisher=BBC Sport | date=20 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He ended 2011 with six centuries in the County Championship, batting with an average of 79.66 across the year. Somerset earned record financial returns that year,&lt;ref name=&quot;Somerset announce financial success in 2011&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/15874345.stm|title=Somerset announce financial success in 2011|date=24 November 2011|work=BBC Sports|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; however again failed in the semi-final and final stages of all major competitions.&lt;ref name=&quot;The winner is...&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/533571.html |title=The winner is...|last=Dobell|first=George|date=September 23, 2011|work=CricInfo|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=2 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Across all three formats, Trescothick took 2,518 runs for his county. CricInfo's George Dobell noted in their end of season round-up that &quot;He continues to dominate county attacks in a way that only Graeme Hick and Mark Ramprakash - of recent batsmen - could match. There are times when he makes the bowlers' job appear impossible.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;The winner is...&quot; /&gt; However, as 2012 - Trescothick's 19th season at Somerset - approached, there was talk of resting him from the newly formed one-day cricket championship that following year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Somerset captain Trescothick may be rested in CB40&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/15624145.stm|title=Somerset captain Trescothick may be rested in CB40|date=7 November 2011|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trescothick did not tavel with the rest of the side to the [[Champions League T20]] in India.
