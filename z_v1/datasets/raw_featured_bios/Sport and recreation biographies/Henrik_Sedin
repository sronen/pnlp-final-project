Selected third overall by the Canucks in the [[1999 NHL Entry Draft]], Henrik has spent his entire NHL career in Vancouver. After four seasons with the club, he became the Canucks' top-scoring centre in [[2005–06 NHL season|2005–06]]. He has since won three [[Cyrus H. McLean Trophy|Cyrus H. McLean Trophies]] as the team's leading point-scorer (from [[2007–08 NHL season|2007–08]] to [[2009–10 NHL season|2009–10]]) and one [[Cyclone Taylor Award]] as the team's most valuable player (2010).

He was also named to the [[NHL All-Star Team|NHL First All-Star Team]] that year and again in [[2010–11 NHL season|2010–11]], a season that included an appearance in the [[Stanley Cup Finals]], where Vancouver lost to the [[Boston Bruins]] in seven games. That summer, Henrik and Daniel were named co-recipients of the [[Victoria Stipendium]] as Swedish athletes of the year.
 
Internationally, Henrik has competed for [[Sweden men's national ice hockey team|Sweden]]. He is a two-time [[Ice hockey at the Winter Olympics|Olympian]] and helped Sweden to a gold medal at the [[Ice hockey at the 2006 Winter Olympics|2006 Winter Games]] in [[Turin]].

==Playing career==
===Modo Hockey (1997–2000)===
Aged 16, Henrik and Daniel Sedin began their professional careers in 1997–98 with Modo Hockey of the [[Elitserien|Swedish Elite League]]. Henrik recorded a goal and five points over 39&amp;nbsp;games during his rookie season. In his second year with Modo, he improved to 12 goals and 34 points, joint second in team scoring with [[Samuel Påhlsson]], behind Daniel.&lt;ref name=modo99&gt;{{Cite web|title=1998–99 Modo Hockey Ornskoldsvik [SEL]|url=http://www.hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/leagues/seasons/teams/0014321999.html|accessdate=2009-01-20|publisher=Hockeydb}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the end of the season, Henrik and Daniel were named co-recipients of the [[Guldpucken|Golden Puck]], the Swedish player of the year award.&lt;ref name=legends&gt;{{cite web|title=Henrik Sedin|url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/SearchPlayer.jsp?player=19288|accessdate=2010-04-21|publisher=[[Hockey Hall of Fame]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The Sedins were considered top [[prospect (sports)|prospects]] for the [[1999 NHL Entry Draft]].

This option required that they play [[junior ice hockey]] in North America, which was not their intention.&lt;ref name=mirror/&gt; Barnett also suggested that either Henrik or Daniel opt out of the 1999 draft, in the hope that the same team that selected the first twin would select the other the following year.&lt;ref name=mirror/&gt;  On the possibility of the Sedins' playing for separate teams, [[Vancouver Canucks]] scout [[Thomas Gradin]] commented, &quot;They're good enough to play with anyone, but separately their capacity might decrease by 10 or 15 percent.&quot;&lt;ref name=mirror/&gt;  Nevertheless, Henrik and Daniel entered the 1999 draft expecting to be selected by separate teams.&lt;ref name=tiger/&gt;  However, through a series of transactions,{{#tag:ref|The Canucks already possessed the 3rd overall pick in the [[1999 NHL Entry Draft]] that was used to select Henrik Sedin.

#The 4th overall pick acquired from the Blackhawks was then traded along with two third-round picks in the 1999 draft (75th and 88th) to the [[Tampa Bay Lightning]] in exchange for the Lightning's first-round pick (1st overall).
#The 1st overall pick acquired from the Lightning, along with a conditional third-round pick in the 2000 draft, was then traded to the [[Atlanta Thrashers]] for the Thrashers' first-round pick (2nd overall) under the condition that then-Thrashers GM [[Don Waddell]] not select either Sedin with the first overall pick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sedin twins' dynamics changed draft|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/hockey/nhl/1999/draft/news/1999/06/26/nhldraft_twins/|accessdate=2010-08-22|date=1999-06-26|publisher=''[[Sports Illustrated]]''|author=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=notes}} Canucks general manager [[Brian Burke (ice hockey)|Brian Burke]] obtained the second and third overall picks, which he used to select Daniel and Henrik, respectively.

Henrik played for the first time in North America with Sweden's national under-17 team at the 1997 [[World U17 Hockey Challenge]], held in [[Alberta]]. Recording 20 points (12 goals and 8 assists) over 6 games, he helped Sweden to a silver medal. After going undefeated in five contests, they were defeated in the gold medal game by Team [[Ontario]] 6–2.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Before they were stars: 25 years of great performances at the World U17 Hockey Challenge|url=http://www.hockeycanada.ca/index.php/ci_id/156190/la_id/1/|accessdate=2011-03-11|date=2011-01-01|publisher=[[Hockey Canada]]|author=Derek Jory}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Henrik competed for Sweden at the 1997 European Junior Championships, recording three goals and seven points over six games.  He joined Sweden for the 1998 European Junior Championships, the final game of which required Sweden to beat Russia by four goals to surpass Finland in [[goal difference|goal differential]] and win the gold medal.  Henrik recorded a goal and an assist against Russia as Sweden won 5–1.&lt;ref name=mirror/&gt;

In his NHL draft year, Henrik competed for Sweden at the [[1999 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships|1999 World Junior Championships]] in [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]].  He recorded nine points in six games, fifth in tournament scoring and second in team scoring to brother Daniel, as Sweden failed to win a medal. Later that year, Henrik made his international debut for the [[Sweden men's national ice hockey team|Swedish national men's team]] at the [[1999 Men's World Ice Hockey Championships|1999 World Championships]] in [[Norway]]. He scored no points in eight games as Sweden won the bronze medal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Schedule/Results|url=http://hockeycanada.ca/index.php/ci_id/22056/la_id/1.htm|accessdate=2010-05-04|publisher=[[Hockey Canada]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, Henrik once again competed in both the [[2000 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships|World Junior]] and [[2000 Men's World Ice Hockey Championships|Senior Championships]].  At the junior tournament in Sweden, Henrik led the tournament with 13&amp;nbsp;points in seven games,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scoring leaders|url=http://www.iihf.com/hockey/x/9900/U20a/gs/pg000007.htm|accessdate=2010-04-18|publisher=[[International Ice Hockey Federation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Sweden did not earn a medal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Final rankings|url=http://www.iihf.com/hockey/x/9900/U20a/9900/htm/u20a_fr.htm|accessdate=2010-04-17|publisher=[[International Ice Hockey Federation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the World Championships, Henrik recorded five points as Sweden again failed to medal.

Following his rookie season with the Vancouver Canucks, Henrik made his third World Championships appearance, in [[2001 IIHF World Championship|2001]] in [[Germany]]. He earned his second bronze medal in three years as Sweden defeated the [[United States national men's ice hockey team|United States]] 3–2 in the bronze medal game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Playoff Round|url=http://www.iihf.com/hockey/x/0001/WS/cs/pg000010.htm|accessdate=2010-05-04|publisher=[[International Ice Hockey Federation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He made a fourth tournament appearance at the [[2005 IIHF World Championship|2005 World Championships]] in [[Austria]].

==Playing style==
Throughout his career, Henrik has scored more assists than goals. Known as a [[wiktionary:playmaker|playmaker]],&lt;ref name=surprise/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;have hart&quot;/&gt; he starts play sequences that lead to goals with passes to his teammates.

Beginning around the [[2008–09 NHL season|2008–09 season]], Henrik began to expand his skill-set by scoring more goals. His increased tendency to shoot was given an extra push when Daniel suffered the first major injury of his career early in the [[2009–10 NHL season|2009–10 season]], forcing Henrik to play without his brother and consequently pass less often.&lt;ref name=surprise/&gt;  He recorded the first two 20-goal seasons of his career in 2008–09 and 2009–10, and increased his shot totals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Henrik Sedin|url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/player.htm?id=8467876|accessdate=2010-04-19|publisher=[[National Hockey League]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With his offensive skill the prime component of his game, Henrik is known to avoid initiating contact with opposing players.  Early in their career, he and Daniel were knocked off the puck easily, leading many in the media to refer to them as the &quot;Sedin Sisters&quot;.&lt;ref name=surprise/&gt;  As a result, players have often taken advantage of the brothers' lack of physicality by playing aggressively against them. This once led Canucks general manager [[Brian Burke (ice hockey)|Brian Burke]] to publicly complain, commenting during a [[2002 Stanley Cup playoffs|2002 playoff]] series against the [[Detroit Red Wings]], {{&quot;'}}Sedin' is not Swedish for 'punch me or headlock me in a scrum'.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Top Canucks prospect Cody Hodgson to return to game action|url=http://www.faceoff.com/hockey/teams/story.html?id=2510345&amp;add_feed_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.faceoff.com%2Fscripts%2FSP6Atom.aspx%3Fid%3D830270|accessdate=2010-04-19|date=2010-02-01|publisher=''[[Vancouver Sun]]''|author=Elliott Papp}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As their careers progressed, the Sedins have worked on their strength, improving their puck possession and allowing them to play more effectively.&lt;ref name=surprise/&gt;
