'''George Henry Stevens &quot;Harry&quot; Trott''' (5 August 1866 &amp;ndash; 10 November 1917) was an [[Australian]] [[Test cricket]]er who played 24 [[Test cricket|Test matches]] as an [[all-rounder]] between 1888 and 1898. Although Trott was a versatile batsman, spin bowler and outstanding fielder, &quot;...&amp;nbsp;it is as a [[captain (cricket)|captain]] that he is best remembered, an understanding judge of human nature&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robinson&quot;&gt;Robinson (1996), pp. 67&amp;ndash;74.&lt;/ref&gt; After a period of some instability and  ill discipline in Australian cricket, he was the first in a succession of assertive Australian captains that included [[Joe Darling]], [[Monty Noble]] and [[Clem Hill]], who restored the prestige of the Test team. Respected by teammates and opponents alike for his cricketing judgement, he was quick to pick up a weakness in opponents.  A right-hand batsman, Trott was known for his sound defence and vigorous hitting. His slow [[leg spin]] bowling was often able to deceive batsmen through subtle variations of pace and [[flight (cricket)|flight]], but allowed opposition batsmen to score quickly.

Trott made his Test debut in 1888 and toured England four times; 1888, 1890, 1893 and 1896, scoring over 1000 runs on each occasion. For the tour in 1896, Trott was elected captain by his team-mates.  Despite England winning the series two Tests to one and retaining [[The Ashes]], Trott's ability as a captain was highly regarded. In the return series in Australia in 1897&amp;ndash;98, Trott's team was more successful, winning the series 4 Tests to 1 and regaining The Ashes. At a time when the [[Federation of Australia|federation of the Australian colonies]] was under discussion, the victory saw Trott praised as a &quot;national institution&quot; and his team as having &quot;done more for the federation of Australian hearts than all the big delegates put together&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robinson&quot;/&gt;

A severe [[mental disorder|mental illness]] abruptly ended the Test career of Trott at the age of 31.  After a series of seizures in 1898, he suffered from [[insomnia]], [[apathy]] and memory loss.  Failing to recover lucidity, he was committed to a [[psychiatric hospital]] for over 400&amp;nbsp;days.  After he was discharged, in time he returned to cricket, once again playing [[first-class cricket]] for his state, [[Victorian Bushrangers|Victoria]], and performing at a consistently high level for his club, [[Casey-South Melbourne Cricket Club|South Melbourne]].  A [[Mail carrier|postman]] by trade, after retirement from cricket Trott served as a [[selector (sport)|selector]] for the Victorian team.

==Early life and career==
Born in [[Collingwood, Victoria|Collingwood]], an inner suburb of [[Melbourne]], Trott was the third of eight children for accountant Adolphus Trott and his wife Mary-Ann (n√©e Stephens).&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last = Pierce|first = Peter|year = 1990|url = http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A120297b.htm|title =  Trott, George Henry Stevens (1866 - 1917)|work = [[Australian Dictionary of Biography]], Online Edition|publisher = [[Australian National University]]|accessdate = 2008-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Haigh&quot;&gt;Haigh (2004), pp. 107&amp;ndash;115&lt;/ref&gt;  His younger brother [[Albert Trott|Albert]] also became a Test cricketer.  The siblings played their junior cricket with the local Capulet club.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;  Harry transferred to [[Casey-South Melbourne Cricket Club|South Melbourne]], which played in Melbourne's [[Victorian Premier Cricket|pennant competition]], after scouts for the club noticed him playing park cricket.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robinson&quot;/&gt;  In his first season, the 18-year-old Trott recorded the best [[batting average#Cricket|batting average]] and [[bowling average]] for the team.&lt;ref name=&quot;Haigh&quot;/&gt; 

Trott made his [[first-class cricket|first-class]] debut for [[Victorian Bushrangers|Victoria]] against an &quot;Australian XI&quot; on New Year's Day 1886, scoring four and 18 [[not out]].&lt;ref name=&quot;FCdebut&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/3/3039.html| title = Victoria v Australian XI: Other First-Class matches 1885/86|publisher = CricketArchive|accessdate = 2008-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Two months later, he played his first inter-colonial match, against [[South Australian Redbacks|South Australia]] at the [[Adelaide Oval]]. Batting, he scored 54&amp;nbsp;runs; his innings included a memorable hit over the [[leg side]] [[boundary (cricket)|boundary]] from the bowling of leading Test all-rounder [[George Giffen]], and he captured seven wickets for the match with his bowling.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robinson&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SSdebut&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/3/3042.html| title = South Australia v Victoria: Other First-Class matches 1885/86|publisher = CricketArchive|accessdate =17 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1886&amp;ndash;87, Trott hit a double [[century (cricket)|century]] for South Melbourne in a match against [[St Kilda Cricket Club|St Kilda]] and appeared for Victoria against [[Alfred Shaw]]'s touring English team, claiming four wickets for 125 runs (4/125).&lt;ref name=&quot;PremierCricket&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last = Fiddian  | first = Marc  | year = 1992 | url = http://premier.cricketvictoria.com.au/page/trott_george_henry_harry_stevens.html | title = Trott, George Henry (Harry) Stevens | work = extract from Australian All-Rounders - From Giffen to Gilmour | publisher = [[Victorian Premier Cricket]] | accessdate = 2008-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AShawXI&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/3/3166.html| title = Victoria v A Shaw's XI: A Shaw's XI in Australia 1886/87| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate = 2008-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the next summer, he played for a non-representative &quot;Australian XI&quot; against [[Arthur Shrewsbury]]'s XI and [[George Vernon]]'s XI, two English teams touring Australia simultaneously.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shrew&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/3/3294.html| title = Australian XI v A Shrewsbury's XI: A Shrewsbury's XI in Australia 1887/88| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate = 2008-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Vernon&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/3/3286.html| title = Australian XI v GF Vernon's XI': GF Vernon's XI in Australia 1887/88| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate = 2008-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; His chances for inclusion in the Australian squad for the forthcoming tour of England were enhanced when a number of leading players made themselves unavailable.&lt;ref&gt;Harte (2003), p 154.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Trott's batting credentials were modest: he had scored only one half-century in 29 first-class innings.&lt;ref name=CricArchiveBatting&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/0/109/f_Batting_by_Season.html| title = First-class Batting and Fielding in Each Season by Harry Trott| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate = 2008-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this point, Trott had enjoyed more success with his bowling. Prior to the Australian team departing for England, a change to the [[leg before wicket]] (LBW) law that would aid bowlers of Trott's style seemed imminent. The former Australian player [[Tom Horan]] wrote: &quot;There is no bowler in England who has such a fast leg-break, and on a fine, firm pitch many a batsman has saved his wicket by his legs or body in opposing Trott's deliveries.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Horan&quot;&gt;Horan (1989), pp. 128&amp;ndash;129.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Test cricket==
===First tours of England===
Included in the [[Australian cricket team in England in 1886|Australian squad to tour England]], Trott was selected in the team for the First Test at [[Lord's Cricket Ground|Lord's]]. He had an inauspicious Test debut: he made a [[Duck (cricket)|duck]] in the first innings and three runs in the second, and did not bowl.&lt;ref name=&quot;Debut&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/3/3361.html| title = England v Australia: Australia in England 1888 (1st Test)| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate = 2008-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Australians won the game by 62&amp;nbsp;runs, only their second Test match victory in England.&lt;ref name=&quot;1888win&quot;&gt;{{cite web| year = 1889| url = http://content-www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/150142.html| title = First Test match: England v Australia 1888| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack - online archive| publisher = John Wisden &amp; Co| accessdate = 2008-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, England retained The Ashes by winning the remaining two Tests and Trott's influence on the series was negligible: he did not pass 20 in an innings, and he failed to take a wicket.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wisden1889&quot;&gt;{{cite web| year = 1889| url = http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/152997.html?from=login| title = England 2 Australia 1: The Australian team in England, 1888 | work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack - online archive| publisher = John Wisden &amp; Co| accessdate = 2008-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nevertheless, his performances in the other matches of the season prompted ''[[Wisden Cricketers Almanack]]'' to write that he, &quot;...&amp;nbsp;fully justif[ied] his selection by scoring the highly creditable total of 1,212&amp;nbsp;runs, with an average of over 19 per innings&quot;, and that his [[fielding (cricket)|fielding]] was &quot;excellent at [[fielding (cricket)#Fielding position names and locations|point]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wisden1889&quot;/&gt;  ''Wisden'' was less complimentary about his bowling: &quot;We have no great opinion of Trott's leg break bowling, and think it probably too slow to be effectual against good batsmen.&quot; Trott's opportunities were limited as his teammates [[Charles Turner (cricketer)|Charles Turner]] and [[John Ferris (cricketer)|John Ferris]], &quot;monopolised the bowling&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wisden1889&quot;/&gt;  
[[Image:HarryTrottFielding.jpg|upright|right|thumb|Trott was an outstanding fielder, usually at point]]

On his return to Australia, Trott's batting continued to improve. He scored 172&amp;nbsp;runs for an Australian XI against [[New South Wales Blues|New South Wales]], his maiden century in first-class cricket.&lt;ref name=&quot;FCTon&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/3/3415.html| title = New South Wales v Australian XI: Other First-Class matches 1888/89l| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate = 2008-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'' wrote that the innings &quot;...&amp;nbsp;stamped him as a batsman of the highest class&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;PremierCricket&quot;/&gt; In first-class matches, Trott posted 507&amp;nbsp;runs (at 39.00 average) and claimed 25&amp;nbsp;wickets (at 17.44 average) for the summer, and hit a double century in a club match against [[Melbourne Cricket Club|Melbourne]]. Another good all-round season in 1889&amp;ndash;90 ensured his place for the next trip to England.

The 1890 Australian team touring England was relatively inexperienced.&lt;ref name=&quot;7thAustralians&quot;&gt;Pollard (1988), p. 405.&lt;/ref&gt;  The team missed the [[all-rounder|all-round]] ability of George Giffen who had refused to tour, thinking it unlikely the tour would be a sporting or financial success.&lt;ref name=&quot;Giffen&quot;&gt;Robinson (1996), p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Australians won 13&amp;nbsp;matches on tour, losing&amp;nbsp;16 and [[result (cricket)|drawing]]&amp;nbsp;9.&lt;ref name=&quot;7thAustralians&quot;/&gt;  Trott scored 1,211&amp;nbsp;first-class runs (at 20.87 average) with a highest score of 186 against [[Cambridge University]] Past and Present,&lt;ref name=&quot;1890average&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Events/ENG/Australia_in_England_1890/f_Australians_Batting.html| title = First-class Batting and Fielding for Australians: Australia in England 1890| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate = 2008-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cambridge&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/3/3619.html| title = Cambridge University Past and Present v Australians: Australia in England 1890| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate = 2008-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and captured 20&amp;nbsp;wickets.&lt;ref name=&quot;1890bowlaverage&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Events/ENG/Australia_in_England_1890/f_Australians_Bowling.html| title = First-class Bowling for Australians: Australia in England 1890| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate = 2008-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Disappointed by Trott's performances, ''Wisden'' felt that he &quot;...&amp;nbsp;barely maintained the reputation he had so honestly gained during the tour of 1888 ... it cannot be said that he came up to expectations&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;1891Wisden&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/153714.html| title = The Australians in England, 1890| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack - online archive| publisher = John Wisden &amp; Co| accessdate = 2008-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australian revival and Wisden cricketer of the year===
In 1891&amp;ndash;92, [[Henry Holroyd, 3rd Earl of Sheffield|Lord Sheffield]]'s [[English cricket team in Australia in 1891-92|team]] (captained by [[W. G. Grace]]) toured Australia, the first English side to do so in four years. The presence of Grace contributed to a revival of interest in the game that had waned due to a surfeit of international tours and indifferent performances by the Australian team.&lt;ref&gt;Harte (2003), p173.&lt;/ref&gt; The Australians won the series 2&amp;ndash;1 to regain The Ashes.&lt;ref name=&quot;1893wisden&quot;&gt;{{cite web| year = 1893| url = http://content-www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/150147.html| title = Australia 2 England 1: The England team in Australia, 1891-92| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack - online archive| publisher = John Wisden &amp; Co| accessdate = 2008-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the first Test at [[Melbourne Cricket Ground|Melbourne]], Trott scored three and 23, but had greater impact with the ball. Requiring 213 runs for victory, England's score reached 60 before their first two batsmen were dismissed. The Australian captain [[Jack Blackham]] then gambled by calling on Trott's often inaccurate bowling. Trott took two quick wickets and the English innings never recovered.&lt;ref&gt;Whitington (1974), p 45.&lt;/ref&gt; In returning 3/52 for the innings, ''Wisden'' noted that Trott &quot;bowled admirably&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;1stTest1891Wisden&quot;&gt;{{cite web| year = 1893| url = http://content-www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/153715.html| title = First Test: England v Australia 1891-92| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack - online archive| publisher = John Wisden &amp; Co.| accessdate = 2008-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The remaining two Tests were less productive for Trott: he finished with 48&amp;nbsp;runs (at an average of 8.00) and 6&amp;nbsp;wickets (at an average of 35.00) for the series.&lt;ref name=&quot;1891BattingAverage&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Events/AUS/Lord_Sheffields_XI_in_Australia_1891-92/t_Australia_Batting.html| title = Test Batting and Fielding for Australia: Lord Sheffield's XI in Australia 1891/92| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate = 2008-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;1891BowlingAverage&quot;&gt;{{cite web

A reorganisation of Australian cricket took place in the wake of the tour. The first national body to control the game, the Australasian Cricket Council (ACC), was formed to co-ordinate the Australian Test team. Previously, private entrepreneurs and the players themselves organised international cricket. Lord Sheffield donated money to the ACC, which was used to purchase a trophy for the champion domestic team. Trott appeared in Victoria's inaugural [[Pura Cup|Sheffield Shield]] match, against [[New South Wales Blues|New South Wales]] in December 1892. He scored 63 and 70 not out in a winning effort. The ACC appointed Trott as one of the six players to select the touring team for England.&lt;ref&gt;Harte (2003), pp 176&amp;ndash;177.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Australian cricket team in England in 1893|Australian team toured England in 1893]] to compete for The Ashes.  The English won the series one Test to nil, with two [[result (cricket)|drawn]] to recover The Ashes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wisden1894&quot;&gt;{{cite web| year = 1894

A feature of the summer was the emergence of [[Albert Trott]] and the performance of the brothers in tandem. Playing for Victoria against the touring side, the Trotts claimed twelve wickets and held eight catches between them; Harry scored 63 in the second innings. During the second innings of the traditional Christmas fixture against New South Wales, Albert claimed five wickets, took three catches (two from Harry's bowling) and made a [[run out]].&lt;ref name=&quot;XmasNSW&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/4/4254.html| title = Victoria v New South Wales: Sheffield Shield 1894/95| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate =25 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In between these two games, England won the first Test at  [[Sydney Cricket Ground|Sydney]]&amp;mdash;a remarkable turnaround after they had been forced to [[follow-on]]&amp;mdash;by bowling the Australians out for 166 in the second innings.&lt;ref name=&quot;1stTest1894&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/4/4253.html| title = Australia v England: AE Stoddart's XI in Australia 1894/95 (1st Test)| publisher = CricketArchive | accessdate = 2008-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The second Test at [[Melbourne Cricket Ground|Melbourne]] saw another English victory; Trott played a rearguard innings of 95 in the second innings, to no avail.&lt;ref name=&quot;2ndTest1894&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/4/4255.html| title = Australia v England: AE Stoddart's XI in Australia 1894/95 (2nd Test)| publisher = CricketArchive | accessdate = 2008-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Attempting to stay in the series, Australia dramatically revamped their team for the next Test at [[Adelaide Oval|Adelaide]]. Albert Trott, making his Test debut, was one of four inclusions while Harry was elevated to open the batting. In a match played in intense heat throughout, Harry Trott made 48 on the opening day before he was run out. Albert was the dominant player of the match with innings of 38&amp;nbsp;not&amp;nbsp;out and 72&amp;nbsp;not&amp;nbsp;out (both scored from the [[batting order (cricket)|number ten]] position), and a bowling return of 8/43 in England's second innings. Australia won the match by 382&amp;nbsp;runs.&lt;ref name=&quot;3rdTest&quot;&gt;{{cite web| year = 1896| url = http://content-www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/153728.html

The fluctuating fortunes of the Test series created immense interest in the deciding Test at Melbourne. Spectators arrived from all over the country, with special trains laid on from Adelaide and Sydney.&lt;ref&gt;Harte (2003), p 185.&lt;/ref&gt; Harry Trott's all-round contribution was a score of 42 in each innings, six wickets and two catches, but England won The Ashes by chasing a target of 297 runs in the second innings, which they reached with six wickets in hand.&lt;ref name=&quot;5thTest1894&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/4/4274.html| title = Australia v England: AE Stoddart's XI in Australia 1894/95 (5th Test)| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate = 2008-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MatchofCentury&quot;&gt;{{cite web | year = 1896| url = http://content-www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/153730.html| title = Fifth Test Match: The Match of the Century| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack - online archive| publisher = John Wisden &amp; Co| accessdate = 2008-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even in England, &quot;the interest was greater than had ever been felt in matches played away from [England]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;1896Wisden&quot;&gt;{{cite web| year = 1896| url = http://content-www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/154326.html| title = England in Australia, 1894-95| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack - online archive| publisher = John Wisden &amp; Co| accessdate = 2008-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the following summer, Trott again acted as a Test selector, along with the incumbent Test captain George Giffen and former captain [[Percy McDonnell]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Harte 2003, p 187&quot;&gt;Harte (2003), p 187.&lt;/ref&gt; When choosing the Australian team for the previous tour of England, Giffen used his influence to ensure the selection of his younger brother, [[Walter Giffen|Walter]]. The team chosen for the 1896 tour of England included a number of promising young players, including [[Joe Darling]] and Clem Hill, both of whom went on to captain Australia. Albert Trott was a controversial omission, in light of performances in the previous Ashes series, but he accompanied the team on their voyage and later settled in England. He had a successful career with [[Middlesex County Cricket Club|Middlesex]] and appeared for England in two Test matches against [[South Africa]]. The cricket historian [[David Frith]] records that when the Trott brothers encountered each other on an English street, they merely exchanged acknowledging nods and kept walking.&lt;ref&gt;Frith (1984), p 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the team was en route to England, the players elected Trott as [[captain (cricket)|captain]] ahead of George Giffen.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robinson&quot;/&gt; On the opening day of the first Test  at Lord's, England bowled Australia out in 75&amp;nbsp;minutes for only 53&amp;nbsp;runs on a pitch thought to be good for batting.&lt;ref name=&quot;1stTest1896Wisden&quot;&gt;{{cite web| year =1897| url = http://content-www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/153734.html| title = First Test Match: England v Australia 1896| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack - online archive| publisher = John Wisden &amp; Co| accessdate = 2008-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In reply, England made 292 with Trott taking two wickets.&lt;ref name=&quot;IstTest1896&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/4/4565.html|title = England v Australia: Australia in England 1896 (1st Test)| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate = 2008-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In their second innings, Australia was still 177 runs in arrears with three wickets down when [[Syd Gregory]] joined Trott at the crease.

Trott made 1297&amp;nbsp;runs and took 44&amp;nbsp;wickets in first-class matches on the tour.&lt;ref name=&quot;1896batting&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Events/ENG/Australia_in_England_1896/f_Australians_Batting.html| title = First-class Batting and Fielding for Australians: Australia in England 1896| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate = 2008-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;1896Bowling&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Events/ENG/Australia_in_England_1896/f_Australians_Bowling.html| title = First-class Bowling for Australians: Australia in England 1896| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate = 2008-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of his batting ''Wisden'' said &quot;Trott's average is a little disappointing, but when a special effort was required he was not often at fault.&quot; and he bowled &quot;on a good many occasions with fair results&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;1896wisden&quot;&gt;{{cite web| year = 1897| url = http://content-www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/154328.html| title = The Australians in England, 1896| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack| publisher = John Wisden &amp; Co.| accessdate = 2008-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; However it was as a captain that Trott earned most plaudits.  ''Wisden'' rated Trott as &quot;with the exception of [Billy Murdoch],&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;incomparably the best captain the Australians had ever had in this country&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;1896wisden&quot;/&gt;

{{Quote|He was by no means anxious for the post, but almost from the first match it was perfectly clear that he was in every way fitted for it. Of course the continuous success of his side made his duties far more pleasant and easy than those of some previous captains, but we feel quite sure that in a season of ill-fortune he would have earned just as great a reputation. Blessed with a temper that nothing could ruffle, he was always master both of himself and his team whatever the position of the game. More than that his judgement in changing the bowling was rarely or never at fault.|''Wisden Cricketers' Almanack''|&lt;ref name=&quot;1896wisden&quot;/&gt;}}

Although the team was considered successful, in spite of the failure to recapture The Ashes, the problems between the players and the administrators continued. Before the team departed Australia, the players arbitrarily replaced one of the selected players without recourse to the ACC.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harte 2003, p 187&quot;/&gt; After the final match in England, Trott and his players broke an agreement to return home in time for the 1896&amp;ndash;97 Australian season. Instead, they organised matches in North America and New Zealand.

===&quot;A national institution&quot;===
Trott retained the captaincy when Andrew Stoddart returned to Australia with his English team in 1897&amp;ndash;98. Stoddart's team got away to a good start when they won the First Test in Sydney by  nine wickets, K. S. Ranjitsinhji scoring 175&amp;nbsp;runs.&lt;ref name=&quot;1stTest1897&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/4/4915.html| title = Australia v England: AE Stoddart's XI in Australia 1897/98 (1st Test)| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate = 2008-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; With Joe Darling, Trott devised a plan to curb Ranjitsinhji's run scoring.  A exponent of the [[batting (cricket)#Leg glance|leg glance]], &quot;Ranji&quot; would take a last look at the field before he took guard.  Taking advantage of this fact, after he took strike, the Australians deliberately weakened the [[Fielding (cricket)#Off and leg side fields|off side]] with two men placed about {{convert|10|m|ft|0|abbv=on}} away from him.  Bowling a [[line and length|leg side line]], the Australians aimed for a catch from a shot played to that side.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pollard1986&quot;&gt;Pollard (1986), p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt; Darling said of the plan, &quot;As soon as he had his last look and the bowler was at the point of delivering the ball, we shifted positions by a few yards, sometimes one way, sometimes the other.  Occasionally, only one would move and sometimes none would move. [...] This eventually put him clean off his game.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pollard1986&quot;/&gt;  The English captain Archie MacLaren agreed saying, &quot;Ranji is in a blue funk&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pollard1986&quot;/&gt; Regardless of the tactics, Ranji made 457&amp;nbsp;runs at an average of 50.77 for the Test series.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ranji&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Events/AUS/AE_Stoddarts_XI_in_Australia_1897-98/t_England_Batting.html| title = Test Batting and Fielding for England: AE Stoddart's XI in Australia 1897/98| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate = 2008-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Image:HarryTrott.jpg|upright|left|thumb|Fond of hats, Trott was seldom seen without one.&lt;ref name=&quot;Haigh&quot;/&gt;]]
Australia fought back to win the Second Test in Melbourne by an innings and 55&amp;nbsp;runs with Trott scoring 79&amp;nbsp;runs.&lt;ref name=&quot;2ndTest1897&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/4/4921.html| title = Australia v England: AE Stoddart's XI in Australia 1897/98 (2nd Test)| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate = 2008-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Third and Fourth Tests were both won by Australia as they retrieved The Ashes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wisden1899&quot;&gt;{{cite web| year = 1899| url = http://content-www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/154329.html| title = England in Australia, 1897-98| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack - online archive| publisher = John Wisden &amp; Co| accessdate = 2008-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Fifth and final Test in Sydney would be Trott's last.  In the Sydney heat, Australia won the Test by 6&amp;nbsp;wickets but Trott had an attack of [[Hyperthermia|sunstroke]]. This caused him to lose the sight in one eye before his last Test innings, where he made 18&amp;nbsp;runs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robinson&quot;/&gt;  In a review of the Test series ''Wisden'' noted that &quot;the Australians owed much to the unfailing skill and tact of Trott as a captain&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wisden1899&quot;/&gt;

During the course of the Test series, a major convention was in progress to discuss the proposed [[Federation of Australia|federation]] of the Australian colonies. However, the victory over England dominated the attention of the Australian public and some newspapers decried the focus on cricket when important matters were being discussed.  Another editor remarked in defence of the public, &quot;We believe that Harry Trott and his ten good men and true have done more for the federation of Australian hearts than all the big delegates put together.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Robinson&quot;/&gt;  In reply to complaints about leave granted to Trott to play cricket, his proud employers at the Post office responded &quot;Harry Trott is a national institution.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Haigh&quot;/&gt;  Passers-by, including men and their families, would stop and look at Trott's home in [[Albert Park, Victoria|Albert Park]] &quot;with the deference of worshippers at a shrine&quot;, in the words of cricket writer [[Ray Robinson (cricket writer)|Ray Robinson]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Robinson&quot;/&gt;

The impetus for federation did not extend to the administration of cricket, however. The ACC continued to attract criticism for being ineffectual and at a meeting of the [[Cricket Victoria|Victorian Cricket Association]] in July 1898, Trott (in his capacity as a delegate for the South Melbourne club) tabled a motion that Victoria secede from the ACC.&lt;ref&gt;Coleman (1993), p 186.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the proposal was defeated by a single vote, Trott was one of twelve Test players who signed a letter to the ACC secretary calling for the disbanding of the organisation.&lt;ref&gt;Harte (2003), p 196.&lt;/ref&gt; Failing to win the support of the players, the ACC folded in January 1900 following the withdrawal of the [[New South Wales Cricket Association]].&lt;ref&gt;Harte (2003), p 202.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Illness and recovery==
Less than six months after leading his team to victory over England, Trott endured a severe mental illness.&lt;ref name=&quot;Haigh&quot;/&gt; While visiting his mother on 8 August 1898, Trott collapsed and lost consciousness. Later, on the train home with his wife, he had another [[Seizure (medicine)|convulsive fit]] and yet another at 10&amp;nbsp;pm that evening, in the presence of a doctor.  Trott passed in and out of consciousness over the next four weeks, unable to work or even communicate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Haigh&quot;/&gt;  His supporters raised [[Australian pound|‚Ç§]]453 to send him for two weeks at a private retreat at [[Woodend, Victoria|Woodend]], a small town north-west of Melbourne. The treatment was unsuccessful and Trott continued to suffer from [[insomnia]], memory loss and [[apathy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Haigh&quot;/&gt;

===Hospitalisation===
[[Image:KewAsylum.jpg|thumb|right|Kew Asylum, circa 1885-1887&amp;mdash;around ten years before Trott's commitment]]
Because Trott's illness precluded his selection for the [[Australian cricket team in England in 1899|1899 Australian team to England]], the Australian captaincy passed to [[Joe Darling]]. On 8 May 1899, Trott was committed to the [[Kew Asylum]], a [[psychiatric hospital]] in the eastern suburbs of Melbourne.&lt;ref name=&quot;Haigh&quot;/&gt;  The facility opened in 1871 during an era when large asylums were in vogue.  By the time of Trott's admission, expert opinion had changed; in January 1898 ''[[The Argus (Australia)|The Argus]]'' reported a specialist's claim that the asylum was likely to make a patient, &quot;just mad enough to be put under restraint&quot;&amp;mdash;that is, worse rather than better.&lt;ref name=&quot;Haigh&quot;/&gt; Trott was recorded as suffering &quot;[[dementia]]&quot; and &quot;[[alcoholism]]&quot;, although there is little empirical evidence for either diagnosis.  Cricket writer [[Gideon Haigh]] suggests that his symptoms would possibly be identified in modern times as [[psychotic depression|depressive psychosis]] and treated with [[antipsychotic]]s or [[electroconvulsive therapy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Haigh&quot;/&gt;

Doctors observed that Trott continually stood in one place, showing little interest in events around him.  A doctor noted on Trott's file: &quot;Refuses to converse not appearing to be able to follow what is said to him. Answers questions in monosyllables. Does not rouse up when subjects are spoken of that formerly he was interested in.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Haigh&quot;/&gt; Attempting to reach him, doctors sent Trott to play cricket which he did in a, &quot;mechanical, indifferent fashion&quot;. In a departure from normal hospital procedure, he was allowed newspapers reporting the details of Darling's Australian side in England; this left him unmoved. Trott's friend Ben Wardill, the secretary of the [[Melbourne Cricket Club]], visited in November 1899 but Trott did not recognise him.&lt;ref name=&quot;Haigh&quot;/&gt;  A fellow patient, when released, wrote of Trott: &quot;Here is a well-known cricketer, whom we once treated as a hero.  But alas! Like everything else, times have changed and he is almost forgotten.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Haigh&quot;/&gt;

===Return to cricket===
In February 1900, Trott played in a cricket match for the asylum team against the North Melbourne Rovers club. To the astonishment of his treating doctors and his teammates, he scored 98&amp;nbsp;runs in 40&amp;nbsp;minutes, including 20 [[boundary (cricket)|fours]] and a [[six (cricket)|six]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Haigh&quot;/&gt;  While the doctors remained cautious about his chances of recovery, Trott played in further matches against other visiting teams and in April 1900, he took a [[hat-trick]] against a team from the Commercial Travellers Association.  Declared to be &quot;recovered&quot;, Trott was discharged after spending 400&amp;nbsp;days at [[Kew Asylum]].  He returned to the South Melbourne team and captained Victoria against Tasmania at [[Launceston, Tasmania|Launceston]] (taking eight wickets) during the 1900&amp;ndash;01 season, but otherwise failed to recapture the form that made him captain of his country.&lt;ref name=&quot;PremierCricket&quot;/&gt;

To aid his convalescence, the [[Postmaster-General's Department]]&amp;mdash;Trott's employer&amp;mdash;transferred him to the post office at [[Bendigo, Victoria|Bendigo]] in central Victoria.&lt;ref name=&quot;Perry&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1902&amp;ndash;03, he turned up uninvited to a Bendigo United Cricket Club practice session and asked to join in.  He played five first-class matches during 1903&amp;ndash;04, scoring 268 runs at an average of 26.80 and taking 13 wickets at 23.53 runs each.&lt;ref name=CricArchiveBatting/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CricArchiveBowling&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/0/109/f_Bowling_by_Season.html|title =  First-class Bowling in Each Season by Harry Trott|publisher = CricketArchive|accessdate = 2008-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his final appearance of the season, he led [[Victorian Bushrangers|Victoria]] against [[Plum Warner]]'s [[English cricket team in Australia in 1903-04|touring English team]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Robinson&quot;/&gt;  He captained the [[Carlton Cricket Club|Carlton club]] for two seasons, before spending two seasons with [[Fitzroy Doncaster Cricket Club|Fitzroy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;PremierCricket&quot;/&gt; During the 1907&amp;ndash;08 season, he led XVIII of Bendigo against the touring English team and made a farewell first-class appearance against the tourists for Victoria.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robinson&quot;/&gt; Opening the bowling, Trott returned 5/116, including the wickets of England's leading batsmen [[Jack Hobbs]] and [[George Gunn]].&lt;ref name=&quot;FinalFCMatch&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/7/7496.html|title = Victoria v Marylebone Cricket Club: Marylebone Cricket Club in Australia 1907/08|publisher = CricketArchive|accessdate = 2008-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Trott later returned to [[Casey-South Melbourne Cricket Club|South Melbourne]], where he played until the age of 44.&lt;ref name=&quot;PremierCricket&quot;/&gt; He led the club on a tour of New Zealand in 1912&amp;ndash;13 and in the next season (his last) he topped the club's batting and bowling averages, for the fifth time as a batsman and the third time as a bowler.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robinson&quot;/&gt;

==Personal life==
[[Image:TrottHouse.jpg|right|thumb|Recent photo of Trott's house, where passers-by stopped to look &quot;with the deference of worshippers at a shrine&quot;&lt;ref name=Robinson/&gt;]]
Trott spent his entire working life in the Post Office, employed as a postman and mail sorter.&lt;ref name=&quot;Haigh&quot;/&gt;  He married Violet Hodson in [[Fitzroy, Victoria|Fitzroy]] on 17 February 1890 and the couple had one son.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; In 1911, Trott became a [[selector (sport)|selector]] for the Victorian team when [[Hugh Trumble]] resigned to take the secretaryship of the [[Melbourne Cricket Club]].  Trott's high standing in the cricket community saw the other candidate for the position withdraw rather than oppose him.&lt;ref name=&quot;Armstrongp222&quot;&gt;Haigh (2001), p. 222.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1912, Trott took the side of the &quot;[[Big Six cricket dispute of 1912|Big Six]]&quot;, the Australian cricketers opposed to the newly formed [[Cricket Australia|Australian Board of Control for International Cricket]]'s attempt to wrest control of touring Australian sides from the players.  At an &quot;indignation meeting&quot; at the Athenaeum Hall on [[Collins Street, Melbourne|Collins Street]] in Melbourne, the ''Argus'' reported Trott as saying that &quot;to say he was disgusted with the Board of Control was to put it mildly&quot; and that &quot;[h]e would like to shake hands with the six men who had stood out against the Board&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Armstrongp232&quot;&gt;Haigh (2001), p. 232.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the age of 51, Trott died of [[Hodgkin's lymphoma]], at his home in inner-suburban [[Albert Park, Victoria|Albert Park]] on 9 November 1917. He was buried at [[Brighton Cemetery]] where, two years later, a large monument was erected over his grave, paid for by the [[Cricket Victoria|Victorian Cricket Association]] and cricket enthusiasts.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coleman (1993), p 292.&lt;/ref&gt; His great-grandson, [[Stuart Trott]], played 200 games for [[St Kilda Football Club|St Kilda]] and [[Hawthorn Football Club|Hawthorn]] in the [[Australian Football League|Victorian Football League]] between 1967 and 1977.&lt;ref name=&quot;Main&quot;&gt;Main, p. 441.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[South Africa]]n-born English cricketer [[Jonathan Trott]] says he is a distant relation to Harry and Albert Trott.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jonathan&quot;&gt;{{cite news | first = Simon | last = Wilde | title = Trott to prove there‚Äôs room for two egos | url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/cricket/article1977489.ece | publisher = [[The Times]] | date = 24 July 2007 | accessdate = 2008-05-22 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trott's role in Australian cricket was recognised by the clubs for which he had played.  Until 2005, Trott's club team, [[Casey-South Melbourne Cricket Club|South Melbourne Cricket Club]] was based at Harry Trott Oval in [[Albert Park and Lake|Albert Park]],&lt;ref name=&quot;AlbertPark&quot;&gt;{{cite news| first = Nabila| last = Ahmed| title = South Melbourne draws stumps, heads south-east| url = http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/11/18/1100748140556.html?from=storylhs| publisher = [[The Age]]| date = 19 November 2004| accessdate = 2008-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Bendigo United Cricket Club, for whom Trott played in 1902, still play at the Harry Trott Oval in the [[Bendigo, Victoria|Bendigo]] suburb of [[Kennington, Victoria|Kennington]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Robinson&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BUCC1&quot;&gt;{{cite news | title = Home, sweet home | url = http://www.bendigo.yourguide.com.au/news/sport/general/home-sweet-home/1196723.html| publisher = [[The Advertiser (Bendigo)|The (Bendigo) Advertiser]]| date = 6 March 2008| accessdate = 2008-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;weekly&quot;&gt;{{cite news | title = Sports Goss - Harry‚Äôs Oval| url = http://www.bendigoweekly.com/articles/3563/1/Sports-Goss/Page1.html| publisher = [[Bendigo Weekly]]| date = 27 April 2007| accessdate = 2008-04-21}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Playing style===
The authoritative cricket journal ''[[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack]]'', in an obituary, wrote &quot;Australia has produced greater cricketers than Harry Trott, but in his day he held a place in the front rank of the world's famous players. He was a first-rate bat, a fine field at point, and his leg breaks made him a very effective change bowler.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Obit&quot;&gt;{{cite web| last = Pardon| first = Sydney| year = 1918 | url = http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/155607.html?from=login| title = George ('Harry') Trott| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack - online archive| publisher = John Wisden &amp; Co| accessdate = 2008-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a batsman, Trott scored his runs mostly in front the wicket.  He often lifted his [[Batting (cricket)#Drive|on-drives]] and was an exponent of the [[Batting (cricket)#Cut|late cut]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Robinson&quot;/&gt; George Giffen said of Trott, &quot;On a good wicket, I have seen Harry Trott adopt forcing tactics worthy of the big hitter, and in the very next match play keeps on a difficult pitch with wonderful skill.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pollard&quot;&gt;Pollard (1988), pp. 1068&amp;ndash;1069.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Wisden Cricketers' Almanack'' described Trott as &quot;one of the soundest [Australian batsman], combining as he does vigorous hitting with a strong, watchful defence&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;WCOTY&quot;/&gt;

Trott was able to obtain turn from all types of pitches bowling his loopy [[leg spin]]ners, through varying his pace and [[flight (cricket)|flight]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Robinson&quot;/&gt; He was noted for giving young batsmen a [[full toss]] on the [[leg side]], allowing the batsman to hit it to the [[boundary (cricket)|boundary]].  The next ball would seem identical, but for a subtle change in the position of a [[fielding (cricket)|fielder]], resulting in a catch and the comment, &quot;That first ball was to give you confidence, son.  The second to teach you a lesson.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Armstrongp24&quot;&gt;Haigh (2001), p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Warwick Armstrong]], a childhood admirer and later team-mate of Trott, said &quot;Trott had an almost uncanny knowledge of batsman who were likely to succumb to his wiles and after he had met with a success, he would at once take himself off and put on some other bowler of a different type.&quot;&lt;ref name&quot;Armstrongp25&gt;Haigh (2001), p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Wisden'' thought his bowling was &quot;too slow to be effectual against good batsmen&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wisden1889&quot;/&gt; and &quot;that though he may now and then get a wicket, runs are sure to come at the rate of six or eight an over&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;WCOTY&quot;/&gt;

Clem Hill said, &quot;As a captain Harry Trott was in a class by himself&amp;mdash;the best I ever played under.  Harry was quick to grasp a situation. He saw an opponent's weakness in a second. [...] Time and time again, he got a champion batsman's wicket by putting on a bowler he knew the batsman did not like.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Robinson&quot;/&gt;  The English batsman K. S. Ranjitsinhji considered Trott as a captain &quot;without a superior anywhere today&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Haigh&quot;/&gt; ''Wisden'' thought him, &quot;with the exception of &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Billy Murdoch]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; ... incomparably the best captain the Australians had ever had in this country.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wisden1897&quot;&gt;{{cite web|year = 1897| url = http://content-www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/154328.html|title = England 2 Australia 1: The Australians in England, 1896|work = ''Wisden Cricketers' Almanack - online archive|publisher = John Wisden &amp; Co|accessdate = 2008-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sporting newspaper, ''The Referee'' wrote &quot;[Trott's] bowlers felt he understood the gruelling nature of their work and that they had his sympathy in the grimmest of battles.&quot; Some English [[History of English amateur cricket|professional cricketers]] thought less of Trott's captaincy; wicket-keeper [[William Storer]] said, &quot;I like a captain to have a settled plan, [Trott] just seemed to do whatever he thought of at the moment.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Robinson&quot;/&gt;

===Personality===
Trott's sense of humour was well-known.  He originated a persistent myth that workers at the [[Sheffield]] steelworks generated extra plumes of smoke when the Australians were batting at nearby [[Bramall Lane]], in order to reduce the quality of the light.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robinson&quot;/&gt;  When Australia played the [[Philadelphia cricket team|Gentlemen of Philadelphia]] in the United States, a local reporter asked Trott why Australians did not play [[baseball]]. He replied: &quot;Running around in circles makes us giddy.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Robinson&quot;/&gt;  When Trott, a humble postman, met the [[Prince of Wales]] (later [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Edward VII]]) in 1896, his teammates admired his natural ease of manner in the presence of royalty.  Given a cigar by the Prince, Trott simply smoked it, to the surprise of those who thought a royal souvenir worth keeping.  With this in mind, Trott later played a practical joke when he returned home. Gathering cigar butts on board the ship before disembarking in Australia, he distributed them to his friends claiming it was the one given to him by the Prince of Wales; he asked the recipients not to tell others in case it provoked jealousy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robinson&quot;/&gt;  Trott was extremely fond of hats; a teammate described him as, &quot;...&amp;nbsp;the only man I have seen who, in the nude, had to have a hat on his head&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Haigh&quot;/&gt;

[[Jack Pollard]] wrote &quot;It was said that [Trott] never made an enemy and was universally admired.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pollard&quot;/&gt;  His rival, England captain Archie MacLaren said &quot;I would give anything to play the game as keenly and yet as light-heartedly as Trott's lads did.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pollardp140&quot;&gt;Pollard (1986), p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt; 

{{quote|The personal popularity that Harry Trott enjoyed&amp;nbsp;... was remarkable. One is inclined to think that no Australian captain before or since, was liked so much by his opponents. By sheer force of character he overcame the disadvantages involved in lack of education, and won the warm regard of men with whom, apart from the comradeship of the cricket field, he had nothing in common.|''Wisden Cricketers' Almanack'' obituary|&lt;ref name=&quot;Obit&quot;/&gt;}}
