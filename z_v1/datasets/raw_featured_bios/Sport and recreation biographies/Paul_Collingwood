== Domestic career ==
Paul Collingwood signed for [[Durham County Cricket Club|Durham]], his local [[county]] side, in 1995, playing first in [[List A cricket|List A]] [[one-day cricket]].&lt;ref name=FirstClassDebut&gt;{{Cite web

| title = Player archive &amp;ndash; Paul Collingwood

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When he first came to Durham's attention, Collingwood was regarded &quot;as a bowler who batted a bit&quot;. According to coach [[Geoff Cook]]'s 2006 assessment it was Collingwood's determination, rather than his talent, that shone through.&lt;ref name=earlycareer/&gt;

{{cquote|Paul had talent... but I don't think he had any more [talent] than a number of lads who came through with him at the time...He had terrible luck with his back, he missed an awful lot of cricket, and a lesser character could well have decided to call it a day. To his credit, Paul came back and worked harder than he'd ever done before. He couldn't bowl as much at the start, so he did an awful lot more batting and, straight away, there were obvious signs of talent there. By the time he forced his way into the Under-19 team he was batting at the top of the order and the following year he was offered a professional contract.}}

Collingwood made his [[first-class cricket|first&amp;ndash;class]] debut against [[Northamptonshire County Cricket Club|Northamptonshire]] in 1996, at Durham's [[Riverside Ground]].  He made an immediate impression by taking the [[wicket]] of former England all-rounder [[David Capel]] with his first ball, and scoring 91 in his first innings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, his early years as a first-class player were characterised by steady and relatively modest performances with bat and ball: in each season from 1996 to 2000, his [[batting average]] was between 20 and 30 and his [[bowling average]] was between 30 and 60.&lt;ref name=&quot;1stbatting&quot;&gt;{{Cite web

His breakthrough began in 2000, when he was voted Player of the Year by the Durham members, particularly for his one-day efforts.&lt;ref name=&quot;ECB&quot;&gt;{{Cite web

}}{{dead link|date=August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; His form varied following a back injury, but he hit his stride in 2001, when he excelled both in the [[county championship]] and in the one-day game.&lt;ref name=&quot;ECB&quot;/&gt; In the six English seasons from 2001, Collingwood has exceeded a batting average of 40 four times and achieved a bowling average of less than 40 on three occasions.&lt;ref name=1stbatting/&gt;&lt;ref name=1stbowling/&gt;

Recognising his need to improve his all-round game Collingwood took himself off to Australia for their 2000-01 season where he played for the long-established Richmond Cricket Club in the tough Melbourne Premier League. At the end of the season Collingwood was awarded the prestigious Jack Ryder Medal for the best player in the league (an award he shared), and was the first - and so far only - Richmond player to ever receive it.

Durham only achieved first-class status in 1992.&lt;ref name=&quot;Durhamhist&quot;&gt;{{Cite web

Following in 2007 with the Friends Provident Trophy, beating Hampshire by 125 runs, Collingwood picking up 22 runs and bowling figures of 3/33.&lt;ref name=Durhamhist/&gt; However, Collingwood's involvement was severely limited by his England commitments and he made no appearances at all in either competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

This stood in marked contrast to the previous season, when Collingwood was available to Durham for four of the five Tests, before his England recall for the final [[The Ashes|Ashes]] Test; he &quot;pushed his claims for a Test recall with three centuries in four innings in the Frizzell County Championship.&quot;&lt;ref name=ECB/&gt; In just 13 appearances in the County Championship in that 2005 season, Collingwood scored 1103 runs and took 21 wickets, averaging 55.15 and 31.90 respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

In the traditional reward for services to a county, Durham awarded Collingwood a [[Benefit (sports)|benefit year]] for 2007.  He chose to support two charities through his benefit, [[Marie Curie Cancer Care]] and the [[Cricket Foundation]]'s &quot;[[Chance to Shine]]&quot; project, which encourages cricket coaching in [[state school]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Half an hour after [[Michael Vaughan]] resigned from the Test captaincy, Collingwood relinquished charge of the ODI squad because it was affecting his ability to enjoy the game. Collingwood told his wife on the night before his century against South Africa that it was time to go.  He later explained, &quot;I've found the extra workload to be very difficult [...].  It's mentally tiring, and that's the top and bottom of it.  I want to have a smile on my face when I'm playing cricket, and, if I'd have kept going, I'm not sure that would have been the case.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cricketworld.com/michael-vaughan-stands-down-as-england-test-captain/16684.htm Michael Vaughan Stands Down As England Test Captain], Cricket World, retrieved 3 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/england/7539673.stm Collingwood explains resignation]&quot;, 3 August 2008, BBC Sport.

=== 2009 ===
[[File:Collingwood in the 2009 Ashes at Cardiff.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Collingwood plays down the ground during the first Test of the 2009 Ashes at the [[SWALEC Stadium]].]]

Collingwood deputised as England wicket-keeper for an injured [[Matt Prior]] in the second home Test against the West Indies in May 2009; he enjoyed the experience and was generally successful, including effecting a catch from an edge by [[Shivnarine Chanderpaul]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Vic Marks|Marks, Vic]], [http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/blog/2009/may/18/paul-collingwood-wicketkeeper-england Cheerful Collingwood catches the mood of England's almost perfect victory], 18 May 2009, The Guardian. Retrieved 25 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Collingwood's form in the 2009 World Twenty20 tournament wasn't good: in five innings, managing just 63 runs. More important, however, was his form in the longest version of the game, in which he had attained something like a peak. Going into the 2009 Ashes, indeed, he was relishing his best-ever run in the Test side, having hoarded three centuries in his last twelve innings.&lt;ref&gt;Hoult, Nick. &quot;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/cricket/international/theashes/5601764/Ashes-2009-England-squad-form-guide.html Ashes 2009: England squad form guide.&quot;] ''[[The Daily Telegraph|telegraph.co.uk]]''. 22 June [[2009 in literature|2009]]. (accessed 28 June 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first Test of the [[2009 Ashes]] at the [[SWALEC Stadium]] in Cardiff, Collingwood scored 64 in the first innings as England totalled 435. On a flat wicket, however, this was put into context by the Australians, who amassed 674 for 6 declared, with four centurions; Collingwood bowled nine overs, and claimed the wicket of [[Brad Haddin]] caught at deep midwicket. In reply, England slid to 70 for 5 and seemed certain to succumb to an innings defeat. In response, Collingwood stayed at the crease for 5¾ hours (nearly the whole of the final day) and top-scored for England with 74 runs from 245 balls. He was ninth man out, edging [[Peter Siddle]] to gully, but final pair [[James Anderson (cricketer)|James Anderson]] and [[Monty Panesar]] blocked out the final 11½ overs of the match to secure an improbable draw.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cricinfo.com/engvaus2009/engine/current/match/345970.html England v Australia at Cardiff, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second Test at [[Lord's cricket ground|Lord's]] Collingwood succumbed to a loose first-innings dismissal, chipping part-time spinner [[Michael Clarke (cricketer)|Michael Clarke]] to mid-on for 16 (and earning the ire of his captain [[Andrew Strauss]], who went on to score 161); England, poised at 302 for 3 before Collingwood's dismissal, subsided to 425 all out. Nonetheless, England's seamers bowled Australia out for 215, and in the second innings Collingwood scored a measured 54, acting as foil to the aggressive strokeplay of [[Matt Prior]] (their partnership adding 86 in twelve overs) and [[Andrew Flintoff]] (51 in eight overs). As Flintoff and [[Graeme Swann]] combined to bowl England to victory, Collingwood contributed two fine slip catches.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cricinfo.com/engvaus2009/engine/current/match/345971.html England v Australia at Lord's, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Paul collingwood warm up.JPG|thumb|left|300px|Collingwood warming up before Englands ODI against Australia at the [[Rose Bowl, Southampton|Rose Bowl]] on 22 June 2010.]]
After Lord's, however, his form tailed away considerably: tormented by Australia's seam-bowling attack, his scores for the rest of the series were 13, 0 and 4, and 24 and 1, bringing his batting average for the five-match series down to 27.78. Collingwood's difficulties with the bat seemed to affect his usually high-class catching, and he dropped three chances of varying degrees of difficulty on the final day of the series at [[the Oval]], though he did take a sharp catch to dismiss [[Mitchell Johnson (cricketer)|Mitchell Johnson]] for a duck off [[Steve Harmison]] as part of England's surge to a 197-run victory in the match, and a 2–1 victory in the series.

Against South Africa in November 2009, Collingwood surpassed [[Alec Stewart]]'s record of 170 ODIs to become England's most capped player.&lt;ref name=&quot;odimatches&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/england/8373186.stm Paul Collingwood inspires England win in South Africa], 22 November 2009, [[BBC Sport]]. Retrieved 25 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===2010 World Twenty20 and Australia===
In early 2010, Collingwood led the England Twenty20 team to the [[2010 World Twenty20]] championship. Collingwood appeared in all seven games, struggling with the bat as he scored only 61 runs at 10.16, with the ball he only bowled one over for ten runs, however his prowess in the field continued - his four catches the joint highest with the wicket keeper, [[Craig Kieswetter]], for the England team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Events/WI/ICC_World_Twenty20_2010/England_Bowling.html|title=Bowling for England - ICC World Twenty20 2010|work=Cricket Archive|accessdate=25 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Events/WI/ICC_World_Twenty20_2010/England_Batting.html|title=Batting and Fielding for England - ICC World Twenty20 2010|work=Cricket Archive|accessdate=25 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was Collingwood's captaincy that was most praised, as he led England to their first ever ICC trophy, hitting the winning runs in their seven-wicket victory over Australia in the final.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Articles/12/12735.html|title=England lift ICC World T20 title|last=Sabastian|first=Jinu|date=16 May 2010|work=Cricket Archive|accessdate=25 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Collingwood was then rested for the home Test series against Bangladesh, however returned for the five-match ODI series against Australia in June. During the second match, he overtook Alec Stewart's record to become England's all-time leading runscorer in the format.&lt;ref name=&quot;odiruns&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/england/8756611.stm Broad inspires England to win over Australia], 24 June 2010, [[BBC Sport]].
