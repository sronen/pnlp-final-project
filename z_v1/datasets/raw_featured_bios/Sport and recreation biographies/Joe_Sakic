'''Joseph Steven &quot;Joe&quot; Sakic''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|s|æ|k|ɨ|k}};&lt;ref&gt;Emrick, Mike (2002). [http://www.usatoday.com/sports/hockey/shn/pronunc.htm NHL pronunciation guide]. Retrieved on 2007-09-20.&lt;/ref&gt; born July 7, 1969) is a former Canadian professional [[ice hockey]] player and current hockey executive. He played his entire [[National Hockey League]] career with the [[Quebec Nordiques]]/[[Colorado Avalanche]] franchise. In his 20-year tenure, Sakic won the [[Stanley Cup]] twice, won numerous NHL trophies, and was voted into 13 [[NHL All-Star Game]]s. Named [[captain (ice hockey)|captain]] of the team in [[1992–93 NHL season|1992]] (after serving as a co-captain in [[1990–91 NHL season|1990–91]]), Sakic is regarded as one of most able team leaders in the league's history&lt;ref name=&quot;Rocky Mountain News&quot;/&gt; and able to motivate his team to play at a winning level.&lt;ref name=&quot;Canadian Gold&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Podnieks|first=Andrew|title=Canadian Gold 2002: Making Hockey History|year=2002|publisher=Fenn Publishing Company Ltd.|location=Bolton, Ontario|page=144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the course of his career, Sakic was one of the most productive forwards in the game, having twice scored 50 goals and earning at least 100 points in six different seasons. His [[wrist shot (ice hockey)|wrist shot]], considered one of the best in the NHL, was the source of much of his production as goalies around the league feared this shot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thehockeynews.com/articles/27171-Top-Shelf-Its-all-in-the-wrist-not-mouth-for-Sakic.html|title=Top Shelf: It’s all in the wrist – not mouth – for Sakic|last=Dixon|first=Ryan|date=July 8, 2009|work=The Hockey News|accessdate=July 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the conclusion of the [[2008–09 NHL season]], he was the eighth all-time points leader in the NHL, as well as 14th in all-time goals&lt;ref name=&quot;500 goals&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=417887|title=NHL 500-Goal Scorers |accessdate=2007-11-21|publisher=NHL.com|year=2007|agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 11th in all-time assists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/careerstats.htm?fetchKey=00002ALLAAHAll&amp;sort=assists&amp;viewName=careerLeadersAllSeasons|title=NHL Career Assists Leaders|publisher=NHL.com|accessdate=2009-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[2002 Winter Olympics]], Sakic helped lead [[Canada men's national ice hockey team|Team Canada]] to its first ice hockey gold medal in 50 years, and was voted as the tournament's most valuable player.&lt;ref name=&quot;Canadian Gold&quot;/&gt; He represented the team in six other international competitions, including the [[Canada at the 1998 Winter Olympics|1998]] and [[Canada at the 2006 Winter Olympics|2006]] Winter Olympics. After the [[2000–01 NHL season]], Sakic was named the MVP of the NHL by the [[Hart Memorial Trophy|hockey writers]] and his [[Lester B. Pearson Award|fellow players]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Recordbook&quot;/&gt; He retired from the NHL on July 9, 2009 and had his jersey number retired prior to Avalanche's [[2009–10 NHL season|2009–10 season]] opener on October 1, 2009 at the [[Pepsi Center]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Retired Jersey&quot;/&gt; He is currently an Executive Advisor and Alternate Governor of the Avalanche.

==Early life==
Sakic was born in [[Burnaby]] to Marijan and Slavica Sakic&lt;ref name=&quot;Encyclopedia&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Francis|first=Daniel (Editor)|title=Encyclopedia of British Columbia|year=2000|publisher=Harbour Publishing|location=Madeira Park, BC|isbn=1-55017-200-X|page=806}}&lt;/ref&gt; (originally Šakić, {{IPA-sh|ʃakitɕ|hr}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vecernji.hr/newsroom/sports/more/496937/index.do?show=all|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071017151942/http://vecernji.hr/newsroom/sports/more/496937/index.do?show=all|archivedate=2007-10-17|title=Bilo kuda, Hrvati svuda|publisher=[[Večernji List]]|date=2006-06-08|author=Dražen Brajdić|accessdate=2007-09-20|language=Croatian}}&lt;/ref&gt;), immigrants from [[Croatia]] in what was then [[Yugoslavia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;GrowingUp&quot;/&gt; Growing up in Burnaby, he did not learn to speak [[English language|English]] well until [[kindergarten]], having been raised with [[Croatian language|Croatian]] as his [[mother tongue]].&lt;ref name=&quot;GrowingUp&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/columns/wigge/sakic033006.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060423013801/http://www.nhl.com/columns/wigge/sakic033006.html|archivedate=2006-04-23|title=Powers far beyond mortal men|accessdate=2006-09-19|publisher=NHL.com|year=2006|author=Wigge, Larry}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of four Sakic attended his first NHL game, a match between the [[Vancouver Canucks]] and [[Atlanta Flames]]; after watching the game, Sakic decided that he wanted to become a hockey player. As a smaller player, he was forced to use skill rather than size to excel, and modeled himself after his idol, [[Wayne Gretzky]].&lt;ref name=&quot;No Average Joe&quot;/&gt; After showing exceptional promise as a young hockey player in Burnaby, Sakic was referenced as a new Wayne Gretzky in the making.&lt;ref name=&quot;Encyclopedia&quot;/&gt; He scored 83 goals and 156 points in only 80 games for Burnaby, while attending school at [[Burnaby North Secondary]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kuklaskorner.com/index.php/psh/comments/future_hall_of_famer_joe_sakic_to_retire/ Reference to Joe Sakic's time at the school]&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after, he was added to the [[Lethbridge Broncos]] of the [[Western Hockey League]] for the last part of the [[1985–86 WHL season|1985–86 season]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Legends of Hockey&quot;/&gt;

During the [[1986–87 WHL season]], the Broncos relocated to [[Swift Current, Saskatchewan]], becoming the [[Swift Current Broncos]]. Sakic, playing in his first full season, was named Rookie of the Year of the WHL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rookie of the Year - Jim Piggott Memorial Trophy|url=http://www.whl.ca/records/awards.php?id=55|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071017172358/http://whl.ca/records/awards.php?id=55|archivedate =2007-10-17|publisher=[[Western Hockey League|WHL]]|accessdate =2007-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; He notched 60 goals and 73 assists for 133 points. But while Sakic enjoyed success on the ice, he and his team faced a tragedy on the night of December 30, 1986. The Broncos were driving to a game against the [[Regina Pats]], and due to bad weather conditions, the bus crashed after the driver lost control on a patch of black ice outside of Swift Current. While Sakic was unharmed, four of his teammates (Trent Kresse, Scott Kruger, Chris Mantyka and Brent Ruff) were killed. This incident had a lasting impact on the young Sakic,&lt;ref name=&quot;No Average Joe&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=287938|title=No average Joe - Sakic quietly moving among NHL all-time greats men|accessdate=2007-01-28|publisher=[[NHL|NHL.com]]|year=2007|author=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; who declined to talk about the crash throughout his career.&lt;ref name=&quot;Denial of Death&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/eticket/story?page=swiftcurrent&amp;lpos=spotlight&amp;lid=tab1pos1|title=Denial of Death|accessdate=2007-04-09|publisher=ESPN|year=2007|author=Joyce, Gare}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next year, in [[1987–88 WHL season|1987–88]], Sakic was named the [[Four Broncos Memorial Trophy|WHL Most Valuable Player]] and [[CHL Player of the Year|Canadian Major Junior Player of the Year]]. He scored 160 points (78 goals, 82 assists), tying him with [[Theoren Fleury]] of the [[Moose Jaw Warriors]] for the WHL scoring title.&lt;ref name=&quot;Canadian Gold&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Player of the Year - Four Broncos Memorial Trophy|url=http://whl.ca/records/awards.php?id=50|archiveurl =http://web.archive.org/web/20071017172353/http://whl.ca/records/awards.php?id=50|archivedate=2007-10-17|publisher=[[Western Hockey League|WHL]]|accessdate =2007-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Avalanche Website&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://avalanche.nhl.com/team/app?page=PlayerDetail&amp;playerId=8451101&amp;service=page&amp;tab=bio|title=Colorado Avalanche Team Bio|accessdate=2007-04-10|publisher=Colorado Avalanche|year=2006|author=Colorado Avalanche|authorlink=Colorado Avalanche}} {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==NHL career==
===Quebec Nordiques===
Sakic was drafted 15th overall by the [[Quebec Nordiques]] in the [[1987 NHL Entry Draft]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Recordbook&quot;/&gt; Rather than make the immediate jump, he told the Nordiques management he would prefer to spend the 1987–88 season in Swift Current to prepare for the NHL.&lt;ref name=&quot;Legends of Hockey&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/SearchPlayer.jsp?player=11437|title=Joe Sakic Page|accessdate=2007-04-09|publisher=Legends of Hockey|year=2007|author=Legends of Hockey}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his NHL debut on October 6, 1988, against the [[Hartford Whalers]] and registered an assist. His first NHL goal came two days later against goaltender [[Sean Burke]] of the [[New Jersey Devils]].&lt;ref name = &quot;NHLPA Bio&quot;/&gt; During the season, he wore #88 because his preferred number, #19 was already taken by a teammate, [[Alain Côté (1957)|Alain Côté]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Numbers&quot;&gt;{{cite book  | last = Morrison | first = Scott | authorlink = Scott Morrison (journalist) | title = Hockey Night in Canada By the Numbers: From 00 to 99 |publisher = Key Porter Books Ltd. | year = 2007  | location = Toronto  | page = 232  |isbn = 978-1-552639-84-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title =1988–89 Quebec Nordiques|url =http://www.hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/leagues/seasons/teams/0000471989.html|publisher =The Internet Hockey Database|accessdate =2007-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; While considered a front-runner for the [[Calder Memorial Trophy]] as rookie of the year due to his rapid scoring pace, an ankle injury that forced him to miss 10 games in December and the resulting scoring slump helped quash any hopes of winning the award.&lt;ref name=&quot;Globe and Mail&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last= Beamish |first= Mike|author= Mike Beamish|title= Nords' rookie Sakic hits first slump|work= Vancouver Sun|location= Vancouver|page= E. 1|date= 1989-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; He would finish his rookie season with 62 points in 70 games.

In [[1989–90 NHL season|1989–90]], his second NHL season, Sakic was able to switch his number back to his familiar #19 (Alain Côté had retired over the summer), and scored 102 points, which was ninth overall in the league. At the start of the next season, [[1990–91 NHL season|1990–91]], he was named [[captain (hockey)|co-captain]] along with [[Steven Finn (ice hockey)|Steven Finn]] (Sakic was captain for home games, Finn for away games)&lt;ref name=&quot;Steven Finn&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hockeydraftcentral.com/1984/84057.html|title=1984 NHL Entry Draft: Steven Finn|accessdate=2007-11-21|publisher=HockeyDraftCentral.com|year=2005|author=Hockey Draft Central}}&lt;/ref&gt; and again passed the 100 point mark, improving to 109 points and sixth overall in the league, but would slip during [[1991–92 NHL season|1991–92]] to 94 points, partly as a result of missing eleven games. Early on in the season, Sakic showed some of his leadership qualities, even while [[Mike Hough]] was serving as captain, as he stood firm in the [[Eric Lindros]] holdout issue. With Lindros holding out against the Nordiques, who were one of the worst teams in league, Sakic commented, &quot;We only want players here who have the passion to play the game. I'm tired of hearing that name. He's not here and there are a lot of others in this locker room who really care about the game.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;GrowingUp&quot;/&gt; Lindros was traded a year later, ending the situation and bringing in a number of quality players, which vastly improved the Nordiques.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lindros&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/futures/2006draft/lookback_91_053106.html|title=A look back: 1991|accessdate=2007-04-15|publisher=NHL.com|year=2006|author=Roarke, Shawn P.}}{{dead link|date=November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; During their first four seasons with Joe Sakic, the Nordiques finished last place in the [[Adams Division]] and last in the entire league for three straight years, from [[1988–89 NHL season|1989]] to [[1990–91 NHL season|1991]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Recordbook&quot;/&gt;

Starting with the [[1992–93 NHL season]], Sakic became the sole captain of the franchise.&lt;ref name=&quot;Recordbook&quot;/&gt; Under his leadership, the Nordiques made the playoffs for the first time in six years, and set a franchise record for wins and points in the process (since broken by the [[2000–01 NHL season|2000-01]] Colorado Avalanche team).&lt;ref name=&quot;Recordbook&quot;/&gt; Sakic reached the 100 point plateau, the third time he did so in five years, by scoring 48 goals and 105 points in the regular season, and added another 6 points in the playoffs. His production went down slightly to 92 points in [[1993–94 NHL season|1993–94]] as the Nordiques failed to make the playoffs again. After missing part of the [[1994–95 NHL season|1994–95]] season due to the players being [[1994–95 NHL lockout|locked out]] by owners, Sakic was 8 points behind [[Jaromír Jágr]] for the scoring title with a fourth place finish, and helped the Nordiques win the division title, their first since the 1985-86 season.&lt;ref name=&quot;Recordbook&quot;/&gt;

===Colorado Avalanche===
In May 1995, the Nordiques announced that the team had been sold and were relocating from Quebec. Before the start of the [[1995–96 NHL season]], the franchise moved to [[Denver, Colorado]] and was renamed the [[Colorado Avalanche]]. Sakic led the team to its first [[Stanley Cup]] championship, scoring 120 points in 82 regular season games and 34 points in 22 playoff games. He was awarded the [[Conn Smythe Trophy]] as the Most Valuable Player of the 1996 NHL playoffs. During the run for the cup, Sakic again proved himself to be an effective team leader. Although he had missed the playoffs in five of his first seven years in the NHL, and lacked any postseason experience, he scored 18 goals, including six game-winners, and 34 points. He was one goal off from the record for goals in a playoff year, and his game-winning goals established a new record.&lt;ref name=&quot;1997 NHL Yearbook&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = National Hockey League  | title = 1997 NHL Yearbook | year = 1996 | publisher = Worldsport Properties | location = Toronto | page = 232}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[1996–97 NHL season|1996–97]] season, Sakic only played in 65 games due to a lacerated calf,&lt;ref name=&quot;Rocky Mountain News&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/nhl/article/0,2777,DRMN_23920_5301508,00.html|title=Sakic lets game, NHL do talking|accessdate=2007-04-10|publisher=Rocky Mountain News|year=2007|author=Sadowski, Rick| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070930223252/http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/nhl/article/0,2777,DRMN_23920_5301508,00.html| archivedate = September 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; yet still managed to score 74 points as the Avalanche earned their first [[President's Trophy]] and third straight division title.&lt;ref name=&quot;NHLPA Bio&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhlpa.com/WebStats/PlayerBiography.asp?ID=4934|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20061115141123/http://www.nhlpa.com/WebStats/PlayerBiography.asp?ID=4934|archivedate=2006-11-15|title=NHLPA Player Bio|accessdate=2007-04-10|publisher=NHLPA|year=2007|author=National Hockey League Players Association|authorlink=National Hockey League Players Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had another great playoff season with 8 goals and 17 assists, and took the Avalanche all the way to the conference finals, where they eventually lost to the [[Detroit Red Wings]] in six games. As a free agent during the summer of 1997, Sakic signed a three year, $21 million [[offer sheet]] with the [[New York Rangers]] as a restricted free agent. Under the collective bargaining agreement at the time, the Avalanche had one week to match the Rangers' offer or let go of Sakic. Colorado would match the offer,&lt;ref name=&quot;Legends of Hockey&quot;/&gt; which instigated a salary raise for many NHL players.&lt;ref name=&quot;TSN about the CBA&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tsn.ca/nhl/news_story/?ID=99378&amp;hubname=nhl|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070519022104/http://www.tsn.ca/nhl/news_story/?ID=99378&amp;hubname=nhl|archivedate=2007-05-19|title=Three key contracts helped kill the CBA|accessdate=2007-04-09|publisher=TSN.ca|year=2004|agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Injuries would again limit Sakic's playing time in the [[1997–98 NHL season|1997–98]] season. While playing in his first Olympics with Team Canada, Sakic hurt his knee and was forced to miss eighteen games with the Avalanche.&lt;ref name=&quot;Avalanche Website&quot;/&gt; In the sixty-four games he did play in, he still scored 63 points, enough to earn him his seventh All-Star appearance.&lt;ref name=&quot;NHLPA Bio&quot;/&gt; He finally rebounded from his injury problems in the [[1998–99 NHL season|1998–99]] season, finishing fifth in the league in scoring with 41 goals and 96 points in only 73 games. He led the Avalanche all the way to within one game of the Stanley Cup finals, where they lost to the eventual Stanley Cup winning Dallas Stars. After the season ended, Sakic was ranked number 94 on ''[[The Hockey News]]''' list of the 100 Greatest Hockey Players.&lt;ref name=&quot;100 Greatest Players&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Dryden | first = Steve  | title = The Top 100 NHL Players Of All Time | year = 1997 | publisher = McClelland &amp; Stewart Inc. | location = Toronto | page = 160 | isbn= 0-7710-4176-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[1999–2000 NHL season|1999–2000]] season, Sakic reached several career milestones. Injuries limited him to only 60 games, but he still managed to lead the team in scoring with 81 points. On December 27, 1999, against the [[St. Louis Blues (ice hockey)|St. Louis Blues]], Sakic earned an assist to become the 56th player in NHL history to reach 1,000 career points.&lt;ref name=&quot;2001 NHL Yearbook&quot;/&gt; Later in the season, on March 23, 2000, he scored a hat trick against the [[Phoenix Coyotes]], and became the 59th player to score 400 career goals.&lt;ref name=&quot;2001 NHL Yearbook&quot;/&gt; It also gave him 1,049 points with the Quebec/Colorado franchise, passing [[Peter Stastny]] as the all-time leader on the team.&lt;ref name=&quot;NHLPA Bio&quot;/&gt; Sakic eclipsed the 100 point mark again in [[2000–01 NHL season|2000–01]], finishing with 118 along with a career best 54 goals. He led the Avalanche to their second Stanley Cup championship, and won the [[Hart Memorial Trophy]], the [[Lady Byng Memorial Trophy]] and the [[Lester B. Pearson Award]]. After the Avalanche defeated the [[New Jersey Devils]] in the 2001 finals in seven games, Sakic received the cup first as the captain. But instead of hoisting it high, he passed it straight to [[Ray Bourque]], a player who had waited a record-breaking 22 seasons to win the Stanley Cup.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pass&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hockeyforum.com/nhl-forum/7602-hockey-tradition-comes-nfl.html|title=A hockey tradition comes to the NFL|accessdate=2007-01-28|publisher=NHL.com|year=2007|author=Weiner, Evan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sakic led the Avalanche in scoring again in the [[2001–02 NHL season|2001–02]] season, finishing sixth in the league with seventy-nine points. On March 9, 2002, he played in his 1,000th career game. The Avalanche once again reached the Western Conference Finals, but lost to the eventual Cup winning [[Detroit Red Wings]]. The following year Sakic appeared in only 58 games, and finished with just 58 points.&lt;ref name=&quot;NHLPA Bio&quot;/&gt; He rebounded the following year, finishing third in the league with 87 points. It also marked the first time since the [[1993–94 NHL season|1993–94]] season that his team did not win the division title, which was won by the [[Vancouver Canucks]].

Following the [[2004–05 NHL lockout]], the Avalanche were forced to lose many of their key players in order to stay below the salary cap.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lockout&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/news/story?id=2116068|title=Sakic, Blake to stay; Forsberg, Foote up in air|accessdate=2007-04-10|publisher=ESPN.com|year=2005|agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even with the loss of teammates [[Peter Forsberg]] and [[Adam Foote]], Sakic still helped the Avalanche get into the playoffs, where they eventually lost to the [[Anaheim Ducks]] in the conference semifinals. In June 2006, Sakic signed a one-year, $5.75 million deal to keep him with the Avalanche for the [[2006–07 NHL season|2006–07]] season.&lt;ref name=&quot;Contract&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.denverpost.com/avalanche/ci_3961182|title=Sakic stays with Avs|accessdate=2006-09-19|publisher=DenverPost.com|year=2006|author=Dater, Adrian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon the retirement of [[Steve Yzerman]] a month later, on July 3, 2006, Sakic became the league leader for most NHL career points scored among active players.

Sakic had another strong season in the [[2006–07 NHL season|2006–07]].

Sakic had an extensive international hockey career, representing Canada at seven international competitions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Canadian Gold&quot;/&gt; After being drafted by the Nordiques in 1987, he went on and helped Canada win the [[World Junior Ice Hockey Championships|1988 World Junior Championship]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Legends of Hockey&quot;/&gt; His next tournament was the [[Ice Hockey World Championships|1991 World Championships]], where Canada won the silver medal and Sakic contributed eleven points in ten games.&lt;ref name=&quot;Legends of Hockey&quot;/&gt; He tried out for the 1991 Canadian Canada Cup team, but was the first player to be cut, being cited for his weak leg strength.&lt;ref name=&quot;Legends of Hockey&quot;/&gt; Sakic was bitter about the experience, feeling he was not given a good enough chance to prove himself, and called the whole experience &quot;a complete waste of time.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Second Chance&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Sakic's Second Chance|url=http://www.chl.ca/HockeyWorldCup/aug15_hkwc_sakic.html|author=Strachan, Al|publisher=[[Toronto Sun]]|date=1996-08-15|accessdate=2007-11-21}}{{dead link|date=November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sakic's first successful professional tournament was the [[Ice Hockey World Championships|1994 World Championships]], where Canada won its first gold medal in the tournament since 1961. Sakic's seven points in eight games were a crucial part of the team's success.&lt;ref name=&quot;Legends of Hockey&quot;/&gt; During the [[1996 World Cup of Hockey]], he played only a minor role in Canada's second place finish as he scored one goal and two assists in six games.&lt;ref name=&quot;1996WCH&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/HockeyWorldCup/stats.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070712191722/http://slam.canoe.ca/HockeyWorldCup/stats.html|archivedate=2007-07-12|title=1996 World Cup of Hockey Statistics|accessdate=2007-04-09|publisher=Canoe – Slam Sports!|year=1996|author=Canadian Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the tournament allowed him to showcase that he was indeed a dominant player who had simply been overlooked.&lt;ref name=&quot;HockeyWinner&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/HockeyWorldCup/sep16_wctucker.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070712191328/http://slam.canoe.ca/HockeyWorldCup/sep16_wctucker.html|archivedate=2007-07-12|title=HOCKEY THE BIG WINNER|accessdate=2007-04-09|publisher=Canoe - Slam Sports!|year=1996|author=Tucker, Larry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sakic's first Olympic appearance came in [[1998 Winter Olympics|1998]] at [[Nagano]], [[Japan]], after the event allowed NHL players to compete for the first time. Bothered by a knee injury, he only scored three points in four games,&lt;ref name=&quot;Avalanche Website&quot;/&gt; as the Canadian squad failed to meet expectations and finished in fourth. Sakic's second Olympic appearance came in the [[2002 Winter Olympics]] in [[Salt Lake City]], [[Utah]]. Led by his strong play, the Canadian team played their way to the gold medal match against Team USA, where Sakic had four points and helped the team win its first gold medal in 50 years. He was later named MVP of the tournament with a cumulative tally of four goals and six assists and became one of the first Canadian members of the [[Triple Gold Club]].&lt;ref name=&quot;TGC&quot;/&gt; Sakic also played a part in Canada's triumph in the [[2004 World Cup of Hockey]], where he scored six points in six games.&lt;ref name=&quot;Legends of Hockey&quot;/&gt;

On December 21, 2005, Sakic was named captain of [[Canada men's national ice hockey team|Team Canada]] for the [[2006 Winter Olympics]] in [[Turin]], [[Italy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;USA Today&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Canada's deep Olympic roster is minus Crosby|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/olympics/torino/hockey/2005-12-21-canada-roster_x.htm|author=Brehm, Mike|publisher=[[USA Today]]|date=2005-12-21|accessdate=2007-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once again, Team Canada was heavily favored and given high expectations, but they failed to medal, finishing seventh overall.&lt;ref name=&quot;New York Times&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=2006 Olympic Winter Games—Hockey: Men; Canada Is Left With Questions and Speculation|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C01E2DF1F3EF937A15751C0A9609C8B63|author=Westhead, Rick|publisher=New York Times|date=2006-02-24|accessdate=2007-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sakic finished the tournament with three points.

==Post-playing career==
After he retired, Sakic decided to take time off from hockey and spent time with his family. In 2011, two years after his retirement, Sakic was hired by the Avalanche to work in their front office. He was named an Executive Advisor and Alternate Governor for the team, effective at the end of the [[2010–11 NHL season|2010–11 season]]. In his role as an advisor, Sakic would advise the team in hockey-related matters, and as an alternate governor, would represent the team at Board of Governors meetings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=557255|title=Joe Sakic joins Av's front office|author=NHL.com|date=2011-03-25|publisher=NHL.com|accessdate=2011-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Milestones===

Sakic recorded his 1000th career point on December 27, 1999, against the [[St. Louis Blues (ice hockey)|St. Louis Blues]].&lt;ref name=&quot;2001 NHL Yearbook&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = National Hockey League  | title = 2001 NHL Yearbook | year = 2000 | publisher = Worldsport Properties | location = Toronto | page = 272}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became the eleventh player to reach 1500 points, doing so on October 25, 2006, with an assist against the [[Washington Capitals]], and the sixth to do so with one franchise.&lt;ref name=&quot;1500 Points&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/news/story?id=2638889|title=Sakic scores 1,500th point|accessdate=2007-05-13|publisher=ESPN|year=2006|agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gordie Howe]], [[Wayne Gretzky]], [[Mario Lemieux]], [[Raymond Bourque]] and [[Steve Yzerman]] are the others who have achieved this feat.&lt;ref name=&quot;No Average Joe&quot;/&gt; On March 22, 2008, Sakic notched his 1,000th career assist against the Edmonton Oilers on a second period goal scored by Tyler Arnason.

Sakic played his 1000th career game on March 9, 2002, against the [[Los Angeles Kings]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Recordbook&quot;&gt;{{cite book  | last = National Hockey League  | authorlink = National Hockey League  | title = National Hockey League Official Guide &amp; Record Book 2007  |publisher = Dan Diamond &amp; Associates, Inc.  | year = 2006  | location = Toronto  | page = 656  |isbn = 978-1-894801-02-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; His 500th career goal came against the [[Vancouver Canucks]] on December 11, 2002.&lt;ref name=&quot;500 Goals&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/story/2002/12/11/sakic021211.html|title=Canucks spoil Sakic's 500th goal|accessdate=2007-11-07|publisher=CBC|year=2006|author=CBC Sports | date=2002-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a February 15, 2007, game against the [[Calgary Flames]], Sakic scored his 600th career goal. He also earned his 900th assist, the sixteenth player to do so, against the Flames, in a game on March 12, 2006.&lt;ref name=&quot;NHL Bio&quot;/&gt;

During the final game of the [[2006–07 NHL season|2006–07]] season, Sakic scored his 100th point of the year. This made him, at age 37, the second oldest player in NHL history, after Gordie Howe, to record 100 points in a regular season.&lt;ref name=&quot;Forbes Article&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://forbes.com/feeds/ap/2007/04/09/ap3592898.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071017170416/http://forbes.com/feeds/ap/2007/04/09/ap3592898.html|archivedate=2007-10-17|title=Sakic Reaches 100 Points As Avs Win|accessdate=2007-04-10|agency=Associated Press|year=2007|author=Stapleton, Arnie}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became the longest active tenured captain in the league, with fifteen seasons leading the Nordiques/Avalanche franchise, after the retirement of Steve Yzerman at the conclusion of the 2005–06 regular season.&lt;ref name=&quot;NHL Bio&quot;/&gt; On March 22, 2008, against the [[Edmonton Oilers]], Sakic recorded the 1000th assist of his career, the 11th player to do so.&lt;ref name=&quot;1000 assists&quot;/&gt; The gloves he wore in the game were later sent to the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref name=&quot;1000 Assists HHOF&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/hockey/2008-03-25-58530803_x.htm|title=Theodore's Shutout Gives Avs Crucial Win|accessdate=2008-03-27|agency=Associated Press|work=USA Today|date=2008-03-25|author=Stapleton, Arnie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alongside [[Bobby Clarke]], [[Wayne Gretzky]] and [[Mark Messier]], Sakic is one of four players to captain his team to a Stanley Cup championship and win the Hart Memorial Trophy in the same year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Trophy Winner&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/NHLAwards/010615_awards1-sun.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070703002347/http://slam.canoe.ca/NHLAwards/010615_awards1-sun.html|archivedate=2007-07-03|title=Sakic is no ordinary Joe|accessdate=2007-05-14|publisher=NBCSports.com|year=2001|author=Zeisberger, Mike}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sakic is also one of twenty-two members in the [[Triple Gold Club]], a term used in ice hockey to describe players who have won an Olympic Gold medal, a World Championship Gold medal and the Stanley Cup.&lt;ref name=&quot;TGC&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iihf.com/iihf-home/history/the-iihf/triple-gold-club.html|title=Hockey's exclusive company–Triple Gold Club|accessdate=2008-11-09|publisher=[[International Ice Hockey Federation]]|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Records===

In his 20-year career with the Nordiques and Avalanche, Sakic has obtained nearly all of the franchise scoring records, including most all-time goals (625), assists (1016), and points (1641). He also holds the franchise record for most games played (1,363),&lt;ref name=&quot;Recordbook 2009&quot;&gt;{{cite book  | last = National Hockey League  | authorlink = National Hockey League  | title = National Hockey League Official Guide &amp; Record Book 2009  |publisher = Dan Diamond &amp; Associates, Inc.  | year = 2008 | location = Toronto  | page = 656  |isbn = 978-1-894801-14-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is on several notable NHL record lists:

&lt;/div&gt;{{-}}

===Leadership===

[[Image:Stastnysakic.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Sakic with [[Paul Stastny]]. When Sakic entered the NHL, he was mentored by [[Peter Šťastný]], Paul's father. Since Paul joined the league in 2006, Sakic has returned the favor by mentoring him.]]
Throughout his career, Sakic was one of the top scorers in the league, but in his early years he was criticized for not leading his team to playoff success.&lt;ref name=&quot;100 Greatest Players&quot;/&gt; While in Quebec, the Nordiques were one of the worst teams in the league, finishing last in their division five out of the seven years Sakic was with the team, including three straight years of being last overall in the league.&lt;ref name=&quot;Recordbook&quot;/&gt; After leading the Avalanche to the Stanley Cup in 1996 with his 34 playoff points, Sakic began to be seen as a leader capable of winning, and he was seen as one of the league's premier players.&lt;ref name=&quot;Recognition&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chl.ca/HockeyWorldCup/sep5_sakic.html|title=Sakic gets what's coming to him|accessdate=2007-11-25|publisher=Canadian Hockey League|year=1996|author=Canadian Press}}{{dead link|date=November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though Sakic was a quiet individual, he was able to motivate his team to play at higher levels, which earned him the respect of his peers and executives.&lt;ref name=&quot;Captain&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/story/2001/06/09/stanleyfinal010609.html|title=Captains Sakic, Stevens are consummate hockey leaders|accessdate=2007-11-26|publisher=CBC|author=Stevens, Neil | date=2001-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first signs of Sakic's leadership began to show while still a member of the Swift Current Broncos of the WHL. After the bus crash that killed four of his teammates, Sakic was seen as the leader of the team, acknowledging that the experience changed his outlook on life. This was further proven during the summer of 1997 when the New York Rangers offered him a large contract, in order to replace captain [[Mark Messier]] (who had left the team for the Vancouver Canucks), which under the rules of the NHL, the Avalanche were able to match.&lt;ref name=&quot;TSN about the CBA&quot;/&gt;

One of the most defining actions of Sakic's career was at the conclusion of the 2001 playoffs. Defying the NHL tradition of the captain being the first to skate around with the Stanley Cup, Sakic passed it off to teammate [[Ray Bourque]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bourque&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title =Avalanche beat Devils to capture Stanley Cup|url =http://www.usatoday.com/sports/hockey/cup01/games/2001-06-09-njcol.htm|author =Allen, Kevin|publisher =[[USA Today]]|date =2001-06-10|accessdate =2007-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bourque, one of the best defensemen to ever play, had been traded to the Avalanche the year before after spending 21 years with the [[Boston Bruins]] and setting the record for most games played without winning the Cup.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bourque Wins&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/nhl/app/?service=page&amp;page=NewsPage&amp;articleid=290833|title=For Bourque, at long last Stanley!|accessdate=2007-11-26|publisher=NHL.com|year=2007|author=Roarke, Shawn P.}}{{dead link|date=December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sakic's handing of the trophy to Bourque is seen as just another example of Sakic's leadership abilities and how he performs through actions rather than words.&lt;ref name=&quot;Captain&quot;/&gt;
