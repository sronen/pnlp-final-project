'''Hedley Verity''' (18&amp;nbsp;May&amp;nbsp;1905&amp;nbsp;– 31&amp;nbsp;July&amp;nbsp;1943) was a professional [[cricket]]er who played for [[Yorkshire County Cricket Club|Yorkshire]] and [[England national cricket team|England]] between 1930 and 1939. A [[Left-arm orthodox spin|slow left-arm orthodox]] bowler, he took 1,956&amp;nbsp;[[Wicket#Dismissing_a_batsman|wickets]] in [[first-class cricket]] at an [[Bowling average|average]] of 14.90 and 144 wickets in 40&amp;nbsp;[[Test cricket|Tests]] at an average of 24.37. Named as one of the [[Wisden Cricketers of the Year]] in 1932, he is regarded as one of the most effective slow left-arm bowlers to have played cricket. Never someone who spun the ball sharply, he achieved success through the accuracy of his bowling. On pitches that were difficult to bat on, particularly ones [[Sticky wicket|affected by rain]], he could be almost impossible to bat against.

Verity was born in Leeds and, from an early age, wished to play cricket for Yorkshire. After establishing a good reputation in local cricket, he signed a contract as a professional cricketer playing in the [[Lancashire League (cricket)|Lancashire League]]. His first season was not a success but, after moving clubs, he began to make a name for himself. Initially a [[Fast_bowling#Categorisation_of_fast_bowling|medium-paced bowler]], he switched to bowling spin in an attempt to secure a place in the Yorkshire team. When [[Wilfred Rhodes]], the incumbent Yorkshire left-arm spinner, announced his retirement, Verity had a successful trial in the team in 1930, and led the national bowling averages. In 1931, his first full season, he achieved the rare feat of taking all 10 wickets in an innings, against [[Warwickshire County Cricket Club]]; the following year, he again took all 10 wickets, against [[Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club|Nottinghamshire]], while conceding just 10 runs. The latter bowling figures remain, as of 2012, a record in first-class cricket for the fewest runs conceded while taking all 10 wickets. He established himself as part of a strong bowling unit, which assisted Yorkshire to the [[County Championship]] seven times in his ten seasons with the club. In that time, Verity was never lower than fifth in the bowling averages and took over 150&amp;nbsp;wickets in every year except his first.

In 1931, he was chosen to play for England for the first time and rose to prominence during a tour to Australia in 1932–33. Afterwards, he played regularly for England and achieved the best performance of his career when he took 15&amp;nbsp;wickets against Australia in a Test match at [[Lord's Cricket Ground]] in 1934. However, critics claimed he was ineffective on good batting pitches, and he was occasionally left out of the England team over the following years. Even so, he had one of the best records of any bowler against [[Donald Bradman]], generally regarded as the greatest batsman in the history of cricket. Verity continued to play for Yorkshire and England until 1939, when the outbreak of the Second World War ended his career.

Verity joined the [[Green Howards]] in 1939, and after training was posted overseas to [[India]], [[Iran|Persia]] and [[Egypt]], achieving the rank of [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|captain]]. During the [[Allied invasion of Sicily]] in 1943, Verity was severely wounded and captured by the Germans. Taken to Italy, he died in [[Caserta]] from his injuries and was buried there.

==Early years==
Verity was born in [[Headingley]], an area of [[Leeds]], on 18&amp;nbsp;May&amp;nbsp;1905. He was the eldest child of Hedley Verity, who worked for a local coal company, and Edith Elwick, a [[Sunday school]] teacher. Verity also had two sisters, Grace and Edith.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, pp. 13, 15.&lt;/ref&gt; The family moved to [[Armley]], then to the more rural location of [[Rawdon, West Yorkshire|Rawdon]].&lt;ref&gt;Hill, pp. 14, 16.&lt;/ref&gt; From an early age, Verity watched [[Yorkshire County Cricket Club|Yorkshire]] play [[County Championship|County Cricket]] matches at Leeds,  Bradford and, during family holidays, Scarborough.&lt;ref name=H18&gt;Hill, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, at [[Aireborough Grammar School|Yeadon and Guiseley Secondary School]], Verity played school cricket, bowling left-arm [[Fast_bowling#Categorisation_of_fast_bowling|medium-paced deliveries]];&lt;ref name=H18/&gt; he maintained this style until 1929 and was capable of bowling both [[inswinger]]s and [[outswinger]]s.&lt;ref name=H23&gt;Hill, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Verity left school aged&amp;nbsp;14 to work for his father, who had established a coal business in [[Guiseley]],&lt;ref&gt;Hill, pp. 18–19.&lt;/ref&gt; and played cricket for Rawdon's second team.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Success on the field persuaded Verity to seek a career in professional cricket and a place in the Yorkshire team.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, pp. 19–20.&lt;/ref&gt; While working for his father, he devoted increasing amounts of time to cricket practice.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, pp. 21–22.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1921, Verity made his debut for Rawdon in league cricket; some of his subsequent performances attracted the notice of the local press, and he took 29&amp;nbsp;wickets at an [[Bowling average|average]] of 13.80 that season.&lt;ref name=H23/&gt; The following season, he was spotted by Yorkshire coach [[George Hirst]] and former England spinner [[Bobby Peel]], who were [[Scout (sport)|talent scouting]] for Yorkshire,&lt;ref name=H23/&gt; and given a trial in the [[cricket nets]] at [[Headingley Stadium|Headingley cricket ground]]. Peel realised Verity was an intelligent bowler who had excellent control of where he pitched the ball, but believed he was not fast enough to be effective for Yorkshire.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, critics in Rawdon began to see increased potential in his batting, which improved steadily; by 1924, the ''[[Yorkshire Evening Post]]'' described Verity as &quot;one of the most promising cricketers in the Leeds district&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, pp. 24–25.&lt;/ref&gt;

Verity moved to play for Horsforth Hall Park in 1924, where his batting became more productive than his bowling.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, pp. 25–26.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1926, when he scored a total of 488&amp;nbsp;runs and took 62&amp;nbsp;wickets to win the Yorkshire Council League prize for best junior bowler, his all-round potential secured a second trial at Yorkshire. Receiving coaching from Hirst, Verity played several matches for the Yorkshire Colts. He was given little bowling to do, suggesting that he was chosen more for his batting at this stage, and was near the bottom of the team's bowling averages.&lt;ref name=coy&gt;
{{Cite web| url = http://www.espncricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/154684.html| title = Hedley Verity (Cricketer of the Year) | work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack  | year = 1932| publisher = John Wisden &amp; Co | location = London | accessdate =11 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hill. p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; Yorkshire did not allocate him to a local club, their practice towards promising cricketers at the time. Hirst was nevertheless impressed by Verity&lt;ref&gt;Hill, pp. 26–27.&lt;/ref&gt; and recommended him to [[Accrington Cricket Club]], a team in the [[Lancashire League (cricket)|Lancashire League]] looking for a professional cricketer. After a trial, Verity signed a contract in September&amp;nbsp;1926.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, pp. 29–31.&lt;/ref&gt;

==League professional==
Verity was unsuccessful during the 1927 season, his only one with Accrington. His bowling was less effective than the club had hoped; he endured spells where he took few wickets and was unable to implement the tactics or bowl in the style that the club expected. His [[Batting_average#Cricket|batting average]] for the season was 5.25. The team, containing players far more experienced than Verity, were unimpressed by his performances and unsympathetic to his difficulties, offering him little support in the field.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, pp. 31–33.&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, the club were prepared to offer an improved contract for 1928, but he declined as Accrington had previously refused to release their players for county cricket.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, pp. 33–34.&lt;/ref&gt; Verity signed a contract with [[Middleton Cricket Club|Middleton]], a club in the [[Central Lancashire Cricket League]]. Limited in resources, the club paid him less than Accrington, but guaranteed his release to play for Yorkshire if he were selected. Playing with young team-mates, Verity worked hard to coach the players and develop team spirit.&lt;ref name=H34-5&gt;Hill, pp. 34–35.&lt;/ref&gt; He made a modest start in his first season, and was initially rated as a useful but unimpressive all-rounder.&lt;ref name=H34-5/&gt; A visit to the Yorkshire nets around this time prompted Verity to alter his bowling style. [[Wilfred Rhodes]], Yorkshire's main spinner since 1898, was considering retirement; he and Hirst suggested that, as there were fewer [[Left-arm orthodox spin|spinners]] than medium-pace bowlers, Verity was more likely to achieve selection if he switched to spin bowling.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; With the support of the Middleton team and committee, Verity started bowling spin at the beginning of the 1929 season and immediately began to attract  attention from  counties, culminating in an unsuccessful [[Cricket nets|nets]] trial for [[Warwickshire County Cricket Club|Warwickshire]].&lt;ref&gt;Hill, pp. 36–37.&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the season, when Verity went to Headingley to watch Yorkshire play, he was asked to fill a vacancy in the Yorkshire Colts team. In the match, he took five wickets for seven runs in the second innings.&lt;ref name=H39&gt;Hill, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the season, he had taken 100&amp;nbsp;wickets for Middleton and topped the Central Lancashire League bowling averages.&lt;ref name=H39/&gt;

For the 1930 season, Verity received lucrative contract offers from several Lancashire League clubs, worth more than three times his Middleton salary. Although recently married and receiving little encouragement from the Yorkshire committee, he eventually rejected the offers.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, pp. 37–38.&lt;/ref&gt; In the event, Middleton allowed Verity to play for Yorkshire during 1930 and eventually released him from his contract.&lt;ref name=&quot;H38&quot;/&gt; Cricket historian Derek Hodgson notes that Verity's years in the Lancashire Leagues &quot;meant that he reached Yorkshire&amp;nbsp;... as a hardened and experienced performer&quot;.&lt;ref name=H129&gt;Hodgson, p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt;

==County cricketer==
===First-class debut===
[[File:Rhodes bowling side.jpg|thumb|[[Wilfred Rhodes]], Verity's predecessor as Yorkshire's left-arm spinner]]
Early in 1930, Wilfred Rhodes announced that he intended to retire from first-class cricket at the end of the season.&lt;ref name=H41&gt;Hill, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; Several spin bowlers were considered as his replacement; Hirst who watched them all bowl in the nets, considered Verity the most impressive.&lt;ref name=Ho128&gt;Hodgson, p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt; Verity made his first-class debut on 21 May 1930 in an early-season non-[[County Championship|Championship]] match against [[Sussex County Cricket Club|Sussex]]. Rhodes, who missed the match, spent the game watching Verity and seemed convinced afterwards that his successor had been found.&lt;ref name=H41/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ho128/&gt; Bowling in two innings, Verity took three wickets for 96 in 46.1&amp;nbsp;[[Over (cricket)|overs]];&lt;ref name=figures&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.cricketarchive.com/cgi-bin/player_oracle_reveals_results2.cgi?playernumber=577&amp;testing=0&amp;opponentmatch=exact&amp;playername=H%20Verity&amp;resulttype=All&amp;matchtype=FirstClass&amp;teammatch=exact&amp;startwicket=&amp;homeawaytype=All&amp;opponent=&amp;endwicket=&amp;wicketkeeper=&amp;searchtype=InningsList&amp;howout=All&amp;endscore=&amp;playermatch=contains&amp;branding=cricketarchive&amp;captain=&amp;endseason=&amp;startscore=&amp;team=&amp;startseason=| title = Player Oracle H Verity| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate =14 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the process, he won praise from the press, particularly for preventing the batsmen from scoring.&lt;ref name=H41/&gt; Rhodes returned for the next match; Verity appeared only once more in May, taking eight wickets in the match against [[Leicestershire County Cricket Club|Leicestershire]], and once in June.&lt;ref name=figures/&gt;&lt;ref name=W367&gt;Woodhouse, p. 367.&lt;/ref&gt; In his fourth game, he took nine for 60 in the second innings against [[Glamorgan County Cricket Club|Glamorgan]] and 12 wickets in the match.&lt;ref name=figures/&gt; [[Sticky wicket|Rain had damaged the pitch]], making it difficult to bat against spinners.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; After this, Verity played regularly alongside Rhodes,&lt;ref name=W367/&gt; and, helped by a succession of rain-affected pitches, took a total of 64&amp;nbsp;wickets in 12&amp;nbsp;games at an average of 12.42, figures which placed him top of the national bowling averages.&lt;ref name=fcbowling&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/0/577/f_Bowling_by_Season.html| title = First-class Bowling in Each Season by Hedley Verity| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate =14 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=H40&gt;Hill, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; His best performance came against [[Hampshire County Cricket Club|Hampshire]] when he took 13 wickets for 83 runs, including seven for 26 in the first innings.&lt;ref name=figures/&gt;

Rhodes and [[Emmott Robinson]], the senior professionals in the Yorkshire team, discussed tactics with Verity and his friend and team-mate [[Bill Bowes]], to analyse their errors. Bowes later wrote: &quot;To Wilfred Rhodes and Emmott Robinson&amp;nbsp;... I owe most for what I learned of first-class cricket—and Hedley Verity shared my debt.&quot;&lt;ref name=B58&gt;Bowes, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; Verity enjoyed long technical discussions with Rhodes and, according to Hirst, took in the advice &quot;like a sponge takes water&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; Even successful performances were critiqued, including Verity's against Glamorgan and Hampshire.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bowes, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the season, critics in the press seemed convinced a successor to Rhodes had been found, and Verity was spoken of as a certainty to become an England regular.&lt;ref name=H40/&gt;

===Test debut===
When the 1931 season started, many critics and journalists watched Verity closely to see how he compared to Rhodes. Their initial impressions were favourable as Verity took five for 42 against the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] (MCC) in Yorkshire's first match of the season and five for 42 against [[Cambridge University Cricket Club|Cambridge University]].&lt;ref name=figures/&gt;&lt;ref name=H47&gt;Hill, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; Then, in his fifth game, Verity became only the second man, after [[Alonzo Drake]], to take all 10 wickets in a single innings for Yorkshire.&lt;ref name=&quot;YB2&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=The Yorkshire County Cricket Club: 2011 Yearbook |last=Warner |first=David |coauthor=|year=2011 |edition=113th |publisher=Great Northern Books |location=Ilkley, Yorkshire |isbn=978-1-905080-85-4 |page=71 |url= |accessdate=18 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Against Warwickshire, on his 26th birthday, Verity took 10 for 36 in the second innings, having taken three wickets in the first innings, to give Yorkshire an [[Result_(cricket)#Statement_of_result|innings victory]].&lt;ref&gt;Hill, pp. 48–50.&lt;/ref&gt;

Verity followed this performance with five for 54 against [[Lancashire Cricket Club|Lancashire]],&lt;ref name=figures/&gt; but a week after his 10 wickets against Warwickshire, [[Frank Woolley]] hit four [[Boundary (cricket)#Scoring runs|sixes]] from Verity's bowling as the Yorkshire bowler conceded 70&amp;nbsp;runs from 12&amp;nbsp;overs without taking a wicket.&lt;ref name=figures/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hill, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; The rest of his season was successful. Favoured by pitches made receptive to his bowling by rain, he recorded impressive performances, earning selection for [[Gentlemen v Players|the Players against the Gentlemen]] at [[Lord's Cricket Ground]],&lt;ref name=coy/&gt; where he took five wickets in the Gentlemen's first innings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/13/13973.html| title = Gentlemen v Players in 1931| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate =19 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also selected in the less prestigious Gentlemen v Players fixtures at [[The Oval]] and Scarborough and was awarded his [[Cap_(sport)#Cricket|county cap]] by Yorkshire.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hill, p. 52&quot;&gt;Hill, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; Having been watched by England selectors, and after taking 11 wickets for Yorkshire in their match against the touring New Zealand team,&lt;ref name=figures/&gt; Verity was selected in the final two [[Test cricket|Test matches]] of the series between England and the tourists. The first match was drawn after the New Zealand team performed above expectations and England brought in four new players, one of whom was Verity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hill, p. 52&quot;/&gt; On his debut, he took four wickets for 75&amp;nbsp;runs in the game. ''[[The Cricketer]]'' noted room for improvements in his technique but observed he could spin the ball well. England won the match and Verity was retained for the final Test. However, rain disrupted the match and he did not bowl.&lt;ref name=figures/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hill, pp. 52–53.&lt;/ref&gt; In his first full season of first-class cricket, Verity took 188&amp;nbsp;wickets at an average of 13.52,&lt;ref name=fcbowling/&gt; finishing on top of the Yorkshire bowling averages and second in the national averages.&lt;ref name=H47/&gt; Yorkshire won the County Championship and, according to ''Wisden'', owed much of their success to Verity's bowling.&lt;ref name=coy/&gt; Verity was selected as one of ''Wisden's'' [[Wisden Cricketers of the Year|Cricketers of the Year]] for his performances in the season. However, the citation said that despite his success and ability, he needed to improve the variety in the pace and [[Flight (cricket)|flight]] of his bowling.&lt;ref name=coy/&gt;

===World record===
Yorkshire made a poor start to the 1932 season. The team lost heavily to Lancashire, for whom [[Eddie Paynter]] scored 152 runs and hit Verity for five sixes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hodgson, p. 132&quot;&gt;Hodgson, p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Verity had figures of eight for 107, he was expected to be more successful as the pitch conditions were perfect for spin bowling. [[Neville Cardus]] wrote that his figures were &quot;bad for the pitch. He can spin the ball keenly enough, but lacks a plan in his control of length. Moreover, he seldom gets the batsman guessing while the ball is in the air.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Cardus (1982), p. 335.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Yorkshire improved their form in the rest of the season to retain the County title.&lt;ref name=ccposn&gt;{{Cite book| title = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack| year = 2010| publisher = John Wisden &amp; Co| chapter = LV County Championship: County Championship Final Positions 1890–2010| location = London| isbn = 978-1-4081-2466-6| page = 575}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hodgson, pp. 132, 135.&lt;/ref&gt; Between them, Verity and Bowes took 352&amp;nbsp;wickets in the season,&lt;ref name=&quot;Hodgson, p. 132&quot;/&gt; and Verity took 162&amp;nbsp;wickets at an average of 13.88&lt;ref name=fcbowling/&gt; to finish second in the national bowling averages.&lt;ref name=fcbowling/&gt;&lt;ref name=averages/&gt; Verity's best performance of the season came at Headingley on 12&amp;nbsp;July, the third and final day of Yorkshire's match against [[Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club|Nottinghamshire]]. After heavy rain on the second day, [[Brian Sellers]], the Yorkshire captain, [[Declaration and forfeiture|closed]] his team's innings when Nottinghamshire still led by 71&amp;nbsp;runs. Verity did not concede any runs from his first nine overs, before the pitch became difficult to bat on as it dried in the sun. He then took all 10 wickets while 10 runs were hit from his bowling. Making the ball spin sharply, he took seven wickets in 15&amp;nbsp;[[Delivery (cricket)|deliveries]], including a [[Hat-trick#Cricket|hat-trick]].&lt;ref name=Notts32&gt;Hill, pp. 53–55.&lt;/ref&gt; His bowling figures of 10 for 10 beat the previous record for fewest runs conceded while taking all 10 wickets,{{#tag:ref|The previous best figures were 10 for 18 by [[George Geary]] in 1929.&lt;ref name=bestfigures&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/records/209288.html| title = Best figures in an innings (first-class records) | publisher = ESPNcricinfo| accessdate =21 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=note}} and this remains, as of 2012, the best [[bowling analysis]] recorded in first-class cricket.&lt;ref name=bestfigures/&gt; He remains the only Yorkshire bowler to take all 10 wickets in an innings on two separate occasions.&lt;ref name=&quot;YB2&quot;/&gt; Yorkshire won the match by an innings.&lt;ref name=Notts32/&gt; Despite Verity's success, he was not selected for any Gentlemen v Players matches, nor in the Test match against India.

Verity had been advised by friends at the start of the season that he would need an exceptional performance to achieve selection on the 1932–33 [[The Ashes|Ashes]] tour of Australia; Alan Hill believes the performance against Nottinghamshire guaranteed Verity would be chosen to tour.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; In the middle of August, Verity was one of the last men added to the MCC team captained by [[Douglas Jardine]].{{#tag:ref|The MCC were responsible for the administration of English cricket, including the England Test team.

Jardine planned to use Verity to contain the batsmen and prevent them scoring runs, while the fast bowlers rested.&lt;ref&gt;Frith, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Verity was not expected to be a big success on the tour. The good batting conditions, the aggressive Australian approach to playing spin bowlers and Verity's lack of experience led critics to dismiss his potential contribution to the English bowling attack,&lt;ref&gt;Hill, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; but Verity had a successful start to the tour. Assisted by overnight rain, he took seven for 37, including the wicket of [[Don Bradman]], against a Combined XI, comprising some of the best Australian players.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frith, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; In the following game, against [[Southern Redbacks|South Australia]], Verity took eight wickets, including five for 42 in the second innings.&lt;ref&gt;Frith, pp. 90–91.&lt;/ref&gt; By now, the press had begun to pay attention to Verity's achievements, and former Australian batsman [[Clem Hill]] expressed his admiration for Verity.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frith, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; Selected for the first Test on the strength of his early tour performances, Verity bowled just 17&amp;nbsp;overs in the game, mainly being used to give the fast bowlers a rest. He did not take any wickets and Verity himself believed he had bowled poorly.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, pp. 63–63.&lt;/ref&gt; England won the match, using [[Bodyline]] tactics which had first been used earlier in the tour.&lt;ref&gt;Frith, p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt; After the Test, the tourists travelled to Tasmania to play two matches against [[Tasmanian Tigers|the state team]]. Verity played in the second, and although rain interrupted play, restricting Verity to five overs, he scored his first [[Glossary_of_cricket_terms#H|half-century]] in first-class cricket.&lt;ref name=figures/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frith, pp. 142–44.&lt;/ref&gt; However, he was left out of the team for the second Test and was replaced by Bill Bowes. England played four fast bowlers but Jardine had misjudged the playing surface; the Australian spinners were very effective on a slow-paced pitch and Australia levelled the series.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, pp. 65–66.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frith, p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt;

Verity regained his place in the team for the third Test, replacing Bowes.&lt;ref&gt;Frith, p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt; The match was highly controversial owing to England's continued and increased use of Bodyline tactics.&lt;ref&gt;Frith, pp. 179–81, 194, 196–201.&lt;/ref&gt; Verity's main contributions to the match came from his batting: he shared [[Partnership (cricket)|partnerships]] worth over 90 runs in both innings, scoring 45&amp;nbsp;runs in the first innings and 40 in the second.&lt;ref&gt;Frith, p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Adelaide&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.espncricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/151781.html| title = Australia v England 1932–33 (Third Test)| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack| year = 1934| publisher = John Wisden &amp; Co | location = London | accessdate =6 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He took one wicket in the game; after 16&amp;nbsp;wicketless overs in the first innings,&lt;ref name=figures/&gt; Verity dismissed Bradman in the second, his first Test wicket against Australia, and England won the match by 338&amp;nbsp;runs.&lt;ref name=figures/&gt;&lt;ref name=Adelaide/&gt; After the third Test, the MCC played New South Wales again.

In their first innings, England had lost eight wickets, and were still 76&amp;nbsp;runs behind Australia's score when Verity joined Paynter, who had left a hospital bed where he had been confined with tonsillitis.&lt;ref&gt;Frith, pp. 287–89.&lt;/ref&gt; The two men scored 92&amp;nbsp;runs together, to give England a small lead. Verity scored 23 [[not out]] in two-and-three-quarter hours, although he was lucky not to be dismissed several times.&lt;ref&gt;Frith, p. 291.&lt;/ref&gt; Australia were bowled out in their second innings and Verity took two wickets; England scored the required runs to record a six-wicket win which ensured victory in the series—and the Ashes.&lt;ref name=figures/&gt; Verity's bowling was most successful in the final Test, when Jardine allowed him to depart from his role of restricting the batsmen's scoring and bowl a more attacking line and length in an attempt to take wickets.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; Having taken three for 62 in Australia's first innings,&lt;ref name=figures/&gt; he took five for 33 in the second, assisted by a worn pitch that helped him to spin the ball.

In the Test series, Verity totalled 11&amp;nbsp;wickets at an average of 24.65, second in the bowling averages to Larwood.{{#tag:ref|[[Tommy Mitchell]] appeared in one match and would be second in the averages if he were included, having taken three wickets for 60 runs.&lt;ref&gt;Frith, p. 331.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=note}}&lt;ref name=H181&gt;Hill, p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt; Verity took three more wickets in his last matches of the tour, which included his appearance in one of the two Tests against New Zealand at the end of the tour.&lt;ref name=figures/&gt; In all first-class games in Australia, he took 44&amp;nbsp;wickets at 15.86, leading the first-class bowling averages for the tourists; he took one further wicket in New Zealand.&lt;ref name=fcbowling/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wisden34&gt;{{Cite web| last = Southerton | first = S.

===Series against West Indies===
In the 1933 season, when Yorkshire won their third consecutive County Championship,&lt;ref name=ccposn/&gt; Verity took 190&amp;nbsp;wickets at an average of 13.43 to be fifth in the national averages; in eight matches he took 10 or more wickets, and achieved five wickets in an innings 18&amp;nbsp;times.&lt;ref name=fcbowling/&gt;&lt;ref name=averages/&gt; In seven consecutive innings, he secured a total of 50&amp;nbsp;wickets, becoming only the third player to achieve this feat in first-class cricket.{{#tag:ref|The other two players were [[Tich Freeman]] and [[Charlie Townsend]].&lt;ref name=consecutive/&gt;|group=note}}&lt;ref name=consecutive&gt;{{Cite book| editor-last= Frindall|editor-first= Bill |title = The Wisden Book of Cricket Records | publisher = MacDonald Queen Anne Press| location = London | year = 1986 | page = 274 | isbn = 0-356-10736-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also scored over 600&amp;nbsp;runs in the season, his highest aggregate to date, including three fifties &amp;nbsp;– his first in English first-class cricket.&lt;ref name=fcbatting&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/0/577/f_Batting_by_Season.html| title = First-class Batting and Fielding in Each Season by Hedley Verity| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate =24 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the season, Verity represented the Players against the Gentlemen and played in the first two of three Tests against the [[West Indies cricket team|West Indies]], taking four for 45 in the first match and capturing seven wickets at an average of 21.85 in the series.&lt;ref name=tbowl&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/0/577/t_Bowling_by_Season.html| title = Test Bowling in Each Season by Hedley Verity| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate =24 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was left out of the final game in favour of [[Charles Marriott]],&lt;ref name=H123&gt;Hill, p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt; but in two other games against the tourists, Verity took a total of 22 wickets.&lt;ref name=figures/&gt; Against Essex, Verity achieved another record by taking 17&amp;nbsp;wickets in a single day's play, the second of three players to achieve this feat, on a pitch damaged by rain.{{#tag:ref|[[Colin Blythe]], in 1907, and [[Tom Goddard]], in 1939, are the only other bowlers to take 17 wickets in one day.&lt;ref name=17w/&gt;|group=note}}&lt;ref name=17w&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/records/283212.html| title = Best figures in a first-class match| publisher = ESPNcricinfo| accessdate =24 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| editor-last= Green |editor-first= Benny |title = Wisden Anthology 1900–1940| publisher = Queen Anne Press| location = London | year = 1982 | chapter = The County Matches (Essex) | page = 534| isbn = 0-7472-0706-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, against Surrey,&lt;ref name=figures/&gt; Yorkshire conceded 560&amp;nbsp;runs and Verity, frustrated at the lack of a declaration, first bowled extremely negatively and then bowled two underarm deliveries that the umpire called [[no ball]] as Verity had not informed the batsmen of his intention. This was an unusually public reaction for Verity and his captain ordered him to resume normal bowling.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the season, an MCC team toured India and played Tests there for the first time. Jardine was chosen as captain, and Verity was the only other player from the Bodyline series to tour, although others declined an invitation.&lt;ref&gt;Frith, pp. 390–91.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Douglas, p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Douglas Jardine Cigarette Card.jpg|thumb|upright|150px|left|[[Douglas Jardine]], Verity's captain in Australia and India, was an admirer of Verity.]]

===Tour of India===
Jardine approached the tour with a competitive attitude and made thorough preparations.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas, pp. 170–71.&lt;/ref&gt; The match attendances were high and the public followed the cricket very closely.&lt;ref name=India/&gt; Verity enjoyed the tour and established a lasting friendship with [[Charlie Barnett (cricketer)|Charlie Barnett]]; Verity helped Barnett to overcome his homesickness and to develop his understanding of cricket.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, pp. 81–82.&lt;/ref&gt; Verity was the leading first-class wicket-taker on the tour, although he was second in the team averages, with 72&amp;nbsp;wickets at an average of 15.54.&lt;ref name=fcbowling/&gt;&lt;ref name=India&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.espncricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/151796.html| title = M.C.C. team in India, 1933–34| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack| year = 1935| publisher = John Wisden &amp; Co | location = London | accessdate =25 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first match of the tour against [[Sindh cricket team|Sind]], he took six for 46 and 10 wickets in the game. His best figures were seven for 37 against the Viceroy's XI and he took five wickets in an innings on five occasions.&lt;ref name=figures/&gt;&lt;ref name=fcbowling/&gt; Against an Indian XI, he achieved his then-highest first-class score of 91&amp;nbsp;not out.&lt;ref name=figures/&gt; On the same ground, in the second Test match, Verity took eight wickets in the drawn  game and scored 55&amp;nbsp;not out, his maiden Test fifty.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; As England had won the first Test, the third and final match would decide the series. Verity was again successful with the bat, scoring 42 and sharing a partnership of 97 with Jardine. Then with the ball, Verity took seven for 49 as the Indian batsmen struggled against his accuracy.&lt;ref name=H83&gt;Hill, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; Four wickets in the second innings gave him eleven wickets for 153 in the match, the first time he had taken 10 or more wickets in a Test match.&lt;ref name=figures/&gt;&lt;ref name=H83/&gt; In the three Tests, Verity took 23 wickets at an average of 16.82, leading the bowling averages for the series.&lt;ref name=tbowl/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hill, p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jardine, who retired from regular first-class cricket after the tour, had little patience with his fast bowlers on the tour. On one occasion, when they were having difficulty in the heat, Jardine said: &quot;Thank God we have one bowler in the side&quot;—referring to Verity.&lt;ref name=F391&gt;Frith, p. 391.&lt;/ref&gt; The two men admired each other greatly. Verity was impressed with the depth of Jardine's thinking on the game and his intelligence, enjoying tactical discussions with him on the voyage to Australia. According to Alan Hill, Verity did not relish the Bodyline tactics on that tour but supported his captain's stance completely.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, pp. 79–80.&lt;/ref&gt; Verity even named his second son Douglas after Jardine.&lt;ref name=H75&gt;Hill, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; Jardine considered Verity to be the best slow left-arm bowler of all time, writing: &quot;I venture to doubt whether any other bowler of his type has proved such a master on all kinds of wickets&amp;nbsp;... No captain could have a greater asset on his side than Verity. He would make a great captain himself.&quot;&lt;ref name=H75/&gt; Historian David Frith writes that Verity was &quot;probably the cricketer [Jardine] admired above all others&quot;,&lt;ref name=F391/&gt; while [[Bob Wyatt]] believed the two men were very similar in outlook, temperament and desire to succeed.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Series against Australia in 1934===
In the 1934 season, Verity took 150&amp;nbsp;wickets at an average of 17.63, placing him third in the national averages.&lt;ref name=fcbowling/&gt;&lt;ref name=averages&gt;Hill, p. 174.&lt;/ref&gt; That year, the Australians toured England and Verity was selected for all five Test matches. Australia won the first game—Verity took two wickets.&lt;ref name=figures/&gt; At Lord's, in the second match, England scored 440 in their first innings but after the second day's play, Australia were well positioned, having reached 192 for two wickets.&lt;ref name=Lords&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.espncricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/151792.html| title = England v Australia 1934 (Second Test) | work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack| year = 1935| publisher = John Wisden &amp; Co | location = London | accessdate =26 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Verity was the only bowler to trouble the batsmen and caught and bowled Bradman, who had scored a quick 36&amp;nbsp;runs.&lt;ref&gt;Cardus (1934), pp. 181–83.&lt;/ref&gt; After rain fell overnight, the pitch changed to become helpful to spin; ''Wisden'' reported that: &quot;although the wicket certainly helped [Verity] considerably it could scarcely be described as genuinely sticky except for one period after lunch.&quot;&lt;ref name=Lords/&gt; On the third day, Australia lost their last eight wickets while scoring 92&amp;nbsp;runs. Verity took six of the wickets to achieve bowling figures of seven for 61.

Verity's length was impeccable and he made the ball come back and lift so abruptly that most of the Australians were helpless.

Under the captaincy of Allen,&lt;ref name=H113&gt;Hill, p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; Verity began the tour well.

Although Verity took just one wicket, ''Wisden's'' correspondent praised him, reporting: &quot;Among the bowlers&amp;nbsp;... Verity must not be forgotten. In the first innings he bowled in his best form and contributed to many of [[Bill Voce|[Bill] Voce's]] wickets&amp;nbsp;...

Verity took three wickets in the match, including that of Bradman.&lt;ref name=H114&gt;Hill, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt;

The turning point of the series was the third Test. On the first day, Verity again dismissed Bradman and the England bowlers performed well in good batting conditions before rain altered the state of the pitch. Australia declared their innings closed at 200 for nine and after losing nine wickets for&amp;nbsp;76, England also declared, hoping to make Australia bat on a still-difficult pitch.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Aus3&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.espncricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/154078.html| title = England v Australia 1936–37 (Second Test)| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack| year = 1938| publisher = John Wisden &amp; Co | location = London | accessdate =2 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In much easier batting conditions, Australia made 564, of which Bradman scored 270.&lt;ref name=Aus3/&gt; Verity bowled nearly 38 eight-ball overs and took three for 79. Cardus wrote: &quot;Verity was magnificent&amp;nbsp;... In his absence Bradman might have scored another 100&amp;nbsp;runs. Nothing but consummate length and flight could have checked Bradman, in circumstances made for Bradman&amp;nbsp;... Every run from Verity had to be earnt. It was beautiful bowling, delightful to the eye and intellect.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hill, pp. 112–13.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Wisden's'' report said: &quot;Voce and Verity were outstanding England bowlers. The latter kept an immaculate length and allowed no batsman to take liberties with him.&quot;&lt;ref name=Aus3/&gt; England were bowled out for 323 and lost the game.&lt;ref name=figures/&gt;

In an attempt to solve their problem in finding a reliable opening partnership in the series, England promoted Verity to open the batting in the fourth Test. After Australia were bowled out for 288, Verity and Barnett put on 53&amp;nbsp;runs together, England's best opening partnership of the series. ''Wisden'' praised Verity's defence but said he had not solved the problem of finding a partner for Barnett.&lt;ref name=Aus4/&gt; England scored 330 but Australia's second innings of 433 left England needing 392.

During the 1937 season, Verity played only one of the three Tests against the touring New Zealanders. He took two wickets, and although batsmen found it difficult to score from his bowling, he did not look dangerous and was left out of the remaining Tests in an attempt to strengthen the English bowling attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.espncricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/151831.html| title = England v New Zealand 1937 (First Test)| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack| year = 1938| publisher = John Wisden &amp; Co | location = London | accessdate =8 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.espncricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/151832.html| title = England v New Zealand 1937 (Second Test)| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack| year = 1938| publisher = John Wisden &amp; Co | location = London | accessdate =8 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was not selected for the Players and his only other representative cricket was for the North against the South and for teams selected from those who had toured Australia during the English winter.&lt;ref name=figures/&gt; Nevertheless, Verity took 202 wickets at 15.67 which placed him third in the bowling averages.&lt;ref name=fcbowling/&gt;&lt;ref name=averages/&gt;

===Ashes series of 1938===
Verity took 158 first-class wickets in 1938 at an average of 15.38,&lt;ref name=fcbowling/&gt; placing him third once more in the national averages; Bowes was second in the list and Yorkshire retained the Championship.&lt;ref name=ccposn/&gt;&lt;ref name=averages/&gt; After appearing in a trial match, Verity played in all four Tests against Australia,{{#tag:ref|One match was abandoned owing to rain.|group=note}} during a series which was tied 1–1.&lt;ref name=figures/&gt; In the first match, England scored 658 and according to ''Wisden'', the new England captain [[Wally Hammond]] decided to keep Verity in reserve in the expectation of making Australia follow-on; he bowled just 45&amp;nbsp;balls in Australia's first innings. Australia did follow-on, and in the second innings, Verity bowled 62&amp;nbsp;overs to take three wickets for 102, bowling very accurately, but the batsmen played him skilfully and the match was drawn.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.espncricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/151849.html| title = England v Australia 1938 (First Test)| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack| year = 1938| publisher = John Wisden &amp; Co | location = London | accessdate =23 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the second match, Verity took four for 103 out of an Australian total of 422, in reply to England's&amp;nbsp;494. After Verity had taken two wickets in eight balls, Australia were in danger of having to follow-on, but [[Bill O'Reilly (cricketer)|Bill O'Reilly]] struck him for two consecutive sixes to remove the possibility. Verity took two wickets in the second innings, but the match was drawn.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.espncricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/engine/match/62650.html| title = England v Australia 1938 (Second Test)| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack| year = 1938| publisher = John Wisden &amp; Co | location = London | accessdate =23 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the third match was abandoned owing to rain, Australia won the fourth Test, held at Headingley, by five wickets to ensure the Ashes were retained. ''Wisden'' commented that: &quot;At no time was the wicket easy for batting and Australia won largely because they possessed better spin bowling.&quot;&lt;ref name=4T38&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.espncricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/151852.html| title = England v Australia 1938 (Fourth Test)| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack| year = 1938| publisher = John Wisden &amp; Co | location = London | accessdate =23 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Verity took two wickets in the match,&lt;ref name=figures/&gt; but some critics believed his bowling could have won the match had Hammond used him more effectively.  In a match where the Australian spinner O'Reilly took 10 wickets,&lt;ref name=4T38/&gt; Hammond used his fast bowlers Bowes and [[Ken Farnes]] for the majority of both innings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/16/16720.html| title = England v Australia 1938 (Fourth Test)| publisher = CricketArchive | accessdate =23 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics believed Hammond over-used his fast bowlers; Cardus wrote: &quot;Hammond's faith in fast bowling rather exceeded his faith in the arts of Verity and Wright. The result was sad disillusionment.&quot;&lt;ref name=H116/&gt; Barnett also said that Hammond refused to allow Verity to alter his bowling tactics, when the Yorkshire bowler wished to aim for a worn area on the pitch.&lt;ref name=H116&gt;Hill, p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt;

As neither side had established a winning lead in the series, the final match at The Oval was to be played to a finish, no matter how long it took.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title = The Final Test Match {{subscription}}| newspaper = The Times  | location = London  | page = 4 | date = 20 August 1938 | url = http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/viewArticle.arc?articleId=ARCHIVE-The_Times-1938-08-20-04-001&amp;pageId=ARCHIVE-The_Times-1938-08-20-04| access date =19 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; England scored a record team total of 903&amp;nbsp;runs and Australia were heavily defeated.

As Hutton's innings began to assume epic proportions, Verity stayed with him throughout the intervals, helping him to maintain concentration. On the Sunday of the match, when there was no play, Verity arranged for Hutton to have a break by the sea to relax away from cricket. Hutton commented: &quot;I owe [Verity] the kind of debt that one can never fully repay&amp;nbsp;... His quiet, natural dignity was an immense source of strength to me throughout those long hours&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; The series was drawn; Verity took 14&amp;nbsp;wickets at an average of 25.28, finishing second in the England bowling averages, behind Bowes.&lt;ref name=tbowl/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hill, p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Charlie Barnett, who played in the series but disliked Hammond,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  |last = Foot  |first = David  |title = Wally Hammond, The Reasons Why: A Biography  |publisher = Robson Books  |year = 1996  |location= London |isbn = 1-86105-037-2|pages = 162–64}}&lt;/ref&gt; believed that Hammond's poor tactical use of Verity cost England potential victories in the second and fourth Tests.&lt;ref name=H115&gt;Hill, p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; Verity played no other representative cricket that season, but appeared once more against the Australians for H.

===Tour to South Africa and final season===
In the winter of 1938–39, Verity toured South Africa with the MCC team under Hammond's captaincy.&lt;ref name=H125-6&gt;Hill, pp. 125–26.&lt;/ref&gt; He took 47&amp;nbsp;wickets at 19.93 in first-class games.&lt;ref name=fcbowling/&gt; In the first game of the tour, Verity took 11 wickets against Griqualand West.&lt;ref name=figures/&gt; In the Test matches, the batsmen played in a negative fashion, despite pitches that were very good for batting.

Verity's final first-class cricket came in the 1939 season which was overshadowed by the forthcoming war.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, pp. 126–28.&lt;/ref&gt; Yorkshire won their third successive County Championship and the seventh of Verity's career.&lt;ref name=ccposn/&gt; Verity took 191&amp;nbsp;wickets at an average of 13.13,&lt;ref name=fcbowling/&gt; to top the bowling averages for the second time in his career.&lt;ref name=averages/&gt; Verity's only representative cricket came in the first Test match against West Indies, when he took two wickets in the match.&lt;ref name=figures/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/17/17032.html| title = England v West Indies in 1939|  publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate =28 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was subsequently left out of the team for the second Test in favour of [[Tom Goddard]], and did not play any more Test matches.

In the second innings, Verity took seven wickets for nine runs on a rain-affected pitch to bowl Sussex out for 33 and take Yorkshire to a win, although the match was played in a strained, tense atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, pp. 129–31.&lt;/ref&gt; This was Verity's last performance in first-class cricket.&lt;ref name=figures/&gt; In total, he had taken 1,956&amp;nbsp;wickets at an average of 14.90 and scored 5,603&amp;nbsp;runs at 18.07.&lt;ref name=cricinfo/&gt;

==Style and technique==
As a bowler, Verity delivered the ball at almost [[Fast_bowling#Categorisation_of_fast_bowling|medium pace]], faster than usual for a spinner.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;&lt;ref name=H158&gt;Hill, p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt; [[R. C. Robertson-Glasgow]], a cricket writer and journalist, wrote &quot;He is a scholarly bowler&amp;nbsp;... He is tall, and much stronger than his pace needs. His run up, longer than most of his kind, has a measured delicacy that you would expect from this fastidious and nearly prim craftsman. Only his delivery has a grace which mathematics can't explain.&quot;&lt;ref name=Crusoe80&gt;Robertson-Glasgow, p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; His main asset as a bowler was an ability to bowl straight and with great accuracy, on a good length. He could also make the ball bounce sharply.&lt;ref name=H158/&gt; His most effective delivery  curved through the air, pitched on [[Stump_(cricket)#Part_of_the_wicket|middle and leg stump]] and spun away from the batsman, causing many of them to edge the ball into the [[Slip (cricket)|slips]].&lt;ref&gt;Hill, pp. 157–58.&lt;/ref&gt; On  rain-affected pitches he bowled more slowly, and was almost unplayable at times.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;&lt;ref name=Crusoe79&gt;Robertson-Glasgow, p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the period in which Verity played was notable for good batting pitches, and batsmen often dominated.&lt;ref name=H158/&gt;&lt;ref name=Crusoe80/&gt; In these conditions, Verity prevented batsmen scoring runs and constantly tried new strategies to try to take wickets.&lt;ref name=H158/&gt; Verity also used different types of delivery to keep batsmen uncertain: he could bowl at a slower and faster pace to his normal style and occasionally bowled a much faster ball which regularly took wickets.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt;

Verity never spun the ball very far, particularly after his second tour to Australia, and preferred to concentrate on bowling a good length.&lt;ref&gt;HIll, pp. 160–61.&lt;/ref&gt; However, critics did not think that Verity posed enough of a threat to batsmen and could be dull to watch.&lt;ref name=H159&gt;Hill, p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt; By the middle of his career, he had a reputation for being ineffective on good batting pitches,&lt;ref name=poorrep/&gt; and was occasionally dropped from the England team for his lack of effectiveness.&lt;ref name=dropped35/&gt; Even so, he only missed one Test against Australia and one against South Africa, the two strongest Test playing teams, after he made his debut.&lt;ref name=figures/&gt; Verity believed his performances in unfavourable conditions for his bowling had greater merit than his successes in favourable ones. He once said: &quot;Do not praise me when I have taken 8 for 20 on a sticky wicket, but when I have got 2 for 100 on a perfect wicket.&quot;&lt;ref name=H110&gt;Hill, p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt; At times, Verity almost seemed bored when bowling and performed less effectively, particularly if his side were winning without needing his contribution. Bowes once told the Yorkshire captain, Brian Sellers, that the way to get the best out of Verity was to tell him that everything depended on him.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, pp. 98–99.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robertson-Glasgow, pp. 80–81.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Bradman&amp;Bat.jpg|thumb|upright|150px|Verity took [[Donald Bradman]]'s wicket more times than anyone else in Test matches. Bradman greatly respected Verity as a bowler.|alt=Man in double breasted suit, posing with a cricket bat.]]
Verity earned the respect of Bradman, generally regarded as the greatest batsman to have played cricket, and enjoyed bowling at him.&lt;ref name=H159/&gt; Bradman described Verity as a great cricketer and wrote that throughout their respective careers, he &quot;grew more and more to respect [Verity] both as a gentleman and as a player.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Writing in the foreword to Hill's book. Hill, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Robertson-Glasgow thought that Verity was &quot;one of only three or four bowlers who came to the battle with Bradman on not unequal terms&quot;.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; During the 17 Tests in which they faced each other, Verity dismissed Bradman eight times, more than any other bowler.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/player/4188.html?class=1;template=results;type=batting;view=bowler_summary| title = Statsguru: DG Bradman (bowlers who dismissed Bradman) | publisher = ESPNcricinfo| accessdate =3 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robertson-Glasgow believed that, but for Verity, Bradman would have averaged over 150 in Tests instead of his actual batting average.{{#tag:ref|Robertson-Glasgow was referring to matches between Australia and England. At the time he wrote, Bradman averaged 91.42 against England. He eventually averaged 89.78 against England and 99.94 overall.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/player/4188.html?class=1;template=results;type=allround| title = Statsguru: DG Bradman (Career Summary) | publisher = ESPNcricinfo| accessdate =3 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=note}}&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; In all first-class cricket, Verity dismissed Bradman 10 times in total, on two occasions twice in the same game. Only [[Clarrie Grimmett]] equalled 10 first-class dismissals of Bradman.&lt;ref name=H159/&gt; However, Bradman once said:  &quot;I think I know all about Clarrie (Grimmett), but with Hedley I am never sure. You see, there's no breaking-point with him.&quot;&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

Verity is often cited as one of the greatest slow left-arm spinners to play the game. Robertson-Glasgow wrote: &quot;We can only say that, in his own short time, he was the best of his kind.&quot; The writer considered Verity may not quite have achieved the heights of some other great bowlers of his type, but &quot;as a workman-artist, he will take some beating.&quot;&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; Douglas Jardine rated him higher than any previous Yorkshire spinners,&lt;ref&gt;Hill, p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt; and Les Ames considered him the best left-arm spinner he had played against.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt; Bradman wrote: &quot;Undoubtedly he was one of the greatest slow left-handed spinners of all time. His record testifies to that. No Australian left-hander of that type was Verity's equal and of the Englishmen I saw&amp;nbsp;... there is no doubt that Hedley was as good or better than the others.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hill, p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a batsman, Verity occasionally showed potential to become good, but concentrated his energy on bowling.&lt;ref name=&quot;H109&quot;/&gt; He modelled his batting on Herbert Sutcliffe,&lt;ref name=H110/&gt; and Robertson-Glasgow wrote: &quot;As a batsman, he looks like Sutcliffe gone stale. That is, pretty good.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Robertson-Glasgow, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military service==
===Training with the Green Howards===
Since around 1937, Verity had expected the outbreak of the Second World War and had prepared for it through reading military literature.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, pp. 133–34.&lt;/ref&gt; He and Bowes decided to enlist together, and after briefly serving in the [[Air Raid Precautions]] in Guiseley until Bowes' wife gave birth, they attempted to join the [[infantry]].&lt;ref&gt;Bowes, pp. 132–33.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hill, p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Bowes was hampered by an old knee complaint and later became a gunnery officer. After serving as a [[sapper]] in the [[Royal Engineers]], Verity was [[Officer_(armed_forces)#United_Kingdom|commissioned]] in January&amp;nbsp;1940 as a [[second lieutenant]] in the [[Green Howards]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title = Supplement to the London Gazette: 9 January 1940| newspaper = London Gazette  | location = London  | page = 149 | issue = 34768| date = 5 January 1940 | url =  http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/34768/supplements/149| access date =14 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later promoted to [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|captain]]. Following a spell at the [[Infantry Training Centre (British Army)|Infantry Training Centre]], he was posted to the 1st&amp;nbsp;Battalion. He served at the regimental depot in [[Richmond, North Yorkshire]], where he was responsible for training recruits.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, pp. 134–35.&lt;/ref&gt; In the spring of 1941, the battalion moved to [[Omagh]] in Northern Ireland for further training.&lt;ref name=H129/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hill, p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt; Verity's Yorkshire and England team-mate [[Norman Yardley]] was also in the 1st Battalion; the fame of these cricketers made an impression on the local population. Playing several cricket matches, Verity frequently took wickets on rough pitches that were unsuitable for batting. There was even time for his appearance in a charity match at Lord's.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, pp. 136–40.&lt;/ref&gt; In August, he returned to England and after a spell in London, he was posted overseas.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hill, pp. 140–41&quot;&gt;Hill, pp. 140–41.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1st&amp;nbsp;battalion of the Green Howards transferred early in 1942 to [[Ranchi]] in India, where the climate badly affected Verity's health. After suffering from dysentery, he was weak and his doctors wished to send him home. However, he resumed his position and, by the end of the year, his battalion was sent to [[Iran|Persia]]. In March&amp;nbsp;1943, the battalion was posted to [[Kibrit Air Base]] in Egypt for training and then to [[Qatana]] in Syria. Here, preparations were finalised for the [[Allied invasion of Sicily]].&lt;ref name=H143&gt;Hill, pp. 143–44.&lt;/ref&gt; Verity remained below peak fitness and was struggling a little owing to his age. His commanding officers planned to withdraw him from front-line fighting and move him to a staff position at headquarters once the Sicily campaign had concluded.&lt;ref name=H143/&gt;

===Death===
The invasion of Sicily was initially successful until the Allied forces reached the plains outside [[Catania]], where German forces put up strong resistance. The Green Howards, as part of the [[15th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|15th Brigade]], made a night attack on 19&amp;nbsp;July. However, conditions were more difficult than expected and the brigade came under heavy fire.&lt;ref name=H146&gt;Hill, pp. 146–47.&lt;/ref&gt; Verity commanded B&amp;nbsp;Company, which was surrounded in the confusion. Attempting to secure the position, Verity was hit in the chest and had to be left behind as the company retreated.&lt;ref name=H146/&gt; The last order he gave was &quot;keep going&quot;.&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.espncricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/152849.html | title = Hedley Verity (''Wisden'' Obituary) | work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack| year = 1944| publisher = John Wisden &amp; Co | location = London | accessdate =30 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Severely wounded and subsequently captured by the Germans, Verity was taken to a field hospital and underwent an operation.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt; Taken by boat across the [[Strait of Messina]] to Italy, Verity first went to a hospital in [[Reggio Calabria]] and was then transported for two days by train to [[Naples]]. The German hospital was full, so Verity was sent to the Italian hospital at [[Caserta]]. By this stage, Verity was very ill and had another operation to relieve pressure from his rib onto his lung. The operation seemed successful but Verity deteriorated rapidly over the following three days, bleeding heavily. He died on 31&amp;nbsp;July, and was buried with full military honours.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, pp. 151–52.&lt;/ref&gt; His grave was later moved from the town's cemetery to the military cemetery established by the [[Commonwealth War Graves Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;Hill, pp. 152–53.&lt;/ref&gt; Several Yorkshire players later visited the grave; some members of the MCC team under Len Hutton's captaincy in 1954–55, including Hutton, journalists and former Yorkshire player [[Abe Waddington]] paid tribute at Verity's grave while en route for Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Verity married Kathleen Alice Metcalfe, a bookbinder and the daughter of a sales agent, on 7&amp;nbsp;March&amp;nbsp;1929.&lt;ref name=ODNB&gt;{{cite web | last = Hill| first = Alan| title = Verity, Hedley (1905–1943) {{subscription}}| work = Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, online edn | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2004, online edition Jan 2011 | url =  http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/38092| accessdate =13 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple had known each other as children in Headingley and met again at a Rawdon youth club social event.&lt;ref name=H38&gt;Hill, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; They had two sons, first Wilfred, named after Wilfred Rhodes,&lt;ref&gt;Hill, photographic plate 3.&lt;/ref&gt; and then Douglas, named after Douglas Jardine.&lt;ref name=H75/&gt;

Shortly before the outbreak of the war, Kathleen began to suffer from poor health, and the family planned a trip to South Africa in the English winter of 1939 to aid her recovery and so Verity could take up one of several offers of a coaching job.&lt;ref name=H125-6/&gt; In the last months before Verity went overseas during the war, Kathleen joined him in Omagh and later in London just before he went away.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hill, pp. 140–41&quot;/&gt;
