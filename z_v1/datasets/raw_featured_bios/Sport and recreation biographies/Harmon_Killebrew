'''Harmon Clayton Killebrew''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|k|ɪ|l|ɨ|b|r|uː}}; June 29, 1936&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; May 17, 2011), nicknamed &quot;'''Killer'''&quot; and &quot;'''Hammerin' Harmon'''&quot;, was an American professional baseball [[first baseman]], [[third baseman]], and [[left fielder]]. During his 22-year career in [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB), he played for the Washington Senators, a team which later became the [[Minnesota Twins]], and the [[Kansas City Royals]]. When he retired, he was second only to [[Babe Ruth]] in [[American League]] (AL) [[home run]]s and was the AL career leader in home runs by a [[right-handed]] batter (since broken by [[Alex Rodriguez]]).&lt;ref name=Goldstein&gt;{{cite news|last=Goldstein|first=Richard|title=Harmon Killebrew, Twins’ Hall of Fame Slugger, Dies at 74|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/18/sports/baseball/harmon-killebrew-twins-hall-of-fame-slugger-dies-at-74.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss|accessdate=May 17, 2011|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=May 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was inducted into the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame]] in 1984.

Killebrew was a [[wikt:stocky|stocky]] {{convert|5|ft|11|in|m|abbr=on}}, 210-pound (95.3&amp;nbsp;kg) hitter with a compact swing that generated tremendous power. He became one of the AL's most feared power hitters of the 1960s, hitting 40 home runs in a season eight times. In 1965, he played in the [[World Series]] with the Minnesota Twins, who lost to the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]]. His finest season was 1969, when he hit 49 home runs, recorded 140 [[runs batted in]] (RBI), and won the AL [[MLB Most Valuable Player award|Most Valuable Player Award]]. Killebrew led the league six times in home runs and three times in RBIs, and was named to eleven [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]] teams.

With quick hands and exceptional upper-body strength, Killebrew was known not just for the frequency of his home runs but also for their distance. He hit the longest measured home runs at [[Metropolitan Stadium|Minnesota's Metropolitan Stadium]], {{convert|520|ft|m|abbr=on}}, and [[Memorial Stadium (Baltimore)|Baltimore's Memorial Stadium]], {{convert|471|ft|m|abbr=on}}, and was the first of just four batters to hit a baseball over the [[left field]] roof at [[Tiger Stadium (Detroit)|Detroit's Tiger Stadium]]. Despite his nicknames and his powerful style of play, Killebrew was considered by his colleagues to be a quiet, kind man. Asked once what hobbies he had, Killebrew replied, &quot;Just washing the dishes, I guess.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;SIHeilman1&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Heilman|first=Barbara|date=April 8, 1963|accessdate=July 7, 2008|journal=[[Sports Illustrated]]|url=http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1074683/1/index.htm|title=Out Of The Park On A Half Swing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After retiring from baseball, Killebrew became a television broadcaster for several baseball teams from 1976 to 1988, and also served as a hitting instructor for the [[Oakland Athletics]]. He also divorced and remarried during this time, moving to Arizona in 1990 and chairing the Harmon Killebrew Foundation. Killebrew was diagnosed with [[esophageal cancer]] in December 2010, and died five months later.

==Early life==
Born in [[Payette, Idaho]], Harmon Killebrew was youngest of four children to Harmon Clayton, Sr. and Katherine Pearl (May) Killebrew. His father, a painter and [[Sheriffs in the United States|sheriff]], was a member of an undefeated [[Millikin College]] [[American football|football]] team who was later named an [[All-America]]n under eventual [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] coach [[Greasy Neale]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Porter807&quot;&gt;[[#Porter|Porter]], p. 807.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Thielman132&quot;&gt;[[#Thielman|Thielman]], p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; According to family legend, Harmon Killebrew's grandfather was the strongest man in the [[Union Army]], winning every available [[Wrestling weight classes|heavyweight wrestling]] championship.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thielman132&quot;/&gt; Clayton encouraged Harmon and his brothers to stay active in various sports before his sudden death in 1953 at age 59.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thielman132&quot;/&gt;

As a child, Harmon played baseball at [[Walter Johnson]] Memorial Field, named after the [[Baseball Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] pitcher who spent part of his childhood in Idaho.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thielman131&quot;&gt;[[#Thielman|Thielman]], p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt; He worked as a farmworker in his youth, where he lifted 10-gallon milk cans, each can weighing about 95&amp;nbsp;lb (43&amp;nbsp;kg).&lt;ref name=Goldstein/&gt; Killebrew earned 12 [[Letterman (sports)|letters]] in various sports and was named an [[All-America#High school sports|All-American]] [[quarterback]] at [[Payette High School]]; his uniform number was later retired by the school.&lt;ref name=&quot;Porter807&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Thielman134&quot;&gt;[[#Thielman|Thielman]], p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; He was offered an [[athletic scholarship]] by the [[Oregon Ducks|University of Oregon]], but declined the offer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Porter8078&quot;&gt;[[#Porter|Porter]], pp. 807–808.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1950s, [[List of United States Senators from Idaho|Idaho Senator]] [[Herman Welker]] told Washington Senators owner [[Clark Griffith]] about Killebrew, who was hitting for an .847 [[batting average]] for a [[semi-professional]] baseball team at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thielman131&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Porter808&quot;&gt;[[#Porter|Porter]], p. 808.&lt;/ref&gt; Griffith told his [[Farm team|farm]] director [[Ossie Bluege]] about the tip and Bluege flew to Idaho to watch Killebrew play.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thielman133&quot;&gt;[[#Thielman|Thielman]], p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Boston Red Sox]] also expressed interest but Bluege succeeded in signing him to a $50,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|50000|1954|r=0}}}} today) contract on June 19, 1954.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thielman134&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Porter808&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The New York Times|title=Senators Pay $50,000 To First Bonus Player|date=June 20, 1954|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional baseball career==
===Washington Senators===
Killebrew signed his contract under [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB)'s [[Bonus Rule]], which required that he spend two full seasons on the major league roster.&lt;ref name=&quot;Porter808&quot;/&gt; Making his major league debut four days after signing and six days from his 18th birthday (becoming the youngest active player in the majors at the time), Killebrew was called on to run for [[Clyde Vollmer]], who had drawn a [[bases loaded]] [[base on balls|walk]] off of [[Chicago White Sox]] starter [[Jack Harshman]] while [[pinch hitting]] for Senators [[relief pitcher|reliever]] [[Chuck Stobbs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/CHA/CHA195406230.shtml|title=June 23, 1954, Senators at White Sox Box Score and Play by Play|work=[[Baseball-Reference]]|publisher=Sports Reference, LLC|accessdate=May 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BBRef&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/k/killeha01.shtml|title=Harmon Killebrew Statistics|work=Baseball-Reference|publisher=Sports Reference, LLC|accessdate=June 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 23, 1954, Killebrew made his first start in the second game of a [[Doubleheader (baseball)|doubleheader]] against the [[Philadelphia Athletics]], hitting two [[single (baseball)|singles]] and a [[double (baseball)|double]] as the Senators won the game, 10–3.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Shirley|last=Povich|title=Kid Killebrew Shines at Bat in Bow as Nat|magazine=[[The Sporting News]]|date=September 1, 1954|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; A year and one day after making his major league debut, Killebrew hit his first major league home run on June 24, 1955 in the 5th inning off [[Detroit Tigers]] starter [[Billy Hoeft]], five days shy of his 19th birthday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/WS1/WS1195506240.shtml|title=June 24, 1955, Tigers at Senators Play by Play and Box Score|work=Baseball-Reference|publisher=Sports Reference, LLC|accessdate=May 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his first two seasons, Killebrew [[strikeout|struck out]] 34 times in only 93 [[at bat]]s, contributing to a .215 batting average with four [[home run]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Porter808&quot;/&gt; Killebrew also had defensive difficulties at [[Third baseman|third base]], where he played behind veteran [[Eddie Yost]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Porter808&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Harmon Killebrew 1959.png|thumb|170px|left|Killebrew with the Senators in 1959.]]
When Killebrew's bonus period expired in 1956, he was sent to the Senators' [[Minor league baseball|minor league]] affiliate in [[Charlotte Hornets (baseball)|Charlotte]] of the [[Southern League (baseball)|South Atlantic League]].&lt;ref name=&quot;RetiredNumbers&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://minnesota.twins.mlb.com/min/history/killebrew.jsp|title=Minnesota Twins Retired Numbers – 3: Harmon Killebrew|publisher=MLB.com|accessdate=July 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to the majors in early May. On May 29, after being forced into action when regular [[second baseman]] [[Pete Runnels]] was injured early in the game, Killebrew hit two home runs in the game, including only the second ball ever hit over a wire barrier in [[Memorial Stadium (Baltimore)|Memorial Stadium]]'s center field.&lt;ref name=&quot;Retro1956HK&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1956/Ikillh1020031956.htm|title=The 1956 WAS A Regular Season Batting Log for Harmon Killebrew|publisher=[[Retrosheet]]|accessdate=June 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Thielman136&quot;&gt;[[#Thielman|Thielman]], p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; Killebrew had a .115 average through June 16, and as a result was sent back to Charlotte; he finished the season there with a .325 batting average and 15 home runs in 70 games.&lt;ref name=&quot;Retro1956HK&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BRMinors&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/player.cgi?id=killeb001har|title=Harmon Killebrew Minor League Statistics &amp; History|work=Baseball-Reference|publisher=Sports Reference, LLC|accessdate=September 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Killebrew spent most of the 1957 season with the [[Southern Association]]'s [[Chattanooga Lookouts]], where he hit a league-high 29 home runs with 101 RBIs and was named to the All-Star Game.&lt;ref name=&quot;BRMinors&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Thielman137&quot;&gt;[[#Thielman|Thielman]], p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt; While in Chattanooga, Killebrew became the only player to hit a home run over the center field wall at [[Engel Stadium]], {{convert|471|ft|m}} from home plate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Murrell&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.idahopress.com/special/?sr=4&amp;sra=4537|title=Harmon Killebrew: Baseball's killer|last=Murrell|first=I.

[[Calvin Griffith]] took over the Senators after his uncle [[Clark Griffith]] died in 1955, and decided Killebrew was ready to become the Senators' regular third baseman. Griffith traded the 32-year-old Eddie Yost to the [[Detroit Tigers]] on December 6, 1958, and Killebrew became the starting third baseman.&lt;ref name=&quot;Porter808&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBRefYost&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/y/yosted01.shtml|title=Eddie Yost Statistics|work=Baseball-Reference|publisher=Sports Reference, LLC|accessdate=June 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; From May 1 to May 17, he had five multi-home run games and his first five-RBI game on May 12.&lt;ref name=&quot;Porter808&quot;/&gt; With 28 home runs by mid-season, he started the [[1959 Major League Baseball All-Star Game (first game)|first 1959 All-Star Game]] and was a reserve in [[1959 Major League Baseball All-Star Game (second game)|the second]]. Killebrew attracted so much attention in Washington that he was visited by President of the United States [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], who frequently attended games,&lt;ref name=&quot;Allen76&quot;&gt;[[#Allen|Allen]], p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; and Griffith turned down a $500,000 offer for Killebrew from the [[Cincinnati Reds]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Allen76&quot;/&gt; Killebrew finished the season with 42 home runs to tie for the [[List of Major League Baseball home run champions|American League lead]]; it also tied the Senator's single-season record set by his teammate [[Roy Sievers]] two years earlier.&lt;ref name=&quot;Porter808&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;DigestClubRecords&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|month=June|year=2003|accessdate=July 20, 2008|journal=[[Baseball Digest]]|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0FCI/is_6_62/ai_100961691|title=Club home run leaders – Season}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although 1959 proved his breakout season, he was ineligible for the [[Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award|Rookie of the Year Award]] because of his previous sparse experience. Instead, the award went to teammate [[Bob Allison]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Thielman143&quot;&gt;[[#Thielman|Thielman]], p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt;

Killebrew was bothered by injury early in the 1960 season.

===Minnesota Twins===
====1961–1965====
For the franchise's first year in Minnesota, Killebrew was named [[Major League Baseball Team Captains|team captain]] by [[manager (baseball)|manager]] [[Cookie Lavagetto]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Thielman16&quot;&gt;[[#Thielman|Thielman]], p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; He responded by hitting 46 home runs, breaking the franchise record he had tied two years earlier.&lt;ref name=&quot;DigestClubRecords&quot;/&gt; Among his other accomplishments over the course of the season, Killebrew accumulated a team-leading 122 RBIs, achieved a career-best batting average of .288 and had a [[slugging percentage]] of over .600 for the only time in his career. In addition, he had a career-high seven [[triple (baseball)|triples]], tying for the team lead, and led his team in runs, total bases and walks.&lt;ref name=BBRef/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;RetiredNumbers&quot;/&gt; On June 12, 1961, Killebrew had the only five-hit game of his career in a losing effort by the Twins.&lt;ref name=&quot;RetroHKTop&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/K/PX_killh102.htm|title=Top Performances for Harmon Killebrew|publisher=Retrosheet|accessdate=July 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Killebrew was named to both 1961 All-Star games. He did not play in the second game, but in the [[1961 Major League Baseball All-Star Game (first game)|first game]], he hit a [[pinch hitter|pinch hit]] home run in the sixth inning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/NLS/NLS196107110.shtml|title=July 11, 1961 All-Star Game Play-By-Play|work=Baseball-Reference|publisher=Sports Reference, LLC|accessdate=May 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the season ended, Killebrew took part in a home run hitting contest with [[Jim Gentile]] and [[Roger Maris]], whose 61 home runs that year broke the single-season record; Killebrew hit 20 to win the contest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Xt9iAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=VTAMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5145,2486362|title=Killebrew Puts Maris In Shade In Homer Derby|work=[[Lewiston Morning Tribune]]|date=October 16, 1961|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After his seven-triple season, his speed began to decrease and he could no longer regularly score triples due to pulling his [[Quadriceps femoris muscle|quadriceps]] during the 1962 season.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thielman146&quot;&gt;[[#Thielman|Thielman]], p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt; Killebrew moved to left field, where he started off the season slowly.

Having played left field for the previous three years with a below-average throwing arm, the additional complication of Killebrew's knee surgery necessitated a move to the infield.

====1966–1969====
At the start of the 1966 season, Killebrew scored few home runs; halfway through May, he had only hit two home runs, his lowest total at that point of a season since 1960, when he had missed the first two months of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=V-pTAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=DjkNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6135,3810983|title=Harmon Killebrew Off to Slow Start in Home Run Department|work=[[St. Joseph News-Press]]|date=May 19, 1966|page=6D}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later increased his tally to 39 and finished the season with a .281 batting average and 110 RBIs.

During the 1967 season, Killebrew showed his ability to hit long home runs when, on June 3, 1967, he struck the longest home run recorded at Metropolitan Stadium, a shot Off of Lew Burdette in the 4th inning that landed in the second deck of the bleachers. &lt;ref name=&quot;Rushin1956&quot;&gt;[[#Rushin|Rushin]], pp. 195–196.&lt;/ref&gt; The Twins, led by Killebrew, were in the pennant race throughout the season, and had a one-game lead as the final two games of the season began against the [[Boston Red Sox]]. Having to win only once to clinch the pennant, Killebrew hit a home run in the first game and recorded two hits in each game, but Boston won twice and Minnesota finished in a second place tie with the [[Detroit Tigers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/MIN/1967_sched.shtml|title=1967 Minnesota Twins Schedule|work=Baseball-Reference|publisher=Sports Reference, LLC|accessdate=July 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Killebrew finished the season with a .269 batting average and 113 RBIs, and led the AL with 44 home runs and 131 walks.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBRef&quot;/&gt; He also finished a distant second in MVP voting to Boston's [[triple crown (baseball)|Triple Crown]] winner [[Carl Yastrzemski]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/awards/awards_1967.shtml#ALmvp|title=Baseball Awards Voting for 1967|work=Baseball-Reference|publisher=Sports Reference, LLC|accessdate=July 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Killebrew started the 1968 season in a different venue; he served as a prosecution witness in a case where his name was being used to sell stocks in Idaho, unknown to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=4KVfAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=WDIMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5853,1596682|title=Killebrew Testifies at Boise Fraud Trial Year|work=Lewiston Morning Tribune|page=15|date=April 10, 1968}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, the season was unsuccessful for Killebrew, whose batting average barely passed .200 most of the year; after a strong start, he hit below .200 in both May and June and his average stood at .204 with 13 home runs going into the all-star break.&lt;ref name=&quot;Retro1968Split&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1968/Jkillh1020151968.htm|title=The 1968 MIN A Batting Splits for Harmon Killebrew|publisher=Retrosheet|accessdate=July 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Retro1968HK&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1968/Ikillh1020151968.htm|title=The 1968 MIN A Regular Season Batting Log for Harmon Killebrew|publisher=Retrosheet|accessdate=July 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, he was selected as the starting first baseman in the All-Star Game and Killebrew stated that, owing to his poor start, he was &quot;surprised&quot; and &quot;embarrassed&quot; by the selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Killebrew Finds Choice Surprise|first=Jim|last=Elliot|work=[[The Baltimore Sun]]|page=C1|date=June 28, 1968}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the All-Star Game itself, he stretched for a ball while playing first base and slipped on the [[Reliant Astrodome|Astrodome]] turf, rupturing his left medial hamstring.&lt;ref name=&quot;Allen79&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1968/B07090NLS1968.htm|title=National League 1, American League 0|publisher=Retrosheet|accessdate=July 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Armour192&quot;&gt;[[#Armour|Armour]], p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, the injury was considered career-threatening, but after missing about six weeks, he returned to limited action in September.&lt;ref name=&quot;Armour192&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Killebrew Out for 6-8 Weeks With Injury|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|page=D18|date=July 11, 1968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the season, Killebrew set career highs in RBIs, runs, walks and [[on-base percentage]], tied his career high with 49 home runs, and even registered eight of his 19 career stolen bases, en route to winning his only [[Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player Award]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Allen79&quot;/&gt; He led the AL in home runs, RBIs, on-base percentage, walks, and intentional walks and knocked in the winning run 20 times while playing in all 162 games.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBRef&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Allen80&quot;&gt;[[#Allen|Allen]], p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2011, Killebrew's home run, RBI, and walk totals from 1969 remain team records,&lt;ref name=&quot;RetiredNumbers&quot;/&gt; and his 145 walks are tied for the 20th highest single season total in MLB history and 7th highest for a right-handed batter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/leaders/BB_season.shtml|title=Single-Season Leaders &amp; Records for Bases on Balls|work=Baseball-Reference|publisher=Sports Reference, LLC|accessdate=May 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[1969 American League Championship Series]], the [[Baltimore Orioles]] used their pitching staff, the best in the league, to defeat Minnesota and win the series three games to none.&lt;ref name=&quot;Armour192&quot;/&gt; Baltimore avoided Killebrew by walking him six times in the three games to avoid pitching to him, which was as many times as they walked the rest of the Twins team.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBRef1969ALCS&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/postseason/1969_ALCS.shtml|title=1969 AL Championship Series – BAL vs. MIN|work=Baseball-Reference|publisher=Sports Reference, LLC|accessdate=July 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====1970–1974====
After his MVP season, Killebrew signed a new contract with the Twins worth $90,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|90000|1970|r=0}}}} today).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=tctNAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=NooDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2087,6127662|title=Frank Robinson, Killebrew Sign Up|work=[[The Free Lance-Star]]|date=February 26, 1970|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was set to lead a team that had undergone a lot of change; Killebrew was one of only four Twins remaining from the 1965 pennant-winning club.&lt;ref name=&quot;Armour193&quot;&gt;[[#Armour|Armour]], p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt; He spent most of the season's first half continuing his success, and found Baltimore's [[Brooks Robinson]] rivalling him for the third base spot during the All-Star voting process; the two were neck-and-neck throughout.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=yX4sAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=6MwEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4653,3329896|title=Harmon, Brooks Battle For Third|work=[[Spartanburg Herald-Journal]]|page=9|date=June 20, 1970}}&lt;/ref&gt; He continued his success through the second half of the year, and at season's end Killebrew had hit 41 home runs with 113 RBIs and finished third in MVP voting behind teammate [[Tony Oliva]] and Baltimore's [[Boog Powell]], who won the award.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/awards/awards_1970.shtml#ALmvp|title=Baseball Awards Voting for 1970|work=Baseball-Reference|publisher=Sports Reference, LLC|accessdate=July 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Twins again faced Powell and the Orioles in the [[1970 American League Championship Series]], a rematch of the previous season.

Killebrew reached the 40 home runs for the final time in 1970 and also made his last appearance in the postseason. His contract continued to grow in value though, and before the 1971 season began he was awarded the first $100,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|100000|1971|r=0}}}} today) contract in Twins' history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=9k0fAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=mdEEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=731,4628288|title=$100,000 Pact For Killebrew|work=[[Daytona Beach Morning Journal]]|page=7|date=February 17, 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt; Killebrew appeared in his last All-Star Game in 1971, hitting a two-run home run off [[Ferguson Jenkins]] to provide the margin of victory for the AL.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBRef&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Retro1971AS&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1971/B07130ALS1971.htm|title=American League 6, National League 4|publisher=Retrosheet|accessdate=July 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He finished the season with a .254 batting average, 114 walks, 119 RBI, the latter two of which led the league, and 28 home runs.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBRef&quot;/&gt; Killebrew hit his 498th home run on June 22, 1971, but a sprained right toe made his run to milestone number 500 a slow one.

In 1972, Killebrew showed signs of slowing down.

Killebrew was involved in a [[Boise, Idaho|Boise]], Idaho insurance and securities business.&lt;ref name=&quot;Markoe515&quot;/&gt; He moved to [[Scottsdale, Arizona|Scottsdale]], Arizona in 1990, where he chaired the Harmon Killebrew Foundation, which he created in 1998.&lt;ref name=&quot;Markoe515&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Foundation&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.harmonkillebrewfoundation.org|title=Harmon Killebrew Foundation|publisher=The Lowertown Group|accessdate=August 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Killebrew founded the Danny Thompson Memorial Golf Tournament in 1977 with former [[Idaho]] [[United States Congress|congressman]] [[Ralph R.

The street along the south side of the [[Mall of America]], the former site of Metropolitan Stadium, was named &quot;Killebrew Drive&quot; in his honor. Banners that hung above the Metrodome's outfield upper deck, resembling baseball cards, showed the retired numbers: Killebrew (3), [[Rod Carew]] (29), Tony Oliva (6), [[Kent Hrbek]] (14) and [[Kirby Puckett]] (34). In 1999, he was ranked 69th on The Sporting News list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|year=1999|month=April|title=Baseball's 100 Greatest Players|magazine=The Sporting News|pages=20|accessdate=July 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was nominated as a finalist for Major League Baseball's All-Century Team.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://static.espn.go.com/mlb/news/1999/1023/129008.html|title=All-Century Team final voting|accessdate=March 5, 2009|author=[[Associated Press]]|publisher=ESPN|date=October 23, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the Twins moved into [[Target Field]] in 2010, Gate 3 on the southeast (centerfield) side of the stadium was named in his honor. There are also corresponding gates for the team's other retired numbers. Killebrew Canyon at [[Heavenly Mountain Resort]] is also named after the baseball star, who [[Alpine skiing|skied]] the outer limits of the resort after his retirement from baseball.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Heavenly Resort turns 50|work=[[Reno Gazette]]|page=E1|date=November 13, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite rumors that Killebrew was the player depicted in the [[Major League Baseball logo]], according to the creator, Jerry Dior, it was not patterned after Killebrew or any other specific player.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Man Behind the MLB Logo|first=David|last=Davis|work=The Wall Street Journal|date=October 23, 2008|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122453063968851133.html|accessdate=June 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=logo&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wireStory?id=13629819|title=Legend of MLB logo: Designer Says Not Killebrew|work=[[ABC News]]|first=Dave|last=Campbell|date=May 19, 2011|accessdate=June 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Killebrew is the model for the [[Major League Baseball Players Alumni Association]], an organization which Killebrew helped found in 1982.&lt;ref name=logo/&gt;

Killebrew was known as an all-around gentleman during his playing career. [[Reggie Jackson]] once said, &quot;If Harmon Killebrew isn't the league's best player, I've never seen one. He's one of the greatest of all time.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Allen80&quot;/&gt; He was even noted as being kind to the umpires:

{{quote|text=The Killer was one of the most feared sluggers in baseball history, but he was also one of the nicest people ever to play the game. He was one of the few players who would go out of his way to compliment umpires on a good job, even if their calls went against him. I'd call a tough strike on him and he would turn around and say approvingly, &quot;Good call.&quot; And he was the same way in the field. And he never did this to get help on close plays, as some players do. The man hit 573 major league home runs and no umpire ever swung a bat for him.|sign=[[Ron Luciano]]|source=Umpire Strikes Back, page 59&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Umpire Strikes Back|first=Ron|last=Luciano|publisher=Bantam|year=1984|isbn=978-0-553-24846-3|page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Killebrew was known for his quick hands and exceptional upper-body strength, demonstrated by several &quot;tape measure&quot; home runs that he hit in the prime of his career. Killebrew said that his first home run in the Majors was his favorite, coming off [[Billy Hoeft]] at [[Griffith Stadium]]. He said of it, &quot;[[Frank House (baseball)|Frank House]] was the catcher. When I came to the plate, he said, 'Kid, we’re going to throw you a fastball.' I didn’t know whether to believe him or not. I hit it out. It was one of the longest home runs I ever hit. As I crossed the plate, House said, 'That’s the last time I ever tell you what pitch is coming'.&quot;&lt;ref name=Goldstein/&gt;

On August 3, 1962, he was the first batter ever to hit a baseball over the left field roof at [[Tiger Stadium (Detroit)|Tiger Stadium]], a seldom-reached target as contrasted with the old ballpark's smaller right field area. Only three others accomplished this feat during the next 37 seasons before the stadium was closed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pahigian&quot;&gt;[[#Pahigian|Pahigian and O'Connell]], p. 253.&lt;/ref&gt;
On May 24, 1964, Harmon hit the longest measured homer at [[Memorial Stadium (Baltimore)|Baltimore Memorial Stadium]], {{convert|471|ft|m}} to deep left center. The ball landed in the far reaches of the bleachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/wire?section=mlb&amp;id=3409131|title=Baseball Today|publisher=MLB.com|accessdate=August 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only player to hit one completely out of the Orioles' stadium was [[Frank Robinson]] in 1966; his blast was reported as about {{convert|451|ft|m}}, or about {{convert|20|ft|m}} less than Killebrew's hit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.baseballlibrary.com/chronology/byyear.php?year=1966#May8|title=May 1966 Chronology|publisher=Baseball Library|accessdate=August 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 3, 1967, Killebrew hit a {{convert|520|ft|m|adj=on}} home run, the longest measured home run ever hit at Metropolitan Stadium and, as of 2011, the longest in Twins history.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rushin1956&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Leboutillier28&quot;&gt;[[#Leboutillier|Leboutillier]], p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; That event is commemorated at the [[Mall of America]] in Bloomington, Minnesota, which includes a plaque marking home plate, and one red-painted seat from the Met which was placed at the location and elevation of the landing spot of the home run.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rushin1956&quot;/&gt; The new Target Field has a statue of a Gold Glove outside Gate 34 and it is exactly {{convert|520|ft|m}} from Target Field's home plate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tcdailyplanet.net/arts/jean-gabler-harmon-killebrew-twins-say-goodbye|first=Jean|last=Gabler|title=Harmon Killebrew: The Minnesota Twins say goodbye to a legend|work=[[Twin Cities Daily Planet]]|date=June 15, 2011|accessdate=June 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
