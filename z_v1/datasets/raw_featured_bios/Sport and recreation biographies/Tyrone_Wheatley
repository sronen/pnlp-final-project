'''Tyrone Anthony Wheatley''' (born January 19, 1972) is the [[running back]]s coach at [[Syracuse University]] and a former professional [[American football]] player who played 10&amp;nbsp;[[season (sports)|seasons]] in the [[National Football League]] (NFL) and was one of the most successful [[high school]] and [[College|collegiate]] athletes in [[Metro Detroit|Metropolitan Detroit]] history. In high school, he was a member of state-champion teams in both [[Track and field athletics|track and field]] and football, and he was named [[Michigan]]'s track and field athlete of the year and football athlete of the year in the same [[academic year]]. He earned [[All-America]] track honors in both high school and college. Following his graduation as one of Michigan's best high school athletes, he attended the [[University of Michigan]] on an [[athletic scholarship]] and earned first-team All-[[Big Ten Conference]] honors on Big Ten Champion football and track teams.

At the University of Michigan, Wheatley earned the [[Big Ten Conference football individual honors#Offensive Player of the Year|Big Ten Offensive Player of the Year Award]] during the [[1992 NCAA Division I-A football season|1992 football season]]. In the [[1992 Michigan Wolverines football team|Michigan Wolverines]]' post-season [[bowl game]], he was named the [[Most Valuable Player]] for his performance in the team's [[1993 Rose Bowl|Rose Bowl]] victory. Wheatley continued his track success as well, earning first-team All-[[Big Ten Conference]] and All-American honors. He ranks among the Wolverines' all-time [[Rush (American football)|rushing]] leaders in numerous categories, and his name appears in several places in the Big Ten football record book. He was named to All-Big Ten teams in football and track and field a total of four times, and he earned portions of seven Big Ten championships (two team awards for football, one team award for indoor track, one award for [[110 meter hurdles]], and three awards for individual football statistical performances).

Following his graduation from the University of Michigan, Wheatley was selected by the [[New York Giants]] of the NFL in the first round of the [[1995 NFL Draft]]. As a running back for the Giants, he was the team's [[all-purpose yards]] leader in 1996 and their leading [[Carry (American football)|ballcarrier]] in 1997. Despite his success on the field, he developed a reputation as a tardy [[WIKT:dawdle|dawdle]]r. He was traded to the [[Miami Dolphins]], but cut before the [[1998 NFL season|1998 season]] began. He signed with the [[Oakland Raiders]] and flourished, leading the team in rushing three times and twice finishing among the NFL's top ten players in rushing [[touchdown]]s. With Wheatley, the Raiders went to the playoffs three years in a row, including one [[Super Bowl]] appearance. During his NFL career ([[1995 NFL season|1995]]–[[2004 NFL season|2004]]), he totaled over 6,500&amp;nbsp;all-purpose yards as a [[running back]] and [[kickoff returner]].

After retiring from the NFL, Wheatley returned to his hometown to coach his high school alma mater, [[Dearborn Heights, Michigan|Dearborn Heights]]' Hamilton J. Robichaud High School, where he had previously made a name for himself as a nine-time [[Michigan High School Athletic Association]] (MHSAA) state champion athlete. As a player, he had led the school to its only state football championship. In 2007, during his first year as head football coach, his team rebounded from an 0–9&amp;nbsp;record to compile a 9–2 record, reaching the playoffs for the first time since 1994. He coached at {{cfb link|year=2008|team=Ohio Northern Klondikes|school=Ohio Northern University|title=Ohio Northern University}} in [[2008 NCAA Division I FCS football season|2008]], and in [[2009 NCAA Division I FCS football season|2009]] he became an assistant coach for [[2009 Eastern Michigan Eagles football team|Eastern Michigan University]].  He has been hired as the [[running backs coach]] for the [[2010 Syracuse Orange football team|Syracuse Orange]] for [[2010 NCAA Division I FCS football season|2010]].

== Early life ==
Wheatley was born in [[Inkster, Michigan]]. Inkster is located in [[Metro Detroit|Metropolitan Detroit]], east of both [[Ann Arbor, Michigan|Ann Arbor]] and University of Michigan.  Wheatley's father (also named Tyrone)&lt;ref name=SoTT/&gt; suffered a mortal [[gunshot]] wound to the head in 1974 when Wheatley was two years old.&lt;ref name=PFTTSotGBE&gt;{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9800E0D9123EF935A35754C0A96E958260&amp;n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/People/W/Wheatley,%20Tyrone|title= Pro Football; The Two Sides of the Giants' Biggest Enigma|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|work=[[New York Times]]|accessdate=2008-08-24|date=1998-07-06|author=Pennington, Bill}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Wheatley's [[stepfather]] died of a heart attack when he was 13, leaving behind Wheatley, his sister, and half-brother, two-year-old Leslie Mongo.&lt;ref name=SoTT&gt;{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CEFD9143CF93AA2575BC0A963958260|title= Sports of The Times; Set Sails Can't Control The Wind|accessdate=2008-01-31|date=1995-08-19|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|work=[[New York Times]]|author=Rhoden, William C.|authorlink= William Rhoden}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Shortly afterward, Wheatley's mother, Patricia,&lt;ref name=PFTTSotGBE/&gt; was [[layoff|laid off]] and became an [[alcoholic]]. With the effective loss of his two parents, Wheatley and his sister were forced to move in with an aunt, where he lived through the rest of his childhood.&lt;ref name=SoTT/&gt;  Due to family difficulties, Wheatley acts as the guardian of two cousins and his half brother.&lt;ref name=SoTT/&gt;&lt;ref name=PFTTSotGBE/&gt; Mongo was ten years younger than Wheatley,&lt;ref name=PFTTSotGBE/&gt; and graduated from high school in New Jersey in 2004—thirteen years after Wheatley had graduated from high school.&lt;ref name=2004USFS/&gt; 

Wheatley was involved in competitive athletics from an early age: In his youth, he ran competitively with the Penn Park track team, where, as an eight-year-old, he stood out for his discipline and promptness.&lt;ref name=MhWwbgm/&gt;  Because of his family trouble, he assumed a family leadership role at a relatively young age.  Wheatley made it clear to his brothers and sisters that when chaos came to their lives, they should to turn to him because he would be there and he would never fall.&lt;ref name=SoTT/&gt; When he was in high school, he would take his younger siblings to basketball games, mapping out emergency plans for shooting outbreaks or brawls.&lt;ref name=PFTTSotGBE/&gt; Wheatley's guardianship continued throughout his career at the University of Michigan and while he was a professional athlete. While playing in the NFL, he realized that leaving Mongo—the youngest of his siblings—in Inkster and merely providing financial support was not a solution because Mongo was still exposed to [[gang]] shootings. As Mongo's guardian, Wheatley moved Mongo to [[New Jersey]] for school. Mongo later earned outstanding freshman athlete honors during the [[Bergen County, New Jersey]] outdoor track championships while living with Wheatley, who was playing for the Giants at the time.&lt;ref name=PFTTSotGBE/&gt; In 2004, with his graduation from high school imminent, Mongo signed a [[letter of intent]] with  [[Utah State Aggies football|Utah State]] as a [[defensive back]].&lt;ref name=2004USFS&gt;{{cite web|url=http://utahstateaggies.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/020404aaa.html|title=2004 Utah State Football Signees (as of 10:15 a.m.)|date=2004-02-04|accessdate=2008-01-30|publisher=utahstateaggies.cstv.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== New York Giants ===
==== Dan Reeves era (1995–1996) ====
Wheatley was drafted by the New York Giants in the first round of the [[1995 NFL Draft]] with the seventeenth overall selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/draft/history/fulldraft?season=1995|title=History (1995 Draft)|publisher=NFL Enterprises LLC.|work=NFL.com |accessdate=2008-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; He held out for 17 days before signing a five-year contract with the team.&lt;ref name=SoTT/&gt; The terms included a $2.3 million [[signing bonus]] and escalating base salaries totaling over $2.9 million.&lt;ref name=PFAPSSFWWG&gt;{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE7DF173EF933A2575BC0A963958260&amp;scp=32&amp;sq=Tyrone+Wheatley+draft&amp;st=nyt|title=Pro Football; A Painfully Slow Start For Wheatley With Giants|accessdate=2008-02-01|date=1995-08-10|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|work=[[New York Times]]|author=Freeman, Mike}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The negotiations were prolonged in part because of extensive family involvement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE0D91E30F93AA3575BC0A963958260&amp;scp=29&amp;sq=Tyrone+Wheatley&amp;st=nyt|title= Pro Football; Wheatley Signs: 5 Years and $5.2 Million|accessdate=2008-01-31|date=1995-08-09|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|work=[[New York Times]]|author=Freeman, Mike}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Wheatley set no goals for himself and lived by his grandmother's motto on preparing oneself: &quot;You can set your sails, but you can't set the wind&quot;.&lt;ref name=SoTT/&gt;  The Giants viewed Wheatley as their running back of the future, since [[Rodney Hampton]] was in the final year of his contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE7D61330F932A2575BC0A963958260&amp;scp=54&amp;sq=Tyrone+Wheatley&amp;st=nyt|title= Pro Football; Hampton Is Still The Man For Giants|accessdate=2008-01-31|date=1995-08-11|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|work=[[New York Times]]|author=Freeman, Mike}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Despite the original visions, Wheatley was used sparingly and started only eight games over the course of four seasons with the Giants.&lt;ref name=DCWiFWoC/&gt; Off the field, Wheatley moved his half-brother with him to New Jersey to keep him out of the tumultuous environment and to provide him a strong learning environment.&lt;ref name=PFWaGNGG/&gt;

In 1995 and 1996, under [[Dan Reeves]] the Giants had losing seasons and relied heavily on [[Rodney Hampton]] who received the bulk of the carries on rushing plays. In [[1995 NFL season|1995]], running back [[Herschel Walker]] received more passing downs and in [[1996 NFL season|1996]] [[fullback (American football)|fullback]] [[Charles Way]] was a main weapon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/teams/newyorkgiants/statistics?season=1995&amp;team=NYG&amp;seasonType=|accessdate=2008-02-25|title=New York Giants (1995)|publisher=NFL Enterprises LLC.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYG96&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/teams/newyorkgiants/statistics?season=1996&amp;team=NYG&amp;seasonType=|accessdate=2008-02-25|title=New York Giants (1996)|publisher=NFL Enterprises LLC.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wheatley returned kickoffs for the 1995 and 1996, with 10&amp;nbsp;returns for 18.6&amp;nbsp;yards per return in 1995 and 23&amp;nbsp;returns for 21.9&amp;nbsp;yards per return in 1996.&lt;ref name=TWNFL&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/players/tyronewheatley/careerstats?id=WHE081965|title=Tyrone Wheatley|accessdate=2008-02-25|publisher=NFL Enterprises LLC}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While Hampton led the team in rushing with 827&amp;nbsp;yards to Wheatley's 400&amp;nbsp;yards in 1996, Wheatley's 503&amp;nbsp;[[return yards]] and 51&amp;nbsp;yards receiving gave him the team [[All-purpose yardage|all-purpose yards]] leadership.&lt;ref name=NYG96/&gt;  However, Wheatley had 6&amp;nbsp;[[fumble]]s on only 147&amp;nbsp;touches (112&amp;nbsp;rushes, 12&amp;nbsp;receptions, and 23&amp;nbsp;kickoff returns).&lt;ref name=TWNFL/&gt;

The drafting of Wheatley had been hotly contested.  Some Giant draft war-room personnel had wanted to select [[Korey Stringer]] and others had an interest in [[Rashaan Salaam]] when the Giants' selection came.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE5D6103FF937A15757C0A963958260&amp;scp=34&amp;sq=Tyrone+Wheatley+draft&amp;st=nyt|title=Pro Football; On a Successful Draft Day, the Giants' Staff Turns Chaos Into Science |accessdate=2008-02-01|date=1995-04-25|publisher= [[The New York Times Company]]|work= [[New York Times]]|author=Freeman, Mike}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After Wheatley was selected with the seventeenth pick, running backs [[Napoleon Kaufman]], [[James Stewart (American football)|James Stewart]] and Rashaan Salaam were chosen with the eighteenth, nineteenth and twenty-first selections, respectively. Reeves made it no secret that he would have selected Salaam over Wheatley in the [[1995 NFL Draft|draft]].&lt;ref name=PFNFFFWFHN/&gt;&lt;ref name=PFACWRUBN/&gt;  Wheatley's introduction to the Giants was a contract squabble that kept him from getting to [[National Football League Training Camp|training camp]] on time.&lt;ref name=PFBRWiH&gt;{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9805E0D71338F932A05754C0A96E958260&amp;n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/People/W/Wheatley,%20Tyrone|title= Pro Football; Broken Record: Wheatley is Hurt|accessdate=2008-08-24|date=1998-07-31|author=Pennington, Bill|publisher= [[The New York Times Company]]|work= [[New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Then, in rookie season training camp, he had the misfortune of pulling a [[hamstring]] while running sprints on the first day.

Although he only actually fell asleep in one meeting, he also had mental concentration issues in practice.  He was not known for living erratically so his falling asleep and loss of concentration was enough of a problem that the Giants had Wheatley evaluated.&lt;ref name=FFMGHTiO&gt;{{cite web|url= http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C00E1DB153AF930A15752C1A9679C8B63&amp;n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/People/W/Wheatley,%20Tyrone|title= Football; Former Mystery Giant Has Thrived in Oakland|accessdate=2008-08-24|date=2001-11-23|author=Pennington, Bill|publisher= [[The New York Times Company]]|work= [[New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On top of this, Wheatley was fined several times for tardiness to team meetings.&lt;ref name=PFACWRUBN&gt;{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9404E0D6113CF93BA35751C1A9669C8B63&amp;n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/People/W/Wheatley,%20Tyrone|title=Pro Football; A Content Wheatley Runs Up Big Numbers|accessdate=2008-08-24|date=2000-12-08|author=Freeman, Mike|publisher= [[The New York Times Company]]|work= [[New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Jim Fassel era (1997–1998) ====

In [[1997 NFL season|1997]], by the end of training camp, Rodney Hampton's knees had given out, and although Wheatley had a great camp, [[Tiki Barber]] was named the starting [[Halfback (American football)|tailback]].&lt;ref name=PFWaGNGG/&gt; That season, [[Jim Fassel]]'s first, the Giants went to the [[NFL playoffs, 1997-98|playoffs]] with a 10–5–1 record. Wheatley led the team in carries that season despite missing two games and shared the ballcarrying responsibilities with Way and Barber.&lt;ref name=NYG97&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/teams/newyorkgiants/statistics?season=1997&amp;team=NYG&amp;seasonType=|accessdate=2008-02-25|title=New York Giants (1997)|publisher=NFL Enterprises LLC.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On October 12, Wheatley had his first 100-yard game with 102&amp;nbsp;yards on 22&amp;nbsp;carries against the [[Arizona Cardinals]] in a 27–13 victory on the road.&lt;ref name=TWBG/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/scores97/97285/97285332.htm|title=New York Giants vs. Arizona|accessdate=2008-01-23|publisher=[[USA Today]]|date=1997-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While Wheatley and Way divided the rushing load, Barber and Way divided most of the responsibility for the running backs' role in the passing attack, while Wheatley had less than half as many [[reception (American football)|receptions]] and reception yards as either of them.&lt;ref name=NYG97/&gt; An ankle injury caused Wheatley to miss the final two regular season games and the [[wild card (sports)|wild card]] [[playoff]] game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A07E0DD1E3EF935A15751C1A961958260&amp;n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/People/W/Wheatley,%20Tyrone|title=  Pro Football: Notebook; Giants' Backs Continue Rotation|accessdate=2008-08-24|date=1997-12-26|author=Litsky, Frank|publisher= [[The New York Times Company]]|work= [[New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/teams/newyorkgiants/statistics?season=1997&amp;team=NYG&amp;seasonType=POST|accessdate=2008-02-29|title=New York Giants (1997 Postseason)|publisher=NFL Enterprises LLC.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By [[1998 NFL season|1998]], Wheatley was the only four-year veteran in the Giants backfield and although he developed another good relationship with an offensive coordinator, he was becoming accustomed to being described as an enigma.&lt;ref name=PFTTSotGBE/&gt;  The Giants fell to 8–8 while relying on Barber, Way and Gary Brown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/teams/newyorkgiants/statistics?season=1998&amp;team=NYG&amp;seasonType=|accessdate=2008-02-25|title=New York Giants (1998)|publisher=NFL Enterprises LLC.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the season, Wheatley often performed [[scout team]] duties and was inactive for some games.  Fassel was not sympathetic to Wheatley's desire for playing time and thought that Wheatley was overweight.&lt;ref name=PFNFFFWFHN/&gt;  Over the course of the season, there was controversy about a season long weight limit of {{convert|235|lb|kg stlb}} that had been placed on Wheatley.&lt;ref name=PFWPItRWRS&gt;{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9502E5D71F31F934A2575AC0A96E958260&amp;n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/People/W/Wheatley,%20Tyrone|title= Pro Football; Weight Problem Is the Reason Wheatley Remains Sidelined for Giants|accessdate=2008-08-24|date=1998-09-17|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|work=[[New York Times]]|author=Pennington, Bill}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE1DF1230F933A1575AC0A96E958260&amp;n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/People/W/Wheatley,%20Tyrone|title=  Pro Football; Wheatley Is In Under the Scale|accessdate=2008-08-24|date=1998-09-20|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|work=[[New York Times]]|author=Pennington, Bill}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Wheatley's playing weight limit had been set at {{convert|230|lb|kg stlb|sigfig=3}} in [[training camp]] and had been raised to 235 on Wheatley's request.&lt;ref name=PFWPItRWRS/&gt;  He had played at {{convert|233|lb|kg stlb}} in the final game of his college career.&lt;ref name=WPWGDNSaM/&gt;  By week 11, Wheatley had only dressed in five games and played in four and was relegated to a role as an alternate when he played.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9901E3D81231F937A25752C1A96E958260&amp;n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/People/W/Wheatley,%20Tyrone|title= Football: Giants Notebook; For Wheatley, a Kickoff Cameo?|accessdate=2008-08-24|date=1998-11-14|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|work=[[New York Times]]|author=Pennington, Bill}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wheatley thought he was treated unfairly in New York although two different coaching staffs had issues with him.  He points out [[double standard]]s that gave him bad feelings in retrospect.  In situations where he was not the only Giant who was overweight or stuck in traffic, he was punished while others were not and those with worse problems such as showing up at practice drunk or being cited for [[Drunk driving (United States)|D.U.I.]] were not vilified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0DEEDB1730F93AA15753C1A9669C8B63&amp;n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/People/W/Wheatley,%20Tyrone|title=Pro Football: Notebook; Running Backs Thriving as Reclamation Projects|accessdate=2008-08-24|date=2000-10-29|author=Freeman, Mike|publisher= [[The New York Times Company]]|work= [[New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Wheatley had the responsibility of driving his brother, Leslie Mongo, to his school that opened at 8:15 and thought he was the victim of New Jersey traffic in relation to occasionally being late for 9:00 a.m. team meetings.&lt;ref name=WPWGDNSaM/&gt;  Charles Way, by contrast, Wheatley's closest friend on the team and [[roommate]] on the road, was nicknamed &quot;Teacher's Pet.&quot;&lt;ref name=PFWaGNGG&gt;{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0CEED6173AF930A25751C0A96F958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=1|title= Pro Football; Wheatley and Giants Never Gained Ground|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|work=[[New York Times]]|accessdate=2008-01-31|date=1999-02-13|author=Pennington, Bill}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to ''[[The New York Times]]'', there was a misperception of Wheatley as a &quot;cancer&quot;&lt;ref name=OPFTGCUWSN/&gt; in the locker room by most accounts.  Although he had some issues, his teammates remembered him for his personality and mannerly nature.&lt;ref name=OPFTGCUWSN/&gt;  The general opinion of Wheatley was that he was blessed with enormous talent, but as a package he was an enigma.  According to [[Michael Strahan]], Wheatley &quot;...could outrun the [[wide receiver]]s, outlift the [[Lineman (American football)|linemen]] and outdebate anyone.&quot;&lt;ref name=FFMGHTiO/&gt;  Thus, his off-season workout pattern of sloughing the weights for discussion of politics and current affairs was troubling, but not challenged because he could outlift most.&lt;ref name=FFMGHTiO/&gt;  However, in addition to the enigmatic issues, Wheatley had physical problems in New York.  He was injured and unable to perform for parts of all four of the training camps.&lt;ref name=PFBRWiH/&gt;  After the 1998 season Wheatley was traded to [[Jimmy Johnson (American football coach)|Jimmy Johnson]]'s [[Miami Dolphins]].&lt;ref name=PFACWRUBN/&gt;  In the February trade, the Giants were satisfied receiving a seventh round draft pick in return.&lt;ref name=OPFTGCUWSN/&gt;

While in [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], Wheatley would achieve much greater success than he had in New York.  Wheatley rushed for 1,000&amp;nbsp;yards in a season, led the Raiders in rushing three times, appeared in three consecutive playoffs (including one Super Bowl) and finished in the top-10 in the NFL for rushing touchdowns twice.

==== Jon Gruden era (1999–2001) ====
[[Image:John Gruden-cropped.jpg|thumb|right|[[Jon Gruden]]'s west coast offense brought out the best in veterans like Wheatley.]]
How well Wheatley complemented Napoleon Kaufman in Oakland was quickly evident to the New York media, and his newfound success was noticed when the Giants had an impotent running game in his absence.&lt;ref name=OPFTGCUWSN&gt;{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9403E4DF1539F93AA25753C1A96F958260&amp;n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/People/W/Wheatley,%20Tyrone|title=On Pro Football; The Giants Could Use Wheatley's Skills Now|accessdate=2008-08-24|date=1999-10-19|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|work=[[New York Times]]|author=Freeman, Mike}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In his early years with the Raiders, Wheatley quickly made good on the promise of his potential with a combination of the power to run inside and the speed to run outside.  Wheatley was quite popular in Oakland.  The players liked him and his coach, [[Jon Gruden]], even joked with him during his interviews.&lt;ref name=PFACWRUBN/&gt;

On the field, Wheatley became an important part of a surprisingly efficient [[West Coast offense]] run by [[Jon Gruden]].&lt;ref name=OPFTGCUWSN/&gt;  In 1999, Wheatley was the Raiders' leading rusher and their only running back to have more than one touchdown reception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/teams/oaklandraiders/statistics?season=1999&amp;team=OAK&amp;seasonType=|title=Oakland Raiders (1999)|publisher=NFL Enterprises LLC|accessdate=2008-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the first time, Wheatley had multiple 100-yard games in the same season:&lt;ref name=TWBG/&gt; 100&amp;nbsp;yards on 20&amp;nbsp;rushes on October 3 against the Seattle Seahawks and 111&amp;nbsp;yards on 19&amp;nbsp;rushes on December 19 against the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/scores99/99276/99276353.htm|title=Oakland vs. Seattle|accessdate=2008-01-23|publisher=[[USA Today]]|date=1999-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/scores99/99353/99353350.htm|title=Tampa Bay 0, Oakland 45 |accessdate=2008-01-23|publisher=[[USA Today]]|date=1999-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The players gelled as a unit and not only did Wheatley have his best seasons in Oakland, but also long time NFL veterans on the Raiders amassed their best season upon his arrival.  For example, [[Rich Gannon]], an NFL veteran [[quarterback]] since [[1987 NFL season|1987]], made his first four [[Pro Bowl]] appearances with Wheatley as a weapon.  The team only compiled an 8–8 record, however.

Wheatley had the best season of his career in the [[2000 NFL season|2000]] as Raiders went 12–4 and reached the [[American Football Conference]] championship game of the [[NFL playoffs, 2000-01|2000–01 NFL playoffs]].  Wheatley amassed 1,046&amp;nbsp;yards rushing and 9&amp;nbsp;touchdowns on 232&amp;nbsp;carries and added 20&amp;nbsp;receptions for 156&amp;nbsp;yards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/teams/oaklandraiders/statistics?season=2000&amp;team=OAK&amp;seasonType=|title=Oakland Raiders (2000)|publisher=NFL Enterprises LLC|accessdate=2008-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Wheatley combined effectively with Kaufman to form an inside and outside attacking combination in these first two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/e/a/2000/09/17/SPORTS2067.dtl&amp;hw=Tyrone+Wheatley&amp;sn=006&amp;sc=620|title=Wheatley's hit man for inside jobs: Raiders back finally at home after stops in New York, Miami|author=Blackman, Frank|accessdate=2008-08-24|date=2000-09-17|publisher=[[Hearst Communications Inc.]]|work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wheatley’s 4.5&amp;nbsp;yards per carry ranked ninth in the NFL.&lt;ref name=TWPFR&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/W/WheaTy00.htm|title=Tyrone Wheatley|accessdate=2008-01-20|publisher=Sports Reference, LLC.|work=Pro-Football-Reference.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not only did Wheatley amass a career-high three 100-yard rushing games that season, but he also had his three highest career single-game performances:&lt;ref name=TWBG&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/W/WheaTy00_biggames.htm|title= Tyrone Wheatley (big games)|accessdate=2008-01-20|publisher= Sports Reference, LLC.|work= Pro-Football-Reference.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  156&amp;nbsp;yards on only 15&amp;nbsp;carries on October 22 at home against the Seattle Seahawks, 146&amp;nbsp;yards on December 16 at Seattle and 112&amp;nbsp;yards on November 5 against the [[Kansas City Chiefs]].

In [[2001 NFL season|2001]], with the arrival of [[Jerry Rice]] and [[Charlie Garner]], the offense focused on the passing game, running five more pass attempts per game than the year before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2001/10/19/SP204000.DTL&amp;hw=Tyrone+Wheatley&amp;sn=005&amp;sc=642|title=Wheatley's status still a mystery|accessdate=2008-08-24|date=2001-10-19|publisher=[[Hearst Communications Inc.]]|work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|author=Smith Michelle}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The team produced two 1,000-yard receivers with Rice amassing 1,139&amp;nbsp;yards and [[Tim Brown (American football)|Tim Brown]] totaling 1,165&amp;nbsp;yards.  Garner led the team in rushing and accumulated 72&amp;nbsp;receptions.  Meanwhile, Wheatley only started three games and accumulated only 12&amp;nbsp;receptions over the course of the season.  For the first time as a Raider, Wheatley went an entire season without a 100-yard rushing game.&lt;ref name=TWBG/&gt;  The team went 10–6 and returned to the [[NFL playoffs, 2001-02|2001–02 NFL playoffs]], but Wheatley only had 88&amp;nbsp;carries during the regular season despite tying Zack Crockett for the running back leadership with 6&amp;nbsp;touchdowns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/teams/oaklandraiders/statistics?season=2001&amp;team=OAK&amp;seasonType=|title=Oakland Raiders (2001)|publisher=NFL Enterprises LLC|accessdate=2008-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the first round [[Wild card (sports)|wild card]] game, Wheatley posted his second highest playoff total of 37&amp;nbsp;yards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/scores102/102012/102012302.htm|title=New York Jets 24, Oakland 38|accessdate=2008-01-24|publisher=[[USA Today]]|date=2002-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Wheatley's first and only career [[road (sports)|road]] playoff game, he only posted five yards rushing on four carries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/scores102/102019/102019302.htm|title=Oakland 13, New England 16 |accessdate=2008-01-24|publisher=[[USA Today]]|date=2002-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Bill Callahan era (2002–2003) ====

Under new coach [[Bill Callahan (coach)|Bill Callahan]], the [[2002 NFL season|2002]] Raiders became more reliant on Garner as the primary running back.  Again, Rice and Brown were primary targets for Gannon who, while having his best season with 4,689&amp;nbsp;yards, did not use Wheatley as a receiver as much as other players.  Wheatley had more carries than in 2001, but did not start a single game and did not see the end zone often. Again, Wheatley went an entire season without a 100-yard rushing game.&lt;ref name=TWBG/&gt; However, as a role player he was able to play in three [[NFL playoffs, 2002-03|2002–03 playoff games]] including the [[Super Bowl XXXVII|2003 Super Bowl]] against former coach Gruden.&lt;ref name=TWP/&gt;  As in his previous seasons, Wheatley posted his best playoff numbers in his first game, this time 30&amp;nbsp;yards on only four carries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/scores103/103012/20030112NFL--OAKLAND---0nr.htm|title=Oakland 30, N.Y.

In [[2003 NFL season|2003]], Wheatley reclaimed his role as the Raiders' leading rusher although Garner, the second leading rusher, continued to be the target of more passes and Crockett made it to the end zone as a rusher as often as Wheatley and Garner combined.  Wheatley became the sixth person to lead the Raiders franchise in rushing yards three times ([[Clem Daniels]], [[Marv Hubbard]], [[Mark van Eeghen]], [[Marcus Allen]], [[Napoleon Kaufman]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/rai/|title=Oakland Raiders Franchise Encyclopedia|accessdate=2008-01-18|publisher=Sports Reference, LLC.|work=Pro-Football-Reference.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 2003 Raiders fell to 4–12 and had no 1,000-yard receivers or runners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/teams/oaklandraiders/statistics?season=2003&amp;team=OAK&amp;seasonType=|title=Oakland Raiders (2003)|publisher=NFL Enterprises LLC|accessdate=2008-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wheatley’s only 100-yard rushing game came on November 16 at home against the [[Minnesota Vikings]].&lt;ref name=TWBG/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scores.espn.go.com/nfl/boxscore?gameId=231116013|title=Minnesota 18, Oakland 28|accessdate=2008-01-23|date=2003-11-16|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wheatley's name and those of several of his teammates were found on the list of clients of the [[Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative]] (BALCO) that had given performance-enhancing drugs to [[Marion Jones]] and others.  As a result he, and teammates [[Chris Hetherington]], [[Dana Stubblefield]], and [[Chris Cooper (football player)|Chris Cooper]] were called to testify before a 2003&amp;nbsp;federal [[grand jury]] investigating a laboratory that produces [[Dietary supplement|nutritional supplements]].  [[Johnnie Morton]] was called before the same jury.  Wheatley, Stubblefield, and Morton all declined to comment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9402E0D91538F937A25752C1A9659C8B63&amp;n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/People/W/Wheatley,%20Tyrone|title= A Photographer Says Wheatley Hit Him Outside Courthouse|accessdate=2008-08-24|date=2003-11-14|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|work=[[New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This court appearance in the BALCO hearings was notable for Wheatley's assault of a [[freelance]] photographer who attempted to take Wheatley's photo outside the [[Philip Burton Federal Building]] just after Wheatley had informed the [[KNTV]] [[cameraman]] that he would sue anyone who took his picture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/chronicle/archive/2003/11/14/SPG743228E1.DTL|title=Wheatley's photo op goes over the top Grapple with photographer overshadows BALCO testimony|accessdate=2008-01-29|publisher=[[Hearst Communications Inc.]]|work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|author=Crumpacker, John and Ron Kroichick|date=2003-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Norv Turner era (2004) ====

Although Wheatley's 2003 performance had been modest compared with the other seasons that he led the Raiders in rushing (1999, 2000), it was sufficient to convince the Raiders that they did not need to re-sign the pass catching running back Charlie Garner for the [[2004 NFL season|2004 season]] with the new coach [[Norv Turner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1208/is_38_228/ai_n6203721 |title=AFC West |publisher=FindArticles|work=Sporting News|accessdate=2008-08-24|date=2004-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2004 Raiders used a platoon of five runners (Wheatley, Crockett, [[Justin Fargas]], [[J.

== Coaching ==
