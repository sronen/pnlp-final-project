[[Ron Hamence]] was a member of [[Donald Bradman]]'s famous [[Australian cricket team in England in 1948|Australian cricket team of 1948]], which toured England and was undefeated in its 34 matches. As a result of this unprecedented feat by a Test side touring England, the team earned the sobriquet ''The Invincibles''.

A right-handed [[batting order (cricket)|middle-order]] batsman, Hamence was not instrumental in the team's success. Regarded as the last batsman to be chosen for the team, his selection was the subject of controversy because many batsmen who had scored more runs in the preceding Australian season had been overlooked. Hamence and [[Colin McCool]] were the only squad members who did not play a [[Test cricket|Test]] on tour. Hamence was used in non-Test tour matches so that the leading batsmen could conserve energy for the Tests, as play was scheduled for six days a week. Along with [[Doug Ring]], Hamence and McCool called themselves &quot;ground staff&quot; because of their scant playing duties in the major matches, and they often created and sang ironic songs about their lack of opportunities. Bradman was reluctant to risk the team's unbeaten record and as a result, Hamence did not receive many opportunities to bat high in the order, something that was the subject of criticism.

Hamence scored 582 [[run (cricket)|runs]] at a [[batting average]] of 32.33, with a top-score of 99. He was the only frontline Australian batsman not to score a [[century (cricket)|century]]. The remaining eight frontline batsmen each scored at least 973 runs and all averaged no less than 47.30. Hamence also occasionally opened the bowling in the tour matches with his [[fast bowling#Categorisation_of_fast_bowling|gentle medium pace]], allowing the team's leading bowlers to recuperate between Tests.

== Background ==

During the preceding 1947&amp;ndash;48 season in Australia, Hamence was dropped from the national team. He had played sporadically in the Test team, being selected in three of the ten matches in the previous two seasons. In those three Tests he scored a total of 81 runs at an average of 27.00.&lt;ref name=testlist&gt;{{cite web

His selection for the 1948 tour of England under Bradman was the subject of considerable controversy, as many other batsmen were overlooked despite being more productive during the Australian summer. For his part, Bradman described his middle-order&amp;mdash;Hamence among them&amp;mdash;as &quot;an array of batsmen who could scarcely fail&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Bradman, p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; From the start, Hamence was on the outer with regards to selection in the Tests.&lt;ref&gt;Perry (2008), p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; He was not selected for any of the Tests during the English campaign, but in a 2008 interview,&lt;ref name=&quot;Allen 1999&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last= Allen |first= Peter |title= The Invincibles: The Legend of Bradman's 1948 Australians |year=1999 |publisher= Allen and Kemsley |location=Mosman, NSW, Australia |isbn= 1-875171-06-1 |pages=76&amp;ndash;79}}&lt;/ref&gt; emphasised that he felt no resentment over his omission.&lt;ref name=hero&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,23864963-2882,00.html |title=Celebrating 60 years since the 1948 Ashes Test series |work=[[The Herald Sun]] |accessdate=2008-06-17 |date=15 June 2008 | first=Glenn | last=McFarlane}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hamence was a popular member of the touring party and his cheerful nature and splendid [[tenor]] voice added to the good spirits of the team.&lt;ref name=hero/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pollard&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Pollard |first=Jack |title=Australian Cricket: The game and the players |year=1988 |publisher=Angus &amp; Robertson |location=Sydney |isbn=0-207-15269-1 |page=506}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Perry (2008), p. 323.&lt;/ref&gt; His roommate during the tour was the seamer [[Ernie Toshack]].&lt;ref&gt;Perry (2008), p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early tour ==
Australia traditionally fielded its first-choice team in the tour opener, which was customarily against [[Worcestershire County Cricket Club|Worcestershire]].&lt;ref name=haigh&gt;{{cite news| title=Gentrifying the game| first=Gideon | last=Haigh| authorlink=Gideon Haigh| url=http://www.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/295893.html |publisher=[[Cricinfo]] |date=26 May 2007| accessdate=2007-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Being a fringe member of the squad and having made only sporadic Test appearances in previous seasons, Hamence was not selected. Australia promptly crushed the hosts [[The_result_in_cricket#Statement_of_result|by an innings]].&lt;ref name=o/&gt;&lt;ref name=sched/&gt;

Hamence made his debut on English soil in the second tour match against [[Leicestershire County Cricket Club|Leicestershire]]. Batting at No. 6, he came in at 4/344&lt;ref&gt;This notation means that four [[wicket]]s were lost while 344 runs were scored.&lt;/ref&gt; and made only seven. His [[dismissal (cricket)|dismissal]] triggered a collapse of 5/38 as Australia were bowled out for 448 before winning by an innings.&lt;ref name=leics&gt;{{cite web

He batted slowly, coming in at 2/24 before departing at 7/74.&lt;ref name=york/&gt; After Australia dismissed the hosts for 89 in their second innings, Australia collapsed to 3/13 in pursuit of 60 for victory. Hamence came in and scored one before he was [[run out]] after being slow to set off for a quick single; Australia collapsed to 6/31. To make matters worse, [[Sam Loxton]] was injured and could not bat, so Australia effectively had only three wickets in hand and faced their first loss to an English county since 1912.&lt;ref name=york&gt;{{cite web

Hamence was rested as the Australians travelled to London to defeat [[Surrey County Cricket Club|Surrey]] at [[The Oval]] by an innings.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;&lt;ref name=sched/&gt; He returned for the next match against [[Cambridge University Cricket Club|Cambridge University]]. Elevated to No. 3 by stand-in captain [[Lindsay Hassett]], Hamence came in at 1/64 and put on a [[partnership (cricket)|partnership]] of 176 with [[Bill Brown (cricketer)|Bill Brown]], ending with 92 as Australia piled on 4/414 and won by an innings.&lt;ref name=camb/&gt; Hamence scored mainly from the back foot,&lt;ref&gt;Perry (2008), p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jack Fingleton]] opined &quot;a nice innings it was, too, in its neat strokemaking&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Fingleton, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; Hamence also bowled for the first time on tour, sending down three [[over (cricket)|overs]] for seven runs in the second innings without taking a wicket.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;&lt;ref name=sched/&gt;&lt;ref name=camb&gt;{{cite web

In the following match, Australia crushed [[Essex County Cricket Club|Essex]] by an innings and 451 runs, their largest winning margin for the summer.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;&lt;ref name=sched/&gt; On the first day, Australia set a world record by scoring 721, the most first-class runs added in one day.&lt;ref&gt;Fingleton, pp. 65&amp;ndash;67.&lt;/ref&gt; Halfway through the day, at 2/364, [[all rounder]] [[Keith Miller]] came to the crease. A cavalier and carefree character, Miller resented Bradman's ruthless attitude towards annihilating the opposition and often refused to try when Australia were in an unassailable position. He deliberately let the ball hit the stumps and was out for a [[duck (cricket)|golden duck]].&lt;ref&gt;Fingleton, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=p227&gt;Perry (2005), p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt; Hamence came in and struck 46, adding 146 runs for the fifth wicket with [[Sam Loxton]].&lt;ref name=essex/&gt; The partnership took only an hour,&lt;ref&gt;Fingleton, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; and Australia went on to win by an innings.&lt;ref name=essex&gt;{{cite web

The next match was against the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] (MCC) at [[Lord's]]. The MCC fielded seven players who would represent England in the Tests,&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#00f&quot;&gt;N-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;{{Ref label|play|1|a}} and were basically a full strength Test team, while Australia fielded their first-choice team. It was a chance to gain a psychological advantage. Given Hamence's early struggles in the English conditions, which saw him make only 161 runs at 26.83 in his first six innings,&lt;ref name=o/&gt; while all of Australia's first-choice top six had made centuries,&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#00f&quot;&gt;N-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;{{Ref label|cent|3|a}} he was not selected; Australia amassed 552 and won by an innings.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;&lt;ref name=sched/&gt;

Recalled for the next match, against [[Lancashire County Cricket Club|Lancashire]] at [[Old Trafford (cricket ground)|Old Trafford]] in Manchester, Hamence scored two while batting at No. 7 in the first innings and an unbeaten 49 at No. 6 in the second, putting on an unbeaten century partnership with Harvey as the match ended in a draw after the entire first day's play was lost to rain.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;&lt;ref name=lancs&gt;{{cite web

Hamence had one last chance to make his case for Test selection in the match against [[Sussex County Cricket Club|Sussex]] at [[Hove]], the last county fixture before the First Test at [[Trent Bridge]]. He came to the crease at 4/453 and made 34 in a stand of 96 with Harvey. His dismissal and Harvey reaching his 100 prompted Australia to [[declaration and forfeiture|declare]] at 5/549.&lt;ref name=sussex/&gt; Bradman said that Hamence was &quot;the unlucky player of the match&quot; and that he was standing on the balcony ready to declare when Hamence fell on the last ball of the over.&lt;ref name=b175&gt;Bradman, p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt; Australia went on to complete an innings victory. In the second innings, Hamence opened the bowling with [[Ray Lindwall]]. He took an early wicket before ending the innings by claiming the last man to fall, a stumping by [[Ron Saggers]] standing up to the stumps.&lt;ref name=sched/&gt;&lt;ref name=sussex&gt;{{cite web

Since [[World War II]], the first five positions in Australia's Test batting order had regularly consisted of [[Arthur Morris]], [[Sid Barnes]], Bradman, Hassett and Miller, while the sixth position saw many occupants.&lt;ref&gt;Perry (2005), pp. 216&amp;ndash;218.&lt;/ref&gt; All of the first five were selected for the matches against Worcestershire and the MCC, and retained their positions for the First Test.&lt;ref name=sco1/&gt;&lt;ref name=mcc/&gt;&lt;ref name=worcs/&gt;

== Later tour matches ==

Seven matches remained on Bradman's quest to go through a tour of England without defeat.&lt;ref name=sched/&gt; Australia batted first against [[Kent County Cricket Club|Kent]] and Hamence made 38. Hamence was the ninth man to fall as partners ran out and Australia lost their last seven wickets for 89 to end at 361.&lt;ref name=kent&gt;{{cite web

Hamence bowled in both innings for a total of 1/41 as Australia won by an innings.&lt;ref name=sched/&gt;&lt;ref name=gents&gt;{{cite web

With his score on 99, the rest of the team left their card games in readiness to applaud his impending milestone.&lt;ref name=Pollard/&gt; However, Hamence hit two balls from the middle of the bat, only to see them travel directly to the fielder, yielding no runs.&lt;ref name=b216/&gt; Anxious to reach his century, Hamence then charged down the pitch and was then stumped for 99, his highest score for the season.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pollard&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Perry (2008), p. 253.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Bradman, Hamence &quot;fell to what everyone said was the best ball all day&quot;.&lt;ref name=b216&gt;Bradman, p. 216.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Australia won by an innings and 374 runs.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;&lt;ref name=sched/&gt;&lt;ref name=somerset/&gt; In the following match against the [[South of England cricket team|South of England]], Hamence made seven as Australia declared at 7/522.

Australia's biggest challenge in the post-Test tour matches was the fixture against Leveson-Gower's XI. During the last tour in 1938, this team was effectively a full-strength England outfit, but this time Bradman insisted that only six players currently in England's Test team be allowed to play for the hosts.&lt;ref name=plg/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fingleton, pp. 207&amp;ndash;209.&lt;/ref&gt; Bradman then fielded a full-strength team,&lt;ref name=plg&gt;Perry (2005), pp. 253&amp;ndash;254.&lt;/ref&gt; so Hamence was left out. Australia led by 312 on the first innings and were well in control, but the match ended in a draw after multiple rain delays.&lt;ref name=sco5/&gt;&lt;ref name=lg&gt;{{cite web

After consecutive single figure scores, he makes four scores between 30 and 50 in five innings. eh then made six innings in a row below 30, before scoring 99 near the end of the sequence.]]

During the tour, Hamence played 19&amp;nbsp;first-class matches and scored 582&amp;nbsp;runs at an average of 32.33.&lt;ref name=&quot;Allen 1999&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=fc/&gt; An occasional bowler who delivered 56.3 overs of [[seam bowling|medium pace]] during the tour,&lt;ref name=fc/&gt; he took seven wickets at 21.42 and completed nine catches.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; He was the most successful of the specialist batsmen with the ball,&lt;ref name=fc/&gt; occasionally opening the bowling in the tour matches, such as in both innings of the second match against Surrey and the second innings of the second match against Yorkshire. This allowed Bradman to rest his first-choice bowlers to keep them fresh for the Tests.&lt;ref name=york2/&gt;&lt;ref name=surrey2/&gt; Hamence's primary role was to allow the leading batsmen an opportunity to conserve energy for the Tests; the Australians generally had six days of play scheduled every week.&lt;ref name=sched/&gt; In most of the matches, Hamence batted in the middle order at Nos. 5, 6 and 7.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#00f&quot;&gt;N-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;{{Ref label|bat|3|a}} Along with Loxton, he was given 22 first-class opportunities with the bat, whereas the other eight frontline batsmen had at least 26 innings. Loxton scored 973 runs, while the others all scored more than 1,000. All of the batsmen other than Loxton averaged at least 47.30.&lt;ref name=fc&gt;{{cite web| url=http://stats.cricinfo.com/ci/engine/records/averages/batting_bowling.html?class=4;id=1070;type=tour |publisher=[[Cricinfo]] |title=Batting and bowling averages Australia tour of England, April-September 1948 - First-class matches|accessdate=2008-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as Australia won many of their matches by an innings or by eight or more wickets, he seldom batted in the second innings. On four occasions, he was unbeaten when Australia either declared, reached their target or time ran out.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; 

Teammate Sid Barnes criticised the omission of Hamence from much meaningful cricket on the tour. Referring to the match against the Gentlemen of England, Barnes criticised the fact that Bradman, Hassett and himself all made centuries, while Hamence was only given a short innings in the lower order and was not out on 24 when Australia declared. As the tourists were already in a strong position, Barnes reasoned that Hamence &quot;could have been sent in [at] [[Batting order (cricket)|first wicket down]], where he batted with his [[Southern Redbacks|interstate team]]&amp;nbsp;... Despite this, Hassett still went in before Hamence in the next game, against Somerset&amp;nbsp;... Hamence batted No. 6... but he should have been sent in No. 3.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;barnes&quot;&gt;Barnes, p. 180. &quot;No. 6&quot; and &quot;No. 3&quot; refer to positions in the batting order. The No. 3 batsman bats after the first wicket in the innings has fallen, i.e. third in order after the two opening batsmen. The No. 6 batsman will bat after the fourth wicket has fallen.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Barnes reported that Hamence, along with the other frequent omissions [[Colin McCool]] and [[Doug Ring]], termed themselves the &quot;ground staff&quot;.&lt;ref name=barnes/&gt; He added: &quot;In the dressing room during [[County cricket|county games]] they would break out into ironic song about the few chances they got.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;barnes&quot;/&gt; Loxton reported that these songs included the &quot;odd risque [[limerick]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Perry (2008), p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; Bradman did later state that &quot;because of the strong array of batsman ahead of him, [Hamence] seldom had an opportunity to make big scores&quot; but &quot;was an extremely useful reserve who could have been played in the Tests with confidence&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bradman&quot;/&gt; Following the 1948 tour, Bradman described Hamence as &quot;a fine batsman of the strictly orthodox type. Very sound and reliable with his game based on [[Batting (cricket)#Drive|driving]]&quot; and a &quot;very safe fieldsman&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bradman&quot;&gt;Bradman, p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt; Bradman added that Hamence had few opportunities because of Australia's batting strength but &quot;always batted well and often at a critical moment made valuable runs&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Bradman, p. 230.&lt;/ref&gt; Bradman said that Hamence &quot;could have been played in the Tests with confidence&quot; and praised his contributions to team morale.&lt;ref&gt;Bradman, p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt; Fingleton said &quot;there was criticism of his selection in this side, but had the war not intervened he undoubtedly would have made a [Ashes] trip before&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Fingleton, p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt;
