'''Ian Meckiff''' (born 6 January 1935 in [[Mentone, Victoria|Mentone]], Victoria, Australia) is a former [[cricket]]er who represented [[Australia national cricket team|Australia]] in 18 [[test cricket|Tests]] between 1957 and 1963. A left-arm [[Fast bowling|fast bowler]], he is best known for two matters that were unrelated to his skill as a player: He was the batsman [[run out]] by [[Joe Solomon]] in 1960, causing the first [[Tied Test]] in cricket history; and in December 1963, his career was sensationally ended when he was [[no-ball|called]] for [[throwing (cricket)|throwing]] in the First Test against [[South Africa national cricket team|South Africa]] by Australian umpire [[Col Egar]]. During the late 1950s and early 1960s, there had been a media frenzy about the perceived prevalence of illegal bowling actions in world cricket. The controversy and speculation that dogged Meckiff in the years preceding his final match caused sections of the cricket community to believe that he had been made a scapegoat by the Australian cricket authorities to prove their intent to stamp out throwing.

With an unconventional front-on bowling action, Meckiff progressed through the [[Victorian Premier Cricket|district cricket ranks]] at [[Casey-South Melbourne Cricket Club|South Melbourne Cricket Club]], making his [[First-class cricket|first-class]] debut for [[Victorian Bushrangers|Victoria]] in 1956–57. After a productive first season, Meckiff was named in a new-look Australian team for the 1957–58 [[Australian cricket team in South Africa in 1957-58|tour of South Africa]]. This was the result of a generational change in the Australian Test team after a decline in performances in the 1950s. The shift saw Meckiff open the bowling in his debut Test, where he performed strongly to take eight wickets. Generating his pace from an unusual bent-arm action which involved a flick of the wrist, Meckiff reached his peak in the Second Test of the 1958–59 season against [[England cricket team|England]] at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]]. He took 6/38 in the second innings as England were dismissed for 87, setting up an Australian victory. His achievement was engulfed by controversy, as English media and former players accused him of throwing Australia to victory.

The controversy over Meckiff's action persisted as throwing was in the spotlight in England, where it was regarded as a growing problem. The issue prompted numerous international discussions and meetings on amending the throwing law and the interpretation thereof. An expected confrontation with English umpires in 1961 was averted when the bowler suffered multiple injuries in the preceding Australian summer and was omitted from the [[Australian cricket team in England in 1961|team to tour England]], but Meckiff had two strong seasons in domestic cricket that forced the Australian selectors to recall him for the Tests against South Africa in 1963–64. The Victorian's recall had occurred despite his being [[no ball|no-balled]] for throwing in two separate [[Sheffield Shield]] matches in the previous season. In his first over of the Test, Meckiff was no-balled four times by umpire Egar. Australian captain [[Richie Benaud]] chose to not bowl his paceman again, and Meckiff retired from all cricket at the end of the match. The throwing controversy provoked heavy debate among cricket commentators, players and umpires, past and present; some praised Egar's no-ball call while others condemned the umpire and felt that the paceman had bowled in the same way as he had always done. Others felt that Meckiff had been set up so that he would be no-balled in an &quot;execution&quot; or &quot;sacrifice&quot; to prove Australia's resolve against throwing.

==Early life==
Meckiff was the second of three children born to Vera and Walter Meckiff; he had an older brother Don and a younger sister Margaret. Growing up in the south-eastern Melbourne suburb of [[Mentone, Victoria|Mentone]],&lt;ref name=fam/&gt; the children went to Mentone Primary School before progressing to Mordialloc-Chelsea High School, where both brothers became prefects.&lt;ref name=fam/&gt; All of the children represented their high school for sport—Don and Ian in athletics, swimming, football and cricket; and Margaret in softball. The brothers played for Mentone Cricket Club in the Federal District Cricket Association, Ian as a [[left-arm unorthodox spin]]ner. He routinely dominated the opposition batsmen in the competition, taking 200 wickets at a [[bowling average]] of only 4.50 during his career with Mentone.&lt;ref name=&quot;fam&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=The Meckiffs of Mentone |first=Leo |last=Gamble |publisher=[[City of Kingston]] |url=http://localhistory.kingston.vic.gov.au/htm/article/184.htm |accessdate=2008-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began playing in Mentone's under-16 team at the age of 11.&lt;ref name=c589/&gt;

==Early career==

The red bars indicate the runs that he scored in an innings, with the blue line indicating the [[batting average]] in his last ten innings. The blue dots indicate an innings where he remained [[not out]].&lt;ref name=&quot;testlist&quot;/&gt; |alt=Meckiff started his career with two scores of 11 and then a 26. He then had six innings below 10 including four in a row of no more than two. He then scored his best tally of 45 not out, and made 14 not out two innings later, but after that he did not pass ten in his last eight innings.]]

Having failed as a spin bowler in a trial at Richmond in 1950, Meckiff switched to [[fast bowling]] in 1951–52 when he began his district career in [[Victorian Premier Cricket]] with South Melbourne.&lt;ref name=&quot;fam&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=c589/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;az&quot;&gt;Cashman, p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt; He started in the [[11_(number)#In_sports|Fourth XI]] after his brother had to withdraw from a match. The following summer, aged 17, Meckiff was in the senior team and played in South Melbourne's first championship-winning side in his debut season in the First XI,&lt;ref name=c589/&gt; although his club career was sometimes interrupted by [[conscription in Australia|national service]] in the [[Australian Army Reserve|reserves]]. After receiving requests from cricket administrators, the military authorities scheduled the leave of young players for weekends, so that the impact on their careers would be minimised.&lt;ref name=h27&gt;Haigh, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, Australia lacked bowlers of great pace, so a teammate advised Meckiff to bowl as fast as he could, without regard for accuracy—a plan he successfully adopted.&lt;ref name=h108&gt;Haigh, p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meckiff made his first-class debut for [[Victorian Bushrangers|Victoria]] in 1956–57 against [[Western Warriors|Western Australia]]. Coming in to bat with his state's score at 8 wickets for 77 (8/77), he made 19 [[not out]] to help them reach 131, before taking three wickets for 45 runs (3/45) to restrict Western Australia to a 34-run first innings lead.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; His first wicket was future Australian captain [[Bob Simpson (cricketer)|Bob Simpson]] for a [[duck (cricket)|duck]], and he followed up by removing Test batsmen [[Barry Shepherd]] and [[Ken Meuleman]].&lt;ref name=c589/&gt;&lt;ref name=ow/&gt; Meckiff made 11 in the second innings and took 0/40 as Victoria lost by four wickets.&lt;ref name=o&gt;{{Cite web| title=Player Oracle I Meckiff |url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/cgi-bin/player_oracle_reveals_results2.cgi?playernumber=1059&amp;opponentmatch=exact&amp;playername=Meckiff&amp;resulttype=All&amp;matchtype=All&amp;teammatch=exact&amp;startwicket=&amp;homeawaytype=All&amp;opponent=&amp;endwicket=&amp;wicketkeeper=&amp;searchtype=InningsList&amp;endscore=&amp;playermatch=contains&amp;branding=cricketarchive&amp;captain=&amp;endseason=&amp;startscore=&amp;team=&amp;startseason= |accessdate=2009-05-14 |publisher=[[CricketArchive]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meckiff's most prominent showing in his debut season was in the [[Sheffield Shield]] match against [[New South Wales Blues|New South Wales]] during the Christmas period of 1956.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; At the time, the two states were by far the strongest in Australia; in the past decade, the teams had 18 of the 20 top-two Shield placings between them, and New South Wales were in the process of winning nine consecutive titles.&lt;ref name=s&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/australia/content/story/260057.html|accessdate=2007-11-30|title=A history of the Sheffield Shield |publisher=[[Cricinfo]] |first=Martin |last=Williamson}}&lt;/ref&gt; The arch-rivals were at full strength as no international matches were held during the season.&lt;ref name=auslist/&gt;&lt;ref name=nsw/&gt;

Coming in at 7/173, Meckiff top-scored with 55—his only first-class 50—as Victoria batted first and made a late recovery to end with 244.&lt;ref name=nsw&gt;{{Cite web| title=Victoria v New South Wales|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/22/22283.html |accessdate=2009-05-14 |publisher=[[CricketArchive]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=p114&gt;Pollard, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; Meckiff took 3/65, including the wickets of Test players [[Bill Watson (cricketer)|Bill Watson]] and [[Richie Benaud]] as New South Wales responded with 281.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;&lt;ref name=ow/&gt; In the Victorian second innings Meckiff managed only 8 as Victoria left their opponents a target of 161 runs for victory. The paceman took 4/56 and claimed the final wicket, removing Test opener [[Jim Burke (cricketer)|Jim Burke]] [[caught behind|caught]] for 8 as New South Wales mustered 160,&lt;ref name=ow&gt;{{Cite web| title=Player Oracle I Meckiff List of Wickets|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/cgi-bin/player_oracle_reveals_results2.cgi?playernumber=1059&amp;testing=0&amp;opponentmatch=exact&amp;playername=IK%20Pathan&amp;resulttype=All&amp;matchtype=All&amp;teammatch=exact&amp;startwicket=&amp;homeawaytype=All&amp;opponent=&amp;endwicket=&amp;wicketkeeper=&amp;searchtype=WicketsTakenList&amp;endscore=&amp;playermatch=contains&amp;branding=cricketarchive&amp;captain=&amp;endseason=&amp;startscore=&amp;team=&amp;startseason= |accessdate=2009-05-14 |publisher=[[CricketArchive]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; causing the match to end in the first tie in Shield history.&lt;ref&gt;Coleman, p. 499.&lt;/ref&gt; Burke had returned to bat after being injured earlier in the innings, while New South Wales captain [[Ian Craig]], who had been ill, hauled himself out of bed in an attempt to salvage the match after his team had fallen to 7/70.&lt;ref name=nsw/&gt;&lt;ref name=p114/&gt; Meckiff's other victims in the final innings included Test players [[Alan Davidson (cricketer)|Alan Davidson]] and [[Johnny Martin]].&lt;ref name=ow/&gt;

Strong showings for Victoria earned Meckiff selection in [[Neil Harvey]]'s XI for the one-off match against [[Ray Lindwall]]'s XI at the start of January 1957. These annual fixtures were used as trials for the leading players vying for national selection.&lt;ref&gt;Pollard, pp. 113–114.&lt;/ref&gt; Lindwall's men batted first and made 428; Meckiff was the most successful bowler, taking 6/75 while his fellow-bowlers struggled to make inroads into the opposition batsmen. His first wicket was Test batsman [[Ken Mackay]] for 99, and he followed this by removing Bob Simpson, [[Norm O'Neill]] and [[Graeme Hole]] in the middle-order.&lt;ref name=ow/&gt;&lt;ref name=rnh&gt;{{Cite web| title=RN Harvey's XI v RR Lindwall's XI|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/22/22306.html |accessdate=2009-05-14 |publisher=[[CricketArchive]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meckiff followed his productive bowling with 47 runs in a [[Batting order (cricket)#Lower_order_or_tail|tail-wagging performance]], adding 71 for the eighth wicket with [[Wally Grout]] as Harvey's men responded with 419.&lt;ref name=rnh/&gt; The Victorian took 0/18 in the second innings as Lindwall's team fell for 188 to leave Harvey's XI with a victory target of 198, which was achieved with seven wickets in hand.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;

Meckiff had performed strongly in his debut first-class season, ending with 27 wickets at an average of 23.66. He was the ninth-highest wicket-taker for the Australian summer and his average was superior to all eight bowlers who took more wickets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://aus.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1950S/1956-57/AUS_LOCAL/STATS/FC_1956-57_BOWL_MOST_WKTS.html |title=Australian First-Class Season 1956/57: Bowling – Most Wickets |accessdate=2008-01-23 |publisher=[[Cricinfo]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; At season's end, he was rewarded with selection for Australia's non-Test tour of New Zealand in February and March 1957.&lt;ref name=&quot;az&quot;/&gt; The hosts had Test status at the time, but Australia refused to ratify games against their trans-Tasman neighbours as Test matches, citing the weakness of the New Zealand team.&lt;ref name=nz&gt;Pollard, pp. 115–116.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=h104&gt;Haigh, p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt;

The tour represented a changing of the guard in Australian cricket following the [[Australian cricket team in England in 1956|tour of England]] and the [[Indian subcontinent]] in 1956, with the bowling line-up heavily overhauled due to advancing age, injury and loss of form. Australia had lost three [[The Ashes|Ashes]] series in a row,&lt;ref name=auslist/&gt; and captain [[Ian Johnson (cricketer)|Ian Johnson]] and his deputy [[Keith Miller]] retired upon their return home.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Perry, p. 198.&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson was Australia's first-choice spinner while Miller and the 35-year-old [[Ray Lindwall]] had formed Australia's [[cricket ball|new ball]] pairing for the previous decade.&lt;ref&gt;Cashman, pp. 174–175.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the fast bowling [[all rounder]] [[Ron Archer]] suffered a long-term knee injury during the 1956 tour,&lt;ref&gt;Cashman, pp. 8&amp;ndash;12.&lt;/ref&gt; while paceman [[Pat Crawford]] played only one first-class match in 1956&amp;ndash;57 after his marriage broke down.&lt;ref&gt;Cashman, pp. 67&amp;ndash;71.&lt;/ref&gt; In the wake of Australia's decline in the past five years, the selectors turned to youth in an attempt to rebuild the side, resting several established Test representatives from the side.&lt;ref&gt;Pollard, pp. 110&amp;ndash;117.&lt;/ref&gt; Ian Craig was installed as the nation's youngest ever captain at the age of 22, having previously played only six Tests without securing a regular position in the team.&lt;ref&gt;Cashman, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

The New Zealand campaign was a chance for the younger players to establish themselves in the national team.&lt;ref name=nz/&gt;&lt;ref name=h104/&gt; Meckiff took 2/46 and 3/25 in his first-class debut for Australia, an innings win over [[Otago cricket team|Otago]].&lt;ref name=o/&gt; He played in the first match against [[New Zealand national cricket team|New Zealand]], but after taking 0/41 in a drawn encounter, he was dropped for the second game. The paceman forced his way back into the team for the third match after claiming 4/12 and 5/48 to help to set up an innings victory over [[Auckland cricket team|Auckland]].&lt;ref name=o/&gt;

In the final match, New Zealand batted first and Meckiff played a leading role in Australia's victory, taking 4/28 from 27.2 overs to help dismiss the hosts for 198. The fast bowler was not required to bat as the tourists replied with 8/350 [[declaration and forfeiture|declared]]. He took 2/17 in the second innings as the home team fell for 161 before Craig's men sealed the series with a 10-wicket win.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; Meckiff ended the tour with 20 first-class wickets at 10.85,&lt;ref name=o/&gt; placing him top of the tour bowling averages.&lt;ref name=pol117&gt;Pollard, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Test debut==
The following season, when the team for the 1957–58 South African tour was announced, Lindwall's name was omitted, despite his 212 Test wickets, second only to [[Clarrie Grimmett]] among Australian bowlers.&lt;ref name=pol117/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p240&quot;&gt;Perry, p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt; Meckiff was selected for the tour as part of Australia's generational change, after a single season in first-class cricket,&lt;ref name=&quot;az&quot;/&gt; and the squad departed for South Africa in October.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; On the tour, in five first-class matches ahead of the Tests he took 12 wickets, at 26.25.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;

Meckiff was one of four Australians to make their debuts in the First Test, which was played on a batsman-friendly surface in [[Johannesburg]] over the Christmas holiday period.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Haigh, p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=p121&gt;Pollard, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt;  Under some pressure due to Australia's decision to discard Lindwall and invest in new talent, he opened the bowling alongside [[Alan Davidson (cricketer)|Alan Davidson]], who up to that point had taken only 16 wickets at 34.06 in 12 Tests.&lt;ref&gt;Cashman, pp. 72–73.&lt;/ref&gt;  The match began badly for Australia's inexperienced attack as the South African openers [[Jackie McGlew]] and [[Trevor Goddard (cricketer)|Trevor Goddard]] put on an opening stand of 176. Meckiff claimed his maiden Test wicket, and Australia's first breakthrough, when he [[bowled]] Goddard for 90. He then removed McGlew for 108 and later dismissed [[Russell Endean]] and [[Roy McLean]] for 50 apiece. South Africa amassed 470, and Meckiff had the best figures, taking 5/125 in the hosts' first innings, all five being specialist batsmen. When the tourists batted, Meckiff came in at 8/313 and held up his end as [[century (cricket)|centurion]] [[Richie Benaud]] did the majority of the scoring in their 42-run partnership. The debutant ended with 11 in his first Test outing with the bat as Craig's team ended on 368. Meckiff took 3/52 in the South African second innings, including McGlew for the second time, as the match ended in a draw.&lt;ref name=&quot;testlist&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=1st Test:South Africa v Australia, Johannesburg Dec 23–28 1957|url=http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/62830.html| publisher=[[Cricinfo]] |accessdate=2007-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; This fine start to the Victorian's international career was halted in the Second Test at [[Cape Town]], where he broke down with injury early in the first innings and took no further part in an Australian innings victory. He did not take a wicket.&lt;ref name=&quot;testlist&quot;/&gt;

Meckiff missed the Third Test in [[Durban]] and spent a month on the sidelines, before returning against a combined team from [[Orange Free State cricket team|Orange Free State]] and [[Border cricket team|Border]] at the end of January. He took 6/29 in the first innings, his best return of the tour, and earned a recall for the final two Tests of the five-match series. He was not as effective as he was on debut, taking two and one wickets for the matches respectively, and scoring 26 runs in his only innings of the Fourth Test. Overall, the Victorian paceman had made a steady start to his international career, with 11 Test wickets at an average of 32.09, and 56 runs at 18.66.&lt;ref name=&quot;testlist&quot;/&gt; In the entire tour, he took 33 first-class wickets at 23.09.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; However, there was a hint of the controversy that was to end his career six years later. A year after the series, the South African Test umpire [[Bill Marais]] said he was prepared to [[no-ball]] Meckiff and his team-mate [[Jim Burke (cricketer)|Jim Burke]] for [[throwing (cricket)|throwing]].&lt;ref name=&quot;h119&quot;&gt;Haigh and Frith, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; There were reports that Craig had been tipped off about Marais’s intentions and therefore operated the two bowlers exclusively from the end at which Marais was not officiating.&lt;ref name=&quot;h119&quot;/&gt;

==Career peak and start of throwing controversy==
The Victorian paceman's international career peaked in 1958–59 during the English tour of Australia.&lt;ref name=w69/&gt; He started the season with a match for Victoria against the tourists, taking 4/69 and 1/16 in a losing effort.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; His wickets included English Test batsmen [[Peter Richardson (cricketer)|Peter Richardson]] (twice), [[Arthur Milton]] and [[Raman Subba Row]].&lt;ref name=ow/&gt;

The Test team was now under the leadership of Benaud—Craig had been forced to withdraw from cricket due to [[hepatitis]]; Meckiff retained his place in the side.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the Tests, English all-rounder [[Trevor Bailey]] privately described Meckiff as &quot;the worst bowler ever to represent Australia&quot;, and felt he posed little threat to the visitors.&lt;ref name=hs124&gt;Haigh, p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; However this proved to be questionable. The Benaud era started well for Australia and Meckiff, with a comfortable eight-wicket victory in the First Test in [[Brisbane]]. The paceman took 3/33 and 2/30,&lt;ref name=&quot;testlist&quot;/&gt; removing Milton, [[Colin Cowdrey]] and captain [[Peter May]] early on the first day to help Australia take the initiative after the tourists had batted first.&lt;ref name=ow/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Australia v England Marylebone Cricket Club in Australia 1958/59 (1st Test)
|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/23/23216.html |accessdate=2007-12-18|publisher=[[CricketArchive]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The match also marked the start of behind-the-scenes rumblings about the bowler's action.&lt;ref&gt;Pollard, pp. 128–129.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meckiff's career peaked at the Second Test, which began on New Year's Eve, 1958 at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]]. It was his first international fixture in front of his home crowd, and also marked the start of his career-long public problem with accusations of throwing. The match was dominated by the Victorian and his left-arm pace partner Davidson; the pair took 18 of the 20 English wickets to fall. England's first innings was headlined by Davidson's 6/64; Meckiff took 3/69, including the wicket of England captain May for 113 with a [[swing bowling|swinging ball]], which breached the batsman's defence and crashed into the stumps.&lt;ref name=pi189&gt;Piesse, p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt; This ended a century partnership with Cowdrey, and triggered a collapse that saw England be dismissed for 259, the last six English wickets falling for 49 runs.

He followed this by removing the English skipper for a second time to leave England at 7/71. This set up a comfortable Australian victory as they reached their target of 39 with the loss of two wickets.&lt;ref name=&quot;score&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=2nd Test:Australia v England at Melbourne, Dec 31 1958 – Jan 5 1959|url=http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/62851.html |accessdate=2007-12-18|publisher=[[Cricinfo]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Australian pace duo were aided by a series of difficult, diving catches.&lt;ref&gt;Pollard, p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt; The pair combined forces when Davidson caught May, and then Graveney, in the [[List of cricket terms#L|leg trap behind square]] from the bowling of his fellow left-armer, who called the reflex catches  &quot;absolutely unbelievable&quot;.&lt;ref name=pi189/&gt; Meckiff described the hometown atmosphere as &quot;electrifying&quot;, and attributed his performance to the crowd support.&lt;ref name=pi189/&gt;

The match ended on the eve of Meckiff's 24th birthday, but Australian celebrations were marred by English journalists, who levelled accusations of throwing against him and some of his colleagues. The evening edition of the Melbourne ''Herald'' carried a column by former English spinner [[Johnny Wardle]], accusing Meckiff of &quot;throwing England out&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;w70&quot;&gt;Whimpress, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pi190/&gt; Wardle's piece was written confrontationally, as a series of sentences starting with &quot;I accuse&quot;.&lt;ref name=hs125/&gt; This was followed by more anti-Meckiff comments in the English press, including one that dubbed the bowler &quot;the greatest ogre of international cricket since [[Harold Larwood|Larwood]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;az&quot;/&gt; ''[[The Evening News (newspaper)|The Evening News]]'' proclaimed: &quot;Meckiff's throwing was devastating&quot; and ''[[The Star (London)|The Star]]'' said: &quot;at least two of his wickets were obtained by deliveries which looked to be thrown&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;w70&quot;/&gt; Former England spinner [[Ian Peebles]] asserted that Meckiff and [[Gordon Rorke]] threw &quot;the greater number of balls they deliver&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;h120&quot;&gt;Haigh and Frith, p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; while former English [[pace bowling|paceman]] [[Alf Gover]] claimed that none of the left-armer's deliveries were legal;&lt;ref name=&quot;w70&quot;/&gt; it was &quot;ridiculous that a player of his action should be the agent of England's destruction&quot;.&lt;ref name=p181&gt;Pollard, p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Australian writer [[Jack Pollard]], such headlines relegated the [[Cold War]], which usually occupied the front pages, to the interior of the English newspapers.&lt;ref name=p181/&gt;

By contrast to the strident condemnation of Meckiff in the English press, Australian opinion was mixed. The former Test opener and leading commentator [[Jack Fingleton]] said: &quot;when he [Meckiff] delivered to Bailey, his fastest ball looked most suspect&quot; and that the left-armer should have been [[List of cricket terms#C|called for throwing]].&lt;ref name=&quot;h119&quot;/&gt; Fingleton claimed to know of five former Australian Test cricketers who felt that Meckiff threw, but only named the 1930s paceman [[Ernie McCormick]].&lt;ref name=&quot;h119&quot;/&gt; Former Australian player [[Tommy Andrews (cricketer)|Tommy Andrews]] claimed: &quot;if they stop throwing in Australia, cricket will die&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;quote&quot;/&gt; Former Australian captain [[Ian Johnson (cricketer)|Ian Johnson]] argued that if Meckiff were to be cited for an illegal action for jerking his wrist, then leading English bowlers such as Trueman, [[Brian Statham]] and [[Tony Lock]], who played against Australia during the season, should also be sanctioned.&lt;ref name=p134&gt;Pollard, p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;w72&quot;&gt;Whimpress, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; As with Meckiff, Lock was under scrutiny at the time and later tried to change his bowling action but the new style coincided with a downturn in results.&lt;ref name=w80/&gt; Johnson also noted that any successful spinner would be called for throwing if the law were enforced strictly because of their flicking of the wrist and fingers during the delivery of the ball, as they could not otherwise extract spin.&lt;ref name=p134/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p73&quot;&gt;Whimpress, p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, Robert Coleman, the historian of the [[Victorian Cricket Association]], decried the anti-Meckiff campaign as &quot;[[Fleet Street]] bleating&quot;,&lt;ref name=c588&gt;Coleman, p. 588.&lt;/ref&gt; and said: &quot;there have been no more hysterical outbursts on the subject [of throwing] than occurred during England's 1958–59 tour&quot;.&lt;ref name=pi190&gt;Piesse, p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=c588/&gt; Writing decades after the event, Pollard said &quot;Meckiff, in fact, went to the crease with a beautifully relaxed approach, paused momentarily with his arm absolutely straight, and then let the ball go with a blurred swing of the arm that was impossible to follow from 60 yards away, even with the aid of good binoculars.&quot;&lt;ref name=c589/&gt;

Journalists who wrote books about the 1958–59 season made thinly veiled references to the controversy in the names of their work. Fingleton’s account on the series was entitled ''Four [[throwing (cricket)|Chukkas]] to Australia'', while E. N. Wellings labelled his tome ''The Ashes Thrown Away'',&lt;ref name=&quot;h118&quot;/&gt; and accused Meckiff, along with Burke, Rorke and [[Keith Slater]] of throwing for Australia in the Tests.&lt;ref name=&quot;h118&quot;&gt;Haigh and Frith, p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; An Australian television debate program featured an entire session where English journalists Wellings and [[Crawford White]] discussed the throwing issue with former Australian Test cricketers [[Keith Miller]] and [[Sid Barnes]].&lt;ref name=&quot;h119&quot;/&gt;

In the Third Test at the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]] Meckiff took one wicket—Bailey—in the first innings, before breaking down with an injury in the second.&lt;ref name=&quot;testlist&quot;/&gt; This ruled him out of the Fourth Test,&lt;ref&gt;Perry, p. 243.&lt;/ref&gt; and he missed a month of cricket before returning for the final Test in Melbourne in mid February,&lt;ref name=o/&gt; where he removed specialist batsmen May and [[Ted Dexter]]. On the field it had been a successful series for the Victorian; he had taken 17 wickets at 17.17, as Australia claimed the series 4–0.&lt;ref name=&quot;testlist&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=auslist/&gt; These efforts placed him top of the Test bowling averages for the series.&lt;ref name=p134/&gt;&lt;ref name=c588/&gt; When Lindwall was recalled for the Fourth Test in place of the injured Meckiff he was reported to have said &quot;I'm the last of the straight-arm bowlers&quot;.&lt;ref name=quote/&gt;  The veteran paceman played alongside Meckiff in later matches,&lt;ref name=quote/&gt; including the Fifth Test.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Australia v England Marylebone Cricket Club in Australia 1958/59 (5th Test)
|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/23/23342.html |accessdate=2007-12-18|publisher=[[CricketArchive]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meckiff was also prominent in the two Shield matches against New South Wales, when both teams were at full strength. In the first contest he had match figures of 5/129, his victims including Test teammates Burke, O'Neill and Davidson (twice),&lt;ref name=ow/&gt; but his efforts were unable to prevent defeat.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; In the return fixture, Meckiff took a total of 7/162; five of his victims were Australian Test batsmen.&lt;ref name=ow/&gt; Victoria held the upper hand, and were 45 runs short of victory in the second innings when time ran out.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;

Within the wider cricket community there was a steady crescendo of comment condemning the prevalence of bowlers with suspect actions. Prior to the alteration of the bowling law by the [[Imperial Cricket Conference]] in 1960, the law stated:&lt;ref name=&quot;w71&quot;&gt;Whimpress, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|For a delivery to be fair, the ball must be bowled, not thrown or jerked; if either umpire be not entirely satisfied of the absolute fairness of a delivery in this respect, he shall call and signal no-ball instantly upon delivery.&lt;ref name=&quot;w71&quot;/&gt;}}

===Reaction by players and officials===
In contrast to the heated debate in the media, players and administrators refrained from publicly questioning or condemning Meckiff. Neither the England captain May nor manager [[Freddie Brown (cricketer)|Freddie Brown]] raised any concerns about Meckiff's action after the Test.&lt;ref name=&quot;w74&quot;/&gt; However, it was later revealed that Brown had wanted to lodge an official complaint with the [[Cricket Australia|Australian Board of Control]], but May had refused, fearing accusations of sour grapes.&lt;ref name=&quot;h118&quot;/&gt; Years later, Richardson and some of his fellow batsmen accused the Australian fast bowler of throwing them out, while England paceman [[Fred Trueman]] said: &quot;Meckiff's action was totally illegal and that he should never have been allowed to play&quot;.&lt;ref name=pi189/&gt; Richardson's [[off spin]]ning team-mate [[Jim Laker]] likened Meckiff's and Burke's arm actions to those of dart-throwers.&lt;ref name=quote/&gt;

Benaud said he was &quot;completely satisfied that [Meckiff's] delivery was fair and legitimate&quot;,&lt;ref name=hs125/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;w74&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=p182&gt;Pollard, p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt; while the selection panel of [[Don Bradman]], [[Dudley Seddon]] and [[Jack Ryder (cricketer)|Jack Ryder]] continued to pick the paceman, implying that they regarded his action as legal.&lt;ref name=&quot;w74&quot;&gt;Whimpress, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bill Dowling]], the chairman of the Australian Board of Control, denounced the media attention on suspect bowling actions as excessive and &quot;magnified out of all proportion&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;h119&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=hs125&gt;Haigh, p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt;

Off the field, the throwing controversy was beginning to affect Meckiff adversely. In his 1961 autobiography, prophetically titled ''Thrown Out'',&lt;ref name=c591&gt;Coleman, p. 591.&lt;/ref&gt; he said the accusations took a deep personal toll on him and his family, and prompted him to shun the public. He became known by the derisive nickname &quot;[[throwing (cricket)|Chucker]]&quot; and was credited on the front cover of his autobiography as &quot;Ian 'Chucker' Meckiff&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;w70&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=c591/&gt; Meckiff reported that from the Melbourne Test onwards, his son was verbally abused by classmates; Meckiff's parents were persistently told their son bowled illegally.&lt;ref name=p182/&gt; He added that doctors believed his anxiety was contributing to stomach ailments.&lt;ref name=p182/&gt; At the time, players were not allowed to talk to the media during the season, and Meckiff was upset because he could not rebut his accusers while they were free to attack him.&lt;ref name=p182/&gt; He denied ever throwing, but admitted he may have been open to suspicion after bowling 15 to 20 overs in a day's play, as his body would begin to fall away in the delivery stride due to fatigue. He had a permanently bent bowling arm; he generated his pace from his wrist action, and asserted that his thin wrists gave the impression that his whole arm was bending.&lt;ref name=pi190/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;w71&quot;/&gt;

==Subcontinent tour==
In 1959–60, the season started with a Test trial between the XIs of Lindwall and Benaud. Meckiff claimed a match total of 4/90 for Lindwall's men and was selected for the Test tour of [[Pakistan]] and [[India]].&lt;ref name=testlist/&gt;&lt;ref name=o/&gt; Before the team departed, Meckiff demonstrated his new bowling action, which used a rigid left arm during the run-up,&lt;ref name=h181&gt;Haigh, p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt; before swinging the arm over during the delivery stride.&lt;ref name=&quot;w80&quot;&gt;Whimpress, p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next two years, sceptics and sporting opponents mostly regarded his action as fair, and said so in public.&lt;ref name=h181/&gt; He was not called for throwing in either India or Pakistan, meaning that he had played in five nations without being sanctioned.&lt;ref name=&quot;w74&quot;/&gt;

Meckiff was wicketless in Australia's win in the First Test against [[Pakistan national cricket team|Pakistan]] on a [[cricket pitch|matting wicket]] in [[Dhaka|Dacca]] (now in [[Bangladesh]]). In the first innings of the Second Test in [[Lahore]],&lt;ref name=&quot;testlist&quot;/&gt; he took three wickets, including that of opposition captain [[Hanif Mohammad]];&lt;ref name=ow/&gt; the match was Australia's last Test win on Pakistani soil for 39 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;auslist&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://stats.cricinfo.com/guru?sdb=team;team=AUS;class=testteam;filter=basic;opposition=0;notopposition=0;decade=0;homeaway=0;continent=0;country=0;notcountry=0;groundid=0;season=0;startdefault=1877-03-15;start=1877-03-15;enddefault=2007-11-20;end=2007-11-20;tourneyid=0;finals=0;daynight=0;toss=0;scheduledovers=0;scheduleddays=0;innings=0;followon=0;result=0;seriesresult=0;captainid=0;recent=;viewtype=resultlist;runslow=;runshigh=;wicketslow=;wicketshigh=;ballslow=;ballshigh=;overslow=;overshigh=;bpo=0;batevent=;conclow=;conchigh=;takenlow=;takenhigh=;ballsbowledlow=;ballsbowledhigh=;oversbowledlow=;oversbowledhigh=;bpobowled=0;bowlevent=;submit=1;.cgifields=viewtype |title=Statsguru – Australia – Tests – Results list |publisher=[[Cricinfo]] |accessdate=2007-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the Third Test, he helped the tourists beat the President's XI in a low-scoring game in which none of the four innings totalled over 140. Meckiff claimed four wickets in the match, and was batting (he scored two not out) when Australia reached their victory target with three wickets in hand.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; He  missed the drawn Third Test in [[Karachi]].&lt;ref name=testlist/&gt;

In the next leg of the tour, Meckiff returned to the Australian side for the First Test against [[India national cricket team|India]] in [[Delhi]]. After claiming 1/52 in the first innings, he compiled his Test best score of 45 not out. He came in to bat with his team's score at 8/402 and helped [[Lindsay Kline]] and Rorke push Australia's score to 468,  a first innings lead of 333.&lt;ref name=testlist/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=1st Test:India vs Australia at Delhi, Dec 12–16, 1959|url=http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/62868.html |publisher=[[Cricinfo]]|accessdate=2007-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meckiff was unable to capture a wicket in the Indian second innings as Benaud's men won by an innings and 117 runs.&lt;ref name=&quot;testlist&quot;/&gt; He bowled with little success in the Second Test in [[Kanpur]], taking 1/52 in a spin-dominated match in which [[Jasu Patel]] claimed 14 wickets to bowl India to their first-ever Test win over Australia.&lt;ref name=testlist/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=A history of Australia in India over the years |first=Siddhartha |last=Vaidyanathan |url=http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/142176.html |publisher=[[Cricinfo]]|accessdate=2007-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meckiff was unbeaten on 14 when India secured the final wicket.&lt;ref name=&quot;testlist&quot;/&gt; In his first two Tests on Indian soil, Meckiff’s only victim had been [[Chandu Borde]], whom he dismissed twice.&lt;ref name=ow/&gt;

Meckiff's most successful Test during the Indian tour was the drawn third match at [[Brabourne Stadium]] in [[Mumbai|Bombay]], where he captured 4/79 and 3/67. In the Indian first innings, after removing opener [[Nari Contractor]] for 108, Meckiff captured four of the next five wickets as India collapsed from 3/199 to 8/246&amp;mdash;they were eventually all out for 289.&lt;ref name=5i/&gt; In the second innings he secured three quick wickets as the hosts slumped from 0/99 to 4/116 before a recovery which  prevented their defeat.&lt;ref name=5i&gt;{{Cite web|title=India v Australia Australia in India 1959/60 (3rd Test) | url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/23/23887.html |accessdate=2007-12-18|publisher=[[CricketArchive]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meckiff continued to hold the upper hand over Borde, dismissing him in both innings.&lt;ref name=ow/&gt; The Victorian bowler had little success in the final two Tests, taking only three wickets as Australia won the series 2–1.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;&lt;ref name=auslist/&gt;  He ended the subcontinental tour with 15 wickets at 35.73, and scored 70 runs at 23.33.&lt;ref name=&quot;testlist&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://stats.cricinfo.com/guru?sdb=player;playerid=1059;class=testplayer;filter=basic;team=0;opposition=0;notopposition=0;season=0;homeaway=0;continent=0;country=0;notcountry=0;groundid=0;startdefault=1957-12-23;start=1957-12-23;enddefault=1963-12-11;end=1963-12-11;tourneyid=0;finals=0;daynight=0;toss=0;scheduledovers=0;scheduleddays=0;innings=0;result=0;followon=0;seriesresult=0;captain=0;keeper=0;dnp=0;recent=;viewtype=aro_list;runslow=;runshigh=;batposition=0;dismissal=0;bowposition=0;ballslow=;ballshigh=;bpof=0;overslow=;overshigh=;conclow=;conchigh=;wicketslow=;wicketshigh=;dismissalslow=;dismissalshigh=;caughtlow=;caughthigh=;caughttype=0;stumpedlow=;stumpedhigh=;csearch=;submit=1;.cgifields=viewtype| title=Statsguru – I Meckiff – Tests – Innings by innings list| accessdate=2007-12-18| publisher=[[Cricinfo]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had particular success against Borde, dismissing him five times in as many Tests.&lt;ref name=ow/&gt; Meckiff returned to Australia in time to play his solitary Sheffield Shield match for the 1959–60 season, taking the only ten-wicket match haul of his career. He took 5/41 and 5/84 to set up an easy win over Western Australia. His first innings effort helped dismiss Western Australia for 141, and Victoria replied with 431 to move into a match-winning position.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; He also helped South Melbourne to another district title, taking 9/51&amp;mdash;including a [[hat-trick]]&amp;mdash;in the last match of the regular season against [[Fitzroy Cricket Club|Fitzroy]]. This victory allowed South Melbourne to climb from seventh to fourth in the table and become the last qualifier for the semi-finals. They subsequently won their semi-final and the grand final to secure the title.&lt;ref&gt;Coleman, p. 497.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alterations to the throwing law==
In 1960, at a meeting of the Imperial Cricket Conference in London, cricket's &quot;throwing law&quot; was changed to forbid the straightening of the arm at the instant of the ball's delivery.&lt;ref name=&quot;chuck law&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=p143/&gt; The Australian Board of Control were so concerned about the controversy and its possible impact on the Australian game that they sent Board chairman Dowling and Board member Sir Donald Bradman to the meeting, rather than the customary Britain-based representative.&lt;ref name=p143/&gt;&lt;ref name=c590&gt;Coleman, p. 590.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the agreed change in the law, because of conflicting interpretations in different countries a compromise was agreed, which specified an amnesty during the forthcoming 1961 Australian tour to England. It was agreed that on the tour, umpires would privately report any concerns about bowling actions to the teams concerned, for them to remedy. After the tour, umpires would &quot;call&quot; bowlers whenever they felt the new law to have been breached.&lt;ref name=&quot;chuck law&quot;&gt;Whimpress, pp. 73–75.&lt;/ref&gt;

On his return to Australia Dowling angrily accused the English cricket community of pre-judging Meckiff.&lt;ref name=c590/&gt; Dowling said the strident press attacks on Meckiff had amounted to intimidation of umpires through the media,&lt;ref name=p143&gt;Pollard, p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt; and claimed that some administrators had privately told him that the Australian paceman would be called if he toured England.&lt;ref name=c590/&gt; The president of the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]], Sir [[Hubert Ashton]], said he hoped Australia would not choose Meckiff for their 1961 tour.&lt;ref name=w79/&gt;

==Tied Test against the West Indies, 1960–61==
The Victorian was not called during the 1960–61 Australian season, but his performances were ineffective and he was repeatedly hampered by injuries.&lt;ref name=w79/&gt; In particular, a strained [[achilles tendon]] restricted his speed and penetration, particularly in the lead-up to the opening Test.&lt;ref name=c590/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Haigh, p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt; Meckiff played in the First and the Third Tests, taking two wickets at 117.00 and scoring 12 runs at 6.00;&lt;ref name=&quot;testlist&quot;/&gt; he was unable to complete either match, sustaining injuries during the second innings of both fixtures.&lt;ref name=&quot;w79&quot;&gt;Whimpress, p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; These fitness problems resulted in his omission for the three other Tests. During the summer, Meckiff's bowling was passed by [[Col Egar]], who later ended his career. He noted that the umpire had told him there was little point in changing his action.&lt;ref name=&quot;w74&quot;/&gt;

Meckiff took match figures of 4/90 as Victoria started the season with a nine-wicket win over South Australia, but he managed only 2/122 as his state lost by an innings to the touring [[West Indies cricket team|West Indies]] in the next fixture.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; The paceman removed [[Rohan Kanhai]], who made 252 of the visitors' 493, and captain [[Frank Worrell]], who contributed 82.&lt;ref name=ow/&gt; During the heavy defeat, Meckiff equal top-scored with 24 not out in the first innings,&lt;ref name=c593/&gt; as the hosts struggled against the mysterious spin of [[Sonny Ramadhin]].&lt;ref&gt;Pollard, p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his unpenetrative performance with the ball, the paceman was retained for the First Test in Brisbane. The Caribbean team batted first and attacked Meckiff, taking more than [[run rate|seven runs per over]] from his bowling. The paceman ended with 1/129 from 18 overs as the visitors amassed 453;&lt;ref&gt;Pollard, p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt; his only wicket was that of [[Gary Sobers]] for 132.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;&lt;ref name=ow/&gt; The West Indian batsman had been particularly severe on Meckiff and was ironically dismissed by &quot;the day's worst ball&quot;—&lt;ref name=h142&gt;Haigh, p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt; a leg side [[full toss]] that he hit to [[fielding (cricket)|mid-on]].&lt;ref name=h142/&gt; In the second innings, Meckiff broke down after only four overs, but came out to bat on 14 December, late in Australia’s climactic run-chase,&lt;ref name=o/&gt;&lt;ref name=w79/&gt; for which he was often remembered. At the end of a dramatic final day, Australia needed seven runs from the final over for victory, and they had three wickets in hand. The home side had seemed destined for a win after Davidson and Benaud had fought back with a century stand for the seventh wicket in the final session. Both were well set and had passed 50, but the tourists halted Australia's momentum by [[run out|running out]] Davidson with a direct hit from the last ball of the previous over.&lt;ref name=f&gt;Fiddian, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=p149/&gt; Benaud was caught behind on the second ball of the final over attempting a [[List of cricket terms#H|hook]] and Meckiff came to the crease to join [[Wally Grout]].&lt;ref name=f/&gt; Five runs were needed from six balls with two wickets in hand.&lt;ref name=c593/&gt;&lt;ref name=p149/&gt;

The injured paceman blocked the first ball he faced—the third of the over—and ran a [[bye (cricket)|bye]] after missing the next. The West Indian wicket-keeper tried to run Meckiff out, but missed the stumps at the [[List of cricket terms#S|non-striker's end]] with the batsman many metres out of his ground.&lt;ref name=h146&gt;Haigh, p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt; Grout top-edged the following ball straight up into the air, but the two fielders who converged beneath it collided and dropped the catch, allowing the Australians to take another run. The hosts thus needed three runs from the last three balls. Meckiff faced the sixth ball; it was a [[half volley]] and he lofted it over [[fielding (cricket)|square leg]].&lt;ref name=c593/&gt;&lt;ref name=h146/&gt; The ball looked as though it would reach the boundary for a match-winning four runs; however, after landing close to the fence, it stopped rolling a metre short on the slow outfield.&lt;ref name=h147&gt;Haigh, p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt; Grout attempted a third run, which would have won the match, but an accurate long throw saw him run out.&lt;ref name=c593/&gt; The last man [[Lindsay Kline]] came in for the final two balls, with scores level, and the Australian pair agreed to run under all circumstances. Meckiff [[List of cricket terms#B|backed up]] significantly in anticipation of a quick single, and set off for the winning run after his partner hit the ball to square leg.&lt;ref name=c593/&gt; However, he was [[run out]] by roughly a metre when [[Joe Solomon]] directly hit the stumps from side on, causing the first tie in Test history.&lt;ref name=&quot;testlist&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;az&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=p149/&gt;&lt;ref name=c594&gt;Coleman, p. 594.&lt;/ref&gt; Umpire [[Col Hoy]] said of his decision to give Meckiff out: &quot;God, it was easy. He was miles out.&quot;&lt;ref name=h147/&gt; The entire stadium—players and spectators alike—invaded the ground in excitement, but nobody was sure of the exact scores. It was only later that they realised the match was the first Tied Test;&lt;ref name=c594/&gt; Meckiff initially thought Australia had lost and blamed himself for the result.&lt;ref name=p149&gt;Pollard, p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Haigh, p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt;

After missing the Australian victory in the Second Test due to injury, Meckiff returned for the Third Test and he was again attacked, taking 1/74 from 13 overs in the first innings,&lt;ref name=o/&gt; his sole victim being [[Conrad Hunte]].&lt;ref name=ow/&gt; He then broke down after five overs in the second innings. Davidson also left the field with injury and the tourists took advantage; they attacked the remaining bowlers, levelling the series 1–1.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;&lt;ref name=auslist/&gt;&lt;ref name=w79/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pollard, p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt; The Victorian did not recover in time for the rest of the Tests.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;

Persistently hampered by ankle and back injuries, Meckiff aggregated only 19 first-class wickets at 40 for the summer.&lt;ref name=w80/&gt; His best innings performance was 4/39 against Queensland and he was unable to claim more than five wickets in any single match.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; In one match against arch-rivals New South Wales, the Victorian took a total of 5/155, all of his wickets being Test batsmen.&lt;ref name=ow/&gt; Meckiff was not selected for the Ashes tour. His lack of form saved the Australian selectors the difficult choice of whether to omit him because of his action and avoid a potential run-in with umpires in England.&lt;ref name=w80/&gt; Critics claimed that his new bowling action adopted in 1959&amp;ndash;60 had made him legitimate but reduced his pace and effectiveness.&lt;ref name=w80/&gt;

==No-balled in the Sheffield Shield, 1962–63==
The throwing controversy subsided during the 1961 English season,&lt;ref name=w80/&gt; and the 1961–62 Australian season was purely domestic, with no touring international teams.&lt;ref name=auslist/&gt;&lt;ref name=w80/&gt; As a result, there were no pressing diplomacy imperatives involving throwing. Meckiff was Victoria's leading bowler with 28 wickets at 27.14 in eight matches and was not called.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;&lt;ref name=w80/&gt; His best performance was 5/53 in the first innings of the match against Queensland at the MCG, which ended in defeat for the home team.&lt;ref name=&quot;w80&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title=Victoria v Queensland  Sheffield Shield 1961/62 |url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/25/25250.html |publisher=[[CricketArchive]] |accessdate=2008-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite healthy results for the season overall, the paceman struggled and took match figures of 2/136 and 3/112 as Victoria lost both their matches against the dominant New South Wales XI, who won their ninth successive Shield.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;&lt;ref name=s/&gt; At the end of the season, Meckiff was part of an International XI that toured New Zealand and played against the hosts' national team and against teams from India and Pakistan. He had little success, taking four wickets at 53.00 in three matches.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;

In 1962–63, Meckiff was again under the spotlight when [[Ted Dexter]]'s Englishmen toured Australia. He topped the bowling averages for the Australian first-class season with 58 wickets at 19.86 from ten matches,&lt;ref name=o/&gt;&lt;ref name=w80/&gt; as Victoria won the Sheffield Shield, ending New South Wales' run of titles.&lt;ref name=w80/&gt;&lt;ref name=c591/&gt; Meckiff and [[Alan Connolly]] formed an effective pace pairing, helping Victoria to win four of its eight Shield games, and take first innings points in two others.&lt;ref&gt;Coleman, p. 599.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=p179&gt;Pollard, p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meckiff was hoping to regain his Test place, and started his 1962&amp;ndash;63 campaign in a Sheffield Shield match against South Australia. After Victoria made 174, the paceman took 4/65 to dismiss South Australia for 141 in the first innings. In the second innings he took 3/76 to help seal a win.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; He continued his early season form in taking match figures of 7/179 against Western Australia, but was unable to prevent defeat.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;&lt;ref name=c591/&gt; Despite these performances, Meckiff was overlooked for the First Test. He had another chance to vie for national selection when Victoria played England after the opening Test, and took match figures of 4/90 as the tourists completed a five-wicket victory.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; He dismissed [[Ray Illingworth]], [[Geoff Pullar]] and [[Alan Smith (cricketer)|Alan Smith]] as Victoria took a four-run first innings lead, but the hosts collapsed in their second innings and Dexter's men reached their target of 180 with five wickets in hand.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;&lt;ref name=ow/&gt;

Victoria then played the first of their two matches for the season against their arch-rivals New South Wales, just before the Second Test. Meckiff took 3/33, removing [[Grahame Thomas]], Benaud and Martin as Victoria dismissed the reigning champions for 132.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;&lt;ref name=ow/&gt; He contributed 32 runs at the end of the Victorian first innings reply, helping to extend his team's first-innings lead to 135 runs. In the New South Wales second innings Meckiff  took 3/73, removing Test players Simpson, Davidson and Benaud, to leave his team with a target of 95 runs to win, which they reached with eight wickets in hand.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;

Despite this effort, he was not selected for the Second Test.&lt;ref name=&quot;w80&quot;/&gt; His season was then marred when he was called for throwing for the first time in any competition.&lt;ref name=c591/&gt; In January 1963, Victoria played South Australia at the [[Adelaide Oval]]. After Victoria had made 218, Meckiff removed both openers—[[Les Favell]] and [[K. G. Cunningham|Ken Cunningham]]&lt;ref name=ow/&gt;—for the cost of 19 runs before [[Jack Kierse]] no-balled the fourth ball of his fourth over.&lt;ref name=w81/&gt; He continued to bowl;  his remaining deliveries were deemed legal by the umpires, and he ended with 5/84 in South Australia's reply of 8/408 declared. The hosts had a target of only 108 in the second innings for victory, but Meckiff removed Favell, Cunningham and [[Neil Dansie]] with the new ball to destabilise the run-chase.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;&lt;ref name=ow/&gt; He ended with 3/25 as the South Australians stumbled to 7/86 and held on for a draw.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;w81&quot;&gt;Whimpress, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meckiff took a total of 3/50 in a seven-wicket defeat of Western Australia before the return match against New South Wales, in which Victoria were 34 runs short of victory with seven wickets in hand when time ran out, Meckiff's match figures being 6/121.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; He had a final chance to push for Test selection in the second of his state's two matches against England. The tourists batted first and made 375; Meckiff took 5/93, dismissing Pullar, [[Peter Parfitt]], [[Fred Titmus]], [[David Allen (cricketer)|David Allen]] and top-scorer [[Tom Graveney]], who had made 185. He  took 2/47 in the English second innings, removing [[Barry Knight (cricketer)|Barry Knight]] and [[Ken Barrington]]. England set Victoria 287 for victory, and the hosts faced defeat before Meckiff batted late in the order to score 38 and help his side to a draw with one wicket in hand.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;&lt;ref name=ow/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title=Victoria v Marylebone Cricket Club Marylebone Cricket Club in Australia 1962/63 |url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/25/25950.html |publisher=[[CricketArchive]] |accessdate=2008-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this continued run of prolific wicket-taking and his success against England, Meckiff was overlooked for the Fifth Test.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; In his absence, Australia struggled to make inroads into the English batting, and the series ended 1–1.&lt;ref name=auslist/&gt;

Victoria's season ended with consecutive matches against Queensland. In the first, Meckiff took a total of 5/88 as his side completed an innings victory at home. In the final match in Brisbane, his [[slower ball]] was no-balled in his fifth over of the second innings by umpire [[Bill Priem]].&lt;ref name=c591/&gt; Meckiff bowled 14 further overs without incident and ended the innings with 4/74.&lt;ref name=&quot;w82&quot;&gt;Whimpress, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title=Queensland v Victoria  Sheffield Shield 1962/63 |url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/25/25969.html |publisher=[[CricketArchive]] |accessdate=2008-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Victoria drew the match and sealed their Sheffield Shield victory. Meckiff had been the state's leading wicket-taker and one of the key figures in their triumph,&lt;ref name=w80/&gt; but his bowling action was the main talking point at the end of the match.&lt;ref name=p179/&gt;

==Test no-ball==
Meckiff's performances as the leading wicket-taker during the 1962–63 season meant that he could not be justifiably denied national selection on grounds of productivity,&lt;ref name=w80/&gt; so the matter of his legitimacy had to be resolved. Meanwhile, the retirement of pace spearhead Davidson left a vacancy in the Australian team ahead of the 1963–64 home Test series against South Africa.&lt;ref name=&quot;w82&quot;/&gt; In the opening Shield matches of the season in Melbourne, Meckiff took match figures of 5/102 and 6/107 against South and [[Western Warriors|Western Australia]] respectively.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; His wickets included Test batsmen [[Les Favell]], [[Garry Sobers]], [[Keith Slater]] and [[Barry Shepherd]].&lt;ref name=ow/&gt; In the latter match he took the first five wickets in the innings to reduce Western Australia to 5/54.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Victoria v Western Australia  Sheffield Shield 1963/64 |url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/26/26482.html |publisher=[[CricketArchive]] |accessdate=2008-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his contributions, Victoria were unable to secure victories against either of their opponents.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; However, as a result of these strong personal performances, Meckiff was selected for the First Test in Brisbane.&lt;ref name=&quot;w83&quot;&gt;Whimpress, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the start of the season, the Australian Board of Control had issued a directive calling on the umpires to &quot;get tough&quot; in enforcing the laws of cricket, and asked the state associations to &quot;back the umpires to the fullest extent&quot;.&lt;ref name=p182/&gt;&lt;ref name=w83/&gt; In the lead-up to the Test, Meckiff was the centre of media attention, and one report described him as cricket's &quot;bogey man&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;w83&quot;/&gt; The South Africans were reportedly stunned by Meckiff's selection, giving the impression that they considered him an illegitimate bowler.&lt;ref name=&quot;g20&quot;&gt;Gibbs, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Reaction in England was also hostile, ahead of Australia's forthcoming tour in the English summer of 1964. Colin Ingleby-Mackenzie wrote in the ''[[News of the World]]'': &quot;there is no room in cricket for throwers. Let us hope that...the Australian selectors realise this...otherwise the throwing war will be waged in earnest&quot;.&lt;ref name=h183&gt;Haigh, p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Brisbane Test was dubbed &quot;Meckiff's Test&quot; by the Australian media; speculation abounded that the bowler was being chosen so he could be no-balled as a public relations effort to promote Australia's anti-throwing credentials.&lt;ref name=&quot;g20&quot;/&gt; Keith Miller described the left-armer's selection as having &quot;peppered this once drab-looking series into a curry hot-pot, with all the excitement and trimmings of an [[Alfred Hitchcock]] thriller&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;w83&quot;/&gt; Miller further predicted that the umpires Egar and [[Lou Rowan]] would be having sleepless nights and predicted that the selectors would be biting their fingernails, adding that he hoped Meckiff was not being used as a scapegoat for the anti-throwing movement.&lt;ref name=&quot;w83&quot;/&gt; Former Test [[leg spin]]ner [[Bill O'Reilly (cricketer)|Bill O'Reilly]]&amp;mdash;a correspondent for ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]''&amp;mdash;described the selection as &quot;one of the most fantastic somersaults in cricket policies in our time&quot;.&lt;ref name=quote&gt;Hopps, pp. 214&amp;ndash;216.&lt;/ref&gt; As a close friend of the fast bowler, umpire Egar was in a difficult situation; the duo had won a pairs [[lawn bowling]] competition just a few months earlier.&lt;ref name=c591/&gt; Nevertheless, the paceman and umpire socialised freely at the pre-match function.&lt;ref name=h183/&gt;

===Incident===
In the Test match, which began on 6 December 1963, Australia batted first; Meckiff contributed seven runs before being bowled by [[Peter Pollock]].&lt;ref name=&quot;testlist&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;final&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Australia v South Africa – South Africa in Australia 1963/64 (1st Test)
|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/26/26508.html |publisher=[[CricketArchive]] |accessdate=2008-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the second day, after the Australian innings ended on 435, South Africa began to bat just after the [[List of cricket terms#L|luncheon interval]]. Bowling from the Stanley Street End, [[Graham McKenzie]] conceded 13 runs from the first over.&lt;ref name=&quot;g20&quot;/&gt; Meckiff took the ball for the second over, bowling from the Vulture Street End to South African captain [[Trevor Goddard (cricketer)|Trevor Goddard]].&lt;ref name=&quot;h133&quot;&gt;Haigh and Frith, p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the South African manager [[Ken Viljoen]] set up a camera square of the wicket among the spectators and began filming the left-armer's bowling action.&lt;ref name=&quot;g20&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=h184/&gt; Meckiff was no-balled four times by Egar—who was standing at square leg—in what would be his only over of the match.&lt;ref name=&quot;w84&quot;/&gt; After the Victorian bowled a gentle &quot;loosener&quot; as his first ball (and escaped a front-foot no-ball call), &quot;the drama began&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;g20&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=h184&gt;Haigh, p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt; Egar ruled the second, third, fifth and ninth balls to be throws, and therefore illegitimate.&lt;ref name=p182/&gt;&lt;ref name=w84/&gt; After the third and fifth balls—the latter a [[full toss]] that Goddard hit for [[four (cricket)|four]]—Benaud came over to consult his fast bowler.&lt;ref name=h184/&gt; After the ninth ball, Meckiff and Benaud had another meeting, and the remaining three balls were deemed to be fair.&lt;ref name=&quot;g20&quot;/&gt; In the meantime, the crowd roared loudly, heckling Egar and supporting the beleaguered bowler.&lt;ref name=c591/&gt;&lt;ref name=h185&gt;Haigh, p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt; Meckiff had previously been passed in five countries, having played Tests in four of these nations. Egar had cleared his bowling on five previous occasions, in three Shield matches and two Tests; the Victorian had bowled 119.1 overs in these games without incident. Egar later said &quot;My only judgement was what I saw at the time&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;w84&quot;&gt;Whimpress, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; Benaud removed his paceman from the attack and Meckiff did not bowl again in the match,&lt;ref name=&quot;w84&quot;/&gt; later saying he could not remember the over because he was absorbed by a feeling of complete deflation.&lt;ref name=c591/&gt;

Meckiff conceded eight runs&amp;mdash;Goddard's boundary and the four no-balls&amp;mdash;from his solitary over and the tourists were eventually out for 346. Meckiff did not bat in the second innings of the weather-interrupted match; Australia declared at 1/144 before South Africa reached 1/13 when the match ended as a draw.&lt;ref name=&quot;testlist&quot;/&gt; After his single over, Meckiff's participation in the match was limited to his fielding, during which he caught Goddard from the bowling of Benaud in the South African first innings.&lt;ref name=h185/&gt;&lt;ref name=c592&gt;Coleman, p. 592.&lt;/ref&gt; He retired from all forms of cricket at the end of the game,&lt;ref name=&quot;az&quot;/&gt; but continued to proclaim that his bowling action was fair.&lt;ref name=&quot;h113&quot;&gt;Haigh and Frith, p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Barry Gibbs (cricket)|Barry Gibbs]], the secretary of the [[Queensland Cricket Association]] and the manager of the Australian team, called the &quot;humiliation&quot; of Meckiff &quot;without a doubt the most dramatic and emotion-charged&quot; sporting moment he had witnessed.&lt;ref name=&quot;g19&quot;&gt;Gibbs, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Egar's actions also ignited &quot;one of the most emotional crowd displays in Test history&quot;,&lt;ref name=w87/&gt; as the public backed the paceman. During Meckiff's over, the crowd expressed strong disapproval of the umpire's calls.&lt;ref name=&quot;g21&quot;&gt;Gibbs, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Half an hour before the close of the day's play, proceedings were suspended for two minutes as the crowd repeatedly chanted &quot;We want Meckiff&quot;.&lt;ref name=h185/&gt;&lt;ref name=w87/&gt; When play ended, spectators stormed the field and carried the fast bowler off the arena on their shoulders, hailing him as a hero. They returned to the field and formed two lanes, booing Egar from the ground.&lt;ref name=h185/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;w87&quot;&gt;Whimpress, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; After this incident, the Queensland Police escorted the umpire to and from the match venue.&lt;ref name=p182/&gt; The police presence at the ground was increased because of fears the crowd might attack Egar or Benaud.&lt;ref name=&quot;h133&quot;/&gt; During the Second Test, which was  held in Meckiff's home town of Melbourne, Egar was given a police escort throughout the match after receiving death threats.&lt;ref&gt;Piesse, p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reaction===
During a rest day after the second day's play the media dissected the events of the previous afternoon.&lt;ref name=&quot;w84&quot;/&gt; The majority of reporters believed all of Meckiff's deliveries had been bowled with an identical action.&lt;ref name=&quot;h133&quot;/&gt; Louis Duffus of the ''[[Johannesburg Star]]'' expressed &quot;sympathy for Meckiff as well as admiration for Egar.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;w85&quot;&gt;Whimpress, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; The South African writer [[Charles Fortune]] said that Meckiff's action was &quot;not according to the laws of cricket&quot; although he would not call the Australian bowler a &quot;chucker&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;w85&quot;/&gt; England captain Dexter implicitly accused Meckiff of throwing, saying: &quot;One courageous Australian umpire has brought it to a timely end&quot;.&lt;ref name=h186/&gt;

Team manager Gibbs reported that at the end of the first day's play the Australian dressing room was stunned into silence. Egar asked Benaud for permission to enter, and after the Australian captain allowed him in, the umpire sat quietly for a period before speaking to some other players and then to Meckiff. The pair were close friends, and shook hands before putting their arms around one another's shoulders. The condemned bowler did not take Egar's judgment personally and did not have hard feelings about the incident.&lt;ref name=h186&gt;Haigh, p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gibbs, pp. 20–21.&lt;/ref&gt; Egar claimed to be &quot;the second most upset person in the world&quot;,&lt;ref name=h186/&gt;&lt;ref name=sc&gt;Tibballs, pp. 134&amp;ndash;137.&lt;/ref&gt; and later added that he thought Meckiff's first ball was suspect. He said that he could have called more deliveries, but was worried whether the over would ever end.&lt;ref name=sc/&gt;

When asked why he had not asked Meckiff to bowl at the other end to gauge the judgment of the other umpire, Lou Rowan, Benaud replied &quot;over the years I have always accepted the umpire's decision&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;w88&quot;&gt;Whimpress, p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; The Australian captain was criticised for being acquiescent, and one of his predecessors [[Lindsay Hassett]] believed Meckiff should have been used at reduced speed.&lt;ref name=&quot;w89&quot;/&gt; Rowan later indicated his concurrence with Egar, writing in his book ''The Umpire's Story'', &quot;There is nothing I can now say that will alter the opinions already expressed that his [Meckiff's] delivery was unfair&quot;.&lt;ref name=g23&gt;Gibbs, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; For his part, Meckiff said: &quot;the game is bigger than the individual&quot; and he backed Benaud's decision because doing otherwise &quot;could only have added fuel to the controversy&quot;.&lt;ref name=c592/&gt;

Retired Test umpires [[Col Hoy]] and [[Les Townsend]] were watching at the ground when Meckiff was called. The day after the incident, both asserted that they would not have no-balled the paceman. Hoy said he had never had any problem with the bowler's action during matches in which he officiated. He described Meckiff's action as &quot;slightly different&quot; but attributed this to an accentuated wrist action used in an attempt to get more life out of dead pitches, rather than his elbow.&lt;ref name=&quot;w89&quot;/&gt; Townsend watched the paceman through binoculars and deemed all of his 12 deliveries to be identical. Townsend regarded Meckiff's arm action as &quot;peculiar&quot; but felt he did not throw.&lt;ref name=&quot;w89&quot;&gt;Whimpress, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; Former Test spinners Ian Johnson and [[Doug Ring]] said Meckiff's action was fair.&lt;ref name=h186/&gt;

After his retirement, Meckiff agreed to put his name to a series of ghost-written articles about the no-ball incident.&lt;ref name=h187&gt;Haigh, p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt; He said that Egar's calls &quot;hit him like a dagger in the back&quot;,&lt;ref name=h187/&gt; but described the umpire as &quot;a fair and just man who acted according to his convictions&quot;.&lt;ref name=h187/&gt;

===Allegations of a conspiracy===
Sections of the cricket community believed Meckiff was no-balled to prove that Australia was serious about dealing with the wave of complaints regarding suspected throwing in the 1950s and 1960s.&lt;ref name=&quot;az&quot;/&gt; Leading cricket historian [[David Frith]] wrote: &quot;Meckiff was a popular Australian, and won much sympathy among those who believed him innocent or to have been victimised in a 'clean-up campaign'.&quot;&lt;ref name=az/&gt; A dinner hosted by Don Bradman at his Adelaide home in January 1963 for visiting state captains was later cited to suggest that Meckiff may have been a sacrificial offering. At the dinner, attended by [[Bill Lawry]] of Victoria, [[Barry Shepherd]], [[Ken Mackay]] and Benaud,&lt;ref name=&quot;w90&quot;&gt;Whimpress, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=h182&gt;Haigh, p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt; Bradman had showed frame-by-frame slow motion film of Meckiff and other suspect Australian bowlers, which purportedly depicted incriminating actions. This indicated Bradman's doubts over Meckiff's legitimacy, yet Bradman was one of the selectors who agreed to the bowler's inclusion in the Brisbane Test team.&lt;ref name=&quot;w91&quot;&gt;Whimpress, p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many members of the Australian media alleged a conspiracy against Meckiff. [[Ian McDonald (cricketer)|Ian McDonald]] of Melbourne's ''[[The Sporting Globe|Sporting Globe]]'' said the bowler's action had not changed in the previous eight years and stated: &quot;the whole affair smacks of a set-up&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;w85&quot;/&gt; Sydney's ''Mirror'' labelled the paceman &quot;the most obvious fall-guy in Australian cricket history&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;w85&quot;/&gt; On the third morning of the match, former first-class cricketer [[Percy Beames]], writing for Melbourne's ''[[The Age]]'', claimed Meckiff had been used as a &quot;sacrificial goat&quot; and called for the selectors’ resignation.&lt;ref name=&quot;w86&quot;&gt;Whimpress, p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; Keith Miller wrote a column calling for Bradman's and [[Jack Ryder (cricketer)|Jack Ryder]]'s removal from the selection panel, noting that they had watched Meckiff's performance against Western Australia which prompted his Test selection.&lt;ref name=&quot;w86&quot;/&gt; Miller felt that if the selectors deemed the bowler illegitimate, then they should not have allowed him to be &quot;executed&quot; by the umpires.&lt;ref name=&quot;w87&quot;/&gt; [[Jack Pollard]] said: &quot;there is little doubt Meckiff was sacrificed to end the long-running controversy and the way it was done irked many cricket-lovers.&quot;&lt;ref name=p182/&gt; Cricketer-turned-journalist [[Dick Whitington]] asserted that Benaud was aware his fast bowler had been set up, claiming that the Australian captain knew of Bradman's views on Meckiff’s action. Whitington further cited the fact that Egar and Bradman had travelled from Adelaide to the Brisbane Test together as evidence of a plot.&lt;ref name=h187/&gt; Others saw Bradman's tea-time conversation with Benaud after the no-balling as proof of a conspiracy.&lt;ref name=h188&gt;Haigh, p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt; Benaud repudiated allegations claiming he was involved in a set-up.&lt;ref name=h188/&gt;

Former Australian captain Hassett hinted at a conspiracy when he stated that, as the selectors must have considered Meckiff to be legitimate, then

&lt;blockquote&gt;If the selectors are right, Egar is wrong, and if he is incapable of interpreting the laws correctly, he should not stand in first-class cricket. On the other hand if the selectors as a body threw Meckiff into this arena merely to be tested by the opinion of a single umpire, they are very much guilty of passing the buck, and of exposing both the bowler and the umpire to extreme embarrassment.&lt;ref name=&quot;w87&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The records of the Australian Board of Control attest to board member [[Clem Jones]]'s protestations against Meckiff's inclusion when the selectors' proposed team list was submitted for approval. Jones cited the bowler's questionable action but the Chairman [[Ewart Macmillan]] rejected his objection as unconstitutional. Two other board members attempted to overrule the chairman, but their motion was defeated.&lt;ref name=&quot;h133&quot;/&gt;

More than 40 years after the Meckiff incident, Jones was sure the bowler's fate had been predetermined. He said &quot;They'd decided to do it a week before the game, so the poor bloke had no hope...I was chairman of the umpires selection committee.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;h133&quot;/&gt; Jones remained convinced of Bradman's intention to have Meckiff called for throwing, something Bradman flatly denied.&lt;ref name=&quot;h134&quot;&gt;Haigh and Frith, p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; Gibbs remains suspicious of the motives for selecting Meckiff. He pointed out that although the pitch was conducive to spin bowling, Australia chose five specialist batsmen, two spinners and three fast bowlers. Gibbs speculated that the selection of an extra fast bowler&amp;mdash;the most common strategy is to use four bowlers and six batsmen&amp;mdash;instead of another batsman betrayed fears that Meckiff would be unable to complete the match.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbs, pp. 22–24.&lt;/ref&gt; Alan Connolly remained adamant that his teammate's action was legitimate and implied a conspiracy, saying &quot;I wasn't amazed [by Egar's call]...There was a good reason for that which I can't disclose and won't disclose.&quot;&lt;ref name=pi190/&gt; [[Tom Veivers]], who made his Test debut for Australia in Meckiff’s last match, hinted at the same. He recalled  Rowan's words at the pre-match function: &quot;It's going to be a very interesting game&quot;.&lt;ref name=h183/&gt;

After finishing high school, Meckiff worked as a hardware salesman and lived in Mentone until he married and moved to [[Beaumaris, Victoria|Beaumaris]].&lt;ref name=c589&gt;Coleman, p. 589.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=h180&gt;Haigh, p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt; The couple had a son.&lt;ref name=p182/&gt; After his retirement, the former paceman worked in advertising,&lt;ref name=&quot;az&quot;/&gt; and as a cricket commentator.&lt;ref name=&quot;fam&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=c592/&gt; As of 2001, he was a senior executive with Boyer Sports Media and frequently worked with cricket administrators.&lt;ref name=&quot;g25&quot;/&gt; However, he refused to play the sport&amp;mdash;even at social level&amp;mdash;after the incident in Brisbane.&lt;ref name=pi190/&gt;

Meckiff played [[Australian rules football]] for Mentone in the Federal League, helping them win the premiership in 1956.&lt;ref name=&quot;fam&quot;/&gt; He received offers to play in the [[Australian Football League|Victorian Football League]], the top-tier competition at the time, but declined contracts so he could pursue his cricket career.&lt;ref name=&quot;fam&quot;/&gt; Meckiff also played golf in pennant competition and captained the Victoria Golf Club.&lt;ref name=&quot;g25&quot;&gt;Gibbs, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

In retirement, the throwing issue continued to dog the former paceman. Former Australian captain and teammate Simpson wrote a book titled ''Captain's Story'' in which he assailed various cricketers&amp;mdash;Meckiff chief among them&amp;mdash;for throwing. Meckiff sued for libel in a five-year case, which ended with an out-of-court settlement and apology from Simpson.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, p. 241.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, Meckiff has continued to socialise with people involved in his last Test, including Simpson, Egar, Gibbs, Rowan and [[Peter van der Merwe]], South Africa's vice-captain.&lt;ref name=&quot;g25&quot;/&gt; He says that he never brings up the topic of the no-ball with them.&lt;ref name=c592/&gt; Victorian and Test teammate Lawry rated Meckiff &quot;along with [[Graham McKenzie]], [[Brian Booth]], [[Peter Burge (cricketer)|Peter Burge]] and one or two others as really nature's gentlemen&quot; and said his exit was &quot;one of the saddest [days] of [Lawry's] life&quot;.&lt;ref name=c592/&gt; Lawry credited his fellow Victorian for being dignified despite the torment and said the bowler was a &quot;pretty fair example of the old expression that good guys run last&quot;.&lt;ref name=c593&gt;Coleman, p. 593.&lt;/ref&gt; Connolly said &quot;'Meckie' was one of the nicest guys. It was to his great credit that he wasn't soured by the whole incident.&quot;&lt;ref name=pi190&gt;Piesse, p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt;
