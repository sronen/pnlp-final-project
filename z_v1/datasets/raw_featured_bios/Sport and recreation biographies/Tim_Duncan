Duncan started out as a swimmer and only began playing basketball in ninth grade after [[Hurricane Hugo]] destroyed the only Olympic-sized pool on [[St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands|Saint Croix]]. He soon became a standout for [[St. Dunstan's Episcopal High School]], and had an illustrious college career with the [[Wake Forest University]] [[Wake Forest Demon Deacons men's basketball|Demon Deacons]], winning the [[Naismith College Player of the Year]], [[USBWA College Player of the Year]] and [[John Wooden Award|John Wooden]] awards in his final year. Duncan graduated from college before entering the [[1997 NBA Draft]] as the number one pick, and his list of accomplishments, remarkable consistency, and leadership in the Spurs' NBA championship runs in [[1999 NBA Finals|1999]], [[2003 NBA Finals|2003]], [[2005 NBA Finals|2005]], and [[2007 NBA Finals|2007]] have led basketball experts to consider him to be one of the greatest power forwards in NBA history.

Off the court, Duncan is known for his quiet and unassuming ways, as well as his active philanthropy. He holds an honors degree in psychology and created the Tim Duncan Foundation to raise general health awareness and fund education and youth sports in various parts of the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;nbabio&quot;&gt;[http://www.nba.com/playerfile/tim_duncan/bio.html Tim Duncan – Bio], nba.com.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Duncan is the only son of Ione and William Duncan, a midwife and a mason respectively, joining his two older sisters Cheryl and Tricia in a middle-class family in [[Christiansted]], a town on [[St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands|Saint Croix]], one of the main islands composing the [[United States Virgin Islands]]. In school, Duncan was a bright pupil and dreamt of becoming an Olympic-level swimmer like his sister, [[Tricia Duncan|Tricia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;jockbio&quot;&gt;[http://www.jockbio.com/Bios/Duncan/Duncan_bio.html Tim Duncan Biography], jockbio.com.

When [[Hurricane Hugo]] destroyed the island's only Olympic-sized swimming pool in 1989, Duncan was forced to swim in the ocean and he quickly lost his enthusiasm for swimming because of his fear of sharks.&lt;ref name=&quot;nbabio&quot; /&gt; Duncan was dealt another emotional blow when his mother was diagnosed with [[breast cancer]] and died one day before his 14th birthday.&lt;ref name=&quot;jockbio&quot; /&gt; In her last days, she made Duncan and his sisters promise to finish college with a degree, which would later explain Duncan's reluctance to leave college early.&lt;ref name=&quot;21Q&quot;&gt;[http://www.slamduncan.com/news-21questions.php Questions with Tim Duncan], slamduncan.com. Retrieved January 13, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Duncan never swam competitively again, but was inspired by his brother-in-law to turn to basketball.&lt;ref name=&quot;21Q&quot; /&gt;

Duncan initially had difficulties adapting to the game he thought would help relieve his pain and frustration. Nancy Pomroy, the athletic director of the St. Croix Country Day School was quoted: &quot;[Duncan] was so huge. So big and tall, but he was awfully awkward at the time.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Slam Duncan|first=Kevin|last=Kernan|year=2000|pages=20–21|isbn=978-1-58261-179-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; He overcame this to become a standout for the [[St. Dunstan's Episcopal High School]], averaging 25 points per game as a senior. His play attracted the attention of several universities, despite having only picked up the game in ninth grade.&lt;ref name=&quot;nbabio&quot; /&gt; [[Wake Forest University]] basketball coach [[Dave Odom]] in particular grew interested in Duncan after the 16-year-old allegedly played NBA star [[Alonzo Mourning]] to a draw in a 5-on-5 pick-up game.&lt;ref name=&quot;jockbio&quot; /&gt; Odom was searching for a tall, physical player to play near the basket.&lt;ref name=&quot;jockbio&quot; /&gt; Given the weak level of basketball in the Virgin Islands, Odom was wary about Duncan at first, especially after first meeting him and thinking him to be inattentive; Duncan stared blankly at Odom for most of the conversation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kernan2831&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Slam Duncan|first=Kevin|last=Kernan|year=2000|pages=28–31|isbn=978-1-58261-179-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, after the first talk, Odom understood that this was just Duncan's way of paying attention, and discovered that he was not only athletically talented, but also a quick learner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kernan2831&quot; /&gt; Eventually, despite scholarship offers by the [[University of Hartford]], the [[University of Delaware]] and [[Providence College]], Duncan joined Odom's Wake Forest Demon Deacons.&lt;ref name=&quot;jockbio&quot; /&gt;

The Demon Deacons had previously reached the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|Sweet 16]], but lost main scorer [[Rodney Rogers]], who had entered the [[1993 NBA Draft]].&lt;ref name=&quot;jockbio&quot; /&gt; Coach [[Dave Odom]] had considered [[red-shirt (college sports)|red-shirting]] Duncan, but was forced to play him after fellow freshman big man [[Makhtar N'Diaye (basketball)|Makhtar N'Diaye]] was ruled out due to [[NCAA]] rules violations and eventually transferred to [[Michigan Wolverines men's basketball|Michigan]].&lt;ref&gt;Crothers, Tim, [http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1007467/4/index.htm &quot;Slam Duncan&quot;], sportsillustrated.cnn.com, November 27, 1995. Retrieved November 21, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Duncan struggled with early transition problems and was even held scoreless in his first college game, but as the year progressed, he and teammate [[Randolph Childress]] led the Deacons to a 20–11 win–loss record.&lt;ref name=&quot;jockbio&quot; /&gt; Duncan's style of play was simple but effective, combining an array of [[Low post|low-post]] moves, mid-range [[Basketball moves#Bank shot|bank shots]] and tough defense. He was chosen to represent the U.S. in the 1994 [[Goodwill Games]].&lt;ref name=&quot;jockbio&quot; /&gt; Meanwhile, Duncan worked towards a degree in psychology and also took classes in anthropology and Chinese literature.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kernan2831&quot; /&gt; Despite focusing heavily on basketball, Wake Forest psychology department chairperson Deborah Best was quoted: &quot;Tim [...] was one of my more intellectual students. [...] Other than his height, I couldn't tell him from any other student at Wake Forest.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kernan2831&quot; /&gt; Duncan also established his reputation as a stoic player, to the extent that opposing fans taunted him as &quot;[[Mr. Spock]]&quot;, the prototypical logical, detached character from ''[[Star Trek]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kernan2831&quot; /&gt;

In the [[1994 in basketball|1994–95 NCAA season]], the sophomore was soon called one of the most eligible NBA prospects, along with his peers [[Joe Smith (basketball)|Joe Smith]], [[Rasheed Wallace]] and [[Jerry Stackhouse]].&lt;ref name=&quot;jockbio&quot; /&gt; [[Los Angeles Lakers]] general manager [[Jerry West]] suggested that Duncan might become the top pick in the [[1995 NBA Draft]] if he went early, but Duncan assured everyone he had no intention of [[professional sports|going pro]] until he graduated, even though the NBA was planning to add a rookie [[salary cap]] in 1996. He was giving up a lot of money, but was determined to stay in school.&lt;ref name=&quot;jockbio&quot; /&gt; In that season, he led the Demon Deacons into the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]] (ACC) championship game against a Rasheed Wallace-led [[North Carolina Tar Heels]]. During that game, Duncan neutralized the threat of Wallace, while Childress sealed the win with a [[Jump shot (basketball)|jump shot]] with four seconds left in [[overtime (sports)|overtime]].&lt;ref name=&quot;jockbio&quot; /&gt; In the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] Tournament, the Demon Deacons reached the Sweet 16, and playing against [[Oklahoma State]], Duncan scored 12 points to go with 22 rebounds and eight blocks, outplaying [[Bryant Reeves]], but his team lost 71–66. Still, Duncan ended the year averaging 16.8 [[point (basketball)|points]] and 12.5 [[rebound (basketball)|rebounds]] per game, was named Defensive Player of the Year and became the third-best [[block (basketball)|shot-blocker]] in NCAA history with 3.98 blocks per game.&lt;ref name=&quot;jockbio&quot; /&gt; He was also voted All-ACC First Team, a feat he would repeat in each of his two remaining years at Wake Forest.&lt;ref name=&quot;usabio&quot; /&gt;

In the following [[1995 in basketball|1995–96 NCAA season]], Wake Forest had to deal with the loss of Childress, who entered the NBA. This provided an opportunity for Duncan to show his leadership qualities, and his inexperienced team lost only four games in the entire ACC season.&lt;ref name=&quot;jockbio&quot; /&gt; The Demon Deacons won the ACC Finals again, but in the Sweet 16, Duncan came down with flu, and his team missed the [[Final Four]] by one win. He completed another remarkable season with averages of 19.1 points and 12.3 rebounds per game, and was again voted Defensive and ACC Player of the Year.&lt;ref name=&quot;usabio&quot; /&gt; At the season's end the Wake Forest star was rumored to enter the [[1996 NBA Draft]], but in the end, he stayed in college.&lt;ref name=&quot;jockbio&quot; /&gt;

In the [[1996 in basketball|1996–97 NCAA season]], Duncan was helped by the addition of future NBA player [[Loren Woods]], a 7'1&quot; player who eased the pressure on Duncan close to the basket. The Demon Deacons won their first 13 games, but then got into a slump and failed to win a third ACC title.&lt;ref name=&quot;jockbio&quot; /&gt; The NCAA campaign was just as frustrating, as [[Stanford University]] led by future NBA [[point guard]] [[Brevin Knight]] eliminated Duncan's team with a 72–66 win. Duncan finished with an individually impressive season though, averaging 20.8 points, 14.7 rebounds and 3.2 [[assist (basketball)|assists]] per game while shooting .606 from the [[field goal percentage|field]] and winning the Defensive Player of the Year for a third straight season. He earned first-team [[All-America]] honors for the second time, and was a unanimous pick for both [[USBWA College Player of the Year|USWBA]] and [[Naismith College Player of the Year]].&lt;ref name=&quot;jockbio&quot; /&gt; Duncan led the 1996–97 NCAA Division I in rebounding, was 10th in blocked shots (3.3 bpg) and 28th in scoring (20.8 ppg).&lt;ref name=&quot;usabio&quot;&gt;[http://www.usabasketball.com/biosmen/tim_duncan_bio.html USA Basketball Bio: Tim Duncan]{{dead link|date=January 2011}}, usabasketball.com.

In contrast to contemporary [[prep-to-pro]] players like [[Kevin Garnett]], [[Jermaine O'Neal]], [[Tracy McGrady]] or [[Kobe Bryant]], Duncan stayed at college for a full four years. During that period, he was a two-time ACC Player of the Year, and a three-time [[NABC Defensive Player of the Year]]. The center also made the All-ACC Tournament between 1995 and 1997, the All-ACC First Team between 1995 and 1997, and was named [[Most Valuable Player]] of the 1996 ACC Tournament. Further, 1996 was the year where he led the conference in scoring, rebounding, field goal percentage and blocked shots, becoming the first player in conference history to lead all four of those categories.&lt;ref name=&quot;usabio&quot; /&gt; Overall, Duncan led his team to a 97–31 win–loss record and finished his college career as the second-leading shot blocker in NCAA history, and remains one of only ten players with more than 2,000 career points and 1,500 career rebounds. He was also the first player in NCAA history to reach 1,500 points, 1,000 rebounds, 400 blocked shots and 200 assists. He left college as the all-time leading shot-blocker in ACC history with 481 blocks—second in NCAA annals behind [[Colgate University|Colgate's]] [[Adonal Foyle]] and third on the ACC career rebounding list with 1,570 rebounds.&lt;ref name=&quot;usabio&quot; /&gt; With his college degree in his hands, Duncan finally made himself eligible for the [[1997 NBA Draft]].

===&quot;Twin Towers&quot; (1997–2003)===
In the 1997 NBA Draft, the [[San Antonio Spurs]] drafted Duncan with the first draft pick.&lt;ref name=&quot;stats&quot; /&gt; The Spurs were coming off an injury-riddled [[1996–97 NBA season|1996–97 season]]; their best player, [[David Robinson (basketball)|David Robinson]]—himself a number one draft pick [[1987 NBA Draft|in 1987]]—was sidelined for most of the year, and they had finished with a 20–62 win–loss record.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nba.com/history/standings/19961997.html 1996–97 Standings], nba.com/history. Retrieved April 19, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; However, as the [[1997–98 NBA season|1997–98 season]] approached, the Spurs were considered a notable threat in the NBA. With an experienced [[center (basketball)|center]] in Robinson and the number one pick in Duncan, the Spurs featured one of the best [[frontcourt]]s in the league. Duncan and Robinson became known as the &quot;Twin Towers&quot;, having earned a reputation for their exceptional defense close to the basket, forcing opponents to take lower percentage shots from outside.&lt;ref name=&quot;jockbio&quot; /&gt; From the beginning, Duncan established himself as a quality player: in his second-ever road game, he grabbed 22 rebounds against opposing [[Chicago Bulls]] power forward [[Dennis Rodman]], a multiple rebounding champion and [[NBA Defensive Player of the Year]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Slam Duncan|first=Kevin|last=Kernan|year=2000|page=47|isbn=978-1-58261-179-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duncan was voted to the [[1998 NBA All-Star Game]] by coaches.

The Spurs qualified for the [[1998 NBA Playoffs]] as the fifth [[Seed (tennis)|seed]], but Duncan had a bad first half in his first playoff game against the [[Phoenix Suns]], causing Suns coach [[Danny Ainge]] to play Duncan with less defensive pressure.

==Off the court==
Tim Duncan has two older sisters, Cheryl and [[Tricia Duncan|Tricia]]&lt;ref name=&quot;jockbio&quot; /&gt; Like their younger brother, they were gifted athletes: Cheryl was a championship swimmer before she became a nurse, and Tricia swam [[Virgin Islands at the 1988 Summer Olympics|for the U.S. Virgin Islands]] at the [[1988 Summer Olympics]] in [[Seoul]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Slam Duncan|first=Kevin|last=Kernan|year=2000|page=19|isbn=978-1-58261-179-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Duncan married his wife Amy in 2001&lt;ref name=&quot;nbabio&quot; /&gt; and the couple had their first child, daughter Sydney, in the summer of 2005.&lt;ref name=&quot;nbabio&quot; /&gt; They had a second child, a son, during the summer of 2007. Amy oversees the Tim Duncan Foundation, which has been established to serve the areas of health awareness/research, education, and youth sports/recreation in San Antonio, [[Winston-Salem]], and the United States Virgin Islands.&lt;ref name=&quot;nbabio&quot; /&gt; The foundation holds two major [[fundraiser]]s each year: the annual Tim Duncan Bowling for Dollar$ Charity Bowl-A-Thon and the annual Slam Duncan Charity Golf Classic.&lt;ref name=&quot;nbabio&quot; /&gt; Between 2001 and 2002, the foundation raised more than $350,000 to help fight breast and [[prostate cancer]].&lt;ref name=&quot;adid&quot; /&gt; In those two years, Duncan was named by ''[[Sporting News]]'' as one of the &quot;Good Guys&quot; in sports.&lt;ref name=&quot;adid&quot; /&gt; The Spurs captain also supports the Children's Bereavement Center, the Children's Center of San Antonio and the Cancer Therapy and Research Center.&lt;ref name=&quot;nbabio&quot; /&gt;

Duncan cites his late mother Ione as his main inspiration. Among other things, she taught him and his sisters the nursery rhyme &quot;Good, Better, Best. Never let it rest / Until your Good is Better, and your Better is your Best,&quot; which he adopted as his personal motto.&lt;ref name=&quot;21Q&quot; /&gt; On and off the court, he believes that the three most important values are dedication, teamwork and camaraderie.&lt;ref name=&quot;21Q&quot; /&gt; The Spurs captain has also stated that he chose #21 for his jersey because that was his brother-in-law's college number, since he was Duncan's main basketball inspiration, and cites Hall-of-Fame [[Los Angeles Lakers]] point guard [[Magic Johnson]] as his childhood idol.&lt;ref name=&quot;21Q&quot; /&gt;

For his mixture of success and low-key personality, Duncan has been honored with the Virgin Islands Medal of Honor, the highest award bestowed by the Virgin Islands territorial government, and has been celebrated in several &quot;Tim Duncan Day&quot; ceremonies.&lt;ref name=&quot;slamduncanP24-26&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Slam Duncan|first=Kevin|last=Kernan|year=2000|pages=24–26|isbn=978-1-58261-179-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, [[Legislature of the Virgin Islands]] President [[Vargrave Richards]] of St. Croix said: &quot;He is a quiet giant. His laid-back attitude is the embodiment of the people of St. Croix, doing things without fanfare and hoopla.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;slamduncanP24-26&quot; /&gt;

Regarding his own personality, Duncan compares himself to Will Hunting of the movie ''[[Good Will Hunting]]'', which centers around the genial and antagonistic character of Will Hunting, portrayed by [[Matt Damon]]. He stated: &quot;I'm just a taller, slightly less hyperactive version of the Damon character in the movie. I really enjoyed how he probed people and found out their weaknesses just by asking questions and stating outlandish remarks.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;slamduncanP53&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Slam Duncan|first=Kevin|last=Kernan|year=2000|page=53|isbn=978-1-58261-179-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also admitted shunning the limelight because &quot;[fame] is not me.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;slamduncanP53&quot; /&gt; Off the court, he has stated that his best friend is former Spurs colleague [[Antonio Daniels]], who describes Duncan as a cheerful, funny person off the hardwood.&lt;ref name=&quot;slamduncanP11&quot; /&gt;

Duncan loves [[Renaissance fair]]s, [[Live action role-playing game|Larping]] and the fantasy [[role playing game]] [[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]].&lt;ref name=&quot;briggs&quot;&gt;Briggs, Jerry, &quot;Duncan's unusual hobby and more unusual request,&quot; ''San Antonio Express-News (Texas)'', November 30, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; An avid [[video game]] player, he acknowledges a certain joy of playing &quot;himself&quot; on basketball video games. Duncan states if he had the chance, he would challenge NBA legends [[Wilt Chamberlain]] and [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]] to a one-on-one game.&lt;ref name=&quot;21Q&quot; /&gt;

The satirical newspaper ''[[The Onion]]'' has repeatedly poked fun of Duncan's low key and cerebral reputation and its contradiction with the stereotype of outlandish celebrity athlete behavior with headlines such as &quot;Tim Duncan Hams It Up For Crowd By Arching Left Eyebrow Slightly,&quot; &quot;Tim Duncan Offers To Do Taxes For Entire Spurs Team,&quot; &quot;Tim Duncan Autobiography Reveals He Is Friends With 10,000 Women&quot; (a parody of [[Personal life of Wilt Chamberlain|Wilt Chamberlain's famous claim]]) and &quot;Tim Duncan Announces Shoe Deal With [[Florsheim Shoes|Florsheim]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theonion.com/search/?submit.x=0&amp;submit.y=0&amp;submit=Search&amp;q=tim+duncan &quot;The Onion, Tim Duncan search&quot;], onion.com, March 8, 2011.
