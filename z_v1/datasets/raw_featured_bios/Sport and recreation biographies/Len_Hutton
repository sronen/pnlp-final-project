'''Sir Leonard &quot;Len&quot; Hutton''' (23 June 1916&amp;nbsp;– 6 September 1990) was an [[England national cricket team|English]] [[Test cricket]]er, who played for [[Yorkshire County Cricket Club|Yorkshire]] and England before and after the [[Second World War]] as an [[Batting order (cricket)#Opening batsmen|opening batsman]]. He was described by ''[[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack]]'' as one of the greatest batsmen in the history of [[cricket]]. In 1938, he set a record for the highest individual innings in a Test match in only his sixth Test appearance, scoring 364 [[Run (cricket)|runs]] against Australia, a milestone that stood for nearly 20 years. In 1952 he became the first professional cricketer of the 20th century to captain England in Tests; under his captaincy England won [[the Ashes]] the following year for the first time in 19 years. In the years immediately following the war, he was the mainstay of England's batting.

Marked out as a potential star from his teenage years, Hutton made his debut for Yorkshire in 1934 and quickly established himself at county level. By 1937, he was playing for England and when the war interrupted his career in 1939, critics regarded him as one of the leading batsmen in the country, and even the world. However, during the war, he received a serious injury to his arm while taking part in a commando training course. His arm never fully recovered, forcing him to alter his batting style. When cricket restarted, Hutton resumed his role as one of England's leading batsmen;  by the time of England's [[MCC tour of Australia in 1950–51|tour to Australia in 1950–51]], the team relied heavily on  his batting and did so for the remainder of his career. As a batsman, Hutton was cautious and  built his style on a sound defence. Although capable of attacking strokeplay, both Yorkshire and England depended on him greatly for their success, and awareness of this affected his style. Hutton remains statistically among the best batsmen to have  played Test cricket.

Hutton [[Len Hutton as England captain|captained the England Test team]] between 1952 and 1955, although his leadership was at times controversial. He pursued a cautious approach and faced criticism for negativity. Never comfortable in the role, Hutton felt that the [[Amateur status in first-class cricket|former amateur players]] who administered and governed English cricket did not trust him. In 23 Tests as captain, he won eight Tests and lost four with the others drawn. Worn out by the mental and physical demands of his role, Hutton retired from regular first-class cricket during the 1955 season. He was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] for his contributions to cricket in 1956. He went on to be a Test selector, a journalist and broadcaster. He also worked as a representative for an engineering firm until retiring from the job in 1984. Hutton remained involved in cricket, and became Yorkshire president in 1990. He died a few months afterwards in September 1990, aged 74.

==Early life==
[[File:Fulneck Moravian Settlement.jpg|thumb|upright|left|alt=A row of stone houses and buildings|Fulneck, where Hutton grew up]]
Hutton was born on 23 June 1916 in the [[Moravian Church|Moravian]] community of [[Fulneck]], [[Pudsey]]. He was the youngest of the five children of Henry Hutton and Lily (née Swithenbank);&lt;ref name=H4-6/&gt; many of the family played local cricket.&lt;ref name=coy/&gt; From 1921, Hutton attended Littlemoor Council School in Pudsey.&lt;ref name=H4-6&gt;Howat, pp. 4–6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt; He soon became immersed in cricket, which he both played and read about with enthusiasm.&lt;ref name=coy/&gt; He joined the [[Pudsey St Lawrence Cricket Club]] as a junior; at the age of 12, he made his first appearance for the club's second eleven and by 1929 had reached the first team.&lt;ref&gt;Howat, pp. 6–7.&lt;/ref&gt; Locals encouraged him to meet the [[Yorkshire County Cricket Club|Yorkshire]] and England cricketer [[Herbert Sutcliffe]], a neighbour, from whom Hutton received coaching in Sutcliffe's garden. Sutcliffe was impressed by the young batsman, and commended him to Yorkshire as a good prospect.&lt;ref name=H7/&gt;&lt;ref name=H170&gt;Hill, p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following this endorsement, Hutton went to the county's indoor practice shed at [[Headingley Stadium|Headingley]] in February 1930.&lt;ref name=H7&gt;Howat, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Hirst]], a former Yorkshire cricketer responsible for assessing and coaching young players, believed that Hutton's batting technique was essentially already complete.&lt;ref name=H170/&gt; [[Bill Bowes]], the Yorkshire pace bowler, was equally impressed, and helped Hutton to correct a minor flaw in his technique.&lt;ref name=H8/&gt; In 1930, Hutton watched the Australian [[Don Bradman]] hit 334 [[not out]] at Headingley in a Test match, then a record individual score in Tests—which Hutton himself would surpass eight years later.&lt;ref name=H7/&gt; Hutton was sufficiently encouraged to decide to attempt a career in professional cricket, but at the prompting of his parents decided to learn a trade as well. He spent 1930 studying studying technical drawing and quantitative work at Pudsey Grammar School, before joining his father at a local building firm, Joseph Verity.  After joining Yorkshire as a professional, Hutton continued to work for the company during the winter months in the years until the Second World War.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;&lt;ref name=H8&gt;Howat, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career before the Second World War==
===First years with Yorkshire===
[[File:Herbert Sutcliffe.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[Herbert Sutcliffe]] in 1924: Sutcliffe recognised Hutton's potential in Pudsey during 1929. He later established an opening partnership with Hutton and wrote that his partner was &quot;a marvel&amp;nbsp;– the discovery of a generation&quot;.&lt;ref name=H21/&gt;| alt= A cricketer ready to bat.]]
By 1933 Hutton was playing regularly for the Pudsey St Lawrence first team in the [[Bradford Cricket League]], opening the batting with [[Edgar Oldroyd]], a recently-retired Yorkshire county batsman. Through close observation of Oldroyd's batting style, Hutton further developed his technique, especially in defence. The local press quickly identified Hutton as a player of promise, particularly after he scored a match-winning 108 [[not out]] in the [[Priestley Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;Howat, pp. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt; Senior figures within Yorkshire cricket identified him as a potential successor to [[Percy Holmes]] as an opening partner to Sutcliffe; at this stage in his career, Hutton was also considered a promising [[leg spin]] bowler.&lt;ref&gt;Howat, pp. 13–15.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1933 season Hutton was selected for the Yorkshire Second Eleven. Although he failed to score a run in either of his first two innings, over the season  he scored 699 [[Run (cricket)|runs]] at an [[Batting_average#Cricket|average]] of 69.90.&lt;ref&gt;Howat, pp. 12–13.&lt;/ref&gt; Yorkshire appointed [[Cyril Turner (cricketer)|Cyril Turner]] as Hutton's mentor; [[Hedley Verity]] and Bowes also offered Hutton guidance in his early career.&lt;ref&gt;Howat, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hodgson, p. 139&quot;&gt;Hodgson, p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hutton made his first-class debut for Yorkshire in 1934, at the age of 17 the youngest Yorkshire player since Hirst, 45 years earlier.&lt;ref name=H15-16/&gt; In his first match, against [[Cambridge University Cricket Club|Cambridge University]], he was [[run out]] for [[duck (cricket)|a duck]] but scored an unbeaten 50 runs in his second match, and followed this with another half-century against [[Warwickshire County Cricket Club|Warwickshire]] on his [[County Championship]] debut.&lt;ref name=H15-16&gt;Howat, pp. 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=figures&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.cricketarchive.com/cgi-bin/player_oracle_reveals_results2.cgi?playernumber=694&amp;opponentmatch=exact&amp;playername=&amp;resulttype=All&amp;matchtype=All&amp;teammatch=exact&amp;startwicket=&amp;homeawaytype=All&amp;opponent=&amp;endwicket=&amp;wicketkeeper=&amp;searchtype=InningsList&amp;endscore=&amp;playermatch=contains&amp;branding=cricketarchive&amp;captain=&amp;endseason=&amp;startscore=&amp;team=&amp;startseason=| title = Player Oracle (L Hutton)| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate =27 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In matches later that season, Hutton shared large first-wicket [[Partnership (cricket)|partnerships]] with [[Wilf Barber]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Howat, p.16&quot;&gt;Howat, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; and with [[Arthur Mitchell (cricketer)|Arthur Mitchell]], before scoring his maiden first-class century in an innings of 196 against [[Worcestershire County Cricket Club|Worcestershire]].&lt;ref&gt;Howat, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, he was the youngest Yorkshire batsman to score a first-class century.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt; He finished the season with a total of 863 runs at an average of 33.19;&lt;ref name=fcbatting&gt;{{cite web| url = http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/0/694/f_Batting_by_Season.html| title = First-class Batting and Fielding in Each Season by Len Hutton| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate =5 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yorkshire had limited his first team appearances, and returned him periodically to the second eleven, to prevent his overexposure to Championship cricket.&lt;ref&gt;Howat, pp. 19–20.&lt;/ref&gt;

An operation on his nose before the 1935 season delayed Hutton's appearance on the cricket field that year. As a consequence of his attempting to return too quickly, poor health and poor form limited his subsequent appearances and effectiveness; by the middle of August he had scored a total of just 73 runs.&lt;ref&gt;Howat, pp. 21–22.&lt;/ref&gt; A century against [[Middlesex County Cricket Club|Middlesex]] led to run of bigger scores, and his contribution to Yorkshire's County Championship victory that season&lt;ref name=ccposn&gt;{{Cite book| title = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack| year = 2010| publisher = John Wisden &amp; Co| chapter = LV County Championship: County Championship Final Positions 1890–2010| page = 575}}&lt;/ref&gt; was 577 runs at an average in first-class matches of 28.85.&lt;ref name=figures/&gt;&lt;ref name=fcbatting/&gt;  In the winter of 1935–36 Hutton went on his first overseas tour, as Yorkshire visited Jamaica.&lt;ref name=&quot;Howat, p.23&quot;&gt;Howat, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1936 season he reached 1,000 runs in a season for the first time—1,282 runs at an average of 29.81—and was awarded his [[county cap]]  in July.&lt;ref name=fcbatting/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Howat, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; He took part in several big partnerships through the season, including one of 230 with Sutcliffe, although he endured a run of low scores in May and June.&lt;ref name=H245&gt;Howat, pp. 24–25.&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout his first seasons, Hutton faced press criticism for his caution and his reluctance to play attacking shots. Although regarding him a certain England selection in the future, critics thought Hutton slightly dull and pedestrian.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt; However, Yorkshire were unconcerned;&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Howat, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; cricket writer Alan Hill believes Hutton's subsequent success was built on this initial establishment of a defensive technique.&lt;ref name=H245/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hill, pp. 170–71.&lt;/ref&gt; His achievements brought limited recognition, owing to the high level of expectation surrounding him.&lt;ref name=coy/&gt; This sense of frustration was heightened by comments from Sutcliffe in 1935, when he wrote that Hutton was &quot;a certainty for a place as England's opening batsman. He is a marvel&amp;nbsp;– the discovery of a generation ... His technique is that of a maestro.&quot;&lt;ref name=H21&gt;Howat, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Such praise was rare from Sutcliffe, but Hutton found the comments a burden, while others found them embarrassing.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;&lt;ref name=H21/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hill, p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Test match debut===
Hutton began 1937 very well, with a series of high scores,&lt;ref name=figures/&gt; including an innings of 271 against [[Derbyshire County Cricket Club|Derbyshire]], the reigning County Champions, and a partnership of 315 with Sutcliffe against [[Leicestershire County Cricket Club|Leicestershire]] two days later.&lt;ref&gt;Howat, pp. 27–29.&lt;/ref&gt; He was subsequently chosen for England in the first Test against the touring New Zealand team.&lt;ref&gt;Howat, pp. 28–29.&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 June, he made his Test debut at [[Lord's Cricket Ground]] and he scored 0 and 1.&lt;ref name=inns&gt;{{cite web| url = http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/player/14334.html?class=1;template=results;type=batting;view=innings
| title = Statsguru: L Hutton Test matches (innings by innings list)| publisher = ESPNCricinfo| accessdate =30 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, centuries for Yorkshire in the following games meant he retained his place in the England side for the second Test at [[Old Trafford Cricket Ground|Old Trafford, Manchester]].&lt;ref name=figures/&gt;&lt;ref name=inns/&gt; Here he scored his maiden Test hundred on 24 July, batting three-and-a-half hours to score exactly 100 runs and sharing a century opening partnership with [[Charlie Barnett (cricketer)|Charlie Barnett]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/16/16317.html| title = England v New Zealand in 1937| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate =28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hutton's remaining two innings in his first Test series yielded 14 and 12, giving him 127 runs  at an average of 25.40.&lt;ref name=inns/&gt;&lt;ref name=tbat&gt;{{cite web| url = http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/0/694/t_Batting_by_Season.html| title = Test Batting and Fielding in Each Season by Len Hutton| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate =28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1937, Hutton made his first appearance for  [[Gentlemen v Players|the Players against the Gentlemen]] at Lord's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/16/16293.html| title = Gentlemen v Players in 1937| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate =10 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In total that year he scored 2,888 runs, more than double his previous seasonal best, at an average of 56.62 and including ten centuries.&lt;ref name=fcbatting/&gt; He also recorded the best bowling performance of his career,  six wickets for 76 against Leicestershire, altogether taking ten wickets in the match—the only time he achieved this.&lt;ref name=figures/&gt; His performances that year earned him selection as one of ''Wisden's'' [[Wisden Cricketers of the Year|Cricketers of the Year]]. The citation praised his attitude, technique, fielding and bowling, noting however that some commentators continued to criticise his overcaution.&lt;ref name=coy&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/story/154653.html| title = Len Hutton (Cricketer of the Year 1938)| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack| year = 1938| publisher = John Wisden &amp; Co | location = London | accessdate =3 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early matches  of the 1938 season, with an [[the Ashes|Ashes]] series against Australia pending, Hutton made three centuries and scored 93 not out.&lt;ref name=figures/&gt; Selected for a Test trial, he shared a century opening partnership with [[Bill Edrich]],&lt;ref name=figures/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Howat, pp. 32–33.&lt;/ref&gt; and was selected for the first Test at [[Trent Bridge]] in Nottingham beginning on 28 June.&lt;ref name=inns/&gt;  In just over three hours, Hutton scored 100 from 221 [[Delivery (cricket)|deliveries]] on his Ashes debut, adding 219 with [[Charlie Barnett (cricketer)|Charlie Barnett]] for the first wicket. England, in [[Wally Hammond]]'s first match as Test captain, posted a total of 658 for eight wickets, but the match was drawn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/16/16611.html| title = England v Australia in 1938| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate =3 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hutton failed in the second Test, with two single figure scores in another drawn game.&lt;ref name=figures/&gt; He was generally unsuccessful with the bat in the following weeks, during which the third Test was entirely rained off. Following a sequence of low scores for Yorkshire, Hutton's finger was broken in a match against Middlesex played on a dangerous pitch at Lord's.&lt;ref name=figures/&gt;&lt;ref name=H34-5/&gt; Consequently he could not play in the fourth Test, played at his home ground, Headingley, in which  England were soundly beaten.&lt;ref name=H34-5&gt;Howat, pp. 34–35.&lt;/ref&gt; After missing a month of cricket, Hutton played just two games before his selection for the final Test of the series.&lt;ref name=figures/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Howat, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Test record score===
[[Image:Bradman&amp;Bat.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[Donald Bradman]], whose [[The Ashes|Ashes]] record score of 334 Hutton broke in 1938|alt=Man in double breasted suit, posing with a cricket bat.]]
The last Test was played at [[The Oval]] and began on 20 August 1938.&lt;ref name=inns/&gt; Hammond won the toss on a very good pitch for batting,&lt;ref name=oval38/&gt; and after an early wicket fell, Hutton and [[Maurice Leyland]], his Yorkshire teammate, took the score to 347 for 1 after the first day. Hutton was unbeaten on 160 although Australia missed a chance to dismiss him, [[Stump (cricket)#Manner of dismissing a batsman|stumped]], when he had scored 40. After a rest day, the Yorkshire batsmen took their partnership to 382 before Leyland was out. Hutton then shared substantial partnerships with Hammond and [[Joe Hardstaff junior]], taking his personal score to 300 at the end of the second day, out of a total of 634 for five. In the process he surpassed the previous highest Test score by an England batsman in a home match. Hutton maintained  caution  throughout; ''Wisden'' commented that his dominance of the bowling had become slightly monotonous after two days, although it recognised his skill.&lt;ref name=oval38&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/story/151853.html| title = England v Australia 1938| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack| year = 1939| publisher = John Wisden &amp; Co | location = London | accessdate =3 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=oval38card&gt;{{cite web| url = http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/16/16792.html| title = England v Australia in 1938| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate =3 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the third day (23 August), the Australians made a concerted effort to dismiss Hutton before he broke Bradman's 1930 record Ashes score of 334; although the record score in a Test match was Hammond's 336 not out against New Zealand, it was compiled against what was perceived as inferior bowling, and Bradman's total was more prestigious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Hilton  |first = Christopher  |title = Cricket's 300 Men and one 400 man  |publisher = Breedon Books  |year = 2005  |location= Derby | isbn=1-85983-450-7 |pages=37–38}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although showing nerves as he approached the record, Hutton passed Bradman's score with a [[Batting_(cricket)#Cut|cut]] off [[Chuck Fleetwood-Smith]],&lt;ref name=oval38/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Howat, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; and extended his score to 364 before he was out, caught. Lasting for more than 13 hours, Hutton's innings was the longest in first-class cricket at the time. It was only the sixth Test of his career.&lt;ref name=inns/&gt;&lt;ref name=oval38/&gt;&lt;ref name=oval38card/&gt; England eventually scored 903, the highest team total in a Test at that time, before Hammond declared the innings closed. Australia were bowled out twice and England won by an innings and 579 runs to draw the series with one victory apiece.&lt;ref name=oval38card/&gt;

Commentators mainly praised Hutton's concentration and stamina; his slow scoring, particularly when compared to Bradman's innings of 334, was excused on the grounds that the Oval match was played without a time limit, and run accumulation was more important than fast scoring. Furthermore, Hammond had instructed Hutton to bat as long as possible.&lt;ref&gt;Howat, pp. 39–40.&lt;/ref&gt; Among views expressed by Test cricketers, [[Les Ames]] believed that while Hutton had shown great skill, a combination of a very easy wicket for batting and an unusually weak bowling attack presented an ideal opportunity. Former England captain [[Bob Wyatt]] described the innings as one of the greatest feats of concentration and endurance in the history of the game.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, pp. 177–78.&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics expressed distaste at England's approach, but this opinion was not widely shared.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, pp. 257–58.&lt;/ref&gt; In the aftermath of the innings, Hutton became famous,  in constant demand from the public and press who compared him to Bradman. Hutton later described the acclamation he received as one of the worst things that happened to him, not least because expectations were unreasonably high every time he subsequently batted.&lt;ref&gt;Howat, pp. 40–42.&lt;/ref&gt; When the season ended, Hutton had scored 1,874 runs in all matches at an average of 60.45.&lt;ref name=fcbatting/&gt;

===Leading batsman===
From October 1938, Hutton toured South Africa with the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] (MCC)—the name by which England teams toured at the time—under the captaincy of Hammond; England won the series 1–0, with the other four games drawn.{{#tag:ref|Throughout Hutton's career, the MCC organised and administered English cricket.

In a match which set a record aggregate of runs, Hutton scored 38 and 55 but his contributions were overshadowed by the heavy scoring of others.&lt;ref name=inns/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Howat, p. 44&quot;&gt;Howat, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Hutton scored 265 runs in the Test series, at an average of 44.16,&lt;ref name=tbat/&gt; critics were disappointed, expecting more after his record innings of 1938. In all first-class matches, he scored 1,168 runs at an average of 64.88, the highest aggregate among the tourists, and accumulated five centuries. Spectators found his batting attractive and the ''Wisden'' correspondent regarded him the most accomplished batsman on the tour.&lt;ref name=fcbatting/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/story/155219.html| title = The M.C.C. team in South Africa 1938–39| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack| year = 1940| publisher = John Wisden &amp; Co | location = London | accessdate =6 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its summary of the 1939 season, ''Wisden'' noted the development of Hutton into a more exciting batsman to watch, observing that he &quot;gave further evidence of being one of the world's greatest batsmen&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Howat, p. 44&quot;/&gt; He began to dominate opening partnerships with Sutcliffe, in contrast to prior seasons when he was the junior partner.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, p. 174.&lt;/ref&gt; In total, he scored 2,883 runs, over 400 more than any other batsman and his average of 62.27 placed him second in the national averages behind Hammond.&lt;ref name=fcbatting/&gt;&lt;ref name=H45&gt;Howat, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; Among his twelve centuries, Hutton scored his highest total for Yorkshire, 280 not out in six hours against [[Hampshire County Cricket Club|Hampshire]], sharing an opening partnership of 315 with Sutcliffe.&lt;ref name=&quot;H45&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/16/16983.html| title = Yorkshire v Hampshire in 1939|publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate =13 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hutton's contributions helped Yorkshire to their third successive Championship.&lt;ref name=ccposn/&gt; Hutton was also successful in representative matches, scoring 86 for the Players against the Gentlemen,&lt;ref name=figures/&gt; and compiling 480 runs (averaging 96.00) in the Test matches against West Indies.&lt;ref name=tbat/&gt; England won the series, after recording victory in the first match and drawing the others. Hutton scored 196 in the first Test, hitting his last 96 runs in 95 minutes; he and [[Denis Compton]] scored 248 runs together in 133 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/17/17032.html| title = England v West Indies in 1939|publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate =13 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/story/151856.html| title = England v West Indies 1939 (First Test)| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack| year = 1940| publisher = John Wisden &amp; Co | location = London | accessdate =13 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; After low scores in the second Test, Hutton scored 73 and 165 not out in the final game at the Oval.&lt;ref name=inns/&gt; Facing a West Indian lead of 146, Hutton batted five hours in the second innings, sharing a partnership of 264 with Hammond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/story/151858.html| title = England v West Indies 1939 (Third Test)| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack| year = 1940| publisher = John Wisden &amp; Co | location = London | accessdate =13 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hutton ended his season with a century against Sussex in Yorkshire's final match before the war; two days after its conclusion, the Second World War began.&lt;ref&gt;Howat, pp. 48–49.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wartime injury and recovery==
At the beginning of the war, Hutton volunteered for the army and was recruited to the [[Army Physical Training Corps]] as a sergeant-instructor.&lt;ref&gt;Howat, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; Although no first-class cricket was played during the war, league and charity cricket matches continued and Hutton played several high-profile matches in 1940.&lt;ref name=figures/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Howat, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; But in March 1941, his future in cricket was threatened by a serious injury. On the last day of a commando training course in York, Hutton fell in the gymnasium when a mat slipped from under him. He suffered a fractured left forearm and dislocated his [[ulna]] at the wrist. By the summer, surgery and rest initially looked to have repaired the injury; Hutton returned to his unit and resumed cricket, scoring a century in one game. However, he began to suffer increasing pain and underwent more surgery to graft bone from his legs onto the injured arm. A first operation failed, but the second attempt at the end of 1941 eventually proved successful.&lt;ref&gt;Howat, pp. 53–54.&lt;/ref&gt; Hutton was discharged from the army in the summer of 1942 and after a period of recovery he began work as a civilian for the [[Corps of Royal Engineers|Royal Engineers]], inspecting the condition of government-owned properties. However, the surgery left him with a left arm almost two inches shorter than the right.&lt;ref&gt;Howat, pp. 54–55.&lt;/ref&gt; His subsequent recovery and return to cricket was closely followed by the wartime press, which kept track of many pre-war cricketers.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, p. 268.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hutton resumed professional cricket with Pudsey St Lawrence in 1943, briefly captaining the team before poor results and a disagreement with the committee led him to resign the captaincy. He played for Pudsey until 1945, batting successfully and helping the team to the Priestley Cup, but his relationship with the club remained strained and he did not play for them again after 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Howat, pp. 56–59.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=H63/&gt; When the war ended in 1945, a programme of first-class matches was organised, involving counties and other teams. A series of matches was played between England and an [[Australian Services cricket team]], called [[Victory Tests]] although they were not official Test matches.&lt;ref name=H61&gt;Howat, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; Hutton played in all three games with mixed success. He scored 46 in the second match, but was struck painfully on his weak arm by a short ball from [[Keith Miller]], whom he encountered for the first time.&lt;ref name=H61/&gt; After scoring 81 for Yorkshire against the Australian team,  Hutton scored 104 and 69 in the final &quot;Test&quot;. Another century followed for Yorkshire against the Australians,&lt;ref&gt;Howat, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; taking his first-class run aggregate to 782 runs at an average of 48.87 in nine games.&lt;ref name=fcbatting/&gt; Commentators were satisfied that his batting technique remained effective and that he could still succeed at the highest level.&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/story/155337.html| title = Len Hutton (Obituary)| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack| year = 1991| publisher = John Wisden &amp; Co | location = London | accessdate =18 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The showpiece match of the season was England against the Dominions at Lord's, but Hutton was prevented from appearing by his commitments to Pudsey.&lt;ref name=H63&gt;Howat, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career after the war==
===First tour to Australia===
County cricket fully resumed in 1946. Hutton was troubled by his injury; his wrists no longer rotated fully and he abandoned the [[hook shot]].&lt;ref name=Wis46/&gt;&lt;ref name=H46&gt;Howat, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, he scored 1,552 runs at an average of 48.50,&lt;ref name=fcbatting/&gt; and was recognised by ''Wisden'' as Yorkshire's most effective batsman as the county won their fourth consecutive championship title.&lt;ref name=Wis46&gt;{{Cite book| title = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack| year = 1947| publisher = John Wisden &amp; Co| chapter = Yorkshire in 1946| page = 486}}&lt;/ref&gt; His four centuries included 183 not out against the touring Indian team,&lt;ref name=H66&gt;Howat, p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; but he was less successful in the three Tests, scoring 123 runs at an average of 30.75.&lt;ref name=tbat/&gt; England won the series 1–0 but Hutton's only fifty was a defensive innings in the second Test, when he was troubled by a bad back.&lt;ref name=inns/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/story/152869.html| title = England v India 1946| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack| year = 1947| publisher = John Wisden &amp; Co | location = London | accessdate =22 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was omitted from the Gentlemen and Players match, but was part of the [[MCC tour of Australia in 1946–47|MCC team touring party]] for the 1946–47 tour of Australia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Howat, p. 67&quot;&gt;Howat, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

The MCC were reluctant to tour so soon after the war, but the Australian authorities were insistent. The tourists, led once more by Wally Hammond, were beaten 3–0 in the Test series, finding their opponents much stronger than expected.&lt;ref name=MCC46&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/story/152882.html| title = M.C.C. team in Australia and New Zealand, 1946–47| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack| year = 1948| publisher = John Wisden &amp; Co | location = London | accessdate =22 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hutton began the tour well,&lt;ref name=H68&gt;Howat, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; scoring two early centuries, the latter of which was described by ''Wisden'' as the best English innings of the tour.&lt;ref name=figures/&gt;&lt;ref name=MCC46/&gt; A string of other good performances drew praise from press and former players; one such report named him the best batsman in the world.&lt;ref name=H68/&gt; However, Hutton failed to reach a score of 50 runs in the first three Tests; in the first, he was out for a first ball [[Duck (cricket)|duck]],&lt;ref name=inns/&gt; and in the second, a short ball from Keith Miller struck him on his injured arm. However, in the latter game, he scored 37 in the second innings, frequently [[Drive (cricket)|driving]] the bowling of Miller and [[Fred Freer]] before the bat slipped from his hand and hit the wicket, ending the innings. Even so, the display was praised by critics.&lt;ref&gt;Howat, pp. 69–70.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/story/152884.html| title = England v Australia 1946–47 (Second Test)| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack| year = 1948| publisher = John Wisden &amp; Co | location = London | accessdate =23 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the final two Tests, Hutton shared three consecutive century opening partnerships with [[Cyril Washbrook]].&lt;ref name=MCC46/&gt; A four-hour 94 in the first innings was followed by 76 in the second.&lt;ref name=inns/&gt; Press opinion was divided over Hutton's performance; some critics, including the Australian bowlers, detected insecurity against fast bowling, particularly the bouncers with which [[Ray Lindwall]] and Miller targeted him.&lt;ref name=H71&gt;Howat, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; Hutton's preferred tactic of ducking under the ball reinforced the impression that he was afraid.&lt;ref name=H71/&gt;&lt;ref name=Jenkins&gt;{{cite web| last = Jenkins | first = V.

''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' criticised the high number of short balls bowled by the Australian pacemen, bowled at Hutton as often as three times per [[Over (cricket)|over]].&lt;ref name=H72&gt;Howat, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; However, after the second day was rained off, Hutton was taken ill overnight with [[tonsillitis]], missed the remainder of the match and flew home soon after.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/story/152887.html| title = England v Australia 1946–47 (Fifth Test)| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack| year = 1948| publisher = John Wisden &amp; Co | location = London | accessdate =25 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In all first-class matches on tour, Hutton scored 1,267 runs at an average of 70.38,&lt;ref name=fcbatting/&gt; while in the Tests, he managed 417 runs at an average of 52.12;&lt;ref name=tbat/&gt; he topped both sets of averages.&lt;ref name=H72/&gt; ''Wisden'' noted that it took him time to find form in the Tests, but that he often batted well despite ill health.&lt;ref name=MCC46/&gt; Bill Bowes, covering the tour as a journalist, believed that Hutton was unable to master bowling faster than he had encountered for eight years, but acquitted himself reasonably well.&lt;ref&gt;Bowes, p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Series against South Africa and West Indies===
Hutton's tonsils were removed before the start of the 1947 season but his poor health continued, forcing him to miss some games at the start of the season. Nevertheless, his form remained good and he scored four centuries in early matches.&lt;ref&gt;Howat, pp. 72–73&lt;/ref&gt; However, Yorkshire dropped to equal seventh in the County Championship, affected by the retirement of key players and the frequent loss of Hutton to representative cricket.&lt;ref name=ccposn/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Howat, pp. 73–74.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Test matches Hutton did not initially score heavily. His highest innings after three Tests was only 24 runs,&lt;ref name=inns/&gt; and critics called his place into question.&lt;ref name=h73&gt;Howat, p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to form during the fourth Test, his first at Headingley, with a four-and-a-half hour century on a difficult pitch for batting.&lt;ref name=inns/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/story/152880.html| title = England v South Africa 1947 (Fourth Test)| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack| year = 1948| publisher = John Wisden &amp; Co | location = London | accessdate =31 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hutton scored 83 and 36 in the drawn final Test,&lt;ref name=inns/&gt; and England won the series 3–0 with the other two games drawn. Hutton hit 344 runs in the Test series at an average of 44.00;&lt;ref name=tbat/&gt; in all first-class matches, he scored eleven centuries and totalled 2,585 runs at an average 64.62,&lt;ref name=fcbatting/&gt; although his achievements that season were overshadowed by those of [[Denis Compton]] and Bill Edrich, who both broke the previous record for most runs scored in a season.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

After 16 months of continuous cricket, Hutton chose to miss the 1947–48 winter MCC tour of the West Indies. However, injuries severely affected that team, and its captain [[Gubby Allen]] requested reinforcements. Subsequently, Hutton flew out to join the tour;&lt;ref&gt;Howat, pp. 74–75.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mcc47/48&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/story/152899.html| title = M.C.C. in West Indies, 1947–48| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack| year = 1949| publisher = John Wisden &amp; Co | location = London | accessdate =31 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately after he arrived, having travelled for four days, Hutton played against British Guiana, scoring 138 and 62 not out,&lt;ref name=figures/&gt;&lt;ref name=h75&gt;Howat, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; before appearing in the third Test.&lt;ref name=inns/&gt; After a century against Jamaica,&lt;ref name=figures/&gt; Hutton played innings of 56 and 60 in the fourth and final Test, giving him 171 runs at an average of 42.75 in the series.&lt;ref name=inns/&gt;&lt;ref name=tbat/&gt; He came top of the first-class averages for the tourists, with 578 runs at an average of 64.22, and was judged by ''Wisden'' as one of the few batting successes in a team which lost the four-Test series 2–0 and failed to win a single match on tour.&lt;ref name=fcbatting/&gt;&lt;ref name=mcc47/48/&gt;

===Struggles against pace===
During 1948, Hutton scored heavily for Yorkshire. Despite missing more than half the County Championship matches, he scored more runs at a better average than anyone else in the side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://cricketarchive.com/Yorkshire/Seasons/Seasonal_Averages/1948_f_Batting_by_Average.html| title = First-class Batting and Fielding for Yorkshire in 1948| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate =8 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In county matches, Hutton averaged 92.05 and scored eight centuries. Some Yorkshire critics expressed concern at the team's dependence on Hutton and the poor performance of other batsmen.&lt;ref&gt;Howat, p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; Hutton's main challenge that season came from the [[Australian cricket team in England in 1948|Australian side]] which toured England undefeated and won the Test series 4–0. In the early part of the tour, the Australians, and particularly the pace bowlers Lindwall and Miller, tried to shake Hutton's confidence by targeting him.&lt;ref name=H77&gt;Howat, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Perry|first=Roland|authorlink=Roland Perry|title=Miller's Luck: the life and loves of Keith Miller, Australia's greatest all-rounder|year=2005|publisher=Random House|location=Sydney|isbn=9781741662221|location=Milsons Point, New South Wales|page=229}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Hutton failed on a difficult pitch in Yorkshire's match against the tourists, he was the only successful batsman against them when he appeared for MCC shortly after.&lt;ref&gt;Fingleton, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fingleton, p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hutton was selected for the first Test, but England were overwhelmed by the Australian fast bowlers and lost the match.&lt;ref name=1st48&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/story/152894.html| title = England v Australia 1948 (First Test)| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack| year = 1949| publisher = John Wisden &amp; Co | location = London | accessdate =10 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a failure in the first innings,&lt;ref name=inns/&gt; Hutton scored 74 in the second,&lt;ref name=inns/&gt; and briefly established dominance over Miller,&lt;ref&gt;Fingleton, pp. 82–83, 95–97.&lt;/ref&gt; who responded with a series of bouncers, one of which struck Hutton on the shoulder and provoked an angry reaction from the crowd. Miller [[Dismissal_(cricket)#Law_30:_Bowled|bowled]] him in very poor light at the start of the fourth day's play.&lt;ref name=1st48/&gt; At Lord's in the second Test, also lost by England, Hutton scored 20 and 13,&lt;ref name=inns/&gt; but of more concern to critics was the manner in which he batted. In the second innings, England had to bat for a long time to save the game, ''Wisden'' noted that Hutton, in contrast to his opening partner Washbrook, looked &quot;plainly uncomfortable&quot;.&lt;ref name=2nd48&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/story/152895.html| title = England v Australia 1948 (Second Test)| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack| year = 1949| publisher = John Wisden &amp; Co | location = London | accessdate =10 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was nearly dismissed several times before he was out for 13, and returned to the pavilion to an uncomfortable silence from the crowd.&lt;ref name=F117/&gt;&lt;ref name=O74/&gt; The former Australian batsman [[Jack Fingleton]], covering the tour as a journalist, described it as Hutton's worst effort in a Test.&lt;ref name=F117&gt;Fingleton, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bill O'Reilly (cricketer)|Bill O'Reilly]], another former Australian player working as a journalist, said Hutton seemed to be struggling with concentration and was a shadow of his former self.&lt;ref name=O74&gt;{{cite book |last=O'Reilly |first=W.

Following his struggles at Lord's, Hutton was omitted from the team for the third Test. Observers had noticed Hutton backing away from the fast bowlers, which the English selectors saw as a poor example from a leading batsman.&lt;ref name=G189&gt;Gibson, p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bowes190&gt;Bowes, p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt; The decision generated considerable acrimony, but surprised and pleased the Australians, who felt Hutton was their most formidable opponent with the bat.&lt;ref name=F120&gt;Fingleton, p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Roland |last=Perry| authorlink=Roland Perry| title=Bradman's best: Sir Donald Bradman's selection of the best team in cricket history|year=2001 |publisher= [[Random House|Random House Australia]] |isbn=0-09184-051-1|location=Milsons Point, New South Wales|page=224}}&lt;/ref&gt; Press and critics generally judged the decision a mistake,&lt;ref name=H77/&gt; although the ''Wisden'' correspondent believed the decision to be correct as Hutton benefited from a break.&lt;ref name=48report&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/story/155254.html| title = Australians in England, 1948| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack| year = 1949| publisher = John Wisden &amp; Co | location = London | accessdate =11 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In later years, [[Norman Yardley]], the England captain, agreed that the decision was a poor one.&lt;ref name=M143/&gt; Hutton escaped most of the debate by playing in Scotland for Yorkshire before returning to captain the Players against the Gentlemen at Lord's, where he scored 59 and 132 not out.&lt;ref name=figures/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Howat, pp. 77–78.&lt;/ref&gt; However, he found the situation unsettling and Patrick Murphy, a sports journalist, writes that it &quot;served to drive a reserved man further in on himself.&quot;&lt;ref name=M143/&gt;

Recalled to the England team for the fourth Test at Headingley, Hutton scored 81 and 57.&lt;ref name=inns/&gt; Given an excellent reception by his home crowd, he shared a century opening partnership with Washbrook in both innings, the second time they had accomplished this feat.&lt;ref&gt;Fingleton, pp. 140–41.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=4th48&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/story/152897.html| title = England v Australia 1948 (Fourth Test)| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack| year = 1949| publisher = John Wisden &amp; Co | location = London | accessdate =11 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics considered Hutton to be a better batsmen when he returned and that these innings repaired his damaged reputation.&lt;ref name=G189/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Howat, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; Australia needed 404 to win on a pitch favouring spin, but the poor performances of the main bowlers allowed Australia to record a seven wicket win described by ''Wisden'' as &quot;astonishing&quot;.&lt;ref name=4th48/&gt; Hutton's contribution to the second Australian innings was to bowl four overs and concede 30 runs.&lt;ref name=figures/&gt; Australia's dominance in the series was sealed by a crushing win in the fifth Test.

===Leading batsman again===
Hutton toured South Africa in the winter of 1948–49 with the MCC under the captaincy of [[George Mann (cricketer)|George Mann]].

===Australia 1950–51===

Hutton was chosen to go on the [[MCC tour of Australia in 1950-51|MCC tour of Australia in 1950–51]], under the captaincy of the [[Amateur status in first-class cricket|amateur]] [[Freddie Brown (cricketer)|Freddie Brown]].

Australia in turn struggled to 32 for seven, before declaring to leave England needing 193 to win. By the end of the third day's play, victory seemed unlikely as England were 30 for six.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/19/19560.html | title = Australia v England in 1950/51| publisher = CricketArchive | accessdate =19 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=50T1&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/story/152956.html| title = England v Australia 1950–51 (First Test)| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack| year = 1952| publisher = John Wisden &amp; Co | location = London | accessdate =19 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Next morning on a slightly easier pitch, Hutton scored 62 not out, an innings which was widely acclaimed in the press.&lt;ref name=H94&gt;Howat, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Wisden'' observed that he had &quot;given yet another exhibition of his wonderful batsmanship on tricky turf ...

Hutton remained in the middle order for the second Test, which England lost by 28 runs,&lt;ref name=H95&gt;Howat, p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/story/152957.html| title = England v Australia 1950–51 (Second Test)| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack| year = 1952| publisher = John Wisden &amp; Co | location = London | accessdate =21 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; but resumed his role as opener for the rest of the tour and scored a century in the following state game.&lt;ref name=H95/&gt; Hutton scored 62 in the third Test, but the Australian spinner [[Jack Iverson]], who caused the touring batsmen huge problems all series, bowled Australia to victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/story/152958.html| title = England v Australia 1950–51 (Third Test)| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack| year = 1952| publisher = John Wisden &amp; Co | location = London | accessdate =21 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hutton's form continued in the fourth Test as he carried his bat for the second time in six months.

Reviewing the tour, ''Wisden'' stated, &quot;With Hutton, figures did not lie. He stood head and shoulders above every other batsman and, taking all factors into consideration, worthily earned the description of the finest present-day batsman in the world.&quot;&lt;ref name=50tour/&gt;

===100th century===
Hutton scored 2,145 runs in 1951 with nine centuries, including his 100th in first-class cricket.&lt;ref name=fcbatting/&gt; The South Africans toured England, losing the Test series 3–1. After Hutton scored fifty in the first Test, which was won by South Africa,&lt;ref name=inns/&gt; his 100th century almost came during the third Test, when he scored an unbeaten 98 in the second innings to take England to victory. But the innings provoked controversy when Hutton's team-mates seemed to decline easy runs to allow Hutton the opportunity to reach his hundred before the end of the match, thereby jeopardising England's chances of victory in unsettled weather.&lt;ref name=inns/&gt;&lt;ref name=H100&gt;Howat, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/story/152952.html| title = England v South Africa 1951 (Third Test)| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack| year = 1952| publisher = John Wisden &amp; Co | location = London | accessdate =18 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 100th century came a week later, against Surrey, when Hutton became the thirteenth player to achieve the landmark. He followed this immediately with 194 not out against [[Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club|Nottinghamshire]] and 100, in the drawn fourth Test at Headlingley.&lt;ref name=inns/&gt;&lt;ref name=H101&gt;Howat, p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt; In the final Test, which England won to take the series, Hutton became the first man in Tests, and only the fourth in all first-class cricket, to be given out [[obstructing the field]]: he edged a ball in the air and legitimately knocked it away from his wickets with his bat; in doing so, he prevented a catch being taken and was given out.&lt;ref&gt;Howat, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; This remains the only such instance in Tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/records/275285.html| title = Unusual dismissals | publisher = ESPNCricinfo | accessdate =22 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hutton ended the Test series with 378 runs at an average of 54.00.&lt;ref name=tbat/&gt; Late in the season, he scored a century against Gloucestershire to become the second Yorkshire player after Sutcliffe to complete centuries against the other 16 first-class counties.&lt;ref&gt;Chalke and Hodgson, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Captain of England==
{{Main|Len Hutton as England captain}}

===Appointment===
Brown's resignation from the captaincy of England at the end of 1951 left no obvious replacement candidate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gibson, p. 184&quot;/&gt; Traditionally, captains in county or Test cricket were amateurs, who usually came from privileged backgrounds, in contrast to professionals, who often came from the [[working class]]es. Consequently, class distinction pervaded cricket which was organised and administered by former and current amateurs,&lt;ref&gt;Birley, pp. 105–6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  |last = Ryder  |first = Rowland  |title = Cricket Calling  |publisher = Faber and Faber  |year = 1995  |location= London  |isbn = 0571174760|pages = 175, 179}}&lt;/ref&gt; many of whom reasoned that professionals would not make good captains owing to their worries over safeguarding their contracts or concerns about affecting the livelihoods of other professionals.&lt;ref name=wisden&gt;{{Cite web|last= Caine | first= Stewart | Cite web| url = http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/story/151713.html| title = Notes by the Editor| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack| year = 1928| publisher = John Wisden &amp; Co | location = London | accessdate =22 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; But in 1952, the selectors judged that none of the serving amateur county captains possessed the required ability or experience to fill the role of England captain. Consequently, the selectors decided to radically depart from tradition and appoint a professional captain.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gibson, p. 184&quot;&gt;Gibson, p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt; All previous England captains in home Test matches had been amateurs, and no professional had captained England in any match in the 20th century. However, as widely anticipated by the press, Hutton was appointed to captain England in the first Test of a four-match series against the 1952 Indian tourists. He harboured private doubts whether the cricket establishment would accept a professional captain, but declined to turn amateur, as Wally Hammond had done in 1938.&lt;ref name=&quot;Murphy, p. 145&quot;&gt;Murphy, p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Howat, pp. 105–07.&lt;/ref&gt; The decision met with broad approval from the press, and the editor of ''Wisden'' wrote: &quot;In breaking with tradition and choosing a professional as captain the Selection Committee made a vital decision in the interests of England, because it should mean that in future no man will be picked as leader unless he is worth a place in the side.&quot;&lt;ref name=ed53&gt;{{cite web| last = Preston | first = Norman |url = http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/story/152967.html| title = Notes by the Editor| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack| year = 1953| publisher = John Wisden &amp; Co | location = London | accessdate =20 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Howat, p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt; Hutton had not expected to be asked and had thought an amateur would have been appointed as usual.&lt;ref name=Marshall159&gt;Marshall, p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt; He presumed his appointment was an interim measure until a more suitable candidate could be found.&lt;ref name=Birley283&gt;Birley, p. 283.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before his home crowd at Headingley, Hutton's first match as captain was a success, although his tactics were cautious.&lt;ref name=ed53/&gt; The ''Wisden'' correspondent wrote: &quot;For Hutton the match was a personal triumph. Tradition had been broken&amp;nbsp;... and he must have known that the eyes of the world were upon him.

In the final two Tests, Hutton scored 104 and 86 and his bowlers dominated the Indian batsmen. The drawn final Test was ruined by weather, but England won the four match series 3–0,&lt;ref name=H108&gt;Howat, p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt; and Hutton scored 399 runs at an average of 79.80; in the whole summer he scored 2,567 first-class runs at an average of 61.11 with eleven centuries.&lt;ref name=fcbatting/&gt;

===Ashes victory===
During the 1953 season, Australia toured England having held the Ashes since 1934 but critics considered England to have a good chance of winning the series.&lt;ref name=ed53/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Howat, p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; Hutton was retained as England captain initially on a match-by-match basis.&lt;ref name=H114&gt;Howat, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; However, his health was uncertain and he was troubled by [[Fibromyalgia|fibrositis]] which restricted his movement and adversely affected his fielding.&lt;ref name=H112-13&gt;Howat, pp. 112–13.&lt;/ref&gt; He top-scored in both England innings with 43 and 60 not out in the drawn first Test,&lt;ref name=inns/&gt;&lt;ref name=H112-13/&gt; and batted effectively for Yorkshire against the Australians.

The fourth Test, in front of Hutton's home crowd, was his least successful of the series. He was bowled second ball by a [[yorker]] from Lindwall and England struggled to remain competitive throughout the match. In the fourth innings of the game, Australia needed 177 runs to win, with 115 minutes of play remaining. However, Hutton's negative tactics, including time-wasting and [[leg theory]] bowling, meant Australia could not score the runs in the available time and the match was drawn.&lt;ref name=inns/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/story/152567.html| title = England v Australia 1953 (Fourth Test)| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack| year = 1954| publisher = John Wisden &amp; Co | location = London | accessdate =24 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Australian press criticised Hutton for his negativity, but English critics believed the tactics were justified.&lt;ref&gt;Howat, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; Amid great public interest for the deciding fifth Test, Hutton lost his fifth successive toss but replying to Australia's first innings of 275, England established a narrow first-innings lead.

===Captain in the West Indies===
In the winter of 1953–54, Hutton led the MCC on a tour of West Indies.&lt;ref name=H126&gt;Howat, p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt; Before the team left England, critics queried Hutton's appointment, arguing that a professional captain was unsuitable to lead a tour.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gibson, p. 184&quot;/&gt; Hutton's authority was also compromised by the MCC, who did not give Hutton the tour manager he requested;&lt;ref name=G185-6&gt;Gibson, pp. 185–86.&lt;/ref&gt; instead, they appointed the inexperienced [[Charles Palmer (cricketer)|Charles Palmer]], the Leicestershire captain, who had already been selected as a player on the tour.&lt;ref name=Sw148&gt;Swanton, p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt; Palmer's dual role as player and manager blurred the lines of command between him and Hutton.&lt;ref name=G185-6/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Howat, pp. 140–41.&lt;/ref&gt; Hutton also found some of the professionals in the team to be difficult to lead, particularly [[Godfrey Evans]],&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Fred Trueman]].&lt;ref name=H140&gt;Howat, p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt; Off-field events often overshadowed the cricket. Amid growing independence movements in the region, Hutton believed his team was used as a political instrument to support colonial rule.&lt;ref&gt;Howat, pp. 125–26.&lt;/ref&gt; The situation was further inflamed as journalists and English residents in the Caribbean placed great emphasis on an English victory, and the perception was that the series would establish the unofficial world champions.&lt;ref name=WI53&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/story/155235.html| title = The M.C.C. team in the West Indies, 1953–54| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack| year = 1955| publisher = John Wisden &amp; Co | location = London | accessdate =29 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The standards of local umpiring were a further source of controversy.&lt;ref name=WI53/&gt; The crowds often made noisy protests about on-field events, often related to umpiring. The climax came in the third Test when missiles were thrown onto the outfield when the umpire judged [[Cliff McWatt]] was out; Hutton kept his team and the umpires on the field, possibly defusing a dangerous situation.&lt;ref name=G185&gt;Gibson, p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Howat, p. 131&quot;&gt;Howat, p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt; The attitude of some English players inflamed feelings, either through a perceived lack of courtesy,&lt;ref&gt;Howat, pp. 129, 137–38.&lt;/ref&gt; or their negative reactions to events on the field.&lt;ref name=WI53/&gt; Some critics held Hutton responsible for this,&lt;ref name=WI53/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Howat, pp. 129–30, 140.&lt;/ref&gt; but the editor of ''Wisden'' later wrote: &quot;[Hutton] was involved in the most thankless task any cricket captain has undertaken when he went to West Indies. Instead of finding a friendly cricket atmosphere he and his players were subjected to the impact of deep political and racial feeling—an experience all of them wish to forget. A few members of the team did not hide their innermost feelings, with the result that Hutton came under severe criticism, although his behaviour was blameless.&quot;&lt;ref name=Ed55&gt;{{cite web | last = Preston | first = Norman | url = http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/story/150218.html| title = Notes by the Editor | work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack| year = 1955| publisher = John Wisden &amp; Co | location = London | accessdate =4 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hutton wanted to exploit what he saw as a West Indian weakness against pace, picking four fast bowlers for the first Test. However, he misjudged the pitch; West Indies made a large score and won by 140 runs. Both captains employed time-wasting tactics in the match, and used negative [[leg theory]] bowling, outside [[Stump (cricket)|leg stump]].&lt;ref name=WIT1&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/story/152582.html| title = West Indies v England 1953–54 (First Test)| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack| year = 1955| publisher = John Wisden &amp; Co | location = London | accessdate =30 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Howat, p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt; In the second Test, Hutton scored 72 and 77 but could not prevent another defeat after losing his seventh consecutive toss in Tests.

Hutton lost the toss but his bowlers dismissed West Indies cheaply in good batting conditions. Hutton then batted for almost nine hours to score 205, his nineteenth and final Test century. ''Wisden'' observed that &quot;For concentration and control, Hutton's innings ... scarcely could have been excelled.&quot;&lt;ref name=inns/&gt;&lt;ref name=WIT5&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/story/152586.html| title = West Indies v England 1953–54 (Fifth Test)| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack| year = 1955| publisher = John Wisden &amp; Co | location = London | accessdate =4 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; England's bowlers bowled out West Indies a second time and England scored the required runs to record a series-levelling victory, West Indies' first defeat in Jamaica in a Test.&lt;ref name=WIT5/&gt; In its summary of the tour, ''Wisden'' said that Hutton showed mastery over every bowler. The correspondent wrote, &quot;From first to last no batsman compared with Hutton ... Considering the weight of his many responsibilities and worries, Hutton played magnificent cricket&quot;.&lt;ref name=WI53/&gt; The press were generally supportive despite reservations over his caution.&lt;ref&gt;Howat, pp. 142–44.&lt;/ref&gt; Swanton and Alan Gibson later credited England's recovery in the series to Hutton's batting and leadership.&lt;ref name=Sw148/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, pp. 184–85.&lt;/ref&gt; In five Tests, he scored 677 runs, his highest in a series, at an average of 96.71, the highest on either side.&lt;ref name=tbat/&gt;&lt;ref name=WI53/&gt;  In all first-class matches, he made 780 runs at an average of 78.00.&lt;ref name=fcbatting/&gt;

===Appointment of Sheppard===
Hutton missed large parts of the 1954 season on medical advice, suffering from mental and physical exhaustion brought about by the West Indian tour.&lt;ref name=Sw148/&gt;&lt;ref name=H146&gt;Howat, pp. 146–48.&lt;/ref&gt; He played in the first Test against Pakistan, on their first tour of England, scored a duck and missed the next two matches.&lt;ref name=H146/&gt; In Hutton's absence, the selectors appointed the amateur [[David Sheppard]], a theology student at the time; Sheppard achieved little batting success, but England won the two Tests in which he was captain.&lt;ref name=H146/&gt; According to ''Wisden'' editor [[Norman Preston]], influential figures within the cricket hierarchy blamed Hutton for the previous winter's events and they attempted to replace Hutton as captain.&lt;ref name=Ed55&gt;{{cite web | last = Preston | first = Norman | url = http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/story/152594.html| title = Notes by the Editor | work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack| year = 1956| publisher = John Wisden &amp; Co | location = London | accessdate =4 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two former England cricketers, [[Errol Holmes]] and [[Walter Robins]], the latter also a selector that year, favoured Sheppard over Hutton and persuaded him to offer his candidacy to captain the MCC in Australia that winter. Sheppard indicated he would accept the post and take a leave of absence from his studies if required.&lt;ref name=H146/&gt;&lt;ref name=G186&gt;Gibson, pp. 186–87.&lt;/ref&gt; The press speculated that Hutton would step aside,&lt;ref name=H146/&gt; but most newspapers favoured Hutton's continued leadership and ran stories alleging MCC prejudice against professional cricketers. Neither Hutton nor Sheppard publicly expressed an opinion, although Hutton informed the MCC he would tour Australia as captain or player as required, and both men remained on good personal terms throughout.{{#tag:ref|Following Hutton's death in 1990, Sheppard, then the Bishop of Liverpool, gave the address at a memorial service at York Minster.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;|group=notes}}&lt;ref name=G186/&gt; Robins, seeing the strength of opinion, backed down. When Hutton returned to cricket in July, scoring two centuries, he was appointed captain of the MCC for the winter tour. Returning to captain a slightly weakened team for the fourth and final Test, Hutton failed with the bat, and Pakistan recorded their first Test victory.&lt;ref name=G186/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/story/153886.html| title = England v Pakistan 1954 | work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack| year = 1956| publisher = John Wisden &amp; Co | location = London | accessdate =4 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his three Test innings of the season, Hutton scored just 19 runs.&lt;ref name=inns/&gt; Owing to his reduced appearances, Hutton failed to reach 1,000 first-class runs for the first time since 1936, reaching 912 runs at an average of 35.07.&lt;ref name=fcbatting/&gt;

===Captain in Australia===
{{Main|English cricket team in Australia in 1954–55}}
Expectations before the Australian tour were low after the confusion of the 1954 summer and some controversial selections.&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wis55/&gt; Trueman, [[Jim Laker]] and [[Tony Lock]], part of the winning 1953 team, were omitted,&lt;ref name=&quot;Aus omissions&quot;/&gt; and [[Colin Cowdrey]] and [[Vic Wilson (cricketer)|Vic Wilson]] were included.&lt;ref name=&quot;Controversial selections&quot;/&gt; Hutton further downplayed his team's chances through deliberately exaggerating its inexperience when talking to an Australian press already sympathetic to Hutton as a professional captain of a class-driven country.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt; The team began the tour well and Hutton made a series of good scores in the opening games.&lt;ref name=Wis55&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/story/152600.html| title = M.C.C. in Australia and New Zealand, 1954–55| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack| year = 1956| publisher = John Wisden &amp; Co | location = London | accessdate =5 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Howat, p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt; But for the first Test, Hutton did not include a spinner in the team and chose to bowl on winning the toss, an unusual strategy in Australia. Australia scored 601, England dropped 12 catches and, with the key players Evans and Compton injured, lost by an innings; the press blamed Hutton for choosing to bowl.&lt;ref name=1T55&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/story/152601.html| title = Hutton's gamble backfires| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack| year = 1956| publisher = John Wisden &amp; Co | location = London | accessdate =7 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Howat, p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the result, Hutton saw potential in [[Frank Tyson]]'s bowling and arranged for [[Alf Gover]], a respected coach who was in Australia as a journalist, to improve and shorten Tyson's run to the wicket.&lt;ref&gt;Howat, p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt; For the second Test, Hutton left out the unfit Alec Bedser, England's most reliable bowler since the war, to include two spinners,&lt;ref name=Wis55/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Howat, p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt; but in a low-scoring game, Tyson made the difference and England won by 38 runs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/story/152602.html| title = England v Australia 1954–55 (second Test) | work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack| year = 1956| publisher = John Wisden &amp; Co | location = London | accessdate =8 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unwell before the third Test, suffering from fibrositis and a heavy cold, Hutton decided to play at the last minute and unexpectedly left out Bedser again, although he was fit to play. Hutton neglected to inform Bedser, who only learned of his omission when he saw the team list displayed in the dressing room before the match.&lt;ref&gt;Howat, pp. 156–57.&lt;/ref&gt; Hutton contributed few runs, but Cowdrey and [[Peter May]] made large scores and Tyson took seven wickets as Australia were bowled out for 111 in their second innings, giving England a 128-run victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/21/21392.html| title = Australia v England in 1954/55 (third Test)| publisher = CricketArchive | accessdate =8 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/story/152603.html| title = England v Australia 1954–55 (third Test) | work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack| year = 1956| publisher = John Wisden &amp; Co | location = London | accessdate =8 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fourth Test was crucial, and Hutton's innings of 80 runs in four-and-a-half hours was the highest of the game.&lt;ref name=4Tsc&gt;{{cite web | url = http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/21/21427.html| title = Australia v England in 1954/55 (fourth Test)| publisher = CricketArchive | accessdate =11 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Wisden'' believed Hutton's tactics were instrumental in giving his team the upper hand,&lt;ref name=4T55&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/story/152604.html| title = England v Australia 1954–55 (fourth Test) | work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack| year = 1956| publisher = John Wisden &amp; Co | location = London | accessdate =11 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the final innings, England needed 94 to win and retain the Ashes. Early wickets, including Hutton's, fell to Miller,&lt;ref name=4Tsc/&gt; and when the captain returned to the dressing room, he said that Miller had &quot;done us again.&quot; Compton, the next man in, replied &quot;I haven't been in yet&quot;, and stayed at the wicket until the match was won by five wickets. Many commentators viewed this as a sign that Hutton's reserve had slipped in the critical situation, but Alan Gibson believes it was a deliberate ploy to inspire Compton.&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; England went on to draw the final Test in a match ruined by rain. Hutton was out to the fourth ball of the match, but Australia were forced to follow on for the first time by England since 1938, and Hutton took a wicket with the last ball of the match before time ran out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/story/152605.html| title = England v Australia 1954–55 (fifth Test) | work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack| year = 1956| publisher = John Wisden &amp; Co | location = London | accessdate =11 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ended the series, which England won 3–1.&lt;ref name=Wis55/&gt;

Hutton's tactical approach in the series was praised by Australian and English commentators; they noted how Hutton observed his opponents carefully to spot weaknesses. His caution was criticised, but the main complaint was that he deliberately slowed the speed of play, reducing the number of overs bowled, allowing the fast bowlers to rest and restricting the rate at which Australia scored.&lt;ref&gt;Howat, pp. 162–64.&lt;/ref&gt; With the bat, Hutton scored 220 runs in Tests at an average of 24.44. In all first-class matches in Australia, he scored 959 runs at 50.47.&lt;ref name=fcbatting/&gt;&lt;ref name=tbat/&gt; The tour ended with two Tests in New Zealand; England won the first by eight wickets,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/21/21451.html| title = New Zealand v England in 1954/55 (first Test)| publisher = CricketArchive | accessdate =11 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the second by an innings and 20 runs. New Zealand were bowled out for 26 in their second innings, which, in 2012, remains the lowest Test score.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/records/145832.html | title = Test matches records: Lowest innings totals | publisher = ESPNCricinfo | accessdate =11 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the latter match, Hutton scored 53 batting at number five in his final Test innings.&lt;ref name=inns/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/21/21454.html| title = New Zealand v England in 1954/55 (second Test)| publisher = CricketArchive | accessdate =11 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had played in 79 Test matches, scoring 6,971 runs at an average of 56.67 with 19 hundreds.&lt;ref name=profile/&gt; As England captain in 23 matches, he won eight Tests and lost four,&lt;ref name=G189/&gt; and along with [[Percy Chapman]] was the only England captain to win consecutive series against Australia.&lt;ref name=G190/&gt;

===Retirement===
On Hutton's return to England, he was made an honorary member of the MCC, which changed its rules to allow a current professional to join the club. The selectors appointed him England captain for the entire forthcoming series against South Africa, a rare indication of confidence.{{#tag:ref|Usually, captains were appointed for one or two matches; the only previous captain to be appointed for a whole summer was [[C. B. Fry]] in 1912.&lt;ref name=H166-7&gt;Howat, pp. 166–67.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=notes}}&lt;ref name=H166-7/&gt; However, Hutton's form was poor at the start of the season. He captained MCC against the tourists, but withdrew from the final day of the match with lumbago and his uncertain health led him to resign the England captaincy. The selectors made Peter May captain in his place and appointed Hutton as a selector.&lt;ref&gt;Howat, p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt; Hutton played for Yorkshire until the end of June. Against Nottinghamshire, he scored 194 in five hours, his final first-class century. His last 100 runs came in an hour. After the following match, his back was too painful to continue and he did not play again that season.&lt;ref name=H169&gt;Howat, pp. 168–169.&lt;/ref&gt; In eleven first-class matches, he scored 537 runs at an average of 29.83.&lt;ref name=fcbatting/&gt; In June, he was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] for services to cricket.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; Following the advice of a specialist, Hutton announced his retirement from first-class cricket in January 1956. He was 39, an early retirement age for the period.&lt;ref name=Wis55/&gt;&lt;ref name=H169/&gt; He played one further match in 1957 for MCC against Lancashire, and two matches in 1960 for MCC and L.

==Style and technique==
===Batting===
''Wisden'' viewed Hutton, with [[Jack Hobbs]], as &quot;one of the two most accomplished professional batsmen to have played for his country&quot;,&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; and following the Second World War, critics regarded him as the best batsman in the world.&lt;ref name=Frith&gt;{{cite web | last = Frith | first = David | url = http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/464021.html| title = David Frith on Len Hutton| publisher = ESPNCricinfo | accessdate =13 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2010, he was chosen as part of the ESPNCricinfo All-time World XI, a team selected by a panel of respected commentators and cricket writers to represent the greatest cricketers of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = All-time XI: World| url = http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/current/story/magazine/alltime.html?site_area=2356| publisher = ESPNCricinfo | date = 25 October 2010| accessdate =12 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the same process, he was also chosen in England's greatest team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = All-time XI: England | url = http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/current/story/magazine/alltime.html?site_area=1965| publisher = ESPNCricinfo | date = 28 August 2009| accessdate =12 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The official Yorkshire history describes him as &quot;technically and aesthetically the best batsman to play for Yorkshire&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hodgson, p. 139&quot;/&gt; E. W. Swanton believed that if Hobbs was the greatest professional batsman, Hutton, along with Hammond and Compton, came next.&lt;ref name=Sw146&gt;Swanton, p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Hutton was more cautious than these others. Following the lead of Herbert Sutcliffe, he saw the role of an opening batsman as defensive. The basis of his game was a good defensive technique, although he was able to accelerate and play attacking shots when the situation demanded.&lt;ref name=Frith/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sw146/&gt; Cricket historian [[David Frith]] believes that &quot;there was an apparent touch of genius about his batsmanship&quot;,&lt;ref name=Frith/&gt; and Alan Gibson described Hutton's [[Drive (cricket)|off drive]] as &quot;the glory of the game.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt; He was particularly effective on difficult batting pitches.&lt;ref name=Hod142&gt;Hodgson, p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt; Of the next generation of England batsmen, Peter May tried to adopt Hutton's mental approach to both batting and captaincy,&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; while Colin Cowdrey later said &quot;I had tried to model myself on Len Hutton ever since I started playing serious cricket.&quot;&lt;ref name=Marshall164&gt;Marshall, p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt; Statistically, Hutton stands near the highest achievers. When he retired, only two men had scored more than his 6,971 Test runs; his average of 56.67 is seventh highest of those who played at least fifty Test matches, as of 2012, while only Sutcliffe has a higher average among openers who scored over 4,000 runs. He also displayed consistency; his annual average only fell below 50 three times, he averaged over 50 each year from 1947 to 1954 and scored 20 or more in 90 of his 138 innings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Rajesh| first = S| url = http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/463972.html| title = Consistently prolific| date = 21 June 2010| publisher = ESPNCricinfo | accessdate =13 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hutton's batting technique was orthodox and conventional. John Woodcock writes that he seemed to possess great intuition, for example playing mystery spinners Ramadhin and Iverson with ease.&lt;ref&gt;Woodcock, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; His batting stance was relaxed and still, his first movement being to slide his right foot back and across towards middle stump. He often played the ball off the [[Glossary of cricket terms#B|back foot]], getting right back onto his stumps, but never played as far forward, preferring to let the ball come to him and play it late.&lt;ref name=W55/&gt; Occasionally, he left a slight gap between his bat and pads, meaning he was sometimes bowled through it when out of form.&lt;ref name=W55/&gt; This arose mainly through the wartime injury to his arm and by 1950 he had adjusted his technique to compensate and had fewer problems.&lt;ref name=M143/&gt; Immediately before the war, Hutton batted in a more attacking style and several of his contemporaries remembered his attractive strokeplay. By his own admission, Hutton was not the same player after the war. A combination of the effects of his injury and the responsibility of opening the batting in generally weak Yorkshire and England teams, whose success often depended on Hutton, meant that he batted cautiously.&lt;ref&gt;Woodhouse, p. 374.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, pp. 142–43.&lt;/ref&gt; Hutton only played attacking shots when they presented no risk, and he rarely lifted the ball in the air; he hit just seven sixes in Test matches.&lt;ref name=profile/&gt;&lt;ref name=W55&gt;Woodcock, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Patrick Murphy writes: &quot;Just now and again he would play an innings of genius, when bowlers could not contain him.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Murphy, p. 145&quot;/&gt; One such innings was his score of 37 in the second Test of 1946–47 in which the attacking shots he played reminded older spectators of [[Victor Trumper]], regarded as the ultimate Australian strokeplayer.&lt;ref name=M143&gt;Murphy, p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt; In all his innings, he was expert at hitting the ball just out of the reach of fieldsmen to allow runs to be taken.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt; Several of his contemporaries believed he did not get enough credit for surviving the short-pitched attacks of the Australian bowlers following the war.&lt;ref name=M143/&gt;

===Captaincy===
As captain, Hutton believed that the key to success was a strong pace attack, stemming from his experiences against Lindwall and Miller, which influenced his selection of several promising fast bowlers. His natural inclination and the background to his appointment made him a cautious captain, for example slowing down the game to allow the fast bowlers to rest, which set a precedent for other captains.&lt;ref name=G190&gt;Gibson, p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt; Tactically, Norman Yardley found him &quot;sound rather than venturesome&quot;.&lt;ref name=H198&gt;Howat, p. 198.&lt;/ref&gt; Run saving was his main priority, but during matches, he quickly adjusted his approach to attack the weakness of particular batsmen.&lt;ref name=H198/&gt; Jim Kilburn believed that Hutton pursued a serious approach to all matches, to the point where he missed some enjoyment of the game. Kilburn wrote that the &quot;outstanding characteristic of his captaincy was shrewdness. He made no romantic gestures; he lit no fires of inspiration. He invited admiration rather than affection and would have exchanged either or both for effective obedience.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Kilburn | first = JM | url = http://www.espncricinfo.com/cricketer/content/story/148526.html| title = Len Hutton retires| publisher = The Cricketer (ESPNCricinfo) | accessdate =15 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of his selections as captain were widely debated. Following incidents in the Caribbean, Trueman did not play for England again under Hutton's captaincy, although he was still regarded as an England prospect. Jim Laker was also omitted from the team, possibly because Hutton doubted Laker's commitment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aus omissions&quot;&gt;Chalke and Hodgson, pp. 111–12.&lt;/ref&gt; Both [[Jim McConnon]], Laker's replacement, and [[Vic Wilson (cricketer)|Vic Wilson]] were controversial choices for the 1954–55 Australian tour, whose selections [[Trevor Bailey]] attributed to Hutton;&lt;ref name=&quot;Controversial selections&quot;&gt;Chalke and Hodgson, p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt; neither played a substantial role on the tour.&lt;ref name=Wis55/&gt; A poor communicator, Hutton distanced himself from his team when a stronger lead was required.&lt;ref&gt;Woodcock, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; Trueman and Trevor Bailey thought Hutton found it hard to talk to his players: amateur critics considered this an inevitable consequence of a professional leading other professionals.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, pp. 160–61.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Hutton played a key role in the development of fast bowlers Trueman, Tyson and [[Brian Statham]]. Tyson and Statham later acknowledged his advice and encouragement as factor in their subsequent success.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt; Cowdrey also acknowledged Hutton's advice and assistance when the former began his career. Furthermore, on the 1954–55 tour of Australia, Hutton took a close interest in him and was a particular comfort when Cowdrey's father died during the tour.&lt;ref name=Marshall164/&gt;

Cricket followers from the south of England remained slightly distrustful of Hutton owing to the perception that he occasionally carried professionalism to excess.&lt;ref name=Birley283/&gt; When he was appointed England captain, many in the cricketing establishment held his professionalism against him with the result that Hutton never felt comfortable dealing with the amateurs who ran English cricket at the time. While captain, he was criticised for caution and negativity but also was expected to lead a successful team at a time when results began to assume a far greater importance than in previous years.&lt;ref name=Birley283/&gt; Consequently, Hutton never felt secure in the position and was often uncomfortable around the amateur establishment. Like Herbert Sutcliffe, he attempted to alter his accent to match that of leading southern amateurs to help him to fit in.&lt;ref name=Birley283/&gt; But he did not enjoy the attention that went with the captaincy,&lt;ref name=Marshall159/&gt; and he often worried about the impression he was making.&lt;ref name=Birley283/&gt;

Hutton rarely captained Yorkshire, except in the absence of the official captain, through a combination of poor health, frequent absences with England and the presence of amateur Norman Yardley in the side.&lt;ref name=Sw145/&gt; Yardley claimed several times that he would have stood down in Hutton's favour, but the committee remained distrustful of professional captaincy and thought Hutton a hypochondriac who used his health as an excuse not to play.&lt;ref&gt;Chalke and Hodgson, p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt; As reserved, serious man who nevertheless possessed a quiet sense of humour,&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sw145/&gt; the dressing room clashes of the Yorkshire side of the 1950s did not appeal to Hutton,&lt;ref name=Hod142/&gt; and, as the side's senior professional, he did not always provide the guidance which younger players in the side were seeking.&lt;ref&gt;Howat, p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; The team was divided and the players frequently clashed with each other; some critics believe this was a factor in the county's failure to win the County Championship in the 1950s. [[Ray Illingworth]], a player at the time, believes that Hutton was the only man who could have changed the negative attitude around the team, but &quot;he didn't do anything about it&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Chalke and Hodgson, pp. 166–67.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Hutton married Dorothy Mary Dennis, the sister of former Yorkshire cricketer [[Frank Dennis]], on 16 September 1939 at [[Wykeham, Scarborough|Wykeham near Scarborough]]; they met at an end-of-season dance which Dorothy had attended with her brother.&lt;ref name=&quot;Howat, p.23&quot;/&gt; They had two sons: [[Richard Hutton (cricketer)|Richard]], who later played cricket for Yorkshire and England, in 1942,&lt;ref&gt;Howat, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; and John in 1947.&lt;ref name=&quot;Howat, p. 67&quot;/&gt;

During and after the war, Hutton worked for a paper manufacturer,&lt;ref name=&quot;Howat, p. 60&quot;&gt;Howat, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; but writing and journalism provided a more permanent career. Hutton worked with [[Thomas Moult]], a journalist and writer, to produce a book of memoirs, ''Cricket is My Life'' in 1949,&lt;ref&gt;Howat, pp. 84–85&lt;/ref&gt; and he wrote for the ''[[News of the World]]'' while still playing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Howat, p. 183&quot;&gt;Howat, p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt; Following his cricketing retirement, Hutton worked in broadcasting until 1961,&lt;ref&gt;Howat, pp. 169–70.&lt;/ref&gt; and after 1955, he wrote for the London [[The Evening News (London newspaper)|''Evening News'']] until 1963.&lt;ref name=H175/&gt; A second book, ''Just my story'', followed in 1956 in collaboration with journalist, R. J. Hayter. In 1958–59, Hutton travelled to Australia to cover the M.C.C. tour as correspondent for the ''Evening News'', again assisted by a professional journalist, while between 1963 and 1986, he wrote for ''[[The Observer]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Howat, pp. 183–86.&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote a third book, ''Thirty Years in Cricket'', in 1984.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt; Hutton's increasing commitments in the south of England meant he moved to North London in 1959.&lt;ref name=H175&gt;Howat, p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1960, Hutton was invited to join the engineering firm of J. H. Fenner,&lt;ref&gt;Howat, p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt; mainly working in a [[public relations]] capacity. Later, he moved into marketing and overseas promotion of products,&lt;ref&gt;Howat, pp. 177–82.&lt;/ref&gt; became a director of the firm in 1973,&lt;ref name=ODNB&gt;{{cite web  | last = Howat  | first = Gerald M.

Although he disliked committees, Hutton served as an England Test selector in 1975 and 1976, but business commitments limited his availability and for this reason he resigned in 1977.&lt;ref name=&quot;Howat, p. 183&quot;/&gt; Hutton became involved with Surrey cricket in later years but maintained links with Yorkshire, and assumed the position of Yorkshire president in January 1990.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt; In his final years, Hutton suffered from ill health and became increasingly frail. In September 1990, he suffered a [[Traumatic aortic rupture|ruptured aorta]] shortly after watching a cricket match at the Oval. After an unsuccessful operation, he died on 6 September.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sw145&gt;Swanton, p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt;
