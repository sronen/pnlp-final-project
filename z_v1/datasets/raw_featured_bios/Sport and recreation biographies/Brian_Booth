'''Brian Charles Booth''' (born 19 October 1933) is a former [[Australian cricket team|Australian cricketer]] who played in 29 [[Test cricket|Tests]] from 1961 to 1966. He captained Australia for two Tests during the 1965&amp;ndash;66 Ashes series while regular captain [[Bob Simpson (cricketer)|Bob Simpson]] was absent due to illness and injury. Booth was a graceful right-handed middle order batsman at No. 4 or 5, and occasionally bowled right arm [[pace bowling|medium pace]] or [[off spin]]. He was of modest height and had an inclination to use his feet to charge [[spin bowling|spin bowlers]]. Booth was also a member of the Australian [[field hockey]] team that competed at the [[1956 Summer Olympics]] in [[Melbourne]].

Born near the New South Wales country town of Bathurst, Booth moved to Sydney in 1952 and played in the [[Sydney Grade Cricket|grade cricket]] competition while training to become a teacher. He made his first-class debut for [[New South Wales Blues|New South Wales]] and came to prominence in dramatic circumstances in his second match, against the touring [[England cricket team|Englishmen]] in 1954&amp;ndash;55. Due to late withdrawals, Booth was selected at late notice and had to be called from work on the morning of the match. After arriving after the start of the match, he scored 74 following a batting collapse. Booth struggled to make an impression early in his career and missed a season to prepare for the 1956 Olympics. Upon returning to first-class cricket in 1957&amp;ndash;58, he held down a regular position in the state team while the Test players were touring overseas. Booth gradually progressed and gained selection on the 1959&amp;ndash;60 Australian Second XI tour to New Zealand. 

Booth was selected for the Australian team that toured England in 1961 and played in the final two Tests. Upon his return to Australia, Booth made two centuries in the 1962&amp;ndash;63 home Test series against England, establishing himself in the Test team. He made two further centuries in the following summer against [[South African cricket team|South Africa]] and was named the Australian player of the year. Following the retirement of [[Richie Benaud]], Booth was appointed as the vice-captain under Simpson as Australia embarked on a successful 1964 tour of England, which saw the retention of [[the Ashes]]. Booth played his final Test series in 1965&amp;ndash;66 against England, captaining Australia in the First and Third Tests because Simpson was sidelined with a broken wrist and [[chickenpox]] respectively. The First Test was drawn but Australia fell to its first innings defeat in almost ten years in the Third Test. As he was also in a form slump, Booth was dropped as the Australian selectors made mass changes, ending his career. In retirement, Booth returned to his teaching duties and served as an Anglican lay-preacher. Booth was known for his sportsmanship on the field and often invoked Christianity while discussing ethics and sport.

== Early years ==
The son of &quot;Snowy&quot; Booth, a market gardener and talented country cricketer,&lt;ref&gt;Booth and White, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Booth was born in Perthville, located {{convert|9|km|mi|abbr=on}} outside the New South Wales regional town of [[Bathurst, New South Wales|Bathurst]].&lt;ref name=pollard/&gt; His father hung pictures of [[Don Bradman]] and [[Stan McCabe]] on the wall and told him that &quot;these are the two greatest living cricketers&quot;.&lt;ref name=h257&gt;Haigh, p. 257.&lt;/ref&gt; Booth represented [[Bathurst High School (Bathurst, New South Wales)|Bathurst High School]] at the age of 13 and played first grade cricket in Bathurst at 15. He was selected for a New South Wales youth country side at the age of just 14. In 1950, Booth represented New South Wales Country against a combined Sydney team, and moved to [[St. George Cricket Club|St. George]] to play on a weekly basis two years later.&lt;ref name=&quot;pollard&quot;/&gt; He made the first grade team at the age of 19 and began a four-year course at [[Sydney Teachers College]].&lt;ref name=&quot;p246&quot;&gt;Perry (2000), p. 246.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;r275&quot;/&gt; Booth also played hockey in Perthville and began playing for St. George upon his arrival in Sydney.&lt;ref&gt;Booth and White, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Booth made his first-class debut for [[New South Wales Blues|New South Wales]] against [[Queensland Bulls|Queensland]] in the 1954&amp;ndash;55 [[Sheffield Shield]]. He made a [[duck (cricket)|duck]] in the first innings before adding 19 in the second.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; New South Wales won,&lt;ref name=o/&gt; but Booth was dropped when the Test players returned from international duty.&lt;ref name=&quot;r275&quot;/&gt; Booth was recalled a month later for a match against [[Len Hutton]]'s [[English cricket team in Australia in 1954-55|English cricket team]] at the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]]. [[Arthur Morris]] and [[Bill Watson (cricketer)|Bill Watson]] had to withdraw at late notice and Booth was asked to play, having already started his day's work as a teacher at [[Hurlstone Agricultural High School|Hurlstone Agricultural College]]. He caught a train and arrived at the ground more than half an hour after the start of play, by which time New South Wales had collapsed to 3/12. New South Wales fell further to 5/26 before Booth came in with a borrowed cap and bat to join [[Peter Philpott]]. They put on an 83-run partnership, and Booth eventually finished the innings unbeaten on 74 as the hosts folded for 172.&lt;ref name=p246/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;r275&quot;&gt;Robinson, p. 275.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;o&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;az&quot;/&gt; Booth made a duck in the second innings and took his maiden first-class wicket as New South Wales defeated Hutton's men. It was only the tourists' second loss for the campaign,&lt;ref name=o/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Perry (2005), pp. 359&amp;ndash;360.&lt;/ref&gt; and the last match in Booth's debut season.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://static.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1950S/1954-55/AUS_LOCAL/STATS/FC_1954-55_BAT_MOST_RUNS.html| title=Australian First-Class Season 1954/55: Batting - Most Runs| publisher=[[Cricinfo]] |accessdate=2007-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Booth had a low key season in 1955&amp;ndash;56, struggling to find a regular position in the New South Wales team. As there were no international matches during the summer,&lt;ref name=auslist&gt;{{cite web|title=List of match results (by year) Australia - Test matches|url=http://stats.cricinfo.com/australia/engine/records/team/match_results_year.html?class=1;id=2;type=team| accessdate=2007-12-04| publisher=[[Cricinfo]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Test players were available for the whole campaign. He played in six matches and had few opportunities, managing only 157 runs at 31.40, passing fifty on only one occasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://static.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1950S/1955-56/AUS_LOCAL/STATS/FC_1955-56_BAT_MOST_RUNS.html| title=Australian First-Class Season 1955/56: Batting - Most Runs| publisher=[[Cricinfo]] |accessdate=2007-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; New South Wales went on to claim a hat-trick of Sheffield Shield titles.&lt;ref name=s/&gt; 

Booth was selected for the New South Wales hockey team in 1955 and toured New Zealand in 1956 in preparation for the Olympics.&lt;ref&gt;Booth and White, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; Good performances on this tour led to his selection in the Australian Olympic squad for the 1956 Melbourne Olympics, but he had an anxious wait following media claims that he had received out of pocket expenses for playing cricket, which would make him a professional and therefore ineligible to participate in the Olympics.&lt;ref&gt;Booth and White, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, Booth and fellow first-class cricketers [[Ian Dick]] and [[Maurice Foley (Australian sportsman)|Maurice Foley]] were cleared to play for Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Booth and White, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;   

Booth then missed the 1956&amp;ndash;57 [[Sheffield Shield]] season because he was part of the Australian field hockey team that finished fifth at the [[Australia at the 1956 Summer Olympics|1956 Olympics]] in [[Melbourne]].&lt;ref name=h32&gt;Haigh, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olympics.com.au/athletes.cfm?AthleteID=610|title=Brian Booth|publisher=[[Australian Olympic Committee]]|accessdate=2007-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Booth was selected as an inside left, but was not utilised in any of Australia's matches.&lt;ref name=&quot;pollard&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Pollard | first = Jack | year = 1969 | title = Cricket the Australian Way| publisher=Lansdowne Press |isbn=0-7018-0388-6 |page= 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;r274&quot;&gt;Robinson, p. 274.&lt;/ref&gt; In his absence, New South Wales won a fourth consecutive domestic title.&lt;ref name=o&gt;{{cite web| title=Player Oracle BC Booth|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/cgi-bin/player_oracle_reveals_results2.cgi?playernumber=1153&amp;opponentmatch=exact&amp;playername=Meckiff&amp;resulttype=All&amp;matchtype=All&amp;teammatch=exact&amp;startwicket=&amp;homeawaytype=All&amp;opponent=&amp;endwicket=&amp;wicketkeeper=&amp;searchtype=InningsList&amp;endscore=&amp;playermatch=contains&amp;branding=cricketarchive&amp;captain=&amp;endseason=&amp;startscore=&amp;team=&amp;startseason= |accessdate=2009-05-14 |publisher=[[CricketArchive]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1957&amp;ndash;58, the Australian Test team toured South Africa during the southern hemisphere summer,&lt;ref name=auslist/&gt; opening up opportunities in the Shield competition back in Australia. Booth established himself at first-class level with 503 runs at 50.30.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; After scoring two fifties, he broke through for his maiden first-class century against [[Victorian Bushrangers|Victoria]] at the SCG, in his last match of the season.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; He put on a partnership of 325 with future Test team-mate [[Norm O'Neill]] in fewer than four hours.&lt;ref name=&quot;az&quot;/&gt; It was his fifteenth first-class match,&lt;ref name=p246/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;o&quot;/&gt; and helped his state secure a fifth successive title with a ten-wicket win over their arch-rivals.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;&lt;ref name=auslist/&gt;&lt;ref name=s/&gt; With the Test players returning to Australia in 1958&amp;ndash;59, Booth again faced more competition for places. He struggled, playing six matches and aggregating only 190 runs at 31.66.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://static.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1950S/1958-59/AUS_LOCAL/STATS/FC_1958-59_BAT_MOST_RUNS.html| title=Australian First-Class Season 1960/61: Batting - Most Runs| publisher=[[Cricinfo]] |accessdate=2007-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; He only had six innings for the entire season, and in his only opportunity against [[Peter May]]'s touring Englishmen, he made a duck. Booth passed 50 on two occasions during the season, making 75 and 85.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; In one high-scoring match against [[Southern Redbacks|South Australia]], he took 0/97 with his part-time [[off spin]].&lt;ref name=o/&gt;&lt;ref name=az/&gt;

The national team toured the [[Indian subcontinent]] during the 1959&amp;ndash;60 Australian season,&lt;ref name=auslist/&gt; opening up more vacancies at a domestic level. Booth had a strong first-class season, scoring 718 runs at 65.27 with two centuries to place third on the run scoring aggregates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://static.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1950S/1959-60/AUS_LOCAL/STATS/FC_1959-60_BAT_MOST_RUNS.html| title=Australian First-Class Season 1959/60: Batting - Most Runs| publisher=[[Cricinfo]] |accessdate=2007-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; He started the season with 168 as New South Wales defeated Queensland by an innings before scoring 177 two matches later in an innings win over South Australia.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; His state completed a seventh Sheffield Shield triumph in succession.&lt;ref name=s/&gt;

Booth's performances saw him selected for a second choice Australian team that toured [[New Zealand]] under the captaincy of [[Ian Craig]].&lt;ref name=&quot;az&quot;/&gt; He scored 105 in his first innings for his country, in a victory over [[Auckland cricket team|Auckland]].&lt;ref name=o/&gt; Booth scored 184 runs at 30.66 and took three wickets at 25.00 in the four international matches against [[New Zealand cricket team|New Zealand]].&lt;ref name=o/&gt; Booth considered retiring after the season, feeling that the time needed for first-class cricket was impinging on his work as a lay preacher and a Christian youth worker.&lt;ref name=&quot;r275&quot;/&gt;

Booth brought himself into contention for the Test selection with a series of strong displays in 1960&amp;ndash;61. He aggregated 981 runs at an average of 65.40, with three centuries. Only five players scored more runs, all at lower averages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://static.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1960S/1960-61/AUS_LOCAL/STATS/FC_1960-61_BAT_MOST_RUNS.html| title=Australian First-Class Season 1960/61: Batting - Most Runs| publisher=[[Cricinfo]] |accessdate=2007-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two of the centuries were in combined Australian XI matches at the end of the season for expected Test squad members.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://static.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1960S/1960-61/AUS_LOCAL/OTHERFC/| title=Other First-Class Matches, 1960-61| publisher=[[Cricinfo]] |accessdate=2007-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a match against [[Tasmanian Tigers|Tasmania]], Booth struck a breezy 100 from 104 balls in 90 minutes of batting.&lt;ref name=&quot;r275&quot;/&gt; Another highlight was an 87 against the touring [[West Indies cricket team|West Indies]], helping New South Wales to complete an innings win.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; Booth's productivity helped his state to another Sheffield Shield win.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;

== Test career ==
Booth was then selected for [[the Ashes]] tour of [[England]] in 1961; he and Victorian opening batsmen [[Bill Lawry]], the two uncapped batsmen in the team, were regarded as the last two players chosen.&lt;ref name=h164&gt;Haigh, p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt; Booth quickly gained a reputation for his attention to physical fitness. He led the Australians in their morning exercises during the sea voyage,&lt;ref name=&quot;r275&quot;/&gt; which captain [[Richie Benaud]] made optional.&lt;ref name=h211&gt;Haigh, p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt; After scoring 37 and seven against [[Worcestershire County Cricket Club|Worcestershire]] in his first match on English soil, Booth broke through for his first century for Australia, scoring 113 against [[Cambridge University Cricket Club|Cambridge University]] in his fifth match in England.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; He made 59 against the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]],&lt;ref name=o/&gt; but was overlooked for the first three Tests.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;&lt;ref name=testlist/&gt;

Booth scored 127 not out against [[Somerset County Cricket Club|Somerset]], and in the next match against [[Lancashire County Cricket Club|Lancashire]],&lt;ref name=o/&gt; he was caught behind for 99 from the bowling of another Brian Booth.&lt;ref name=&quot;r276&quot;&gt;Robinson, p. 276.&lt;/ref&gt; He played consistently, with two more half-centuries to earn his debut in the Fourth Test at [[Old Trafford (cricket ground)|Old Trafford]] in place of [[Colin McDonald (cricketer)|Colin McDonald]].&lt;ref name=o/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;az&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Cashman, Franks, Maxwell, Sainsbury, Stoddart, Weaver, Webster | year = 1997 | title = The A-Z of Australian cricketers|pages =27&amp;ndash;28|isbn=0-19-550604-9|publisher= Oxford University Press|location=Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series was evenly poised at 1&amp;ndash;1,&lt;ref name=auslist/&gt; and Australia batted first on a pitch that initially assisted [[fast bowling]]. The surface was tinged with green and England fielded a pace line-up that included [[Brian Statham]] and [[Fred Trueman]]. Booth was struck in the torso by his first ball, a [[bouncer (cricket)|bouncer]] that did not rise as high as was expected. He managed to repel a spearing [[yorker]] on the second ball and compiled a battling 46, the second highest score on the difficult pitch, featuring in a partnership of 46&amp;mdash;the highest in Australia's innings&amp;mdash;with [[Bill Lawry]].&lt;ref name=&quot;p247&quot;/&gt; Australia managed only 190 on the bowler-friendly pitch.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;r276&quot;/&gt; Booth only managed nine in the second innings before Australia retained the Ashes after an English collapse on the final day resulted in a 54-run win.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;testlist&quot;/&gt; In the drawn Fifth and final Test at [[The Oval]], Booth came in with the score at 4/211 after the dismissal of O'Neill for 117.

Booth was dismissed for 71 while attempting to loft the spin of [[Tony Lock]] over the infield,&lt;ref name=&quot;r276&quot;/&gt; as captain [[Richie Benaud]] needed quick runs; observers felt the need to attack cost Booth his maiden Test century.&lt;ref name=&quot;p247&quot;/&gt; Booth added three more 70s in the closing tour matches before the team returned to Australia.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;

The 1961&amp;ndash;62 season was entirely a domestic season.&lt;ref name=auslist/&gt; Booth scored 507 runs at 42.25 with two centuries, against Queensland and South Australia.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; He placed 13th on the run scoring aggregates, helping New South Wales to win its ninth consecutive Sheffield Shield.&lt;ref name=s&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content-www.cricinfo.com/australia/content/story/260057.html|accessdate=2007-11-30|title=A history of the Sheffield Shield |publisher=[[Cricinfo]] |first=Martin |last=Williamson}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://static.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1960S/1961-62/AUS_LOCAL/STATS/FC_1961-62_BAT_MOST_RUNS.html| title=Australian First-Class Season 1961/62: Batting - Most Runs| publisher=[[Cricinfo]] |accessdate=2007-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After scoring 72 in the opening match of the season and adding 41 against the touring Englishmen for New South Wales,&lt;ref name=o/&gt; Booth retained his place in the Test team for the [[1962-63 Ashes series|1962&amp;ndash;63 Ashes series]]. He scored his maiden Test century in the First Test at [[The Gabba]], compiling 112 in the first innings of a high scoring draw. Thirteen innings reached fifty, but Booth was the only player to reach three figures.&lt;ref name=&quot;p247&quot;/&gt; English captain [[Ted Dexter]] attempted to shut down Booth's scoring by employing [[leg theory]].&lt;ref name=p247/&gt; In the [[1962-63 Ashes series#Second Test – Melbourne|Second Test]] at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]], [[Fred Titmus]] bowled outside leg stump with five men on the on side, but Booth completed consecutive centuries with 103 in the second innings. As a result of Dexter's defensive field placings, Booth scored at only half the rate he managed in the First Test.&lt;ref name=&quot;r276&quot;/&gt; Booth took six hours to reach triple figures and hit only four boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;Piesse, p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt; His innings was not enough to prevent England from completing a seven-wicket victory.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; Booth was unable to maintain his form for the rest of the season, with 34 and 77 in the Fourth Test in [[Adelaide]] being the only other times that he passed 20.&lt;ref name=&quot;testlist&quot;/&gt; Australia won the Third Test, drawing the series, and Booth ended the series with 404 runs at 50.50.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p247&quot;/&gt; He added a further three fifties in the Sheffield Shield as Victoria ended New South Wales' nine-year winning streak.&lt;ref name=s/&gt;

Booth started the 1963&amp;ndash;64 season strongly. He scored centuries in his first two innings, recording 121 and 169 not out against Queensland and Western Australia respectively.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; In his rapid innings against [[Western Warriors|Western Australia]] at the SCG, which took only 165 minutes, Booth reached 100 in 94 minutes during the second session of the day&lt;!--One [[six (cricket)|six]] came from a [[Des Hoare]] [[Beamer (cricket)|beamer]], which Booth hooked onto the roof of the stand on the hill.

He finished the series in the Fifth Test in his home town, top-scoring in both of Australia's innings, with 102 not out and 87 in a draw.&lt;ref name=p248/&gt; It capped off a productive fortnight for Booth; he had scored 162 not out against South Australia before the final Test.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; In four Tests, he aggregated 531 runs at 88.50. For the entire first-class season, Booth had struck five centuries and totalled 1,180 runs.&lt;ref name=&quot;p248&quot;/&gt; According to [[Gideon Haigh]], he had &quot;played exquisitely&quot; throughout the season,&lt;ref name=h193&gt;Haigh, p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt; which was his career peak and saw him named the Australian Cricketer of the Year for 1963&amp;ndash;64.&lt;ref name=&quot;az&quot;/&gt;

=== Vice-captaincy ===

Captain Benaud retired at the end of the South Africa series&amp;mdash;he had already relinquished the leadership after the First Test&amp;mdash;and Booth was elevated to the vice-captaincy under [[Bob Simpson (cricketer)|Bob Simpson]] for the 1964 tour of England.&lt;ref name=&quot;p248&quot;/&gt; Along with Simpson and Lawry, Booth was one of three on-tour selectors.&lt;ref name=h197&gt;Haigh, p. 197.&lt;/ref&gt; Some observers felt that the personable Booth would have been more popular among the playing group than Simpson, while others thought that he would not have been hard-nosed enough in pursuing his team's competitive interest.&lt;ref name=&quot;r277&quot;&gt;Robinson, p. 277.&lt;/ref&gt; While Simpson was known for being relentlessly hard-nosed, he was also abrasive and sometimes irritated others by making derogatory comments towards teammates.&lt;ref&gt;Haigh, pp. 191&amp;ndash;192, 243.&lt;/ref&gt; Booth again ran daily fitness classes during the voyage, and on this occasion, Simpson made them compulsory for the players.&lt;ref name=h211/&gt; Booth started the tour well, scoring 109 not out in his third match for the summer, against [[Surrey County Cricket Club|Surrey]].&lt;ref name=o/&gt; He passed 50 three more times before the start of the Tests, when his form waned.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;

Booth failed to pass 20 in the first six innings of the Test series.&lt;ref name=&quot;testlist&quot;/&gt; With Australia 1&amp;ndash;0 up after three Tests, a draw in the Fourth Test was sufficient to retain the urn.&lt;ref name=auslist/&gt; Booth regained his touch with three scores beyond fifty in four innings leading up to the Fourth Test, including 132 against [[Middlesex County Cricket Club|Middlesex]].&lt;ref name=o/&gt; When the teams reconvened at Old Trafford for the Fourth Test, Booth made a &quot;courtly&quot; 98 in a 219-run partnership with Simpson. The Australians batted for more than two days to burn off any chance of an England victory.&lt;ref&gt;Perry (2000), p. 234.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Haigh, p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt; Booth then scored 193 not out, his highest for the summer, in Australia's 7/315 declared against [[Yorkshire County Cricket Club|Yorkshire]], setting up the tourists' victory.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; He made 74 in the Fifth Test and ended the series with 210 runs at 42.00.&lt;ref name=&quot;p248&quot;/&gt; Along with Simpson and Lawry, Booth was one of three Australians to accumulate more than 1,500 first-class runs for the English summer.&lt;ref&gt;Haigh, p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt;

Three Tests against [[India national cricket team|India]] and one against [[Pakistan national cricket team|Pakistan]] lay ahead of Booth as the Australians visited the [[Indian subcontinent]] on the late-1964 voyage back to Australia. He had a mediocre time, passing fifty only once, with 74 in the Second Test at [[Mumbai]]'s [[Brabourne Stadium]].&lt;ref name=testlist/&gt; That innings was terminated when Indian wicket-keeper [[KS Indrajitsinhji]] fumbled a stumping opportunity&amp;mdash;the ball rolled back down the pitch. Despite breaking the stumps with his hand while the ball was not in close proximity, Indrajitsinhji's appeal was upheld.&lt;ref name=h207&gt;Haigh, p. 207.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Haigh, &quot;It seemed like ten men [one of the Australians was ill] were pitted against thirteen [eleven Indian players and two umpires]&quot;.&lt;ref name=h207/&gt; Booth compiled 127 runs at 21.17 and took the only three wickets of his Test career on the spin-friendly subcontinental surfaces. He took 2/33 in the drawn Third Test in [[Calcutta]], before capturing his final wicket in the second innings of the only Test against Pakistan in [[Karachi]].&lt;ref name=&quot;p248&quot;/&gt; At the time, cricket matches in Australia and England were typically interrupted by the Sunday rest day, and Booth used these for religious observances. However, this custom was not observed on the subcontinent. Booth wanted to withdraw for personal reasons, but decided to play due to injuries and illnesses to other players.&lt;ref name=&quot;r277&quot;/&gt; He made 57 in a Test against Pakistan in Melbourne upon arrival in Australia. It was the only home Test of the season before the hosts embarked upon a tour to the [[Caribbean]].&lt;ref name=auslist/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;testlist&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p248&quot;/&gt; Booth scored 115 for his state against the Pakistanis and ended the Australian season with 327 runs at 46.71.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;

Australia arrived in the [[West Indies]] in 1964&amp;ndash;65 for five Tests against the emerging power of the 1960s, who were led by the hostile express [[pace bowling]] of [[Wes Hall]] and [[Charlie Griffith]]. After narrowly evading a bouncer at the start of his innings, Booth made a battling top-score of 56 in the First Test loss at [[Sabina Park]] in [[Jamaica]].&lt;ref name=&quot;r277&quot;/&gt; He then made 117 in the Second Test at [[Port of Spain]] in [[Trinidad]], an innings that included a stand of 228 with [[Bob Cowper]], which helped Australia hang on for a draw. It was to be Booth's last Test century, an innings he regarded as his &quot;most satisfying&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;p248&quot;/&gt; having collected a series of bruises,&lt;ref name=&quot;r278&quot;&gt;Robinson, p. 278.&lt;/ref&gt; on a ground with no sightscreen.&lt;ref&gt;Haigh, p. 229.&lt;/ref&gt; Booth did not pass 40 in the last three Tests and ended with 234 runs at 29.25 as Australia lost 2&amp;ndash;1,&lt;ref name=&quot;testlist&quot;/&gt; their first series loss since the 1956 Ashes series and their first series loss against a team other than England, excluding a one-off Test against Pakistan in 1956.&lt;ref name=auslist/&gt; He had particular trouble with the pace of Griffith, and on one occasion, the paceman hit him on the nose before [[yorker|yorking]] him on the next ball; Booth maintains that he did not see the ball.&lt;ref&gt;Haigh, pp. 226&amp;ndash;227.&lt;/ref&gt; Booth added two more fifties in the four first-class matches outside the Tests.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;

=== Temporary captain ===
&lt;!--[[Image:Bob Simpson sweep.JPG|thumb|right|Booth stood in as captain for Bob Simpson ''(pictured)'' when Simpson was ill and injured.]]--&gt;
At the start of the 1965&amp;ndash;66 season, Booth scored fifties in three consecutive matches, including an 80 against the [[MCC tour of Australia in 1965-66|MCC tourists]].&lt;ref name=o/&gt; The [[1965-66 Ashes series]] saw Booth captain Australia for the first time in a Test. Simpson sustained a broken wrist, leaving Booth to lead the hosts in the First Test in Brisbane. Booth prepared quietly, leaving Simpson to handle the press. He won the toss and elected to bat; fewer than two hours of play was possible on a rain-shortened first day, and the second day was entirely washed out. Booth made only 16 before being caught and bowled by [[Fred Titmus]] on the third morning, but centuries to Lawry and debutant [[Doug Walters]] saw  Australia declare at 6/443.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;&lt;ref name=p244/&gt; Booth rotated his spinners and dismissed the tourists for 280; the match ended in a draw with England at 3/186 after being forced to [[follow on]].&lt;ref name=o/&gt;&lt;ref name=p244&gt;Perry (2000), p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Geoff Boycott]] pushed a ball from [[leg spin]]ner [[Peter Philpott]] away with his hand, Booth refused to appeal for [[handled the ball]].&lt;ref name=&quot;r278&quot;/&gt; 

After the drawn Second Test, Simpson contracted [[chickenpox]], so Booth was again captain for the Third Test in front of his home crowd at the SCG.&lt;ref name=p245/&gt; It was an extra burden, as Booth had made only 49 runs in the first two Tests;&lt;ref name=testlist/&gt; his team-mates felt that their captain had been too anxious following his struggles against Griffith in the Caribbean.&lt;ref name=h236&gt;Haigh, p. 236.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there was to be no fairytale for Booth,&lt;ref name=p245/&gt; who later admitted to being in psychological disarray; he was unaware if the rolling done on the pitch after the toss was legal, and Philpott arrived late and ran onto the field just as play was starting.&lt;ref name=h236/&gt;
 
England batted first and their openers immediately seized the initiative, putting on 234 for the first wicket in four hours.&lt;ref name=h235&gt;Haigh, p. 235.&lt;/ref&gt; The tourists made 488 and Booth scored eight as Australia replied with 221 and were forced to follow on.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;&lt;ref name=p245/&gt; He made 27 in the second innings before being bowled by [[David Allen (cricketer)|David Allen]] as the hosts fell to an innings defeat.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p245&quot;/&gt; It was Australia's biggest defeat at home since the Fourth Test of the [[English cricket team in Australia in 1911–12|1911–12 Ashes series]] when they lost by an innings and 225 runs. After the match, England captain [[M. J. K. Smith|Mike Smith]] told Booth that he expected to see him in the Fourth Test, but his Australian counterpart prophetically predicted his downfall.&lt;ref name=h236/&gt;

With Australia 0&amp;ndash;1 down, the selectors took drastic action and dropped Booth, Cowper, Philpott, McKenzie and [[David Sincock]].&lt;ref name=p245/&gt; The revamped team won the next Test by an innings,&lt;ref name=auslist/&gt; and Booth never played for Australia again.&lt;ref name=testlist/&gt; If he had played another Test, Booth would have been eligible for the [[New South Wales Cricket Association]]'s retirement bonus of AUD50 a Test.&lt;ref name=&quot;r278&quot;/&gt; Booth's last five Test innings had netted only 84 runs.&lt;ref name=&quot;testlist&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://statserver.cricket.org/guru?sdb=player;playerid=1153;class=testplayer;filter=basic;team=0;opposition=0;notopposition=0;season=0;homeaway=0;continent=0;country=0;notcountry=0;groundid=0;startdefault=1961-07-27;start=1961-07-27;enddefault=1966-01-11;end=1966-01-11;tourneyid=0;finals=0;daynight=0;toss=0;scheduledovers=0;scheduleddays=0;innings=0;result=0;followon=0;seriesresult=0;captain=0;keeper=0;dnp=0;recent=;viewtype=aro_list;runslow=;runshigh=;batposition=0;dismissal=0;bowposition=0;ballslow=;ballshigh=;bpof=0;overslow=;overshigh=;conclow=;conchigh=;wicketslow=;wicketshigh=;dismissalslow=;dismissalshigh=;caughtlow=;caughthigh=;caughttype=0;stumpedlow=;stumpedhigh=;csearch=;submit=1;.cgifields=viewtype|title= Statsguru - BC Booth - Tests - Innings by innings list|publisher=[[Cricinfo]]|accessdate=2007-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p245&quot;&gt;Perry (2000), p. 245.&lt;/ref&gt; After the match, he received a letter from [[Don Bradman]], then a member of the selection panel and the [[Cricket Australia|Australian Board of Control]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Never before have I written to a player to express my regret at his omission from the Australian XI. In your case I am making an exception because I want you to know how much my colleagues and I disliked having to make this move. Captain one match and out of the side the next looks like ingratitude, but you understand the circumstances and will be the first to admit that your form has not been good.&lt;ref name=&quot;p246&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Booth ended the first-class season with 596 runs at 29.80, including four half-centuries.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; He continued to play for New South Wales before retiring during the 1968&amp;ndash;69 season.&lt;ref name=az/&gt;

== Final first-class seasons ==

In the 1966&amp;ndash;67 Australian season, Booth scored 638 runs at 49.07, ranking fifth in the run-scoring aggregates for the summer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://static.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1960S/1966-67/AUS_LOCAL/STATS/FC_1966-67_BAT_MOST_RUNS.html| title=Australian First-Class Season 1966/67: Batting - Most Runs| publisher=[[Cricinfo]] |accessdate=2007-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored 149 against Queensland, and added four fifties, including two scores in the 90s.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; As a result, Booth was made vice-captain of an Australian Second XI that toured New Zealand under the leadership of [[Les Favell]],&lt;ref name=az/&gt;&lt;ref name=r278/&gt; while the national team was in [[South Africa]].&lt;ref name=auslist/&gt; After failing to pass 26 in his first five innings, Booth made his highest first-class score&amp;mdash;214 not out&amp;mdash;against [[Central Districts Stags|Central Districts]],&lt;ref name=o/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;az&quot;/&gt; and was Australia's leading run-scorer for the tour.&lt;ref name=&quot;r278&quot;/&gt; After scoring only 62 runs in the first four innings in the opening three international matches against New Zealand, Booth made 179 in the fourth and final match.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;

Booth was less successful in his penultimate season in 1967&amp;ndash;68, with only 426 runs at 23.66, including two half-centuries, both against Victoria.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://static.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1960S/1967-68/AUS_LOCAL/STATS/FC_1967-68_BAT_MOST_RUNS.html| title=Australian First-Class Season 1967/68: Batting - Most Runs| publisher=[[Cricinfo]] |accessdate=2007-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; A decision by administrators to introduce Sunday play into the Sheffield Shield ended his career, as he refused to make himself available for games that involved Sunday play.&lt;ref name=&quot;r269&quot;&gt;Robinson, p. 269.&lt;/ref&gt; He played in only one match in his final season in 1968&amp;ndash;69, scoring a duck and 15 as New South Wales lost to South Australia by three wickets.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://static.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1960S/1968-69/AUS_LOCAL/STATS/FC_1968-69_BAT_MOST_RUNS.html| title=Australian First-Class Season 1968/69: Batting - Most Runs| publisher=[[Cricinfo]] |accessdate=2007-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Booth continued to play grade cricket for the St. George club until 1976&amp;ndash;77, leading the batting averages and aggregates in 1974&amp;ndash;75. With 10,674 runs at 45.42, he was fifth on the all-timr run-scoring aggregates in Sydney grade competition at the time of his retirement, but had now dropped to ninth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.cricketnsw.com.au/nswgc/AA/2008/2008_GradeRecords.pdf |publisher=Sydney Cricket Association |page=17 |title=Sydney Grade Cricket Awards and Records | date=2008-12-10 |accessdate=2009-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Style and the place of religion in sport ==
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Brian Booth, that model of a man and of a batsman who tends to be under-rated and forgotten because both he and his cricket were so blamelessly self-effacing. Tall, upright, correct in method, ever-patient, he repeated the hundred he had got at [[the Gabba|Brisbane]], and so gave England a target to go for while all around him were failing. 
:[[E.W. Swanton]]&lt;ref&gt;pp122-123, [[E.W. Swanton]], ''Swanton in Australia with MCC 1946-75'', Fontana, 1977&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Booth was regarded as an elegant batsman who had an erect stance at the crease. He was known for not hitting the ball hard but for having an easy and relaxed style.&lt;ref name=&quot;p246&quot;/&gt; In hockey, a player is not allowed to lift his stick above the shoulders; this background strengthened Booth's forearms and wrists and enabled him to impart momentum on the ball without a large swing of the blade.&lt;ref name=&quot;r274&quot;/&gt; Booth was particularly known for his late cut and his cover drive, which he played in a manner not dissimilar to [[Mark Waugh]].&lt;ref name=&quot;p246&quot;/&gt; He was known for his quick footwork against spin bowling and was rarely stumped, and he had the ability to change his batting tempo.&lt;ref name=&quot;p246&quot;/&gt; Booth quickly got into position and typically moved onto the back foot to cover his stumps.&lt;ref name=&quot;r274&quot;/&gt; A lean player, Booth stood 181&amp;nbsp;cm, weighed 66&amp;nbsp;kg and refrained from smoking, gambling and drinking.&lt;ref name=h257/&gt;&lt;ref name=az/&gt; He was known for his efficient outfielding, and on the second day of the Second Test against the West Indies in Trinidad in 1964&amp;ndash;65, he [[run out|ran out]] [[Gary Sobers]] and [[Basil Butcher]] with strong throws from the outfield. Booth started as a part-time [[leg spin]]ner before converting to [[off spin]].&lt;ref name=&quot;az&quot;/&gt;

Booth had a reputation for walking when he knew that he was out, without waiting for the umpire's decision, and he was regarded as a player and leader of the highest principles.&lt;ref name=&quot;r277&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p245&quot;/&gt; He was known for his record of instilling high standards of conduct into his players and prevented them from showing dissent towards unfavourable umpiring decisions.&lt;ref name=&quot;r277&quot;&gt;Robinson, p. 277.&lt;/ref&gt; Robinson said that &quot;if a prize were offered for fairplaymanship among Australia's post-war cricketers Brian Booth ought to win it hands down&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;r279&quot;&gt;Robinson, p. 279.&lt;/ref&gt; Lawry regarded Booth as one of the most gentlemanly cricketers that he knew.&lt;ref&gt;Coleman, p. 592.&lt;/ref&gt;

A committed [[Christianity|Christian]], Booth is an [[Anglican]] lay-preacher,&lt;ref name=&quot;p245&quot;/&gt; and often invokes religious and ethical arguments while talking about issues such as sportsmanship. Booth became intensely religious in the 1950s after befriending Pastor Roy Gray, a colleague in district cricket and a classmate at Sydney Teachers College.&lt;ref name=h257/&gt; Gray challenged his friend's faith, and Booth reflected that &quot;Until that point, sport had really been my God&quot;.&lt;ref name=h257/&gt; During Booth's career, the media made much of his religious convictions. After scoring his maiden Test century, Booth was asked whether he felt that God was with him.&lt;ref name=h258&gt;Haigh, p. 258.&lt;/ref&gt; He replied in the affirmative, and the next day, a newspaper printed the headline &quot;England can't win. God is on Brian Booth's side.&quot;&lt;ref name=h258/&gt;

Booth co-authored ''Cricket and Christianity'' with [[Paul White (missionary)|Paul White]] and wrote ''Hockey Fundamentals'' and ''Booth to Bat''. In 1998 he wrote ''Sport and sportsmanship: a Christian perspective towards 2000'' for the Australian Christian Forum on Education. He believed that the foundations of sport were courtesy and fairness, and he condemned the prevalence of verbal jousting in the modern game.&lt;ref name=&quot;az&quot;/&gt; During his career, Booth often spoke at religious functions in combination with other Christian cricketers. He appeared with the English Test opener Reverend [[David Sheppard]] at [[Sydney Town Hall]] and preached with [[Conrad Hunte]] in the West Indies.&lt;ref name=&quot;r277&quot;/&gt; 

Despite Booth's views being more genteel than that of most of his team-mates, there was minimal friction or disconnect.&lt;ref name=h257/&gt; Early in his state career, Booth declined to join a [[Melbourne Cup]] gambling sweep organised by captain [[Keith Miller]]. However, Miller included Booth in the event by assigning him to look after the money.&lt;ref name=h257/&gt; Booth said &quot;That was typical of Keith. That he was able to turn something that might have been a problem into something positive, giving me a responsibility, making me feel part of the team.&quot;&lt;ref name=h258/&gt; He added &quot;The boys just accepted me for what I was. If they didn't share the strength of my convictions, they were quite happy for me to hold them.&quot;&lt;ref name=h258/&gt; Simpson said that Booth never attempted to impose his worldview on his teammates and never gave any inkling that he disapproved of their behaviour.&lt;ref name=h258/&gt;
[[Image:SRWaugh.png|thumb|150px|left|Booth strongly criticised the sledging tactics used by the Australian team led by [[Steve Waugh]] ''(pictured)'' |alt=Person aged around 30 wearing a [[baggy green]] cap with the Australian coat of arms, Australian blazer, green with yellow stripes, and a cream cricket shirt.

==Outside cricket==
After retirement, Booth resumed full-time duties as a Sydney schoolmaster. He spent 12 years as a teacher in the government secondary schools of New South Wales before becoming an instructor in physical education at Sydney Teachers College in 1967. Before retiring in 1989, Booth served as the head of the Health and Human Movement Studies Department at the [[Sydney Institute of Education]]&amp;mdash;the successor of the STC&amp;mdash;for five years.&lt;ref name=&quot;az&quot;/&gt; In 1958, he married Judith Williams, whom he met at STC. They had two daughters, the first being born in 1961,&lt;ref name=&quot;p247&quot;&gt;Perry (2000), p. 247.&lt;/ref&gt; and six grandchildren.&lt;ref name=old/&gt; Booth is the uncle of hammer thrower [[Brooke Krueger-Billett]], who represented Australia at the [[2006 Commonwealth Games]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.melbourne2006.com.au/Participants/Participants?ID=110026|title=KRUEGER Brooke |publisher=[[2006 Commonwealth Games]] |accessdate=2007-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967, Booth was appointed as the founding chairman of the Youth Advisory Council, a body that sought to address community issues such as hooliganism.&lt;ref name=&quot;r279&quot;/&gt; Booth was made a life member of the [[New South Wales Cricket Association]] (NSWCA) in 1974 and served as a vice-president for four years from 1973&amp;ndash;74 onwards. He was awarded life membership of the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]], the home of cricket.&lt;ref name=r279/&gt; Booth has remained involved in grassroots cricket with St George.&lt;ref name=old/&gt; He has served as the club president among other positions on the executive committee, and currently serves as a coach.&lt;ref name=old/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://sportstar.in/tss3046/stories/20071117501701700.htm |title=It’s love for the game  |publisher=[[Sportstar]] |author=Simpson, Bob |date=2007-11-17 |accessdate=2009-09-08 |authorlink=Bob Simpson (cricketer)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pavilion at the club's home ground, Hurstville Oval, is jointly named in his honour.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Brian Booth And Warren Saunders Tribute

In 1974, Booth gained preselection as the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]] candidate for the [[Division of St George]], standing against Science Minister [[William Morrison (Australian politician)|William Morrison]] of the ruling [[Australian Labor Party]] in the [[Australian federal election, 1974|federal election]].&lt;ref name=&quot;r279&quot;/&gt; The seat, which had changed hands at several elections in the past, was held by Morrison &lt;!--who had captured 55.0% of the [[two party preferred]] vote [[Australian federal election, 1972|in 1972]].
