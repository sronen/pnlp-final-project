'''Arthur Joseph Houtteman''' (August 7, 1927&amp;nbsp;– May 6, 2003) was an American [[right-handed]] [[pitcher]] in [[Major League Baseball]] who played for 12 seasons in the [[American League]] with the [[Detroit Tigers]], [[Cleveland Indians]] and [[Baltimore Orioles]]. In 325 career games, Houtteman pitched 1,555 [[innings pitched|innings]] and posted a [[win (baseball)|win-loss record]] of 87–91, with 78 [[complete game]]s, 14 [[shutout]]s, and a 4.14 [[earned run average]] (ERA).

Known on the [[wikt:sandlot|sandlot]] for his pitching motion, Houtteman was signed by [[scout (sport)|scout]] [[Wish Egan]] in 1945 at 17&amp;nbsp;years of age. He was recruited by major league teams, and joined a Tigers pitching staff that had lost players to injuries and [[World War II]]. After moving between the major and [[minor league baseball|minor league]]s over the next few years, he was nearly killed in a driving accident just before the 1949 season. Houtteman rebounded from his injuries and went on to win 15 games that season and made his only [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]] appearance in the following year.

He played three more seasons with the Tigers, then was sold to Cleveland, where he pitched for the [[pennant (sports)|pennant]]-winning Indians during their [[1954 Cleveland Indians season|1954 season]]. After losing his [[starting pitcher|starting]] job, he played two more seasons with the Indians before he was bought by the Orioles, and he finished his final season in Major League Baseball with them. Houtteman ended his baseball career in the minor leagues and became a sales executive in [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]]. In 2003, Houtteman died at the age of 75.

==Early life==
Art Houtteman was born in [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]], [[Michigan]] on August 7, 1927. He was a second-generation American citizen; his grandfather Joseph had [[emigration|emigrated]] from [[Belgium]]. The only son born to the Houtteman family, Art's father, also named Arthur, vowed that his son would become a major league player by the time he turned 17.&lt;ref name=sabr&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bioproj.sabr.org/bioproj.cfm?a=v&amp;v=l&amp;bid=1155&amp;pid=6589|first=Warren|last=Corbett|title=The Baseball Biography Project: Art Houtteman|publisher=The Society for American Baseball Research|accessdate=2008-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Houtteman played baseball at [[Detroit Catholic Central High School]], where his pitching caught the attention of baseball scout [[Wish Egan]], who praised Houtteman's &quot;perfect pitching motion&quot;.&lt;ref name=sabr/&gt; Houtteman was signed by the Detroit Tigers late in 1944 and began to practice with the Tigers in [[spring training]] before the 1945 season along with fellow Detroit sandlot player [[Billy Pierce]]. He spent most of the 1945 season playing for Detroit's top [[minor league baseball|minor league]] affiliate, the [[Buffalo Bisons]].&lt;ref name=sabr/&gt; However, injuries plagued the Tigers' pitching staff, and the 17-year-old Houtteman was recruited by the major league roster and began his professional career.&lt;ref name=sabr/&gt;

==Detroit Tigers==
===Hard Luck Houtteman===
Due to the Tigers' pitching injuries, and many top players' serving their country as [[World War II]] was coming to a close (Houtteman was too young for the draft), Houtteman made his debut on April 29.&lt;ref name=br&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/h/houttar01.shtml|title=Art Houtteman Statistics|work=Baseball-Reference.com|publisher=Sports Reference, LLC|accessdate=2009-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; At 17&amp;nbsp;years old, he debuted as the youngest player in the American League in the [[1945 Detroit Tigers season|1945 season]].&lt;ref name=br/&gt; After two months of major league experience, Houtteman was [[Major League Baseball transactions#Options|optioned]] to Buffalo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Deals of the Week: Majors-Minors|work=[[The Sporting News]]|page=16|date=June 21, 1945}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 20, Houtteman threw a [[no-hitter]] through seven innings, facing only 22 batters in the process, but lost the game 2–0 in [[extra innings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Cy|last=Kritzer|title=International League (continued from page 19)|work=The Sporting News|page=20|date=June 28, 1945}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the course of the season, Houtteman appeared in 13 games as a [[relief pitcher]], he finished with zero [[win (baseball)|wins]], two [[loss (baseball)|losses]], and an [[earned run average|ERA]] of 5.33 in just over 25 [[innings pitched]].&lt;ref name=br/&gt; He was not on the active roster, and as a result did not pitch during the Tigers' [[1945 World Series|World Series]] victory over the [[Chicago Cubs]].

[[File:Art Houtteman.png|thumb|right|Houtteman on the cover of Baseball Digest.]]
Houtteman was the youngest player during the 1946 major league season. However, he only played one game for the Tigers in 1946, allowing eight [[run (baseball)|runs]] and fifteen [[hit (baseball)|hits]] in eight innings.&lt;ref name=br/&gt; He spent most of the 1946 season in the minor leagues, and finished the 1946 minor league season with a 16–13 record and leading the league in strikeouts.&lt;ref name=sabr/&gt; At the end of the season, Houtteman was declared by six of the eight [[International League]] managers as the top pitching prospect in the league.&lt;ref name=minorleague&gt;{{cite news|first=Cy|last=Kritzer|title=Houtteman Tagged &quot;Can't Miss&quot;, Int Pilots Rate Righthander as Top Hill Prospect|work=The Sporting News|page=25|date=September 25, 1946}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was called the top prospect due to his leading the league in strikeouts, with nearly 150, pitching over 200 innings, finishing second in victories with 16, and finishing the season with an 11–2 road record.&lt;ref name=minorleague/&gt; Minor league third baseman Johnny Bero liked Houtteman's fielding ability so much that he called him &quot;a fifth infielder.&quot;&lt;ref name=minorleague/&gt;

Despite his newfound top prospect status, Houtteman remained in Buffalo at the beginning of the 1947 season.&lt;ref name=sabr/&gt; After spending a few months honing his pitching with Buffalo, he was promoted to the Tigers' roster in July.&lt;ref name=sabr/&gt; He occupied the [[bullpen]] for a time, and did not get much action. However, after [[Hal Newhouser]], [[Fred Hutchinson]], and [[Dizzy Trout]] were used in a two-day period, Tigers coach [[Steve O'Neill]] decided to give Houtteman the start against the [[Minnesota Twins|Washington Senators]], the second start of his career.&lt;ref name=spoelstra&gt;{{cite news|first=Watson|last=Spoelstra|title=Freshmen Houtteman and Wertz Win Their Stripes as Tigers|work=The Sporting News|page=14|date=September 3, 1947}}&lt;/ref&gt; Houtteman tossed a five-hit shutout in a Tigers' victory against the Senators, to which Tigers' [[General manager (baseball)|general manager]] [[Billy Evans]] said, &quot;In 40&amp;nbsp;years I've never seen a better pitching job by a first year pitcher. We now know that Houtteman is really a big leaguer&quot;.&lt;ref name=spoelstra/&gt; Houtteman followed this up with another five-hit victory against the [[Boston Red Sox]],&lt;ref name=spoelstra/&gt; then pitched a three-hit shutout in September against the [[Baltimore Orioles|St. Louis Browns]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Houtteman Halts Browns For Tigers; Young Pitcher Yields Only 3 Blows for 2–0 Triumph -- Swift Drives a Homer|url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10B1FFD3858147B93C5A91782D85F438485F9|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|work=Sports|page=S2|date=September 7, 1947}}&lt;/ref&gt; He finished the season with a 7–2 record, a 3.42 ERA, seven complete games, and two shutouts.&lt;ref name=br/&gt; Houtteman's efforts during the [[1947 Detroit Tigers season]] caught the attention of [[New York Yankees]] star and future [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Hall of Famer]] [[Joe DiMaggio]], who said of Houtteman and [[Bob Lemon]], &quot;They have more stuff and more pitching sense than any other young fellows I've seen come up in a long while&quot;.&lt;ref name=sabr/&gt;

The [[1948 Detroit Tigers season]] began with Houtteman as a starting pitcher in the Tigers' rotation. Things started off poorly, however, as Houtteman lost his first eight decisions.&lt;ref name=sabr/&gt; Two of the first five losses, though, were by one run, and he did not have much help from the Tigers' lineup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Watson|last=Spoelstra|title=Everybody, Including Hal, Scratching Heads Over Newhouser's Dip|work=The Sporting News|page=10|date=May 26, 1948}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 0–8 start and lack of run support led to the beginning of the media's nickname for him, &quot;Hard Luck Houtteman&quot;.&lt;ref name=sabr/&gt; His first victory of the season came in a game against the Senators, in which he drove in the winning run.&lt;ref name=sabr/&gt; After winning his next start, he defeated the [[Oakland Athletics|Philadelphia Athletics]] in a five-hit affair, and avoided another loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hard-Luck Houtteman Beats Harder-Luck Brissie, 2 to 1|publisher=[[The Washington Post]]|work=Sports|page=21|date=June 17, 1948}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then lost eight more games to finish the season at 2–16.&lt;ref name=br/&gt; His teammates and media declared that it was bad luck rather than bad pitching, and claimed that he was still a touted prospect. Hal Newhouser said, &quot;The kid has had nothing but bad luck since the season opened&quot;,&lt;ref name=luck&gt;{{cite news|first=H. G.|last=Salsinger|title=Art Houtteman Boasts Everything But Luck|work=The Sporting News|page=11|date=August 28, 1948}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Fred Hutchinson said, &quot;He should not have lost more than three or four games had he gotten an even break&quot;.&lt;ref name=luck/&gt; Houtteman finished the season with a 2–16 record and a 4.66 ERA; however, his ERA was only 0.06 higher than the major league average.&lt;ref name=sabr/&gt;

As spring training for the [[1949 Detroit Tigers season]] began, Houtteman was still a part of the roster when he was nearly killed. In [[Lakeland, Florida]] on March 10, 1949, Houtteman was driving home from [[Florida Southern College]] when he crashed into a fruit truck, and fractured his skull.&lt;ref name=sabr/&gt; Despite his original critical condition, he made a rapid recovery and was able to talk with his teammates two days after the accident, and told them, &quot;I'll be able to pitch sooner than you&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tiger Age Rallies From Auto Injury; Houtteman, Skull Fractured, Regains Consciousness in Hospital at Lakeland|url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F70D15F63B5A157B93C0A81788D85F4D8485F9|publisher=The New York Times|work=Sports|page=13|date=March 12, 1949}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within two weeks, the Tigers were optimistic that their pitcher would be able to play again by June.&lt;ref name=injury&gt;{{cite news|first=Lyall|last=Smith|title=Tigers Hope for Houtteman's Return by June, Hurler Won't be Taken Off Club's Active Player List|work=The Sporting News|page=11|date=March 23, 1949}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the injuries to Houtteman and Yankees star catcher [[Yogi Berra]] due to car accidents, Cleveland Indians manager [[Lou Boudreau]] banned Indians players from driving, which forced them to ride chartered buses to exhibition games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Auto Driving by Indians Banned by Lou Boudreau|work = The New York Times|page=38|date=March 15, 1949}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ace of the staff===
Houtteman marked his return to the Tigers' rotation on May 21, 1949, but he lost his first three decisions.&lt;ref name=sabr/&gt; His performance improved, however, as he began to earn more victories in the 1949 season. These wins included a five-hit 2–1 victory over the [[New York Yankees]] on July 23.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Art Houtteman Stops Yankees|publisher=[[Chicago Tribune|Chicago Daily Tribune]]|date=July 24, 1949}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the course of the season, Houtteman beat each American League club at least once and beat the Yankees and Red Sox three times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Watson|last=Spoelstra|title=Houtteman Now Able to Hoot at Sophomore-Year Hoodoo|work=The Sporting News|page=10|date=September 14, 1949}}&lt;/ref&gt; He finished the season with a 15–10 record, a 3.71 ERA, 13 complete games, and two shutouts.&lt;ref name=br/&gt; He was placed in [[Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award|most valuable player]] (MVP) voting, and received three points and finished tied for 22nd with teammate [[Virgil Trucks]].&lt;ref name=br/&gt; The Philadelphia Sports Writers Association honored him as the year's &quot;Most Courageous Athlete&quot; because of his injury and comeback.&lt;ref name=sabr/&gt;

As the [[1950 Detroit Tigers season]] started, Houtteman was on a high note, pitching all of spring training without allowing a [[base on balls|walk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Watson|last=Spoelstra|title='50 Tiger Edition Best In My Time&amp;nbsp;— Newhouser|page=10|work=The Sporting News|date=April 26, 1950}}&lt;/ref&gt; He won his tenth game of the season on June 28, 1950, and became the first pitcher to hit the 10-win mark alongside [[Bob Lemon]]. After the game, he told an [[Associated Press]] reporter that he was just about convinced that Lady Luck had decided to give him a break after kicking him around for the past two or three years.&lt;ref name=Luck&gt;{{cite news|author=Associated Press|title=Modest Art Houtteman Sees ‘Good Chance’ of Winning 20|publisher=Ironwood Daily Globe|date=June 30, 1950}}&lt;/ref&gt; Houtteman said, &quot;I've been having a pretty good year and it sure feels good after some of the things that have happened to me&quot;.&lt;ref name=Luck/&gt; A week into July, Houtteman notched his eleventh victory, and only lost five games, in a 6–1 win against the [[Baltimore Orioles|St. Louis Browns]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Houtteman Checks Browns for Tigers; Keeps Mates in 4-Game Lead by Scattering Nine Hits for 11th Victory, 6-1|work=The New York Times|page=33|date=July 6, 1950}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just a few days later, Houtteman was named to the [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]] roster alongside fellow Tigers including [[Ted Gray]], [[George Kell]] and [[Hoot Evers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Yankees Topped Selections, With Eight|work=The Sporting News|page=12|date=July 12, 1950}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1950 All-Star game, Houtteman pitched three innings and batted once. He allowed one [[earned run]], three hits, and one walk, his one earned run coming in the ninth inning which made the game go to [[extra innings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1950/B07110ALS1950.htm|title=1950 All-Star Game Box Score|publisher=Retrosheet|accessdate=2008-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Houtteman continued his successful season in the second half. On August 19, he faced the Browns and pitched a [[no-hitter|one-hitter]], and faced the minimum 27 batters in the process.&lt;ref name=sabr/&gt; Houtteman ended the season just short of Ted Gray's prediction of 20 victories, and finished the season with a 19–12 record.&lt;ref name=br/&gt; He led the league in shutouts with four and was second in [[games started]] with 34, second in innings pitched with 274.7, third in wins, and third in complete games with 21. His ERA of 3.54 was good for fifth in the American League.&lt;ref name=br/&gt; He also earned six points in MVP voting, and finished tied for 24th.&lt;ref name=br/&gt; On October 2, the day after the 1950 season ended, Houtteman married Shelagh Marie Kelly. They met in New York's [[Catskill Mountains]] at Grossinger's Resort.&lt;ref name=sabr/&gt;

===Military and return to Tigers===
Before the start of the 1951 season, Houtteman was drafted into the [[United States Army|Army]]. He had originally been classified [[4F (military conscription)|4-F]], or medically ineligible for the draft, because of a high school knee injury, and he felt that he was drafted only because he was a prominent athlete.&lt;ref name=sabr/&gt; He served in the heavy weapons division of the Army, where the roar of the big guns sent pains throbbing through Houtteman's head and gave him severe headaches, which doctors believed was a lingering effect of the skull fracture three years earlier.&lt;ref name=sabr/&gt; As a result, the Army reclassified Houtteman as not fully qualified for combat duty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Army Shifts Houtteman; Former Tiger Hurler Is Found Not Qualified for Combat|work = The New York Times|work=Sports|page=33|date=January 18, 1951}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to a medical discharge on September 15, 1951. Speaking of his time in the Army, Houtteman said, &quot;I spent most of my time in the Army hospital. I did play a little ball at [[Fort Pickett|Camp Pickett]]&quot;, Virginia.&lt;ref name=Stars&gt;{{cite news|author=Hand, Jack|title=Tigers' Flag Hopes Rest On Return By Houtteman|publisher=Pacific Stars and Stripes|date=March 14, 1952}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When he returned to the Tigers for spring training in 1952, Tigers' manager [[Red Rolfe]] noted, &quot;Artie could be our best pitcher. He's the slump-breaking type, a guy who can throw a shutout once in a while&quot;.&lt;ref name=Stars/&gt; After a poor season without Houtteman in 1951, Rolfe predicted, &quot;We'll be back in the first division this season because Art Houtteman is back. Houtteman makes us at least a dozen games better than &lt;nowiki&gt;[last year's Tigers' team]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Northard, Lloyd|title=Rolfe Picks Tigers For First Division; Expects Houtteman To Be Difference; Trucks, Cain Figure In Pitching Plans|publisher=Pacific Stars and Stripes|date=January 19, 1952}}&lt;/ref&gt; Houtteman worked out in Detroit with pitcher Ted Gray over the winter before the 1952 season. Before the season started, Houtteman said, &quot;It all depends on how I get off. I'm anxious to get into the season. My arm doesn't feel any different than it did in '50. I hope I can do even better than my last year&quot;.&lt;ref name=Stars/&gt; Houtteman also took number&amp;nbsp;21 on his uniform, the number he had when he first arrived with the Tigers, because he felt that it had given both him and teammate George Kell, who won a batting title with the number, good luck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Lyall|last=Smith|title=Houtteman Off Flying With 21—on Back of Shirt|work=The Sporting News|page=15|date=March 19, 1952}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It appeared that &quot;Hard Luck Houtteman&quot; had returned as the [[1952 Detroit Tigers season]] began. On April 2, 1952, just before the season started, Art lost his seven-month old daughter in an automobile accident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Art Houtteman Loses Daughter In Auto Crash|publisher=Chicago Daily Tribune|work=Part 4|date=April 4, 1952}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an April 26 matchup against the Cleveland Indians, with two outs in the bottom of the ninth, Houtteman was one out away from a no-hitter when he threw a [[fastball]] that was &quot;supposed to sink&quot; but did not, which Harry hit for a [[single (baseball)|single]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Art Houtteman Loses No Hitter In Ninth Inning|publisher=[[The Hartford Courant]]| url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/courant/access/891594642.html?dids=891594642:891594642&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;date=Apr+27%2C+1952&amp;author=&amp;pub=The+Hartford+Courant&amp;desc=Art+Houtteman+Loses+No+Hitter+In+Ninth+Inning| work=The World of Sports|page=C1|date=April 27, 1952|accessdate=2008-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Houtteman said, &quot;This was the only pitch I shook Ginsberg off the whole game&quot;, and for years afterwards, catcher [[Joe Ginsberg]] repeatedly said to Houtteman, &quot;If you'd listened to me, I'd have you in the Hall of Fame&quot;.&lt;ref name=sabr/&gt; Detroit won the game by a score of 13–0. After losing his tenth game on June 22, manager Red Rolfe moved Houtteman out of the starting rotation and into the bullpen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Watson|last=Spoelstra|title=Rolfe Summons Old Guard to Halt Tigers' Waterloo|work=The Sporting News|page=15|date=July 2, 1952}}&lt;/ref&gt; He finished the year with an 8–20 record and a 4.36 ERA.&lt;ref name=br/&gt; His 20th loss came on September 21 against the Indians, and he became the first Tiger to lose 20 games since [[Bobo Newsom]] in 1941.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Watson|last=Spoelstra|title=Houtteman First 20-Loss Tiger Since Bobo in 1941|work=The Sporting News|page=19|date=October 1, 1952}}&lt;/ref&gt; His disappointing season led to the possibility of a trade, with general manager [[Charlie Gehringer]] acknowledging that Houtteman might be traded if the right offer came along.&lt;ref name=sabr/&gt;

Houtteman spent the offseason selling cars and making public appearances for the Detroit Tigers.&lt;ref name=sabr/&gt; During the [[1953 Detroit Tigers season]] there were rumors of possible trades for Houtteman, with the Yankees proposing the possibility of trading [[Hank Bauer]], an infielder, and [[Gil McDougald]] for Houtteman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Edgar|last=Munzel|title=Slugger and Pitcher Head Lane's Phoenix Shop List|work=The Sporting News|page=20|date=December 3, 1952}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gehringer said of Houtteman's high trading price, &quot;Art has always had good stuff—much too good to be a 20-game loser&quot;.&lt;ref name=sabr/&gt; That season, he was used as both a starter and reliever during the season. However, he lost six straight decisions, and by the middle of June had a 2–6 record and a 5.90 ERA.&lt;ref name=br/&gt; This marked the end of his career as a Tiger.

==Cleveland Indians==
On June 15, 1953, Houtteman was traded by the Tigers, along with [[Owen Friend]], Joe Ginsberg and [[Bill Wight]], to the Cleveland Indians for [[Ray Boone]], [[Al Aber]], [[Steve Gromek]] and [[Dick Weik]].&lt;ref name=br/&gt; In July 1953, he returned to Detroit to pitch against the Tigers. At the time, Houtteman admitted he wanted to be traded.  He said, &quot;The fans are down on me and I'd do everybody a lot more good by being traded&quot;.&lt;ref name=wire&gt;{{cite news|author=Associated Press wire service|title=Houtteman Halts Former Mates Before Large Crowd at Detroit|publisher=Ironwood Daily Globe (AP report)|date=July 1, 1953}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was not content with the Tigers and said there were times when it seemed he &quot;couldn't wait to peel off his uniform after a game&quot;.&lt;ref name=wire/&gt; As a result of Indians' pitching coach [[Mel Harder]] doing a &quot;complete&quot; overhaul, Houtteman was moved into the starting rotation, to replace [[Bob Feller]].&lt;ref name=sabr/&gt; Houtteman finished the season in Cleveland with a 7–7 record, six complete games, one shutout, 109 innings pitched, and a 3.80 ERA.&lt;ref name=br/&gt;

At the start of the [[1954 Cleveland Indians season]], Houtteman's second daughter, Hollis Ann, was born on February 22.&lt;ref name=sabr/&gt; His pitching continued to improve under Mel Harder, who &quot;got me to quit experimenting and to seek my natural delivery&quot;.&lt;ref name=hoot&gt;{{cite news|first=Hal|last=Lebovitz|title=Houtteman Hoots at Hard-Luck Label|work=The Sporting News|page=5|date=June 2, 1954}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Indians used him when they could, especially in extra inning affairs. In the Indians' first six extra inning games, Houtteman was used three times.&lt;ref name=hoot/&gt; As a result, Houtteman finished the season with a career-high 11 complete games.&lt;ref name=br/&gt; The Indians also began to use Houtteman and Feller for [[doubleheader (baseball)|doubleheader]]s with great success, as they had a 9–1 record after their first five doubleheaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Hal|last=Lebovitz|title=High-Voltage Vets From Bench Keep Crippled Injuns in Race|work=The Sporting News|page=9|date=June 30, 1954}}&lt;/ref&gt; Houtteman finished the season with a 15–7 record, a 3.35 ERA, and 188 innings pitched.&lt;ref name=br/&gt; In the [[1954 World Series]] with the Indians, he pitched two innings in Game 3 against the [[San Francisco Giants|New York Giants]], allowing one run and striking out one batter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://baseball-almanac.com/box-scores/boxscore.php?boxid=195410010CLE|title=1953 World Series Game 3 Box Score|publisher=Baseball Almanac|accessdate=2008-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[1955 Cleveland Indians season]] originally planned to use Houtteman as the number four pitcher on the starting rotation, as he had been the previous year. He saw himself remaining the fourth starter, and said, &quot;[[Herb Score]] won't beat me out of the fourth starting job with the Indians&quot; on April 11.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Larry|last=Middlemas|title=Cracks That Splintered the Crystal Ball|work=The Sporting News|page=11|date=January 4, 1956}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he became a [[spot starter]], as he lost his starting position to Score, the &quot;most talked-about rookie in all the major league training camps&quot;.&lt;ref name=sabr/&gt; He split starting time with Bob Feller and finished the season with a 10–6 record, a 3.98 ERA, and three complete games.&lt;ref name=br/&gt; On December 29, 1955, Houtteman's first son, Jeff, was born with assistance from [[National Football League]] player [[Leon Hart]], who was visiting Houtteman and helped deliver the baby.&lt;ref name=sabr/&gt;

Houtteman remained a reliever during the [[1956 Cleveland Indians season]]. He continued to get trade offers in 1956, though, as the [[Chicago White Sox]] were willing to trade outfielder [[Jim Rivera]] for him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Oscar|last=Ruhl|title=from the Ruhl Book|work=The Sporting News|page=17|date=March 28, 1956}}&lt;/ref&gt; A three-team, nine-player deal involving Houtteman again becoming part of the White Sox along with [[George Strickland (baseball)|George Strickland]] was also scrapped at the last second.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bunts and Boots|work=The Sporting News|page=25|date=March 28, 1956}}&lt;/ref&gt; Houtteman finished the 1956 season having only made 22 appearances on the mound, earning a 2–2 record. However, he had a high ERA of 6.56, his highest since 1946, when he made one appearance.&lt;ref name=br/&gt;

As the [[1957 Cleveland Indians season]] neared, tension was running high. There was talk about Houtteman's being &quot;in the doghouse&quot;, or out of favor with the team's management, during the 1956 season due to his lack of starts. According to sportswriter [[Hal Lebovitz]], this was a result of the starting five for the Indians, including spot starter Feller, pitching very well during spring training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Hal|last=Lebovitz|title=Avila Whiffs Help Furrow Senor's Brow|work=The Sporting News|page=8|date=June 6, 1956}}&lt;/ref&gt; Houtteman was again brought up in trade rumors, along with [[Mike Garcia (AL pitcher)|Mike Garcia]], since the Indians were loaded with pitching talent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Hal|last=Lebovitz|title=Hank Gets a New Worry&amp;nbsp;— Wertz in Hospital Check|work=The Sporting News|page=18|date=November 28, 1956}}&lt;/ref&gt; When manager [[Al Lopez]] was replaced by [[Kerby Farrell]], Houtteman did, in fact, land in Farrell's doghouse. Farrell called him out front of his teammates after a poor performance in spring training.&lt;ref name=sabr/&gt; Houtteman pitched only four innings in three games for the Indians in 1957.&lt;ref name=br/&gt;

==Baltimore Orioles and minor leagues==
Houtteman was put on the trading block before the 1957 season, but he drew no serious offers because Cleveland seemed desperate to trade him.&lt;ref name=sabr/&gt; On May 20, after playing three games for the Indians, Houtteman was sold to the Baltimore Orioles for an undisclosed amount.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Baltimore Buys Art Houtteman|publisher=[[Christian Science Monitor]]|work=Sports|date=May 20, 1957}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hal Lebovitz called Houtteman &quot;a pitcher of considerable promise but who somehow has yet to cash in on it&quot;, despite the fact that he was in his 12th and final major league season.&lt;ref name=sabr/&gt; During the [[1957 Baltimore Orioles season]], Houtteman made four relief appearances before he was demoted to the [[Vancouver Mounties]] of the [[Pacific Coast League]].&lt;ref name=sabr/&gt; He was brought back up to the major league roster to pitch on September 22, the final start of his major league career.&lt;ref name=sabr/&gt; In his final game, he pitched 2⅓ innings, allowing three runs on seven hits and throwing two strikeouts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/pi/gl.cgi?n1=houttar01&amp;t=p&amp;year=1957|title=Art Houtteman 1957 Pitching Gamelogs|publisher=Baseball-Reference|accessdate=2008-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Just before the 1958 season began, Houtteman was cut by the Orioles, ending his major league career.&lt;ref name=br/&gt; Shortly after being cut, he signed on with the [[Charleston Senators]], a farm club of the Tigers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Frank|last=Haraway|title=Art Houtteman to Attempt Comeback With Charleston|work=The Sporting News|page=35|date=May 7, 1958}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had a 3.25 ERA and a 7–9 record for the Senators at the end of the 1958 season.&lt;ref name=sabr/&gt; In 1959, the [[Oakland Athletics|Kansas City Athletics]] decided to give him a tryout. However, despite what was described as an &quot;impressive&quot; performance, they cut Houtteman as they were looking for more youthful arms.&lt;ref name=sabr/&gt; Houtteman signed with the [[Portland Beavers]] of the Pacific Coast League, and posted a 6–9 record with an ERA of 3.69 for the season.&lt;ref name=sabr/&gt; After the season ended, and after a third daughter, Sharon, was born in 1959, Houtteman announced his retirement from baseball at the age of 32.&lt;ref name=sabr/&gt;

==Later life==
After retiring from professional baseball, Houtteman kept baseball a part of his life and became a sports reporter for a television station in Detroit for a time. He later became a sales executive with Paragon Steel in Detroit, where he served until reaching the age of retirement. He was in attendance for the last game at [[Tiger Stadium (Detroit)|Tiger Stadium]] in 1999. Houtteman died on May 6, 2003, at the age of 75, of an apparent [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] at his home in [[Rochester Hills, Michigan]]. He was survived by his wife, three children, and six grandchildren.&lt;ref name=sabr/&gt;&lt;!--Note that this reference covers the entire section.--&gt;
