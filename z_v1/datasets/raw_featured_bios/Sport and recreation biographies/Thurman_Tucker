'''Thurman Lowell Tucker''' (September 26, 1917{{spaced ndash}}May 7, 1993) was an [[United States|American]] [[center fielder]] in [[Major League Baseball]] who played for nine seasons in the [[American League]] with the [[Chicago White Sox]] and [[Cleveland Indians]]. In 701 career games, Tucker recorded a [[batting average]] of .255 and accumulated 24 [[triple (baseball)|triples]], 9 [[home run]]s, and 179 [[runs batted in]] (RBI). He was nicknamed &quot;Joe E.&quot; Tucker because of his resemblance to comedian [[Joe E. Brown]].&lt;ref name=digest&gt;{{cite news|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=pTIDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA81#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|first=Bob|last=DuVall|title=Whatever Became Of....|work=[[Baseball Digest]]|date=July 1971|page=81|accessdate=July 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Born and raised in Texas, Tucker first played professionally with the [[Siloam Springs Travelers]]. After gradually progressing through minor league baseball, he was signed by the Chicago White Sox before the 1941 season. His major league debut came the following year and he spent two years as the White Sox's starting center fielder until he enlisted in the armed forces during World War II. Upon his return, Tucker played two more seasons for the White Sox. Subsequently, he was traded to the Cleveland Indians, for whom he played four years, and continued to play minor league baseball throughout the 1950s. After his retirement, he became a major league scout and insurance agent.

==Early life==
Thurman Tucker was born on September 26, 1917 and raised in [[Gordon, Texas]]. In high school, he was a three-sport athlete, playing baseball (where he was a [[second baseman]]), [[basketball]], and [[track and field]]. After graduating in 1935, he played semi-professional baseball and enrolled in a baseball school located in [[Hot Springs, Arkansas]]. In 1936 at age 18, Tucker signed as a professional with the [[Fayetteville Bears]] of the [[Arkansas-Missouri League]], but left the team after only two weeks, without playing a game. Soon after, he was signed by the [[Siloam Springs Travelers]] of the same league, where he began his professional career.&lt;ref name=vaughan&gt;{{cite news|first=Irving|last=Vaughan|title=They Laugh When Tucker Makes Joe Brown Faces, But He's No Joke to Rivals When He Runs the Bases|work=[[The Sporting News]]|date=June 17, 1943|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Minor league career==
In 1936, his first season with the Travelers, Tucker changed fielding positions and became an outfielder.&lt;ref name=vaughan/&gt; In 117 games, he had a .319 [[batting average]] and 25 [[double (baseball)|doubles]].&lt;ref name=brm&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/player.cgi?id=tucker001thu|title=Thurman Tucker Minor League Statistics &amp; History|work=[[Baseball-Reference]]|publisher=Sports Reference, LLC|accessdate=July 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, he was to play for the [[El Dorado Lions]] of the [[Cotton States League]], but a back injury caused him to miss nearly the entire season.&lt;ref name=vaughan/&gt; After recovering from the injury, Tucker continued to progress through the minors, spending 1938 with two separate clubs; he played 55 games for the [[Abbeville A's]] of the [[Evangeline Baseball League]] and 50 games for the [[Greenville Bucks]] of the Cotton States League.&lt;ref name=brm/&gt; He remained in the Cotton States League for 1939, playing for the [[Clarksdale Red Sox]], at the time a minor league affiliate of the [[Boston Red Sox]]. In 136 games for Clarksdale, Tucker had a .298 batting average and 10 [[triple (baseball)|triples]].&lt;ref name=brm/&gt; During his first few years in the minor leagues, one manager asked him to take up [[clowning]] due to his resemblance to [[Joe E. Brown]] and his nickname as a result, Joe E. Tucker objected due to his serious nature and the idea was later dropped.&lt;ref name=vaughan/&gt;

Tucker's breakthrough minor league year came in 1940, his second with Clarksdale. By the end of June, he was leading the Cotton State League with a batting average of .374.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cotton States League|work=The Sporting News|date=June 27, 1940|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; After playing in 97 games, finishing with an average of .390, Tucker was promoted and played in 40 games for the [[Oklahoma City Indians]].&lt;ref name=brm/&gt; At the end of the season, Chicago White Sox [[farm team|farm]] manager Billy Webb was impressed enough to purchase Tucker's contract from Oklahoma City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dykes Checks Off For Untouchables|work=The Sporting News|date=November 14, 1940|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the beginning of the 1941 season, Tucker failed to win the final outfield spot on the White Sox roster from [[Dave Short]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=CXtGAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=_ucMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1132,1624782|title=White Sox May Worry Other Clubs if New Talent Produces|work=[[Schenectady Gazette]]|page=31|date=March 14, 1941}}&lt;/ref&gt; and consequently spent 1941 at Oklahoma City, where he was coached by [[Rogers Hornsby]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tucker, Back From White Sox, Delights Oklahoma City Fans|work=The Sporting News|first=John|last=Cronley|page=8|date=April 10, 1941}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 141 games for the Indians, Tucker had a batting average of .246 and 12 triples.&lt;ref name=brm/&gt;

At spring training for the 1942 season, Tucker competed against [[Dave Philley]] for the final outfield spot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=HFdZAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=WkgNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4106,3020088|title=White Sox Need Batting Strength If They Are To Be Title Threat|work=[[Painesville Telegraph]]|page=7|date=March 31, 1942}}&lt;/ref&gt; White Sox management liked Tucker's defensive abilities, leading to them adding Tucker to their 1942 major league roster; Tucker made his major league debut on April 14, 1942.&lt;ref name=br&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/t/tucketh01.shtml|title=Thurman Tucker Statistics and History|work=Baseball-Reference|publisher=Sports Reference, LLC|accessdate=May 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; After playing two games for the White Sox, Tucker was sent down to the [[Fort Worth Cats (Texas League)|Fort Worth Cats]] of the [[Texas League]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tucker Released|work=[[Christian Science Monitor]]|page=16|date=April 28, 1942}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he spent most of the season and hit .313 in 144 games.&lt;ref name=brm/&gt; When the minor league season ended, Tucker returned to the major league squad, and finished the year having played seven games for the White Sox.&lt;ref name=br/&gt;

==Chicago White Sox==
Of the Chicago White Sox outfielders at the beginning of the 1943 season, only [[Wally Moses]] was assured of a place on the team. During spring training, manager [[Jimmy Dykes]] was impressed by Tucker, who was competing for the starting center fielder position alongside [[Moose Solters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rookies Hold Key to ChiSox Fortunes|work=[[The Palm Beach Post]]|date=March 28, 1943|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, after spring training Tucker became the starting center fielder for 1943, and the team's [[leadoff hitter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Speedy Tucker ChiSox Fielder|work=[[Prescott Evening Courier]]|date=April 16, 1943|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Partway through the season, Tucker's performance caught the eye of American League President [[Will Harridge]], who noted him as someone the public came out to watch in the absence of stars serving in World War II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Hugh|last=Fullerton, Jr.|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=APouAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=8tsFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3115,306619|title=Absence of Stars Means Close Race|work=[[Ottawa Citizen]]|date=June 2, 1943|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among Tucker's achievements during the year were a [[walk-off home run]] on July 26 to win a game against the [[New York Yankees]] 2–1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cardinals Continue Pennant March|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=tSRdAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=v1oNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2413,2350213|work=[[Lawrence Journal-World]]|date=July 26, 1943|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tucker finished the season with a .235 batting average, six triples, and 79 [[base on balls|walks]] in 135 games. He also stole 29 bases, the third best total in the AL, and was caught stealing 17 times, which was second in the league.&lt;ref name=br/&gt;

Tucker passed a physical examination for the [[United States Navy]] before the 1944 season began. Although expected to be called up to serve in the war that year,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=o4dHAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=qHwMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5355,4632610|title=Briefs From Training Camps|work=[[Warsaw Daily Times]]|date=March 23, 1944|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was able to play the entire season for the White Sox. Tucker hit very well during the first month of 1944; he had a .403 batting average on May 16, which led the American League.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=IK4qAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=k2QEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1633,3055027|title=Yesterday's Stars|work=[[Sarasota Herald-Tribune]]|date=May 17, 1944|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; His hitting and fielding abilities impressed critics: sportswriter [[Fred Lieb]] noted him as a breakout performer that year,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Fred|last=Lieb|authorlink=Fred Lieb|title=Hats Off!|work=The Sporting News|date=May 25, 1944|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and manager Jimmy Dykes called Tucker the finest defensive outfielder in the American League.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=KkgKAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=mUoDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6621,1309410|title=Dykes Thinks Tucker's No. 1 Star of Loop|work=[[Ellensburg Daily Record]]|date=June 3, 1944|page=6|accessdate=January 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tucker and [[Dixie Walker]] led their respective leagues in batting average throughout June; at the end of the month, Tucker had an average of .369 in the American League while Walker had an average of .377 in the National League.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=bdApAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=tf8DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6948,3484759|title=Walker and Tucker Continue To Lead Batters in Majors|work=[[Toledo Blade]]|date=June 27, 1944|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Owing to his achievements, Tucker was added to the 1944 [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]] roster for the only time in his career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tucker, Grove Win Places on All-Star Team|work=[[Chicago Daily Tribune]]|date=July 3, 1944|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the leadoff hitter in the [[1944 Major League Baseball All-Star Game]], but went hitless in four at-bats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/NLS/NLS194407110.shtml|title=July 11, 1944 All-Star Game Play by Play and Box Score|work=Baseball-Reference|publisher=Sports Reference, LLC|accessdate=August 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tucker's form faded after the All-Star Game; in early July, he had a hitless streak of 28 at-bats, causing his batting average to shrink from .375 to .327, resulting in losing his status as league leader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Babe O'Rourke in Hospital|work=The Sporting News|date=July 13, 1944|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; When his average fell to .320 after recording one base hit in 35 at-bats, he was removed from the starting lineup for a weekend matchup against the [[Detroit Tigers]] in an attempt to halt his decline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=sJggAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=kGgFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3822,1087541|title=3 Red Sox Holding Spots In League's Top 4 In Batting|work=[[Lewiston Daily Sun]]|date=July 18, 1944|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tucker returned to the starting lineup shortly after being removed, and finished the season with a batting average of .287 and six triples.&lt;ref name=br/&gt;  At the end of July that season, both Tucker and [[George Case]] participated in a 75-yard dash as part of the White Sox's annual benefit for the war effort; Tucker lost the race to Case by a yard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=v-0ZAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ESMEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4404,4312089|title=Case, Nat Speeder, Is First In Dash|work=[[The Milwaukee Journal]]|date=July 27, 1944|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the season ended, Tucker formally joined the Navy, and spent the 1945 season serving in the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Thurman Tucker, Sox Outfielder, Joins Navy|work=Chicago Daily Tribune|page=A2|date=November 19, 1944}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the players returned to their teams at the end of the war, Tucker was slated to be the starting center fielder for the 1946 season, working alongside Wally Moses and [[Taffy Wright]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=TYsiAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=SK8FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=923,4650923|title=White Sox Outlook is Dull Despite Return of Lyons|work=[[Beaver County Times]]|date=March 23, 1946|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the previous season, he struggled with the bat at first, and was relegated to his original status on the White Sox roster as a good fielder but a poor hitter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=5UdjAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=SXUNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3061,6447671|title=Dykes May Be On Way Out As Sox Sink Lower|first=Charles|last=Einstein|work=[[The Telegraph-Herald]]|date=May 21, 1946|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of June, Tucker had a batting average of .229, nearly 150 points lower than his average at the same point in 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/gl.cgi?id=tucketh01&amp;t=b&amp;year=1946|title=Thurman Tucker 1946 Batting Gamelogs|work=Baseball-Reference|publisher=Sports Reference, LLC|accessdate=August 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; His form recovered in the second half of the season and he finished the year with a batting average of .288 and 20 doubles, both career highs.&lt;ref name=br/&gt; As the [[1947 Chicago White Sox season]] began, Tucker remained in his center field position after hitting .400 in the last month of the 1946 season, while rookie Dave Philley played in left field and Taffy Wright and [[Bob Kennedy]] [[platoon system|platooned]] in right field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Milt|last=Woodard|authorlink=Milt Woodard|title=Balky Philley Reined By Sox|work=The Sporting News|date=March 12, 1947|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he started the year by missing some playing time due to a stomach ailment, and did not play regularly for the White Sox until the middle of May.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Milt|last=Woodard|title=ChiSox Flag Pulse, Gate Beat in Unison|work=The Sporting News|date=May 14, 1947|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; After returning to regular play, Tucker alternated playing time with Philley, and he finished the season with a .236 batting average in 89 games.&lt;ref name=br/&gt;

==Cleveland Indians==
On January 27, 1948, Tucker was traded to the [[Cleveland Indians]] for [[Ralph Weigel]]; the Indians front office regarded Tucker as &quot;the finest defensive player in baseball.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=EkdjAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=zXQNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3676,4701484|title=Tribe Trades Weigel for Thurman Tucker|work=The Telegraph-Herald|date=January 28, 1948|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; He started off the year as the starting center fielder for the Indians, and in one early matchup against the Detroit Tigers, was the only player not to record a hit in an 8–2 victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=JMJQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=RtAMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5274,1222276|title=Indians Lead in American Loop|work=[[The Portsmouth Times]]|date=April 24, 1948|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; He missed three weeks of playing time in June after breaking a finger when he was hit by a pitch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Ed|last=McAuley|title=Tribe Finally Sours on Seerey, Welcomes Addition of Kennedy|work=The Sporting News|date=June 9, 1948|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon returning to the lineup, Tucker spent most of the second half of the season as a [[fourth outfielder]], splitting time with [[Allie Clark]] and playing in the outfield alongside [[Larry Doby]] and [[Dale Mitchell (baseball)|Dale Mitchell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Muncrief Hit By Line Drive|work=The Sporting News|page=10|date=June 30, 1948}}&lt;/ref&gt; He finished the season with a .260 batting average and 52 runs in 83 games, and ended the season with a perfect [[fielding percentage]] of 1.000.&lt;ref name=br/&gt; Tucker participated in game six of the [[1948 World Series]], scoring a run in the sixth inning on a [[base on balls|walk]] en route to a 4–3 win for the Indians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sixth Game|work=The Sporting News|date=October 20, 1948|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Indians planned to use Tucker as their fourth outfielder for the 1949 season when he served mostly as backup to Doby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Lhw1AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=0_ADAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6755,1027406|title=Cleveland Strong But Lacks Support|work=[[Eugene Register-Guard]]|page=6|date=April 5, 1949}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was relegated mostly to [[pinch hitting]] duties, and finished the season with a .244 batting average in 20 games and under 200 at-bats.&lt;ref name=br/&gt; Due to his hitting struggles, Indians manager [[Lou Boudreau]] tried converting Tucker to a [[switch hitter]] to start off the 1950 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Boudreau Joins Hank In Picking Redskins|first=Ed|last=McAuley|work=The Sporting News|date=March 15, 1950|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tucker was again set to be a backup outfielder in 1950. His performances during the year included hitting a home run, the only one he hit that season, in an 8–5 victory over the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]]; the teams raised $60,000 in that game to benefit [[sandlot ball|sandlot]] teams in Cleveland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=47,755 at Cleveland See Tribe Beat Dodgers, 8–5|first=Hal|last=Lebovitz|authorlink=Hal Lebovitz|work=The Sporting News|date=July 19, 1950|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tucker finished the season with a .178 batting average in 54 games, the lowest mark of his career.&lt;ref name=br/&gt;

Tucker and Allie Clark both attempted to make the Indians roster to begin the 1951 season, as the additions of [[Harry Simpson]] and [[Minnie Miñoso]] made it likely that one or both of them would be traded or released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=u39gAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=9HINAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1794,938400|title=Cleveland's Pennant Hopes Dim for '51|first=Milton|last=Hichman|work=[[Greensburg Daily Tribune]]|date=April 10, 1951|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tucker played only one game for the Indians, on April 29 when he recorded a strikeout in his lone at-bat.&lt;ref name=br/&gt; In early May, the Indians sent him to their [[Minor_league_baseball#Triple-A|Triple-A minor league affiliate]], the [[San Diego Padres (PCL)|San Diego Padres]] of the [[Pacific Coast League]]; his last major league game was April 29.&lt;ref name=br/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=AEJQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=wQsEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4656,6048662|title=Padres Get Tucker|work=Eugene Register-Guard|page=8|date=May 8, 1951}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
After being sent to the Padres, Tucker completed the 1951 season with them. In 88 games, Tucker had two triples and a .222 batting average.&lt;ref name=brm/&gt; In the offseason, Tucker operated his own taxicab in Texas, and he contemplated retirement from baseball during a contract dispute in February 1952.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Padre Thurman Tucker May Quit Baseball|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=February 27, 1952|page=C2}}&lt;/ref&gt; He eventually played 47 games for the now-unaffiliated Padres, hitting .225 in the process.&lt;ref name=brm/&gt; In mid-June, the Padres sold his contract to the Oklahoma City Indians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sedgman, Rose in Tennis Finals|work=Los Angeles Times|date=June 21, 1952|page=B2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tucker played in 72 games for the Indians that season, hitting .263. He retired from baseball during the 1953 season, and did not play with any professional team during that time.&lt;ref name=brm/&gt;

Tucker returned to baseball in 1954 to play for the [[Lubbock Hubbers]] of the [[West Texas-New Mexico League]]. He played part-time for the team, serving as a replacement when players needed time off, whether through injury or to spend time with their families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Class-C Minor League Highlights|work=The Sporting News|date=September 1, 1954|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; He hit .360 in 25 games for the Hubbers.&lt;ref name=brm/&gt; The following year, he served as player-manager for the [[Carlsbad Potashers]] of the [[Longhorn League]]. Tucker hit .275 in 114 games for the Potashers, including 25 doubles and eight home runs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Class C Diamond Fan Is Class A Heckler|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=EYFPAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ywQEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5840,7906002|work=[[Ocala Star-Banner]]|date=July 31, 1955|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=brm/&gt; He continued as player-manager for the Potashers in 1956, but the management considered firing him during a 14-game losing streak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Class-B Minor League Highlights|work=The Sporting News|date=May 16, 1956|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; He finished the year with a .306 batting average in 128 games. The following season, he was the player-manager of the Hobbs Sports, but only played in 16 games for them, hitting .273.&lt;ref name=brm/&gt; In 1958, he ended his playing career, and became the general manager of the Hobbs team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=John Quinn, Jr., New G.M., Third Generation in Game|work=The Sporting News|date=March 5, 1958|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After retiring, Tucker became an insurance agent and lived in [[Oklahoma City]]. He married and had four children; his son Ronald served in the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref name=digest/&gt; In 1962, he also became one of the [[Houston Astros]]' first [[scout (sport)|scouts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Bob|last=Vanderberg|title=Ex-Sox put stamp on original Colt .45s|work=Chicago Tribune|date=October 23, 2005|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tucker died on May 7, 1993 in Oklahoma City and is buried at Gordon Cemetery in his hometown of Gordon, Texas.&lt;ref name=br/&gt;
