'''Jack Marsh''' (''ca.'' 1874 – 25 May 1916) was an  Australian [[first-class cricket]]er of [[Australian aborigine|Australian aboriginal descent]] who represented [[New South Wales Blues|New South Wales]] in six matches from 1900–01 to 1902–03. A right-arm [[pace bowling|fast bowler]] of extreme pace, Marsh was blessed with high athletic qualities and was regarded as one of the outstanding talents of his era. However, his career was curtailed by continual controversy surrounding the legality of his bowling action; he was [[no-ball]]ed multiple times for [[throwing (cricket)|throwing]]. As a result of the debate over the legitimacy of his action, Marsh never established himself at first-class level and was overlooked for [[Australia national cricket team|national selection]]. Marsh's lack of opportunities has often been attributed to [[racial discrimination]].

Born into the [[Bundjalung people|Bundjalung]] people at [[Yulgilbar]] on the [[Clarence River (New South Wales)|Clarence River]] in northern [[New South Wales]], Marsh first made an impression as a professional [[track and field|runner]], traveling to Sydney and then competing interstate, winning races as a sprinter and a hurdler. While in Sydney, Marsh began competing in the local club cricket competition and his action quickly came under scrutiny. He was first no-balled for throwing in 1897, but it was not until 1900 that he came to prominence in a trial match against the New South Wales state team. Marsh dismissed leading [[Test cricket]]ers [[Victor Trumper]] and [[Monty Noble]], but was called for throwing. Marsh vowed to prove the legitimacy of his action by bowling with his arm encased in [[splint (medicine)|splints]], which prompted the umpire to resign in humiliation. Having topped the [[bowling average]]s in the local competition, Marsh was selected to make his debut in the [[Sheffield Shield]]. He made an immediate impression and led the first-class bowling averages for the season after three matches. He was no-balled in his second match by [[Bob Crockett]], but things came to a head in his fourth match when the same umpire no-balled him seventeen times, leading to angry crowd demonstrations. The cricket community was divided on whether Marsh's action was fair and various theories were propounded, which sought to show a motive for foul play against Marsh. The most popular of these theories was that Marsh was scapegoated in a campaign against throwing and was a soft target because of his race.

Marsh only played in two more first-class matches, which came in the two seasons following his no-balling. In a later season, the touring [[English cricket team]] objected to his selection in an opposition team. There were calls for Marsh to be selected for Australia, but Noble, the New South Wales selector, refused to select him, citing his controversial action. In later years, Marsh turned to alcohol and was briefly jailed for [[assault]]. He was killed in a brawl outside a [[Australian pubs|pub]]; two men, Henry Hewitt, a [[bookmaker]] and Walter Stone a bookmaker's clerk were charged with [[manslaughter|feloniously killing]] Marsh but were acquitted.&lt;ref name='smh1916-1'&gt; {{cite news | title = Death of Jack Marsh | date = 5 June 1916 | newspaper = [[The Sydney Morning Herald]] | page = 8 | accessdate = 2011-03-24 | url = http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/15669433?searchTerm=%22Death%20of%20Jack%20Marsh%22&amp;searchLimits= | quote = At the inquest into the cause of the death of Jack Marsh, a one time champion runner and fast bowler, who died on Friday evening 26&amp;nbsp;May, the coroner found that Marsh was killed, and committed John Henry Hewitt, bookmaker, and Walter Stone, bookmaker's clerk, who had been charged with feloniously killing Marsh, to stand their trial at the next Orange Quarter Sessions.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early years ==

Marsh was born into the Bundjalung people at Yulgilbar, which sits on the [[Clarence River (New South Wales)|Clarence River]] in northern New South Wales. His surname is believed to have possibly derived from that of [[Francis Henry Marsh]], whose property ''Camira'' was separated from Yulgilbar by the Richmond Range.&lt;ref name=&quot;adb&quot;&gt;{{cite web|first=Bernard |last=Whimpress |title= Marsh, Jack (c. 1874–1916) |work=[[Australian Dictionary of Biography]] |accessdate=2007-12-19|url=http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/AS10322b.htm|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Details of Marsh's itinerant pre-cricket life are scarce, because aborigines were not on the electoral roll and Marsh had no written correspondence with others because he was illiterate.&lt;ref name=&quot;smh&quot;/&gt;

Marsh made his first impression in the sporting arena as a professional [[track and field|runner]], following his brother Larry to the Sydney athletics tracks in 1893. A sprinter and [[hurdling|hurdler]], Marsh had several wins in notable races.&lt;ref name=&quot;az&quot;/&gt; He was known for his rapid acceleration, which accounted for him being particular strong over 75&amp;nbsp;m.&lt;ref name=&quot;smh&quot;/&gt; Aside from his victories in [[New South Wales]], he traveled to race in [[Queensland]] and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].&lt;ref name=&quot;az&quot;&gt;Cashman, pp. 188–189.&lt;/ref&gt; As with some other indigenous runners, Marsh was exploited by his trainer and was suspended for &quot;[[match fixing|running stiff]]&quot; in Sydney in 1895.&lt;ref name=&quot;adb&quot;/&gt; A more recent study by Max Bonnell has come to the conclusion that Marsh was a world-class sprinter. He found that ''The Referee'', the leading sports publication in Australia at the time, reported that Marsh has covered 100&amp;nbsp;yd in 9.8&amp;nbsp;s, which was equal to the world record set by American [[John Owen (sprinter)|John Owen]] in 1890. Marsh had also posted a time of 9.9&amp;nbsp;s in the previous year. However, it was only eight years later that a publication briefly noted that Marsh's time was an Australian record.&lt;ref name=&quot;smh&quot;/&gt;

Marsh also gained prominence in the [[South-eastern Sydney|inner-southern Sydney]] suburb of [[La Perouse, New South Wales|La Perouse]], which had a large indigenous population, by demonstrating his [[boomerang]] skills. Marsh, while throwing boomerangs, was spotted by cricket officials and he was persuaded to take up the sport.&lt;ref name=&quot;c25&quot;&gt;Colman, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Club cricket ==

Marsh began playing cricket in a competition based around [[Moore Park, New South Wales|Moore Park]], near central Sydney, representing [[South Sydney Cricket Club|South Sydney]].&lt;ref name=&quot;az&quot;/&gt; Marsh's career was surrounded by controversy from the outset. In November 1897, he was [[no-ball]]ed for [[throwing (cricket)|throwing]] by William Curran in a match against [[Paddington Cricket Club|Paddington]].&lt;ref name=&quot;w44&quot;&gt;Whimpress, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; Following its merger with South Sydney, Marsh played for [[Sydney Cricket Club]].&lt;ref name=&quot;az&quot;/&gt; Marsh's second no-ball incident at club level came when he played for a [[youth system|Colts]] [[First eleven|XV]]&lt;ref&gt;In this match, 15 players were allowed to participate rather than the standard 11 in a cricket match.&lt;/ref&gt; against the [[New South Wales Blues|New South Wales state team]] in a trial match in November 1900, before the start of the 1900–01 [[Sheffield Shield]] season. Curran called him on the first day of the match. Marsh had an eventful day, bowling Test batsmen [[Victor Trumper]], [[Frank Iredale]] and future [[Test cricket|Test]] player [[Bert Hopkins]].&lt;ref name=&quot;w44&quot;/&gt; Trumper was widely regarded as the finest batsman of his era, which was regarded as the [[Golden Age of cricket|&quot;golden age&quot;]] of cricket, and he was seen as one of the most stylish batsmen of all time.&lt;ref&gt;Cashman, p. 305.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Players and Officials – Victor Trumper|url=http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/ci/content/player/7980.html|accessdate=2007-12-28|publisher=[[Cricinfo]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Nairn, Bede|title=Trumper, Victor Thomas (1877–1915) | work=[[Australian Dictionary of Biography]] |accessdate=2007-12-28|url=http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A120303b.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marsh also collected the wickets of Test batsmen and future Australian captains [[Monty Noble]] and [[Syd Gregory]].&lt;ref name=&quot;w44&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cashman, pp. 223–224.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cashman, pp. 108–109.&lt;/ref&gt;

The calls of throwing so infuriated Marsh that at the end of the day's play, he announced that he would wear [[splint (medicine)|splints]] when he was bowling the next day. Marsh took this action to ensure that his elbow was kept straight and to demonstrate that he could bowl fast without throwing. Marsh had previously performed such an exhibition to ground members and the requisite splints and bandages were acquired from the nearby [[St Vincent's Hospital, Sydney|St. Vincent's Hospital]], in order to bind his bowling arm.&lt;ref name=&quot;w44&quot;/&gt; The hospital provided a medical certificate stating that Marsh could not move his elbow while encased in the splints.&lt;ref name=&quot;c25&quot;/&gt; Marsh was proactive in attempting to defend the legitimacy of his bowling action.&lt;ref name=&quot;w45&quot;&gt;Whimpress, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; Marsh's intentions were published in the ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'' and Curran was made aware that Marsh would seek to challenge him.&lt;ref name=&quot;cl81&quot;/&gt;

Marsh and his club sought a speedy resolution to the problem because [[Sheffield Shield]] matches were due to begin in a matter of weeks. They perceived a danger that other umpires in the Sydney competition would follow Curran's lead and call Marsh, effectively outlawing him, resulting in the loss of the club's leading strike bowler. By wearing the splints, Marsh showed his belief that Curran would call him on the second day. This never happened, because Curran withdrew from his position by the [[List of cricket terms#L|luncheon adjournment]] on the second day, believing that he had been humiliated. Curran's resignation was widely criticised by the media and he was reprimanded by the First Grade Committee for his action.&lt;ref name=&quot;c25&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;w45&quot;/&gt; Bowling &quot;as fast as ever&quot;, Marsh went on to finish with 6/125 from 33 overs as New South Wales were bowled out for 320.&lt;ref name=cl81&gt;Clowes, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;

== First-class debut ==

Marsh made his first-class debut when he was selected for the New South Wales team to play [[Southern Redbacks|South Australia]] at the [[Adelaide Oval]] in December 1900,&lt;ref name=w45/&gt;&lt;ref name=o&gt;{{cite web| title=Player Oracle J Marsh|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/cgi-bin/player_oracle_reveals_results2.cgi?playernumber=5979&amp;opponentmatch=exact&amp;playername=Meckiff&amp;resulttype=All&amp;matchtype=All&amp;teammatch=exact&amp;startwicket=&amp;homeawaytype=All&amp;opponent=&amp;endwicket=&amp;wicketkeeper=&amp;searchtype=InningsList&amp;endscore=&amp;playermatch=contains&amp;branding=cricketarchive&amp;captain=&amp;endseason=&amp;startscore=&amp;team=&amp;startseason= |accessdate=2009-05-14 |publisher=[[CricketArchive]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; just a month after he was no-balled for throwing. The selection indicated that the state selectors were prepared to overrule Curran's judgment.&lt;ref name=&quot;w45&quot;/&gt; In a high scoring match, Marsh was the most successful of the New South Wales bowlers, taking five [[dismissal (cricket)|wickets]] for the loss of 181 [[run (cricket)|runs]] (5/181). [[Clem Hill]] scored 365 [[not out]],&lt;ref name=&quot;m1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aus.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1900S/1900-01/AUS_LOCAL/SS/SOA_NSW_SS_15-19DEC1900.html |title=South Australia v New South Wales at Adelaide Oval, 15–19&amp;nbsp;Dec 1900 |publisher=[[Cricinfo]] |accessdate=2008-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; which remains the highest individual score compiled at the Adelaide Oval in a [[Sheffield Shield]] match.&lt;ref name=&quot;w45&quot;/&gt; At the time, South Australia's total of 575 was the highest ever score against New South Wales in the competition.&lt;ref name=&quot;w45&quot;/&gt; Marsh took two early wickets to have South Australia 2/43 before Hill amassed his triple-century. He returned to take three of the last four wickets, displaying an ability to break through the defenses of batsmen—all of his wickets were [[bowled]].&lt;ref name=&quot;m1&quot;/&gt;

A week later, Marsh's action was again under scrutiny when he played his second shield match against [[Victorian Bushrangers|Victoria]] in [[Melbourne]].&lt;ref name=o/&gt; While [[Richard Callaway (umpire)|Richard Callaway]]—the New South Wales umpire officiating the match—was satisfied with Marsh's bowling action, his Victorian counterpart [[Bob Crockett]] was concerned with the twisting of the bowler's wrist. Crockett no-balled Marsh three times in the match, but was reluctant to elucidate on the reasons for his call. Marsh took 3/39 and 3/51 respectively,&lt;ref name=&quot;w46&quot;&gt;Whimpress, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; dismissing Test batsmen [[Peter McAlister]], [[Warwick Armstrong]], [[Jack Worrall]] and [[Frank Laver]]. Marsh bowled three of his victims.&lt;ref name=&quot;c25&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;m2&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aus.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1900S/1900-01/AUS_LOCAL/SS/VIC_NSW_SS_24-27DEC1900.html |title=Victoria v New South Wales at Melbourne Cricket Ground, 24–27&amp;nbsp;Dec 1900 |publisher=[[Cricinfo]] |accessdate=2008-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to cricket historian [[Bernard Whimpress]], the early signs of a conspiracy against Marsh were raised by a journalist from ''[[The Age]]'' of Melbourne by the name of ''Old Boy''. The journalist set a possible agenda by raising a question about Marsh to Crockett on the day before the bowler was called, possibly predisposing the umpire to take action. If ''Old Boy'' could be relied on, then observers suspected that Marsh's faster and slower ball were dubious. The reporter did not specify which ball he questioned, except to say that one ball per over was doubtful. The events in Australia occurred against a backdrop of a throwing frenzy in [[England]]. A fortnight earlier, the captains of the English county teams had drawn up a list of prohibited bowlers. In Australia, [[Jim Phillips]] had set the tone by no-balling Australian Test bowler [[Ernie Jones]]. The events in England were seen as a catalyst for a clean-up campaign against dubious bowling actions. Historians regarded Marsh as a prime target due to his indigenous heritage and his supple wrist action.&lt;ref name=&quot;w46&quot;/&gt;

Marsh's third Sheffield Shield match was the return fixture against South Australia in January 1901 at the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]] (SCG);&lt;ref name=o/&gt; New South Wales reversed the result of the corresponding match three weeks earlier. South Australia batted first and were bowled out for 157, with Marsh taking the leading figures of 5/34.&lt;ref name=&quot;m3&quot;/&gt; These included the prize wickets of Hill and [[George Giffen]], Test players who went on to be inducted into the [[Australian Cricket Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/ci/content/player/5662.html |publisher=[[Cricinfo]] |title= Players and Officials – Clem Hill |accessdate=2008-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/339725.html |title= Healy given Hall of Fame honour |first=Brydon |last=Coverdale |publisher=[[Cricinfo]] |date=25 February 2008|accessdate=2008-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; New South Wales then piled on 918 before completing an [[Result (cricket)#Statement of result|innings victory]] by bowling the visitors out for 156 in the second innings. The margin of an innings and 605 runs set a new record for the largest victory in first-class history.&lt;ref&gt;Clowes, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; Marsh took 5/59 and did the bulk of the damage, removing five of South Australia's top six specialist batsmen, at one stage reducing the visitors to 6/114. Marsh bowled six of his opponents and was not questioned by either umpire.&lt;ref name=&quot;w46&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;m3&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aus.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1900S/1900-01/AUS_LOCAL/SS/NSW_SOA_SS_05-09JAN1901.html |title=New South Wales v South Australia at Sydney Cricket Ground, 5–9&amp;nbsp;Jan 1901 |publisher=[[Cricinfo]] |accessdate=2008-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this point, Marsh led the first-class averages in bowling, with 21 wickets at a [[bowling average]] of 17.38 in three matches.&lt;ref name=&quot;az&quot;/&gt; The match was Marsh's career high point; it was to be the only ten-wicket match of his brief career.

The controversy over Marsh's bowling action came to a head in the return match against Victoria at the SCG.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;&lt;ref name=w47/&gt; The fixture had been slated for the [[Australia Day]] weekend but it was postponed by a week when [[Queen Victoria]] died. By the time the match was under way, public interest had started to wane. Some three decades later, J. C. Davis reflected on the match, noting that it stirred many memories, &quot;some fragrant and some rather unpleasant&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;w47&quot;/&gt; The unsavoury incident that he alluded to was Crockett's continual no-balling of Marsh for throwing.&lt;ref name=&quot;w47&quot;&gt;Whimpress, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

New South Wales batted first and were bowled out on the first afternoon for 170. When the Victorians began their response, Crockett called Marsh for throwing three times in his first [[over (cricket)|over]], provoking rowdy responses from the spectators.&lt;ref name=&quot;w47&quot;/&gt; The ''Sydney Mail'' said the crowd reaction was &quot;a lot of abuse and unfair criticism&quot; of Crockett.&lt;ref name=cl83&gt;Clowes, p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt; He was no-balled a further two times in his second over and five of Victoria's first nine runs were [[extra (cricket)|extras]]. Despite this, Victoria started poorly, losing five wickets by the time it reached 50 runs.&lt;ref name=&quot;m4&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aus.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1900S/1900-01/AUS_LOCAL/SS/NSW_VIC_SS_01-06FEB1901.html |title=New South Wales v Victoria at Sydney Cricket Ground, 1–6&amp;nbsp;Feb 1901 |publisher=[[Cricinfo]] |accessdate=2008-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the five wickets to fall, Marsh bowled future Test captain Armstrong and McAlister. The crowd showed its sympathy for Marsh when he rattled Armstrong's stumps; they cheered him loudly and verbally attacked Crockett.&lt;ref name=cl83/&gt; Marsh was called a total of 17 times during the innings, the most in a single first-class innings in Australia.&lt;ref name=&quot;w47&quot;/&gt; The calls produced angry reactions from the spectators on the hill of the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]], who jeered &quot;Crock! Crock! Crock!&quot;, regarding the umpire—not the bowler's arm—as being crooked.&lt;ref name=&quot;w47&quot;/&gt; Marsh went on to take 2/68.&lt;ref name=&quot;w47&quot;/&gt; At one point Marsh lost his temper and deliberately threw three consecutive balls. Despite the repeated calls, the captain [[Syd Gregory]] kept Marsh bowling from Crockett's end—who was suspected of being biased towards his own state—rather than allowing Marsh to be examined by Crockett's partner.&lt;ref name=&quot;w47&quot;/&gt;

== Reaction to Crockett ==

Crockett's calls provoked a varied response from the media, which often ran counter to their state allegiances. The New South Wales journalist Davis felt that Marsh's deliberate throws raised &quot;uncertainty&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;w48&quot;/&gt; while the ''Australasian's'' cricket writer [[Tom Horan]]—a Victorian who went by the pen name ''Felix''&lt;ref&gt;Cashman, p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt;—felt that Marsh was a soft target for Crockett, whom he regarded as a suspicious character.&lt;ref name=&quot;w47&quot;/&gt; Curran's previous calling of Marsh in the Sydney competition had strengthened Crockett's position away from his parochial state base.&lt;ref name=&quot;w48&quot;&gt;Whimpress, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; The Victorian umpire was regarded as a tough-minded umpire, much like [[Jim Phillips]], who had triggered the current round of throwing calls in Australian cricket. Crockett was commended for his willingness to call Marsh in the face of public anger and for doing what others would not. However, when Marsh bowled from the other end in the second innings of the match, his action was deemed by Crockett's umpiring partner [[Sammy Jones]] to be fair.&lt;ref name=&quot;w48&quot;/&gt; By this time, Marsh's confidence was low.&lt;ref name=&quot;c26&quot;&gt;Colman, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; He took his worst ever first-class figures of 1/105 as New South Wales lost by one wicket.&lt;ref name=&quot;w48&quot;/&gt; His only wicket was Test player [[Charlie McLeod]], bowled for six.&lt;ref name=&quot;m4&quot;/&gt;

Whimpress tabled various hypotheses for Crockett's actions. At the time, Crockett was 37 years old and was ready to emerge from the shadow of Phillips, the eminent Australian umpire of the time. When Crockett called Marsh, it was his 29th match as a first-class umpire and the no-balling was seen in some quarters as a signal that he felt ready to officiate in Test matches. A cynical view of Crockett's calls held that if throwing was to be eradicated then the umpire was going to choose a soft target. This theory ruled out the calling of a fellow Victorian, his state of origin. The same line of reasoning concluded that a New South Welshman would be called, and likely not a high profile Test player like Noble or [[Jack Saunders]]. Those who adhered to this hypothesis believed that it would be easier for Crockett to target someone who had a previous stigma of throwing and that Marsh—an aborigine who led the bowling averages with 21 wickets at 17.38—was an ideal target.&lt;ref name=&quot;az&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;w48&quot;/&gt;

At the time, the alteration to the no-ball law made by the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] (MCC) in 1899 was yet to be implemented in Australian first-class cricket. This change allowed the umpire to call a throw from either end, whereas the law previously barred the [[Umpire (cricket)#Positions|umpire at square leg]] from doing so. The non-implementation of the law diluted the power of Australian umpires, since the bowler could be switched to the other end and made immune from being called by the first umpire. As a result, Gregory's unwillingness to switch Marsh to the opposite end surprised cricket observers.&lt;ref name=&quot;w49&quot;&gt;Whimpress, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; Australian administrators had been under pressure from England to crack down on dubious bowling actions. English captain [[Archie MacLaren]] had asserted that &quot;If Australia expects an English team next September they will have to play according to the new reading of the law at home&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;w50&quot;&gt;Whimpress, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; It was speculated that because Crockett was a lifelong employee of the [[Melbourne Cricket Club]], which organised and sponsored English tours to Australia, he was under pressure to no-ball bowlers in order to curry favour with English administrators.&lt;ref name=&quot;w50&quot;/&gt;

== Incidents against England ==

The controversy over Marsh's bowling action again reared its head during the 1901–02 season, when MacLaren led his English tourists to Australia. The English played in a match at [[Bathurst, New South Wales|Bathurst]] where Marsh was selected, but MacLaren refused to play against him.&lt;ref name=&quot;c26&quot;/&gt; Noble, who selected the New South Wales teams, used the complaints about Marsh to ignore growing calls to have the bowler selected for New South Wales and Australia. Without state backing, the remainder of Australia's selectors were happy to rely on Noble's state-level veto to ignore Marsh.&lt;ref name=&quot;az&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;w50&quot;/&gt; Marsh's only first-class match of the season was against [[Queensland Bulls|Queensland]] in [[Brisbane]].&lt;ref name=o/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;m1&quot;/&gt; At the time, Queensland was not yet in the Sheffield Shield,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/queensland/content/current/story/262298.html |title= A brief history of Queensland |first=Sam |last=Collins |publisher=[[Cricinfo]] |accessdate=2008-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; so it was a one-off match. The match was the subject of much media attention because it was the first time that two aborigines had played in opposing teams at first-class level. Queensland's indigenous player was [[Alec Henry]], another fast bowler who had been accused of throwing.&lt;ref name=&quot;c267&quot;&gt;Colman, pp. 26–27.&lt;/ref&gt; The New South Wales team travelled north to the match by train, making a stop at [[Ipswich, Queensland|Ipswich]]. As part of the media promotion of the match-up between the pair, Henry was taken to Ipswich station to meet Marsh. Marsh was reported in the media as having said &quot;Say old man, toss me up a soft one so I can get a smack at you&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;c28&quot;&gt;Colman, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Marsh took 2/64 and 3/67 in a drawn match, and bowled three of his victims, who were unable to cope with his pace.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;m1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aus.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1900S/1901-02/AUS_LOCAL/STATS/FC_1901-02_BOWL_MOST_WKTS.html |title=Australian First-Class Season 1901/02: Bowling – Most Wickets |publisher=[[Cricinfo]]|accessdate=2008-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;m5&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aus.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1900S/1900-01/AUS_LOCAL/SS/NSW_VIC_SS_01-06FEB1901.html |title=New South Wales v Victoria at Sydney Cricket Ground, 1–6&amp;nbsp;Feb 1901 |publisher=[[Cricinfo]] |accessdate=2008-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marsh and Henry dismissed one another, each being bowled for nine to create a symmetry in the scorecard.&lt;ref name=&quot;c267&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;m5&quot;/&gt;

Marsh was again overlooked for selection during the 1902–03 Sheffield Shield season. He played his only first-class match of the season against Queensland, in another one-off match.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; In the last first-class fixture of his career, Marsh scored his highest first-class score of nine [[not out]] as New South Wales were bowled out for 191. He then took 2/39 in the first innings as New South Wales took a 60-run first innings lead. He finished his career with 3/23 in the second innings, including a final burst of 3/0,&lt;ref name=c88&gt;Clowes, p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; to help his team to a victory.&lt;ref name=&quot;m6&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aus.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1900S/1902-03/AUS_LOCAL/OTHERFC/QLD_NSW_08-11NOV1902.html |title=Queensland v New South Wales at Brisbane, 8–11&amp;nbsp;Nov 1902 |publisher=[[Cricinfo]] |accessdate=2008-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aus.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1900S/1902-03/AUS_LOCAL/STATS/FC_1902-03_BOWL_MOST_WKTS.html |title=Australian First-Class Season 1902/03: Bowling – Most Wickets |publisher=[[Cricinfo]]|accessdate=2008-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the season, Marsh played in a match for New South Wales against Australia, which was not first-class. He took the wicket of Clem Hill as the match ended in a draw.&lt;ref name=aus&gt;{{cite web| title=New South Wales v Australians|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/135/135151.html|accessdate=2009-05-14 |publisher=[[CricketArchive]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marsh was never selected again,&lt;ref name=o/&gt; although he continued to dominate grade cricket. He was the leading wicket-taker for three consecutive seasons from 1901–02 to 1903–04, taking a total of 158 wickets at an average of 10.94.&lt;ref name=&quot;c88&quot;/&gt;

[[Image:Sydney Barnes.jpg|right|thumb|Marsh's ability was compared to that of Sydney Barnes ''(pictured)''.]]
Two years later against [[Plum Warner]]'s MCC team, there were further calls for Marsh to be selected for the Test team as Australia fell 1–2 behind in [[the Ashes]]. Marsh had taken 5/55 against the Englishmen in a match at [[Bathurst, New South Wales|Bathurst]], delivering a mixture of fast bowling and [[off spin]].&lt;ref name=c26/&gt; His victims included [[George Hirst]] and Warner himself.&lt;ref name=bath&gt;{{cite web| title=Bathurst v Marylebone Cricket Club|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/135/135178.html |accessdate=2009-05-14 |publisher=[[CricketArchive]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; No formal complaint about Marsh's bowling was lodged by the English but his bowling did raise eyebrows.&lt;ref name=&quot;c26&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;w50&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;w51&quot;&gt;Whimpress, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; The general consensus among the English touring party was that Marsh's bowling was unfair, with Warner describing him as a &quot;shier&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;w51&quot;/&gt; a 19th century term for a thrower. Warner asserted that no English umpire would tolerate such a bowling action. Despite this, the English players described him as the best bowler that they had faced on the tour.&lt;ref name=&quot;c26&quot;/&gt; Warner and Noble were confident that Crockett would no-ball Marsh out of the match if the Australian Test selectors picked the bowler. As a result, Marsh was effectively excluded from the Australian side and his first-class career was limited to just six matches in which he took 34 wickets at an average of 21.47.&lt;ref name=&quot;w51&quot;/&gt; The Australian Test batsman and captain [[Warren Bardsley]] rated Marsh alongside [[Fred Spofforth]] and England's [[Sydney Barnes]].&lt;ref name=&quot;az&quot;/&gt; The comparison to Barnes was praise indeed; Barnes was the only bowler in Test history with over 120 wickets to have a bowling average under 20, with 189 wickets at an average of just 16.43.&lt;ref&gt;Armstrong, pp. 40–41.&lt;/ref&gt; Bardsley said that the only reason that Marsh was &quot;kept ... out of big cricket was his color&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;adb&quot;/&gt; [[Jack Pollard]] said that Marsh &quot;was clearly the best Australian bowler of his time but unfortunately that was a period when the [[White Australia Policy]] prevailed. Marsh's name was scratched from the list of players ... by an official who was simply carrying out the racist customs of the day.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Cricket and the Law: The man in white is always right |first=David |last=Fraser |publisher=Routledge |year=2005 |isbn=0-7146-5347-0 |page=389}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Popular with teammates and known for his sportsmanship, Marsh was regarded as an average [[fielding (cricket)|fielder]] and had minimal batting skill, with a batting average of 5.00.&lt;ref name=&quot;w45&quot;/&gt; He played out his days in the Sydney competition and topped the bowling aggregates from 1901 to 1904.&lt;ref name=&quot;az&quot;/&gt; [[Les Poidevin]] described Marsh as &quot;a well set-up, perfectly built ... man, with an ebony-black, smooth, clear shining skin and twinkling black eyes&quot; who &quot;is quite good looking&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;adb&quot;/&gt; Marsh was short for a fast bowler standing 5&amp;nbsp;ft 7&amp;nbsp;ins (170&amp;nbsp;cm) tall.&lt;ref name=&quot;adb&quot;/&gt; In later years, Marsh experimented with the [[googly]].&lt;ref name=&quot;az&quot;/&gt; Photographs of Marsh often show him fashionably dressed in a suit and sporting a moustache.&lt;ref name=&quot;adb&quot;/&gt;

== Later years ==

Marsh's cricket career ended in 1905. He returned to his athletic career and in 1906, he ran against [[Arthur Postle]] at a meeting organised by [[John Wren]] in Melbourne. The race was organised to give Postle, then Australia's fastest man, a chance to break the 100&amp;nbsp;yd world record. In front of 12,000 spectators on a wet track, Marsh took an early lead with his rapid acceleration but Postle caught him on the line. Postle was declared the winner in 10&amp;nbsp;s, but some observers claimed that it was a dead heat. He retired from competitive sport after the race.&lt;ref name=&quot;smh&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Uncovered: the tragedy of the first great Aboriginal sprinter |first=Phillip |last=Derriman |url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/05/30/1054177730860.html |work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=31 May 2003 |accessdate=2008-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marsh joined Alexander's Hippodrome Company, traveling around Australia in a [[Showman#Australia|sideshow]],&lt;ref name=&quot;adb&quot;/&gt; where his cricketing fame brought much attention.&lt;ref name=&quot;c26&quot;/&gt; His activities thereafter are unclear, but it is likely that he became an itinerant worker.&lt;ref name=&quot;adb&quot;/&gt; In retirement, Marsh drank heavily and was jailed for 14 days for committing an [[assault]] in Melbourne in 1909,&lt;ref name=&quot;c26&quot;/&gt; something he blamed on alcohol.&lt;ref name=&quot;adb&quot;/&gt; Marsh died after an assault caused by an argument outside the pool room of the Royal Hotel in [[Orange, New South Wales]]. Two people were charged with [[manslaughter]], but they were acquitted.&lt;ref name=&quot;az&quot;/&gt; Marsh was buried in an un-marked grave.&lt;ref name=&quot;c26&quot;/&gt; ''[[The Bulletin]]'' wrote in Marsh's obituary that he was &quot;a darkly troubled man with manners which white brothers found impossible to put up with&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;c26&quot;/&gt;
