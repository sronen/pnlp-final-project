'''Karmichael Neil Matthew Hunt''' (born 17 November 1986 in [[Auckland]], [[New Zealand]]) is an Australian professional multi-code football player, currently playing [[Australian rules football]] for the newly formed [[Gold Coast Football Club|Gold Coast Suns]] in the [[Australian Football League]] (AFL). 

He was formerly best known as a [[rugby league]] player for the [[Brisbane Broncos]] of the [[National Rugby League]] (NRL). He primarily played in the [[Fullback (rugby league)|fullback]] position, but has also played on the [[Wing (rugby league)|wing]] and at [[five-eighth]] and [[Scrum-half (rugby league)|halfback]]. Hunt played in the NRL for Brisbane from 2004 to 2009, and was part of the Broncos' [[Brisbane Broncos 2006#Grand final|competition-winning team]] in 2006. He has represented the [[Queensland state rugby league team|Queensland Maroons]] in the [[Rugby League State of Origin|State of Origin]] series and the [[Australia national rugby league team|Australian Kangaroos]] at international level.

Hunt made his NRL debut in [[National Rugby League season 2004|2004]] and played every game that season, winning the [[Dally M Medal|Dally M]] Rookie of the Year award. In a controversial move, Hunt chose to play for Australia instead of his native [[New Zealand national rugby league team|New Zealand]], citing a lifelong dream of playing for Queensland in State of Origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=''[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation Online|ABC News]]''|title=Hunt set to fulfil Origin dream|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200606/s1656348.htm|accessdate=5 July 2007|date=6 June 2006|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.abc.net.au%2Fnews%2Fnewsitems%2F200606%2Fs1656348.htm&amp;date=2009-05-07|archivedate=7 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a downturn in [[National Rugby League season 2005|2005]], Hunt's [[National Rugby League season 2006|2006]] performances resulted in his selection for Queensland and Australia. After consistent performances for the Broncos and continued selection for Queensland over 2006–2009, Hunt expressed a desire to leave the NRL competition. 

In July 2009, he signed a three year deal with the [[Gold Coast Football Club]] in the [[Australian rules football|Australian rules football code]] beginning in 2011. In 2010, while contracted to the Gold Coast, he played a season with [[Biarritz Olympique]] in the [[Top 14]] French [[rugby union]] competition.

== Brisbane Broncos ==
=== Debut season ===
Hunt's 2001 scholarship came to fruition when he joined the [[Brisbane Broncos]]' main squad at the end of the 2003 season. He participated in the team's off-season training in early 2004, under the guidance of Broncos' coach [[Wayne Bennett (rugby league)|Wayne Bennett]], and was selected to participate in the Broncos' pre-season trial games in February.&lt;ref name=&quot;huntisover&quot;/&gt; Hunt had expected to play most of the 2004 season in the [[Queensland Cup]], the second-tier rugby league competition in Queensland.&lt;ref name=&quot;huntoutoforigin&quot;&gt;{{cite news|first=Dan|last=Koch|title=Hunt out of Origin calculations|date=26 April 2004|url=http://www.broncos.com.au/index.cfm?TopMenuID=266&amp;MenuID=410&amp;NewsID=823|accessdate=5 June 2007|publisher=Brisbane Broncos News |quote=I didn't even consider playing Broncos this year, I thought I would play at Toowoomba.|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071111091957/http://www.broncos.com.au/index.cfm?TopMenuID=266&amp;MenuID=410&amp;NewsID=823 |archivedate = 11 November 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, after [[Darren Lockyer]]'s shift to the five-eighth position and Hunt playing both trial games on the wing and scoring a try in the first game against the [[Melbourne Storm]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brisbane Broncos vs Melbourne Storm (2004 Trial Match)|url=http://www.broncos.com.au/index.cfm?TopMenuID=266&amp;MenuID=274&amp;tShow=MatchPanel&amp;GameID=2139&amp;DisplayTypeID=1|accessdate=2 June 2007|publisher=Brisbane Broncos|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071004212523/http://www.broncos.com.au/index.cfm?TopMenuID=266&amp;MenuID=274&amp;tShow=MatchPanel&amp;GameID=2139&amp;DisplayTypeID=1 |archivedate = 4 October 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was selected to make his [[National Rugby League]] (NRL) debut for the Broncos in the first [[Tournament|round]] of the 2004 season against the [[New Zealand Warriors]], making him the youngest ever Bronco at seventeen.&lt;ref name=&quot;hunttobecomeyoungesteverbronco&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Hunt set to become youngest Bronco| url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2004/03/09/1062170.htm|date=9 March 2004 |accessdate=13 July 2007 |publisher=''[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation Online|ABC News]]'' }}&lt;/ref&gt; Coach Bennett's decision to name Hunt as the starting fullback was somewhat surprising, due to Hunt's original selection, the week before the match, on the [[Rugby league positions#Numbering|interchange bench]].

[[File:Karmichael Hunt cropped.jpg|thumb|right|Hunt in action in 2004, his debut NRL season.]]Hunt described Bennett and Broncos team-mate [[Darren Lockyer]] as the greatest influences on his league career.&lt;ref name=&quot;huntisover&quot;/&gt; With Lockyer's move from fullback to [[five-eighth]], Hunt had large shoes to fill in the position. Hunt proved to be a success for the Broncos; he played every game in 2004, missing just four minutes in total,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=NRL Stats|url=http://203.20.74.147/NRL07/detailedstatsplayer.asp?player=990105&amp;lyear=2004|title=Karmichael Hunt – 2004 Breakdown|accessdate=6 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was the team's top [[try|try-scorer]].&lt;ref name=&quot;04broncostries&quot;&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Rleague|title=Rugby League Tables / Brisbane Scorers / 2004|accessdate=5 June 2007|url=http://stats.rleague.com/rl/teams/brisbane/brisbane_sc.html#2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bennett remarked of him that &quot;Karmichael has an attitude just like [[Darren Lockyer]] where he can make a mistake and kiss it off and just get on with the game, It's a wonderful quality to have and you'd like every player to have it. A lot of guys dwell on mistakes and it stays with them too long.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;skythelimit&quot;/&gt;

Hunt drew criticism for his style of [[Fullback (rugby league)|returning the football]]; upon receiving the ball, he would run straight at opposition players rather than attempting to evade them.&lt;ref name=&quot;skythelimit&quot;/&gt; As a result, he received several [[tackle (football move)|high tackles]], causing the Broncos to ask the NRL to protect Hunt by punishing opposition players more severely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=''[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation Online|ABC News]]''|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2004/07/19/1157070.htm|title=Stop the head Hunt|date=19 July 2004|accessdate=13 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The referees' board supported this position, and stated that fullbacks such as Hunt needed to be protected due to greater risk of injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=''[[The Daily Telegraph (Australia)|The Daily Telegraph]]''|url=http://www.newstext.com.au/docs/DTM/2004/get.jsp?docid=DTM-20040722-1-076-4270984V13@NSW-METRO-2004-2003|title=Mum fears for teen star Hunt's future|first=Michael|last=Crutcher|date=22 June 2004|accessdate=16 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 October 2009, it was revealed he agreed to play for the French professional rugby union team [[Biarritz Olympique]] based in [[Biarritz]], [[Aquitaine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]]|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/10/17/2716839.htm|date=17 October 2009|accessdate=17 October 2009|title=Hunt leaves for French sojourn|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.abc.net.au%2Fnews%2Fstories%2F2009%2F10%2F17%2F2716839.htm&amp;date=2009-10-17|archivedate=17 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Australian rules football career (2010-) ==
===Victorian Football League (2010)===
On 12 June 2010, Hunt played his first [[Australian rules football]] match for [[Victorian Football League]] team [[Gold Coast Football Club|the Gold Coast]] in their heavy loss against the [[Coburg Tigers]] at the Highgate Recreation Reserve in [[Craigieburn, Victoria]].&lt;ref name=&quot;12Jun2010_GCFC_KarmichaelHunt&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2010-06-12/hunt-quiet-in-vfl-debut/864268|title=Hunt quiet in VFL debut|date=12 June 2010|publisher=[[ABC News (Australia)]]|accessdate=12 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Playing at [[full-forward]] Hunt had three shots at goal in the first quarter, two from [[Free kick (Australian rules football)|free kicks]]. Hunt kicked two goals in quick succession after he was awarded a free kick for a late push from an opponent after his running goal in the goalsquare. After this he was quiet with few possessions and left the field with [[cramp]] in the third quarter.&lt;ref name=&quot;CourierMail_12Jun2010_Sport_AFL_GregDavis_KarmichaelHunt&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.couriermail.com.au/sport/afl/karmichael-hunt-kicks-two-goals-in-vfl-debut-for-gold-coast-against-coburg-tigers/story-e6frepf6-1225878835149|title=Karmichael Hunt kicks two goals in VFL debut for Gold Coast against Coburg Tigers|last=Davis|first=Greg|date=12 June 2010|publisher=[[The Courier-Mail]]|accessdate=12 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his second match against [[Frankston Football Club]] on 26 June 2010, Hunt was tried as a defender, playing [[Fullback (Australian rules football)|fullback]] on a taller, heavier opponent. He drew some criticism for not getting any kicks and for an inability to read the play, however running a total around 8 kilometres during the game on and off the bench Hunt managed just a handful of possessions and tackles in his side's convincing win.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.couriermail.com.au/sport/afl/karmichael-hunt-finds-a-way-to-win-without-kicking-as-gold-coast-beats-frankston/story-e6frepf6-1225884678240 Karmichael Hunt finds a way to win without kicking as Gold Coast beats Frankston]. Courier Mail (2010-06-26). Retrieved on 2011-05-01.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hunt's coaching staff have speculated him to make an experimental shift into the [[Follower (Australian rules football)|midfield]] (as centreman or ruck rover), however he was again selected at fullback for the match against the [[Box Hill Hawks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/afl/afl-news/different-codes-and-familiar-foes-as-hunt-gets-defensive-20100702-zu1m.html|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|title=Different codes and familiar foes as Hunt gets defensive|first=Jim|last=Morton|date=3 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the match Hunt had just three kicks, three handpasses and two marks before straining his groin in the final minutes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theroar.com.au/2010/07/04/karmichael-hunt-improving-but-way-to-go Karmichael Hunt improving, but way to go » The Roar – Your Sports Opinion].

In Cairns, Hunt had a breakthrough game against the [[Bendigo Bombers]] showing dramatic improvement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/afl/afl-news/seventh-heaven-for-hunt-20100717-10f91.html Seventh heaven for Hunt] BRENT DIAMOND 18 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt; He followed the good form being named in the Gold Coast's best and clearly the best backman against the [[Sandringham Football Club]], again playing in defence showing good run and carry skills with 15 disposals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goldcoast.com.au/article/2010/07/25/241981_gold-coast-afl.html Breakthrough as Hunt named in best] Nick Smart and AAP 25 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australian Football League (2011-)===
Hunt's [[Australian Football League pre-season competition]] debut was at [[Blacktown Olympic Park]] on 19 February 2011 in front of a crowd of 10,000. Playing at fullback, he was named among the side's best in the three point win against the [[Sydney Swans]] while playing on dual Brownlow Medallist [[Adam Goodes]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afl.com.au/news/newsarticle/tabid/208/newsid/108054/default.aspx Suns shine brightly on debut].

Retrieved on 2011-05-01.&lt;/ref&gt; In each of his two first pre-season matches, the second against the [[Greater Western Sydney Football Club]], his performance statistics were consistent at six possessions and a tackle.&lt;ref&gt;Orme, Stephen [http://www.sportal.com.au/afl-news-display/hunt-eyes-improvement-112428 Hunt plays down performance] Sportal.com.au 20/2/2011&lt;/ref&gt;

His first official AFL game was in the Suns' debut match in round two of the 2011 season against [[Carlton Football Club|Carlton]]. He kicked his first AFL goal on 28 May 2011 against [[Geelong Football Club|Geelong]] at [[Carrara Stadium|Metricon Stadium]]. In the same match, however, he earned a one-week suspension for head-high contact to Geelong's [[Nathan Vardy]].

Hunt's promising first season was rewarded by being named on the half-back flank in the ''Courier Mail'' 2011 Queensland Team of the Year.&lt;ref&gt;NEAFL (2011).

He began his second season solidly, named among the 3 best Gold Coast players in Round 3 at Metricon Stadium against Essendon with 9 second quarter possessions, earning praise from coach McKenna as well as laying a solid [[Shepherding (Australian rules football)|shepherd]] on Essendon's [[Angus Monfries]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.afl.com.au/tabid/16931/Default.aspx#fixtureid=7683&amp;tab=Recap&lt;/ref&gt;
