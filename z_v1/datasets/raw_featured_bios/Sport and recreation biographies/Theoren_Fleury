'''Theoren Wallace &quot;Theo&quot; Fleury''' (born June 29, 1968) is a [[Canadians|Canadian]]  former professional [[ice hockey]] player for the [[Calgary Flames]], [[Colorado Avalanche]], [[New York Rangers]], and [[Chicago Blackhawks]] of the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL), [[Tappara]] of [[Finland]]'s [[SM-liiga]], and the [[Belfast Giants]] of the [[UK]]'s [[Elite Ice Hockey League]]. He was drafted by the Flames in the 8th round, 166th overall, at the [[1987 NHL Entry Draft]], and played over [[List of National Hockey League players with 1000 games played|1,000 games]] in the NHL between 1989 and 2003.  

One of the smallest players of his generation, Fleury played a physical style that often led to altercations. As a [[junior ice hockey|junior]], he was at the centre of the infamous [[Punch-up in Piestany]], a brawl that resulted in the disqualification of both Canada and the [[Soviet Union]] from the [[1987 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships]]. Once considered unlikely to play in the NHL due to his small size, Fleury scored over [[List of National Hockey League players with 1000 points|1,000 points]] in his career and won the [[Stanley Cup]] in [[1989 Stanley Cup Finals|1989]] with the Flames. He twice represented Canada at the [[Winter Olympics]], winning a gold medal in [[Ice hockey at the 2002 Winter Olympics|2002]]. Throughout his career, he battled drug and alcohol [[addiction]]s that ultimately forced him out of the NHL in [[2002–03 NHL season|2003]], when he was only 35 years old. He played one successful season in the British Elite Ice Hockey League in [[2005–06 EIHL season|2005–06]], and made two attempts to win the [[Allan Cup]]. After an unsuccessful NHL comeback attempt with the Flames, he retired in 2009.

Outside of hockey, Fleury overcame his addictions, operated a concrete business in Calgary with his family, and filmed a [[television pilot|pilot]] for a [[reality television]] show based around it. He marketed his own brand of clothing, which led him to play two professional [[baseball]] games for the [[Calgary Vipers]] of the [[Golden Baseball League]]. In 1995, he was diagnosed with [[Crohn's disease]], and his annual charity golf tournament has helped raise more than $1&amp;nbsp;million for the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of Canada. 

Fleury co-wrote ''[[Playing with Fire (Autobiography)|Playing with Fire]]'', a best-selling [[autobiography]] released in October 2009, in which he revealed that he had been sexually abused by former coach [[Graham James (ice hockey)|Graham James]]. Fleury filed a criminal complaint against James, who subsequently pleaded guilty to charges of sexual assault.  Fleury has since become an [[advocate]] for sexual abuse victims, and developed a career as a [[public speaker]].

==Early life==
Fleury was born on June 29, 1968, in [[Oxbow, Saskatchewan]], Canada, the first of Wally and Donna Fleury's three sons. Wally was a hockey player whose dreams of a professional career ended when he broke his leg playing baseball in the summer of 1963; the injury helped fuel a drinking problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Malcolm|1997|pp=27–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Donna was a quiet, religious woman who battled drug addiction for many years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fire6&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Fleury|2009|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fleury is of [[Métis people (Canada)|Métis]] heritage, as his grandmother Mary was [[Cree]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Fire6&quot; /&gt; The Fleurys lived in [[Williams Lake, British Columbia]], for four years, a period that saw Theo's brother Ted born in 1970, before settling in [[Russell, Manitoba]], by 1973, the year his youngest brother Travis was born.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Malcolm|1997|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wally worked as a truck driver and maintenance worker at the arena in Russell.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fire35&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Malcolm|1997|pp=35–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Always one of the smallest children in his class and without stable supervision at home, Fleury adopted an aggressive posture and later described himself as a [[bullying|bully]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fleury|2009|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; He turned to hockey as an outlet when he borrowed an old pair of skates and a broken stick to play his first game at the age of five.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fleury|2009|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; From that point on, he played hockey at every opportunity, often accompanying his father to the arena in Russell in the pre-dawn hours. He was described by his teachers as a determined youth, who would repeat any activity he failed at until he got it right.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fire35&quot; /&gt;

Although his mother was a [[Jehovah's Witnesses|Jehovah's Witness]], Fleury was raised as a [[Roman Catholic]]. He attended mass from age 6 to 12, serving as an altar boy until the church's priest died of a heart attack, depriving Fleury of one of his earliest positive influences.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fleury|2009|pp=11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Always lacking money and a stable home, Fleury received support from the community, in particular the Peltz family in Russell, who ensured that he and his brothers were fed and bought them new clothes when required.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fleury19&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Fleury|2009|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1982, Fleury's dreams of playing in the NHL nearly ended at the age of 13 when, during a game, he suffered a deep cut under his arm that severed his [[brachial artery]]. He missed nearly a year of contact hockey as a result.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fleury|2009|pp=14–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five months after the incident, the community raised money to send him to the [[Andy Murray (ice hockey)|Andy Murray]] Hockey School in [[Brandon, Manitoba]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fleury|2009|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was there that Fleury met [[Graham James (ice hockey)|Graham James]], who was working as a scout for the [[Winnipeg Warriors]] of the [[Western Hockey League]] (WHL).  James told Fleury that he had the skill to play in the NHL despite his size, and promised to recruit him to play junior hockey for the Warriors when he was old enough.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fleury19&quot; /&gt;

==Playing career==
===Junior===
Fleury began his junior career in 1983–84 as a 15-year-old with the [[St. James Canadians]] of the [[Manitoba Junior Hockey League]], scoring 33&amp;nbsp;[[goal (ice hockey)|goals]] and 64&amp;nbsp;[[point (ice hockey)|points]] in 22&amp;nbsp;games, an incredible pace of nearly three points per game.&lt;ref name=&quot;LOHFleury&quot;&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/SearchPlayer.jsp?player=10485 |title=Player profile – Theoren Fleury |publisher=Hockey Hall of Fame |accessdate=2009-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[1984–85 WHL season|1984–85]] he moved to the [[Moose Jaw Warriors]], who had just relocated from [[Winnipeg]], scoring 29&amp;nbsp;goals and 75&amp;nbsp;points in 71&amp;nbsp;games as a 16-year-old. He improved his totals in each of his four years in the WHL, culminating with a 68-goal, 92-[[assist (ice hockey)|assist]] season in [[1987–88 WHL season|1987–88]].&lt;ref name=&quot;LOHFleury&quot; /&gt; Fleury's 160&amp;nbsp;points tied him for the league lead with [[Joe Sakic]], and the two players shared the [[Bob Clarke Trophy]] as the WHL's top scorers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Flett|2009|pp=40–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fleury's 92&amp;nbsp;assists and 160&amp;nbsp;points remain team records; he also holds the Warriors' career records for goals (201), assists (271) and points (472).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Flett|2009|p=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{asof|2012}}, he remains 10th all-time in WHL scoring.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fire50&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Fleury|2009|p=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Always one of the smallest players in the game,&lt;ref name=&quot;reinstatement&quot;&gt;{{citation |last=Dreger |first=Darren |url=http://www.tsn.ca/nhl/story/?id=287047 |title=Fleury attempting NHL comeback |publisher=The Sports Network |date=2009-08-10 |accessdate=2009-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fleury learned early that he had to play an unpredictable style of game to survive against players much larger than he was. He found that the best way to protect himself was to intimidate his opponents by playing a feisty, physical game,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fleury|2009|pp=97–98}}&lt;/ref&gt; which he said led to many retaliatory penalties and several arguments with his coaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fleury|2009|p=102}}&lt;/ref&gt; He recorded 235&amp;nbsp;[[Penalty (ice hockey)|penalties in minutes]] in his final year of junior, nearly 100 more than any of the other top 10 WHL scorers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Flett|2009|p=173}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fleury retained this style of play throughout his hockey career, routinely surprising opponents who felt their size was an advantage.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Johnson |first=George |url=http://www.calgaryherald.com/sports/Back+saddle/1990696/story.html |title=Back in the saddle |work=Calgary Herald |date=2009-09-14 |accessdate=2009-11-01 |ref=}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fleury twice represented [[Canada men's national junior ice hockey team|Canada]] at the [[IIHF World U20 Championship|World Junior Hockey Championships]]. He first joined the team for the [[1987 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships|1987 tournament]] in [[Piešťany]], [[Czechoslovakia]]. The tournament is best remembered for the &quot;[[Punch-up in Piestany]]&quot; on January 4, 1987, an infamous [[bench-clearing brawl]] between the Canadians and the [[Soviet Union national ice hockey team|Soviet Union]]. Fleury scored the first goal of the game and, as part of his celebration, used his stick to mimic firing a [[machine gun]] at the Soviet bench, a move that was criticized by Canadian officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Joyce|2006|p=126}}&lt;/ref&gt; The brawl began early in the second period with Canada leading 4–2, when Pavel Kostichkin slashed Fleury, leading to a fight between the two. It quickly escalated into a [[line brawl]] involving all skaters on the ice, after which the Soviet players left their bench, followed closely by the Canadians.&lt;ref name=&quot;cbcarchives&quot;&gt;{{citation |url=http://archives.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/clips/12742/ |title=The Punch-up in Piestany |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |accessdate=2008-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both teams were disqualified from the tournament, costing Fleury and the Canadians a medal -– potentially the gold.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Joyce|2006|p=148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Ice Hockey Federation]] suspended all players involved in the brawl from participating in international tournaments for 18&amp;nbsp;months, though the bans were later reduced to 6&amp;nbsp;months on appeal. This reduction allowed Fleury to participate in the [[1988 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships|1988 tournament]] in [[Moscow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Joyce|2006|p=215}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was named captain,&lt;ref name=&quot;Fire50&quot; /&gt; finished second in team scoring with eight points in seven games, and was named a tournament all-star as Canada won the gold medal.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.tsn.ca/World_jrs/feature/?fid=987 |title=WJHC history (gold) – 1988 |publisher=The Sports Network |accessdate=2009-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although he scored 129 points for the Warriors in [[1986–87 WHL season|1986–87]],&lt;ref name=&quot;LOHFleury&quot; /&gt; Fleury's small stature led many teams to doubt that he could play in the NHL.&lt;ref name=&quot;HeraldTimeline&quot;&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.calgaryherald.com/sports/hockey/calgary-flames/Theoren+Fleury+timeline/1872226/story.html |title=Theoren Fleury: A timeline |work=Calgary Herald |date=2009-08-08 |accessdate=2009-09-19}} {{Dead link|date=March 2012|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Calgary Flames]] drafted him in the 8th round, 166th overall, of the [[1987 NHL Entry Draft]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hanlon|2008|p=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon completing his junior season in 1988, Fleury signed his first professional contract, worth [[Canadian Dollar|C$]]415,000, and joined the Flames' [[International Hockey League (1945–2001)|International Hockey League]] (IHL) affiliate, the [[Salt Lake Golden Eagles]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Fire50&quot; /&gt; He scored seven points in two regular season games, then 16 more in eight playoff games as the Eagles won the [[Turner Cup]] championship.&lt;ref name=&quot;LOHFleury&quot; /&gt;

===Calgary Flames===
Fleury arrived at the Flames' 1988 training camp {{convert|20|lb|kg}} overweight, and was assigned back to Salt Lake to begin the 1988–89 season.&lt;ref name=&quot;TradeTimeline&quot;&gt;{{citation |title=Fleury Chronology |work=Calgary Herald |date=1999-03-01 |page=D9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He averaged nearly two points per game, recording 37&amp;nbsp;goals and 37&amp;nbsp;assists to lead the IHL in scoring after 40&amp;nbsp;games.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fleury|2009|p=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mired in a slump, the Flames recalled Fleury on January 1, 1989, in the hope he could help their offence.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Kuzma |first=Ben |title=Fleury gets chance to renew acquaintances with Sakic |work=Calgary Herald |date=1989-01-02 |page=D1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He played his first NHL game against the [[Quebec Nordiques]] two nights later and recorded his first points – three assists – on January 5 against the [[Los Angeles Kings]].&lt;ref name=&quot;TradeTimeline&quot; /&gt;  He scored his first two NHL goals in a 7–2 victory over the [[Edmonton Oilers]] on January 7.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Duhatschek |first=Eric |title=Little brother shows 'em how |work=Calgary Herald |date=1989-01-08 |page=A1 |ref=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fleury continued to score, and finished with 34&amp;nbsp;points in 36&amp;nbsp;games in his NHL rookie season.&lt;ref name=&quot;LOHFleury&quot; /&gt;  He added 11 points in the playoffs, helping the Flames to the first [[Stanley Cup]] championship in franchise history.&lt;ref name=&quot;TradeTimeline&quot; /&gt;

After improving to 33&amp;nbsp;goals in his first full season, Fleury broke out in [[1990–91 NHL season|1990–91]], scoring [[List of NHL players with 50 goal seasons|51 goals]] and [[List of NHL players with 100 point seasons|104 points]] to lead the Flames offensively.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hanlon|2008|p=150}}&lt;/ref&gt; He played in the [[42nd National Hockey League All-Star Game|1991 All-Star Game]],&lt;ref name=&quot;MediaGuide All-Star&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Hanlon|2008|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; scoring a goal in an 11–5 victory by the [[Campbell Conference]] over the [[Wales Conference]].  Towards the end of the season, Fleury set a league record by scoring three [[Goal (ice hockey)|shorthanded goals]] in one game against the [[St. Louis Blues (ice hockey)|St. Louis Blues]].&lt;ref name=&quot;TradeTimeline&quot; /&gt; He shared the [[NHL Plus-Minus Award]] with [[Marty McSorley]], whom he tied for the league lead with [[Plus-minus (ice hockey)|+48]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MediaGuideAwards&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Hanlon|2008|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fleury scored only two goals in the [[1991 Stanley Cup Playoffs]], but after his overtime winner in game six against the Oilers he famously slid the entire length of the ice in jubilation before crashing into the boards as his teammates attempted to catch up to him.&lt;ref name=&quot;TradeTimeline&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSRFLUBgvzc |title=Game 6, Calgary Flames at Edmonton Oilers (04/24/91) |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (via YouTube) |accessdate=2009-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Flames were defeated in game seven, which ended their season.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=2009–10 Calgary Flames Media Guide |publisher=Calgary Flames Hockey Club |editor=Hanlon, Peter and Kelso, Sean |page=258}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fleury fell back to 33&amp;nbsp;goals in [[1991–92 NHL season|1991–92]] as the Flames missed the playoffs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hanlon|2008|p=149}}&lt;/ref&gt; That season, he made his [[43rd National Hockey League All-Star Game|second All-Star Game]] appearance, recording a goal for the Campbell Conference. Fleury finished with over 100&amp;nbsp;points for the second time in his career in [[1992–93 NHL season|1992–93]] to lead the team in scoring,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hanlon|2008|p=148}}&lt;/ref&gt; and set a franchise record by going +9 in a 13–1 victory over the [[San Jose Sharks]] on February 10, 1993, in which he scored six points.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Stewart |first=Monte |title=Flames bomb Sharks |work=Calgary Herald |date=1993-02-11 |page=E1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[1994–95 NHL lockout]] reduced the season to 48 games from 84. During the lockout, Fleury played for [[Tappara]] in [[Finland]]'s top league, the [[SM-liiga]]. He recorded 17 points in ten games before the NHL's labour dispute was resolved, bringing him back to Calgary.&lt;ref name=&quot;LOHFleury&quot; /&gt; Late in the season, Fleury recorded two goals and an assist against the Oilers on March 31, 1995, to surpass 500&amp;nbsp;career points.&lt;ref name=&quot;TradeTimeline&quot; /&gt;

Lacking a contract prior to the [[1995–96 NHL season|1995–96 season]], Fleury staged a brief hold-out during training camp before signing a five-year, $12&amp;nbsp;million deal with the Flames. He agreed to take less money than he could have received on the open market out of loyalty to the franchise that had given him his NHL opportunity.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Board |first=Mike |title=Loyalty over Loonies |work=Calgary Herald |date=1995-09-23 |page=E1 |ref=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He missed much of the pre-season with a stomach ailment, but joined the team for the season opener.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Duhatschek |first=Eric |title=Fleury pencils himself into lineup |work=Calgary Herald |date=1995-10-04 |page=C1 |ref=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he felt like somebody was &quot;stabbing a knife in [his] gut every five minutes&quot;, Fleury had played every game for the Flames when he revealed in December 1995 that he had been diagnosed with [[Crohn's Disease]] and doctors had finally found the correct medication to control it.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Maki |first=Allan |title=Fleury battling Crohn's |work=Calgary Herald |date=1995-12-28 |page=C7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the ailment, Fleury led the team in goals, assists and points,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hanlon|2008|p=145}}&lt;/ref&gt; and played in his third [[46th National Hockey League All-Star Game|All-Star Game]], serving as Calgary's only representative.&lt;ref name=&quot;MediaGuide All-Star&quot; /&gt;

When [[Joe Nieuwendyk]] refused to report to the Flames prior to the 1995 season, they named Fleury interim [[captain (ice hockey)|captain]]. The title was made permanent when Nieuwendyk was traded in December.&lt;ref name=&quot;TradeTimeline&quot; /&gt; Fleury was reluctant to assume the captaincy, but did so out of loyalty to the team and because there was nobody else capable of taking on the role.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Duhatschek |first=Eric |title=Fleury steps down as Flames' captain |work=Calgary Herald |date=1997-07-03 |page=E3 |ref=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He relinquished it two seasons later after deciding that it was harming his play and affecting his relationship with his teammates and coach [[Pierre Pagé]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTCaptain&quot;&gt;{{citation |last=Lapointe |first=Joe |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1997/09/28/sports/hockey-wearing-hockey-s-badge-leadership-captain-s-c-carries-much-influence-ice.html |title=Wearing hockey's badge of leadership |work=New York Times |date=1997-09-28 |accessdate=2009-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Flames struggled in [[1996–97 NHL season|1996–97]], finishing last in the [[Pacific Division (NHL)|Pacific Division]] and missing the playoffs for only the second time since their arrival in Calgary in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hanlon|2008|p=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fleury again led the team in scoring, but his 29&amp;nbsp;goals were the fewest he had scored in a full season in the NHL.&lt;ref name=&quot;LOHFleury&quot; /&gt; He was the Flames' lone representative at the [[47th National Hockey League All-Star Game|1997 All-Star Game]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MediaGuide All-Star&quot; /&gt;  He scored only 27&amp;nbsp;goals in [[1997–98 NHL season|1997–98]], but increased his point total from 67 to 78 while also leading the team with 197&amp;nbsp;[[Penalty (ice hockey)|penalties in minutes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hanlon|2008|p=143}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 29, 1997, Fleury scored his 315th career goal, breaking Nieuwendyk's franchise record. The same day, he was named to Team Canada for the [[1998 Winter Olympics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Duhatschek |first=Eric |title=McCarthy grounds Ducks |work=Calgary Herald |date=1997-11-30 |page=B5 |ref=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fleury participated in his [[48th National Hockey League All-Star Game|fifth All-Star Game]] that season, but the Flames again missed the playoffs.

Fleury made his debut for the Avalanche the day after the trade and was met with loud cheers from the [[Denver]] crowd.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Duhatschek |first=Eric |title=Theo gets rousing Denver greeting |work=Calgary Herald |date=1999-03-02 |page=C3 |ref=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored a goal in a 4–3 loss to Edmonton, but also sprained his knee and missed the next two weeks.

The Avalanche chose not to re-sign Fleury, and he joined the [[New York Rangers]] on a three-year contract worth $21&amp;nbsp;million that included a club option for a fourth year at $7&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=El-Bashir |first=Tarik |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1999/07/09/sports/hockey-feeling-wanted-fleury-becomes-a-ranger.html?scp=23&amp;sq=Fleury&amp;st=nyt |title=Feeling wanted, Fleury becomes a Ranger |work=New York Times |date=1999-07-09 |accessdate=2009-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; He touched off a wave of anger on signing with the Rangers when he claimed he was unappreciated in Calgary, comments he later stated were directed at the Flames' owners and not the team's fans, whom he said always supported him.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Duhatschek |first=Eric |title=Fleury still cool to Flames |work=Calgary Herald |date=1999-10-01 |page=C3 |ref=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fleury's first year in [[Manhattan]] was a disappointment. He scored only 15&amp;nbsp;goals in [[1999–2000 NHL season|1999–2000]], struggling under the pressure of trying to lead the Rangers into the playoffs and adapting to life in [[New York]]. After the season, he voluntarily entered a league-operated program that treats substance abuse and emotional problems, though he denied that either had any effect on his play.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Kennedy |first=Kostya |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1021332/index.htm |title=Fleury of goals |work=Sports Illustrated |date=2000-12-11 |accessdate=2009-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Senior hockey and the Belfast Giants===
In January 2005, Fleury announced that he had joined his cousin [[Todd Holt]] and former NHL players [[Gino Odjick]], [[Sasha Lakovic]] and [[Dody Wood]] in playing for the [[Horse Lake Thunder]] of the [[North Peace Hockey League]] for the [[Allan Cup]], Canada's national senior amateur championship.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/story/2005/01/05/fleury050105.html |title=Fleury to play senior hockey in Alberta |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |date=2005-01-06 |accessdate=2009-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also hoped to serve as a role model for kids on the [[Horse Lakes 152b|Horse Lake First Nation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;GPHT&quot;&gt;{{citation |last=Woodard |first=Dale |url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Hockey/NHL/2005/01/06/812391.html |title=It's game on for Fleury |work=Grande Prairie Herald-Tribune |date=2005-01-06 |accessdate=2009-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hockey Alberta]] initially ruled that he was ineligible to play [[senior ice hockey|senior hockey]] in 2004–05 because he had been signed to a professional contract during the 2003–04 season.  Hockey Alberta denied an appeal, citing a new policy it had put in effect to prevent NHL players from joining senior teams during the [[2004–05 NHL lockout]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.tsn.ca/nhl/story/?id=111272&amp;hubname=nhl |title=Theo Fleury's appeal denied |publisher=The Sports Network |date=2005-01-14 |accessdate=2009-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; It reversed its decision on a second appeal after the NHL and [[National Hockey League Players Association]] both agreed that Fleury was a free agent, and not a locked-out player.  Fleury played his first game for the Thunder on January 22, 2005, scoring a goal and two assists.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/story/2005/01/23/fleury050123.html |title=Theo Fleury nets 3 points in his return |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |date=2005-01-23 |accessdate=2009-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fleury remained embroiled in controversy at the [[2005 Allan Cup]] tournament.

Unhappy with how his NHL career ended, Fleury hired a personal trainer in February 2009 and began an attempt to return to the NHL. By August, he petitioned Commissioner [[Gary Bettman]] to lift his suspension.&lt;ref name=&quot;reinstatement&quot; /&gt; He was reinstated on September 10 following a meeting with Bettman, Deputy Commissioner [[Bill Daly]] and league doctors.&lt;ref name=&quot;HeraldReinstatement&quot;&gt;{{citation |last=Hall |first=Vicki |url=http://www.calgaryherald.com/story_print.html?id=1981395&amp;sponsor= |title=Bettman clears Fleury to return to NHL |work=Calgary Herald |date=2009-09-10 |accessdate=2009-09-20}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fleury then accepted a try-out offer from the Flames.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://flames.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=498338 |title=Flames offer Theo Fleury a try-out |publisher=Calgary Flames Hockey Club |date=2009-09-12 |accessdate=2009-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said he wanted to prove to himself that he could still play at the NHL level, though his skeptics pointed to his child support payments and the failure of his concrete business, as well as the planned release of his autobiography, and argued Fleury's comeback was financially motivated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Francis |first=Eric |title=Forecast calling for Fleury |work=Calgary Sun |date=2009-09-12 |page=4 |ref=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He made his return to the NHL in an exhibition game in Calgary against the [[New York Islanders]] on September 17 on a line with [[Daymond Langkow]] and [[Nigel Dawes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.tsn.ca/nhl/story/?id=291363 |title=Fleury looking forward to playing first game with Flames |publisher=The Sports Network |date=2009-09-17 |accessdate=2009-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fleury was met with loud cheers throughout the game, and scored the only goal in a [[Overtime (ice hockey)|shootout]] to give the Flames a 5–4 win.

Fleury played four exhibition games, scoring four points, before being released by the Flames.

Fleury made his debut with the [[Canada national men's ice hockey team|Canadian senior team]] at the  [[1990 Men's World Ice Hockey Championships|1990 World Hockey Championships]], scoring 11&amp;nbsp;points in nine games for the fourth-place Canadians.&lt;ref name=&quot;LOHFleury&quot; /&gt;  He returned the following year despite a knee injury, helping Canada win the silver medal at the [[1991 Men's World Ice Hockey Championships|1991 tournament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fleury|2009|p=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His 51-goal NHL season in 1990–91 also earned Fleury a spot at the [[1991 Canada Cup]], where he scored a goal and four assists in seven games for the tournament champion Canadians.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.hhof.com/HTML/GamesSummaryCCUP1991.shtml |title=Canada Cup – 1991 summary |publisher=Hockey Hall of Fame |accessdate=2009-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five years later, he played in the [[1996 World Cup of Hockey]], the successor to the [[Canada Cup (ice hockey)|Canada Cup]].  He finished fourth in the tournament with four goals,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.hhof.com/html/StatLeadersWCUP1996.shtml |title=1996 World Cup statistical leaders |publisher=Hockey Hall of Fame |accessdate=2009-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Canada finished in second place after giving up four goals in the final four minutes of the championship game against the [[United States national men's ice hockey team|American team]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.hhof.com/html/GamesSummaryWCUP1996.shtml |title=World Cup of Hockey 1996 summary |publisher=Hockey Hall of Fame |accessdate=2009-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

National Hockey League players were first allowed to participate in the [[Ice hockey at the Winter Olympics|Olympic ice hockey]] tournament at the [[1998 Winter Olympics|1998 games]].  Invited to join Canada's &quot;Dream Team&quot;, Fleury described his selection as a highlight of his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Board |first=Mike |title=Fleury's state is global after getting call from Canada |work=Calgary Herald |date=1997-11-30 |page=B1 |ref=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He scored a goal for Canada, who lost their semi-final match-up against the [[Czech Republic national men's ice hockey team|Czech Republic]] in a [[Shootout (ice hockey)|shootout]] and failed to medal.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Farber |first=Michael |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1012122/index.htm |title=Was it worth it? |work=Sports Illustrated |date=1998-03-02 |accessdate=2009-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Four years later, Fleury was invited by General Manager [[Wayne Gretzky]] to participate in Canada's selection camp for the [[Ice hockey at the 2002 Winter Olympics|2002 Olympics]].  The invitation was controversial, as his behavioural and substance abuse issues had become increasingly public in previous months.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Sportak |first=Randy |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/hockey/nhl/news/2001/07/25/canada_olympics_slam/ |title=Depth Charge |publisher=CNN/Sports Illustrated |date=2001-07-25 |accessdate=2009-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fleury wanted to justify Gretzky's support and, knowing that he would be removed from consideration if he failed, refrained from drinking or taking drugs during the [[2001–02 NHL season]], later describing himself as a &quot;dry drunk&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fleury|2009|p=237}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He earned a spot on the team and recorded two assists in six games as the Canadian hockey team won its first Olympic gold medal in 50 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/olympics/2002/ice_hockey/news/2002/02/24/usa_canada_ap/ |title=Stand on guard for thee |publisher=CNN/Sports Illustrated |date=2002-02-24 |accessdate=2009-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fleury considers the championship to be the pinnacle of his career.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fleury|2009|p=246}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fleury continued to battle drug and alcohol addictions, revealing in a November 2004 interview that he had not overcome the problems that ended his NHL career a year and a half earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/story/2004/11/01/theo_fleury041101.html |title=I'm not sober: Theoren Fleury |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |date=2004-11-02 |accessdate=2009-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; He credits his second wife, Jennifer, with turning his life around after they met when he was playing for Horse Lake in 2005. Fleury feared that Jennifer's frustration with his drug use would cost him the relationship, and, with her help, quit drugs and drinking on September 18, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fleury|2009|pp=303–304}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were married one year later and have a daughter, Skylah.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Francis |first=Eric |url=http://www.calgarysun.com/sports/columnists/eric_francis/2009/09/17/10951351-sun.html |title='She's my winger' |work=Calgary Sun |date=2009-09-17 |accessdate=2009-09-23 |ref=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fleury also has a son and daughter, Beaux and Tatym, from his relationship with his first wife, Veronica,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Dellapina |first=John |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/sports/2001/11/22/2001-11-22_the_family_man___after_nearl.html |title=The family man |work=New York Daily News |date=2001-11-22 |accessdate=2009-09-23}} {{Dead link|date=March 2012|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a son, Josh, born in 1987 to his high school girlfriend, Shannon.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fleury|2009|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, Fleury joined a group that involved his former junior coach, [[Graham James (ice hockey)|Graham James]], fellow NHL player [[Joe Sakic]], and professional wrestler [[Bret Hart]] as a minority owner of the expansion [[Calgary Hitmen]] of the [[Western Hockey League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Tucker |first=Larry |title=Method to this madness |work=Calgary Herald |date=1994-06-24 |page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; He sold his share of the team to the Flames in 1997 in the aftermath of James' conviction for sexually abusing [[Sheldon Kennedy]] and another player.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Board |first=Mike |title=Flames take shot at owning Hitmen |work=Calgary Herald |date=1997-06-14 |page=E1 |ref=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After returning from Northern Ireland, he operated Fleury's Concrete Coatings, a concrete sealing business he started with his wife Jennifer and brother Travis, until it closed in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Francis |first=Eric |url=http://www.calgarysun.com/sports/columnists/eric_francis/2009/09/11/10835541-sun.html |title=Talk of Theo signing heats up |work=Calgary Sun |date=2009-09-11 |accessdate=2009-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; He filmed a [[pilot episode]] in 2007 for a [[Reality TV]] series based on his concrete business called ''Theoren Fleury: Rock Solid'': &quot;We want to show people that if you have a dream, anything is possible with a little ambition,&quot; Fleury said of the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Doody |first=Kelly | url=http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/MediaNews/2007/12/15/4726246-sun.html | title=Rogers bash lives up to Christmas billing |work=Calgary Sun |date=2007-12-15 | accessdate=2008-09-12}} {{Dead link|date=March 2012|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not picked up by any network.

The 2008 launch of clothing line &quot;FAKE&quot; (Fleury's Artistic Kustom Enterprises) led him to approach the [[Calgary Vipers]] of the [[Golden Baseball League]] in the hope of convincing them to use his brand of practice jerseys. The conversation led to talk of Fleury playing a game for the Vipers as a publicity stunt.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=McIntyre |first=Heather | url=http://www.canada.com/calgaryherald/news/sports/story.html?id=c370a204-3c51-4353-a1f6-d80a37091886 | title=Fleury will be a Viper for a day | work=Calgary Herald |date=2008-05-23 | accessdate=2009-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his professional baseball debut on August 9, 2008, at the age of 40, hitting a [[single (baseball)|single]] in a [[pinch hitter|pinch-hit]] appearance against the [[Yuma Scorpions]]. He started the second game at [[left fielder|left field]] and [[strikeout|struck out]] twice before he was replaced. &quot;I've had so many things happen in my life already that I sometimes surprise myself with the things I've done, the things I've accomplished. This was just another one of those days,&quot; Fleury said of his appearance with the Vipers.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Down |first=John |title=Fleury's a big hit |work=Calgary Herald |date=2008-08-10 |page=F5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fleury has organized or participated in numerous charitable causes. He launched a hockey school in the mid-1990s that ran for seven years in Calgary and another eight in Russell, and donated the proceeds to minor hockey associations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fleury|2009|pp=116–118}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following his diagnosis with [[Crohn's Disease]] in 1995, Fleury joined with the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of Canada to host an annual golf tournament in Calgary. The event has raised over $1&amp;nbsp;million,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fleury|2009|p=312}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is one of the organization's largest fundraising events in the Calgary area.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://mmccfc.golfreg.com/pages/index.cfm?PageID=36549 |title=About Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) |publisher=Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of Canada |accessdate=2009-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; He participates in Flames Alumni events and volunteers with the Calgary Dream Centre, which helps people overcome addiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fleury|2009|pp=311–312}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fleury was a participant on the second season of the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] [[figure skating]] reality show ''[[Battle of the Blades]]'', aired in the fall of 2010, and was donating his winnings to The Men's Project, a charity that provides support for men abused in childhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Harris |first=Bill |url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Hockey/News/2010/09/07/15266786.html |title=Fleury ready for different battle |publisher=Slam!

===Autobiography===
With the help of [[Kirstie McLellan Day]], Fleury wrote his [[autobiography]], ''[[Playing with Fire (Autobiography)|Playing with Fire]]'', which was released on October 16, 2009. In it, he alleged that he was sexually abused by Graham James over a period of two years. While he stated he &quot;doesn't want to become the poster boy for abuse by James&quot;, Fleury hoped that speaking out might make it easier for other childhood sexual abuse victims to come forward.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/story/2009/10/09/sp-fleury-tell-all.html |title=Fleury tell-all book chronicles sexual abuse |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |date=2009-10-09 |accessdate=2009-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; He blamed the abuse for turning him into a &quot;raging, alcoholic lunatic&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Maki |first=Allan |url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/fleury-opens-up-about-sexual-abuse/article1319778/ |title=Fleury opens up about sexual abuse |work=The Globe and Mail |date=2009-10-10 |accessdate=2009-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and claimed to have placed a loaded gun in his mouth and contemplated suicide in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.calgaryherald.com/health/Fleury+pondered+suicide+autobiography+reveals/2098274/story.html |title=Fleury pondered suicide, autobiography reveals |work=Calgary Herald |date=2009-10-14 |accessdate=2009-10-20 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20091016193825/http://www.calgaryherald.com/health/Fleury+pondered+suicide+autobiography+reveals/2098274/story.html &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt; |archivedate=2009-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; He revealed that he had spent most of his income on alcohol, drugs, gambling and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=MacIntyre |first=Iain |url=http://www.vancouversun.com/sports/Smarter+fitter+sober+Fleury+playing+with+fire+again/2018822/story.html |title=Smarter, fitter and sober Fleury playing with fire again |work=Vancouver Sun |date=2009-09-22 |accessdate=2009-11-01}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fleury also claimed that he failed 13 consecutive drug tests while playing for the Rangers, but that the league did not want to suspend him because he was a leading scorer. The league disputed this, and stated that its substance abuse program functioned appropriately.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Klein |first=Jeff Z. |url=http://slapshot.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/10/14/wednesdays-news-of-hockey-91409-nhl-answers-fleurys-drug-test-allegations/ |title=N.H.L. answers Fleury's drug test allegations |work=New York Times |accessdate=2009-10-20 | date=2009-10-14 |unused_data=date-2009-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Playing with Fire'' became the top seller on [[Amazon.com|Amazon.ca]] within a week of its release, and Fleury stated that he had been contacted by several sexual abuse victims who were motivated by his book to seek help.&lt;ref name=&quot;CFCNinterview&quot;&gt;{{citation |url=http://calgary.ctv.ca/servlet/an/local/CTVNews/20091019/CGY_fleury_theo_091017/20091019/?hub=CalgaryHome |title=Fleury's book helping others |publisher=CTV Calgary |date=2009-10-19 |accessdate=2009-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also revealed that he was contemplating a criminal complaint against James,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/alberta/story/2009/10/14/sp-fleury-allegations-official.html |title=Fleury may press charges against James |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |date=2009-10-14 |accessdate=2009-10-20}} {{Dead link|date=March 2012|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; and had begun volunteering with an organization dedicated to helping male sexual abuse victims.&lt;ref name=&quot;CFCNinterview&quot; /&gt; Fleury was surprised that his story became the top-selling non-fiction book in Canada; without help, he and his wife were unable to keep up with the mail they were receiving.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=MacLeod |first=Meredith |url=http://www.thespec.com/News/Business/article/663459 |title=Ice and fire: hockey star Fleury inspires as author, role model |work=Hamilton Spectator |date=2009-10-30 |accessdate=2009-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the second book about Fleury's life, following ''Fury'', released in 1997, which did not discuss many of the problems he was facing at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Johnson |first=George |url=http://www.nationalpost.com/sports/story.html?id=2004931 |title=Fleury no longer playing with fire |work=National Post |date=2009-09-17 |accessdate=2009-11-01 |ref=}} {{Dead link|date=March 2012|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon the release of the autobiography, [[Sheldon Kennedy]] encouraged Fleury to press charges against James.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Komarnicki |first=Jamie |url=http://www.leaderpost.com/sports/Abuse+victim+Kennedy+hopes+Fleury+will+follow+through+with+charges/2091029/story.html |title=Abuse victim Kennedy hopes Fleury will 'follow through' with charges |work=Calgary Herald |date=2009-10-10 |accessdate=2010-01-14}} {{Dead link|date=March 2012|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fleury retained a lawyer to look into the possibility,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalpost.com/sports/story.html?id=2139091 |title=Fleury gets high profile lawyer to look at legal action |work=National Post |date=2009-10-23 |accessdate=2010-01-14}} {{Dead link|date=March 2012|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; and revealed on January 14, 2010, that he had filed a complaint with City of [[Winnipeg]] Police, who had begun an investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Dreger |first=Darren |url=http://www.tsn.ca/nhl/story/?id=306136 |title=Fleury meets with police regarding abuse by James |publisher=The Sports Network |date=2010-01-14 |accessdate=2010-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  James ultimately pleaded guilty to charges stemming from his abuse of Fleury and his cousin [[Todd Holt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/story/2011/12/07/mb-graham-james-court-winnipeg.html |title=Graham James pleads guilty to sex assaults |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |date=2011-12-07 |accessdate=2011-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; James was sentenced to two years in prison, a decision which sparked outrage across Canada.

McLellan Day is adapting the autobiography into a one-man play, entitled ''Playing with Fire: The Theo Fleury Story'', to be produced by [[Alberta Theatre Projects]] in [[Calgary]], Alberta. The play will make its world premiere May 1, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.atplive.com/The-Shows/PlayingWithFire/index.html |title=Playing with Fire: The Theo Fleury Story |publisher=Alberta Theatre Projects |accessdate=2011-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
