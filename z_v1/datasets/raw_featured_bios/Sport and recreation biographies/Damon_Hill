'''Damon Graham Devereux Hill''' &lt;small&gt;[[Order of the British Empire|OBE]]&lt;/small&gt; (born 17 September 1960) is a retired British racing driver from [[England]]. In 1996 Hill won the [[Formula One]] World Championship. As the son of the late [[Graham Hill]], he is the only son of a world champion to win the title.&lt;!-- Please do not alter this statement until the facts change - neither Antonio Ascari nor Gilles Villeneuve won the World Championship --&gt; His father died in an aeroplane crash when Hill was 15.

==Personal and early life==
Hill was born in [[Hampstead]], London on 17 September 1960 to Graham and Bette Hill. [[Graham Hill]] was a racing driver in the international [[Formula One]] series. He won the world drivers' championship in 1962 and 1968 and became a well known personality in the United Kingdom. Graham Hill's career provided a comfortable living. By 1975 the family lived in a &quot;25-room country mansion&quot; in Hertfordshire and Damon attended the independent [[Haberdashers' Aske's Boys' School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukwhoswho.com/view/article/oupww/whoswho/U20140|title=HILL, Damon Graham Devereux|month=December | year=2007|work=Who's Who 2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=2008-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The death of his father in an aeroplane crash in 1975 left the 15-year-old Hill, his mother, and sisters Samantha and Brigitte in drastically reduced circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Henry | first = Alan | title = Damon Hill | publisher=Patrick Stephens Ltd. | location = Cambridge | year = 1994 | isbn = 1-85260-484-0|pages=10–12 &amp; 16–17}} (subscription required)&lt;/ref&gt; Hill worked as a labourer and a motorcycle courier to support his further education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people=Aspel, Michael (presenter) |date=-1999-01-11 |title=This Is Your Life – Damon Hill OBE |medium=Television Production |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |location=London, UK |accessdate=2008-10-17 |time=00:56–01:03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hill is married to Susan George ('Georgie' – born 29 April 1961) and they have four children: Oliver (born 4 March 1989), [[Josh Hill (racing driver)|Joshua]] (born 9 January 1991), Tabitha (born 19 July 1995) and Rosie (born 1 February 1998). Oliver was born with [[Down syndrome|Down's syndrome]] and Hill and Georgie are both patrons of the Down's Syndrome Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Down's Syndrome Association Annual Report 2006-2007|page=20|url=http://www.downs-syndrome.org.uk/images/stories/DSA-documents/annual_review_06-07.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2008-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, Damon also became the first patron of St. Joseph's Specialist School and College, a school for children with severe learning disabilities and autism in Cranleigh, Surrey. Joshua started racing in 2008,&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Sun (newspaper)|The Sun]]'', 2008-11-03, p.52&lt;/ref&gt; and as of 2011 is competing in the [[British Formula Renault Championship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Josh Hill Racing|url=http://www.joshhillracing.com/|publisher=Josh Hill Racing|accessdate=11 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===Pre-Formula One===
[[File:Damon Hill helmet.jpg|thumb|right|Hill's helmet]]
Hill started his motorsport career in [[motorcycle racing]] in 1981. He used the same simple, easily identifiable helmet design as his father: eight white oar blades arranged vertically around the upper surface of a dark blue helmet. The device and colours represent the [[London Rowing Club]] for which Graham Hill rowed in the early 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Henry | first = Alan | title = Damon Hill: From Zero to Hero | publisher=Patrick Stephens Ltd. | location = Cambridge | year = 1994 | isbn = 1-85260-484-0|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he won a 350&amp;nbsp;cc clubman's championship at the [[Brands Hatch]] circuit,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Walker|first=Murray|coauthors=Taylor, Simon|title=Murray Walker's Formula One Heroes|publisher=Virgin Books|year=2001|page=136|isbn=1-85227-918-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; his racing budget came from working as a building labourer and he &quot;didn't really look destined for great things&quot; according to ''[[Motorcycle News]]'' reporter Rob McDonnell.&lt;ref name=Henry32&gt;{{cite book | last = Henry | first = Alan | title = Damon Hill | publisher=Patrick Stephens Ltd. | location = Cambridge | year = 1994 | isbn = 1-85260-484-0|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother, who was concerned about the dangers of racing motorcycles, persuaded him to take a racing car course at the Winfield Racing School in France in 1983. Although he showed &quot;above-average aptitude&quot;,&lt;ref name=Henry32 /&gt; Hill had only sporadic single-seater races until the end of 1984. He graduated through British [[Formula Ford]], winning six races driving a [[Van Diemen]] for Manadient Racing in 1985, his first full season in cars, and finishing third and fifth in the two UK national championships. He also took third place in the final of the 1985 [[Formula Ford Festival]], helping the UK to win the team prize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Henry | first = Alan | title = Damon Hill | publisher=Patrick Stephens Ltd. | location = Cambridge | year = 1994 | isbn = 1-85260-484-0|pages=29–36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For 1986, Hill planned to move up to the [[British Formula Three Championship]] with title-winning team [[West Surrey Racing]]. The loss of sponsorship from Ricoh, and then the death of his proposed team-mate Bertrand Fabi in a testing accident, ended Hill's proposed drive. Hill says &quot;When Bert was killed, I took the conscious decision that I wasn't going to stop doing that sort of thing. It's not just competing, it's doing something more exciting. I'm at my fullest skiing, racing or whatever. And I'm more frightened of letting it all slip and reaching 60 and finding I've done nothing.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Henry | first = Alan | title = Damon Hill | publisher=P. Stephens | location = Cambridge | year = 1994 | isbn = 1-85260-484-0|pages=37–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hill borrowed £100,000 to finance his racing and had a steady first season for Murray Taylor Racing in 1986 before taking a brace of wins in each of the following years for Intersport. He finished third in the 1988 championship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Henry | first = Alan | title = Damon Hill | publisher=P. Stephens | location = Cambridge | year = 1994 | isbn = 1-85260-484-0|pages=41–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe in the 1990s, a successful driver would usually progress from Formula Three either directly to Formula One, the pinnacle of the sport, or to the [[International Formula 3000]] championship. However, Hill did not have enough sponsorship available to fund a drive in F3000. He says &quot;I ended up having to reappraise my career a bit. The first thing was to realise how lucky I was to be driving anything. I made the decision that whatever I drove I would do it to the best of my ability and see where it led.&quot;&lt;ref name=GPcom&gt;{{cite web |last=Saward |first=Joe |url=http://www.grandprix.com/ft/ft00115.html |title=Interview: Damon Hill |work=GrandPrix.com |date=1992-04-01 |accessdate=2006-06-27 |publisher=Inside F1, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He took a one-off drive in the lower level British F3000 championship and shared a [[Porsche 962]] at [[1989 24 Hours of Le Mans|Le Mans]] for [[Richard Lloyd Racing]], where the engine failed after 228&amp;nbsp;laps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Henry | first = Alan | title = Damon Hill | publisher=P. Stephens | location = Cambridge | year = 1994 | isbn = 1-85260-484-0|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also competed in one race in the [[British Touring Car Championship]] at [[Donington Park]], driving a [[Ford Sierra|Ford Sierra RS500]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.btcc.net/html/history_driver_detail.php?id=31&amp;PHPSESSID=7a022d867dfed7e131167400c7c5fae1|title=BTCC Drivers/Damon Hill|publisher=BTCC.net|accessdate=2008-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Midway through the season, an opportunity arose at the uncompetitive Mooncraft F3000 team. The team tested Hill and [[Perry McCarthy]]. Their performances were comparable but according to the team manager, John Wickham, the team sponsors preferred the Hill name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Henry | first = Alan | title = Damon Hill | publisher=P. Stephens | location = Cambridge | year = 1994 | isbn = 1-85260-484-0|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although his best result was a 15th place, Hill's race performances for Mooncraft led to an offer to drive a [[Lola Cars|Lola]] chassis for Middlebridge Racing in 1990. He took three pole positions and led five races in 1990, but did not win a race during his Formula 3000 career.&lt;ref name=GPcom /&gt;

===Formula One===
====1992: Brabham====
Hill started his Grand Prix career during the [[1991 Formula One season|1991 season]] as a test driver with the championship-winning [[WilliamsF1|Williams]] team while still competing in the F3000 series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://atlasf1.autosport.com/news/drivers/dhill.html|title=Damon Hill|year=1999|publisher=Atlas F1|accessdate=2008-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, midway through [[1992 Formula One season|1992]] Hill broke into Grand Prix racing as a driver with the struggling [[Brabham]] team. The formerly competitive team was in serious financial difficulties. Hill started the season only after three races, replacing [[Giovanna Amati]] after her sponsorship had failed to materialise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.f1rejects.com/drivers/amati/biography.html|title=Giovanna Amati – Biography|date=2001-05-06|publisher=Formula One Rejects|accessdate=2008-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amati had not been able to get the car through qualifying but Hill matched his team-mate, [[Eric van de Poele]] by qualifying for two races, the mid-season [[1992 British Grand Prix|British]] and [[1992 Hungarian Grand Prix|Hungarian]] Grands Prix. Hill continued to test for the Williams team that year and the British Grand Prix saw [[Nigel Mansell]] win the race for Williams, while he finished last in the Brabham.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.formula1.com/teams_and_drivers/hall_of_fame/71/|title=F1 Hall of Fame – Damon Hill|last=Donaldson|first=Gerald|publisher=Formula One Administration|work=Formula1.com|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071129212358/http://www.formula1.com/teams_and_drivers/hall_of_fame/71/|archivedate=2007-11-29|accessdate=2008-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Brabham team collapsed after the Hungarian Grand Prix and did not complete the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Henry | first = Alan | title = Damon Hill | publisher=P. Stephens | location = Cambridge | year = 1994 | isbn = 1-85260-484-0|pages=96–97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====1993–1996: Williams====
[[File:Williams Renault FW16.jpg|thumb|right|Hill's 1994 number '0' Williams – Hill is one of only two drivers to have carried this number in the history of the F1 world championship and the only one to carry it twice.]]

When Mansell's team-mate [[Riccardo Patrese]] left Williams to drive for [[Benetton Formula|Benetton]] in [[1993 Formula One season|1993]], Hill was unexpectedly promoted to the race team alongside triple world champion [[Alain Prost]] ahead of more experienced candidates such as [[Martin Brundle]] and [[Mika Häkkinen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Walker|first=Murray|coauthors=Taylor, Simon|title=Murray Walker's Formula One Heroes|publisher=Virgin Books|year=2001|page=25|isbn=1-85227-918-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, the reigning driver's world champion carries the number '1' on his car and his team-mate takes the number '2'. Because Mansell, the 1992 champion, was not racing in Formula One in 1993, his Williams team were given numbers '0' and '2'. As the junior partner to Prost, Hill took '0', the second man in Formula One history to do so, after [[Jody Scheckter]] in [[1973 Formula One season|1973]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Car Number: Car 0|url= http://www.chicanef1.com/indiv.pl?name=0&amp;type=N |work=ChicaneF1.com |accessdate= 2008-11-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--As a result of the major difference in build between Hill and Prost, the Frenchman being a foot shorter, Williams eventually opted to build [[Williams_FW15C#The_Chassis|two slightly different FW15C tubs]]. This was also to accommodate Hill's size 12 feet, as he had repeatedly complained of cramp in the tight confines around the pedals.{{Fact|date=November 2008}} I can't find a ref for this anywhere. 4u1e--&gt;

The season did not start well when Hill spun out of second place shortly after the start of the [[1993 South African Grand Prix|South African]] Grand Prix and failed to finish the race after colliding with [[Alex Zanardi]] on lap 16. However, at the [[1993 Brazilian Grand Prix|Brazilian]] and [[1993 European Grand Prix|European]] Grands Prix, Prost fared poorly in the rain and Hill drove well enough to finish second behind another triple world champion, [[Ayrton Senna]]. In his first full season, Hill benefited from the experience of his veteran French team-mate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Derick |last=Allsop |title=Designs on Victory: On the Grand Prix Trail With Benetton |publisher=Hutchinson |isbn=0-09-178311-9 |year=1994 |page=188}}&lt;/ref&gt; His results continued to improve as the season went on. He took pole at the [[1993 French Grand Prix|French Grand Prix]] and closely followed Prost, team orders preventing him from seriously challenging for the win.&lt;ref name=&quot;prost_slowing_down&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grandprix.com/ft/ft00156.html|title=Is Alain Prost slowing down?|publisher=GrandPrix.com|author=Saward, Joe|date=1993-08-01|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080202183616/http://www.grandprix.com/ft/ft00156.html|archivedate=2008-02-02|accessdate=2008-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; He suffered an engine failure while leading the [[1993 British Grand Prix|British Grand Prix]] and a puncture near the end of the [[1993 German Grand Prix|German Grand Prix]] also while leading. Hill went on to win three successive races at the [[1993 Hungarian Grand Prix|Hungarian]], [[1993 Belgian Grand Prix|Belgian]] and [[1993 Italian Grand Prix|Italian]] Grands Prix. In doing so he became the first son of a Formula One Grand Prix winner to take victory himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Henry | first = Alan | title = Damon Hill | publisher=Patrick Stephens Ltd. | location = Cambridge | year = 1994 | isbn = 1-85260-484-0|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hill's third consecutive win clinched the constructors' championship for Williams and moved him temporarily to second in the drivers' standings until McLaren's Ayrton Senna passed him by winning the last two races. Prost finished the season as champion.

In [[1994 Formula One season|1994]], Senna joined Hill at Williams. As the reigning champion, this time Prost, was again no longer racing, Hill retained his number '0'. The pre-season betting was that Senna would coast to the title,&lt;ref&gt;''Formula One History: After Tamburello'' [http://www.f1-grandprix.com/history7.html F1-GrandPrix.com/History]. Retrieved 13 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt; but with the banning of electronic driver aids, the [[Benetton Formula|Benetton]] team and [[Michael Schumacher]] initially proved more competitive and won the first three races. At the [[1994 San Marino Grand Prix|San Marino Grand Prix]] on 1 May, Senna died after his car went off the road. With the team undergoing investigation from the Italian authorities on manslaughter charges, Hill found himself team leader with only one season’s experience in the top flight. It was widely reported at the time that the Williams car's steering column had failed, though Hill told BBC Sport in 2004 that he believed Senna simply took the corner too fast for the conditions, referring to the fact that the car had just restarted the race with cold tyres after being slowed down by a safety car.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/3641633.stm |title=Hill: Senna was at fault |work=BBC Sport  |date=2004-04-20 |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071020155752/news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/motorsport/3641633.stm|archivedate=2007-10-21|accessdate=2006-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:Damon Hill juillet 1995.jpg|thumb|right|Damon Hill at the 1995 French Grand Prix]]
Hill represented Williams alone at the next race, the [[1994 Monaco Grand Prix|Monaco Grand Prix]]. His race ended early in a collision involving several cars on the opening lap of the race. For the following race, the [[1994 Spanish Grand Prix|Spanish Grand Prix]], Williams' test driver [[David Coulthard]] was promoted to the race team alongside Hill, who won the race just four weeks after Senna's death. Twenty-six years earlier Graham Hill had won in Spain under similar circumstances for [[Team Lotus|Lotus]] after the death of his team-mate [[Jim Clark]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grandprix.com/ft/ft00366.html|title=The Spanish Grand Prix – a history|work=GrandPrix.com|publisher=Inside F1, Inc.|accessdate=2008-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Championship leader Schumacher finished second with a gearbox fault restricting him to fifth gear, having led the early laps.

Schumacher led by 66 points to 29 by the mid-point of the season. At the [[1994 French Grand Prix|French Grand Prix]], [[Frank Williams (Formula One)|Frank Williams]] brought back Mansell, who shared the second car with Coulthard for the remainder of the season. Mansell earned approximately £900,000 for each of his four races, while Hill was paid £300,000 for the entire season, though Hill's position as lead driver remained unquestioned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hamilton | first = Maurice | title = Frank Williams | publisher=Macmillan Publishers Ltd. | location = London, UK | year = 1998 | isbn = 0-333-71716-3|page=244 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hill came back into contention for the title after winning the [[1994 British Grand Prix|British Grand Prix]], a race which his father had never won.&lt;ref name=&quot;Walker 2001 138&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Walker|first=Murray|coauthors=Taylor, Simon|title=Murray Walker's Formula One Heroes|publisher=Virgin Books|year=2001|page=138|isbn=1-85227-918-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schumacher was disqualified from that race and banned for two further races for overtaking Hill during the formation lap and ignoring the subsequent black flag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rendall|first=Ivan|title=The Chequered Flag: 100 Years of Motor Racing|publisher=Weidenfeld and Nicolson|year=1993|page=354|isbn=0-297-83550-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four more victories for Hill, three of which were in races where Schumacher was excluded or disqualified, took the title battle to the final event at Adelaide. At Schumacher's first race since his ban, the [[1994 European Grand Prix|European Grand Prix]], he suggested that Hill (who was eight years his senior) was not a world class driver. However, during the penultimate race at the [[1994 Japanese Grand Prix|Japanese Grand Prix]], Hill took victory ahead of Schumacher in a rain-soaked event. This put Hill just one point behind the German before the last race of the season.&lt;ref name=racingrivalry&gt;{{cite web|url=http://atlasf1.autosport.com/99/fra/preview/horton.html|title=Reflections on a Racing Rivalry|last=Horton|first=Roger|publisher=Haymarket Group |work=AtlasF1.com|accessdate=2008-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neither Hill nor Schumacher finished the season-closing [[1994 Australian Grand Prix|Australian Grand Prix]], after a controversial collision which gave the title to Schumacher. Schumacher ran off the track hitting the wall with the right-hand side of his Benetton while leading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Benson |first=Andrew |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/low/motorsport/formula_one/5024532.stm |title=Schumacher's chequered history |work=BBC Sport Online |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=2006-05-28 |accessdate=2006-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coming into the sixth corner Hill moved to pass the Benetton and the two collided, breaking the Williams' front left [[Double wishbone suspension|suspension wishbone]], and forcing both drivers' retirement from the race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grandprix.com/gpe/rr564.html|title=Grand Prix results: Australian GP, 1994|work=GrandPrix.com|publisher=Inside F1, Inc.|accessdate=2008-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; BBC Formula One commentator [[Murray Walker]], a great fan and friend of Hill, has often maintained that Schumacher did not cause the crash intentionally.&lt;ref name=&quot;Walker 2001 138&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Walker|first=Murray|title=My Autobiography: Unless I'm Very Much Mistaken|publisher=HarperCollins Publishers London|year=2002|page=316|isbn=0-00-712696-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; WilliamsF1 co-owner [[Patrick Head]] feels differently. In 2006 he said that at the time of the incident &quot;Williams were already 100% certain that Michael was guilty of foul play&quot; but did not protest Schumacher's title because the team was still dealing with the death of Ayrton Senna.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://motoring.iafrica.com/formulaone/561093.htm |title='Ruthless' Schumi blasted |accessdate= 2008-10-23 |date=2006-07-19 |work=Motoring.iAfrica.com |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071013164119/http://motoring.iafrica.com/formulaone/561093.htm |archivedate=2007-10-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Hill explicitly accused Schumacher of causing the collision deliberately.&lt;ref name=&quot;motorsport07&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Taylor|first=S|year=2007|title=Lunch with...

[[File:Damon Hill 1995.jpg|thumb|left|Damon Hill driving for the [[WilliamsF1|Williams]] Formula One team in [[Canadian Grand Prix|Montreal]] in 1995.]]

Hill's season earned him the 1994 [[BBC Sports Personality of the Year]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= BBC Sports Personality past winners: 1993–1997 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/tv_and_radio/sports_personality_2003/3222666.stm#2 |work=BBC Sport Online |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=2003-11-27 |accessdate=2008-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Coming into the [[1995 Formula One season|1995 season]], Hill was one of the title favourites.&lt;ref name=HillGPcom&gt;{{cite web |title=Drivers:Damon Hill |url=http://www.grandprix.com/gpe/drv-hildam.html |work=GrandPrix.com |publisher=Inside F1, Inc. |accessdate=2006-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Williams team were reigning constructors' champions, having beaten Benetton in 1994, and with young David Coulthard, who was embarking on his first full season in Formula One, as team-mate, Hill was the clear number one driver. The year started badly when he spun off in Brazil due to a mechanical problem,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grandprix.com/gpe/rr565.html|title=Grand Prix results: Brazilian GP, 1995|work=GrandPrix.com|publisher=Inside F1, Inc.|accessdate=2008-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; but wins in the next two races put him in the championship lead. However, Schumacher won seven of the next twelve races, and took his second title with two races to spare, while Benetton took the constructors' championship. Schumacher and Hill had several on-track incidents during the season, two of which led to suspended one race bans. Schumacher's penalty was for blocking and forcing Hill off the road at the [[Belgian Grand Prix]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grandprix.com/gpe/rr575.html|title=Grand Prix Results: Belgian Grand Prix, 1995|work=GrandPrix.com|publisher=Inside F1, Inc.|accessdate=2008-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hill's was for colliding with Schumacher under braking at the [[1995 Italian Grand Prix|Italian Grand Prix]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grandprix.com/gpe/rr576.html|work=GrandPrix.com|title=Grand Prix results: Italian GP, 1995|publisher=Inside F1, Inc.|accessdate=2008-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hill's season finished positively when he won the [[1995 Australian Grand Prix|Australian Grand Prix]] by finishing two laps ahead of the runner-up, [[Olivier Panis]] in a [[Equipe Ligier|Ligier]].&lt;ref name=HillGPcom /&gt;

1995 was a disappointing season for Hill: some of the Williams team had been frustrated with his performances and Frank Williams began to consider bringing in [[Heinz-Harald Frentzen]] to replace him. With Hill already under contract for 1996, his place at the team was secure for one more season, but it would prove to be his last at Williams.&lt;ref name=HillGPcom /&gt;

In [[1996 Formula One season|1996]] the Williams car was clearly the quickest in Formula One&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Review of Year 1996 |url=http://www.grandprix.com/ft/ft00244.html |work=GrandPrix.com |first=Joe |last=Saward |date=2006-12-02 |publisher=Inside F1, Inc. |accessdate=2006-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Hill went on to win the title ahead of his rookie teammate [[Jacques Villeneuve]], becoming the only son of a Formula One champion to win the championship himself.&lt;ref name=heroes139&gt;{{cite book|last=Walker|first=Murray|coauthors=Taylor, Simon|title=Murray Walker's Formula One Heroes|publisher=Virgin Books|year=2001|page=139|isbn=1-85227-918-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taking eight wins and never qualifying off the front row, Hill enjoyed by far his most successful season. At Monaco, where his father had won five times in the 1960s, he led until his engine failed, curtailing his race and allowing Olivier Panis to take his only Formula One win. Near the end of the season, Villeneuve began to mount a title challenge and took pole in the [[1996 Japanese Grand Prix|Japanese Grand Prix]], the final race of the year. However, Hill took the lead at the start and won both the race and the championship after the Canadian retired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grandprix.com/gpe/rr597.html|title=Grand Prix results: Japanese GP, 1996|work=GrandPrix.com|publisher=Inside F1, Inc.|accessdate=2008-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hill equalled the record for starting all 16 races of the season from the front row, matching Ayrton Senna in {{F1|1989}} and Alain Prost in {{F1|1993}}. [[Sebastian Vettel]] holds the record for the highest number of front row starts in a season, with 18 in {{F1|2011}}.

Despite winning the title, Hill learned before the season's close that he was to be dropped by Williams in favour of Frentzen for the following season.&lt;ref name=heroes139 /&gt; Hill left Williams as the team's second most successful driver in terms of race victories, with 21, second only to Mansell.&lt;ref name=&quot;Autocourse Grand Prix Archive&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autocoursegpa.com/team_entries.asp?teamsroot_id=8174&amp;type=win|title=F1 statistics – Williams – wins|publisher=Crash Media Group Ltd|accessdate=2008-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hill's 1996 world championship earned him his second BBC Sports Personality Of The Year Award, making him one of only three people to receive the award twice – the others being boxer [[Henry Cooper (boxer)|Henry Cooper]] and Mansell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=BBC Sports Personality: Did you know? |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/tv_and_radio/sports_personality_2004/4003153.stm |work=BBC Sport Online |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=2004-11-19 |accessdate=2006-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hill was also awarded the [[Segrave Trophy]] by the [[Royal Automobile Club]]. The trophy is awarded to the British national who accomplishes the most outstanding demonstration of the possibilities of transport by land, sea, air, or water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royalautomobileclub.co.uk/Motoring/Trophies-and-Medals|title=Segrave Trophy|publisher=Royal Automobile Club|accessdate=2008-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====1997: Arrows====
[[File:Damon Hill 1997 Arrows.jpg|thumb|right|At the [[1997 British Grand Prix|British GP]], Hill scored his first point for the [[Arrows]] team.]]

Hill became the fourth driver in nine years to win the World Drivers' Championship and not drive for Williams the following season following in the footsteps of [[Nelson Piquet]] ({{f1|1987}} WDC - {{f1|1988}} drove for [[Team Lotus|Lotus]]), [[Nigel Mansell]] ({{f1|1992}} WDC - 1993 competed in the [[United States|US]] based [[Champ Car World Series]] instead of F1) and [[Alain Prost]] ([[F1 1993|1993]] WDC - Retired). As world champion, Hill was in high demand, and had offers to drive from [[McLaren (racing)|McLaren]], [[Benetton Formula|Benetton]] and [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]]. However, in Hill's opinion neither fully financially valued his World Champion status.&lt;ref name=motorsport07 /&gt; Instead, he signed for [[Arrows]], a team which had never won a race in its 20-year history and had scored only a single point the previous year. His title defence in [[1997 Formula One season|1997]] proved unsuccessful, getting off to a poor start when he only narrowly qualified for the [[1997 Australian Grand Prix|Australian Grand Prix]], and then retired on the parade lap. The Arrows car, using tyres from series debutant [[Bridgestone]] and engines from previously unsuccessful Yamaha, was generally uncompetitive, and Hill did not score his first point for the team until the [[1997 British Grand Prix|British Grand Prix]] at [[Silverstone Circuit|Silverstone]] in July. The highlight of the year came at the [[1997 Hungarian Grand Prix|Hungarian Grand Prix]]. On a day when the Bridgestone tyres had a competitive edge over their [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company|Goodyear]] rivals, Hill qualified third in a car which had not previously placed higher than 9th on the grid. During the race he passed championship contender Michael Schumacher on the track and was leading late in the race, well ahead of the eventual 1997 World Champion Villeneuve, when a hydraulic problem drastically slowed the Arrows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Race Summaries: 1997 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/formula_1/62492.stm#hungary |work=BBC News  |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=1998-03-05 |accessdate=2006-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Villeneuve passed Hill, who finished second and achieved the team's first podium since the 1995 Australian Grand Prix.

====1998–1999: Jordan====
Hill left Arrows after one season and after coming close to signing for the Prost team run by his former team-mate, decided instead to sign for the [[Jordan Grand Prix|Jordan team]] for the [[1998 Formula One season|1998 season]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Nicholson 1999 115–1167&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Nicholson | first = Jon |coauthors=Hamilton, Maurice| title = Against the Odds | publisher=Macmillan U.K | year = 1999 | isbn = 0-333-73655-9|pages=115–1167}}&lt;/ref&gt; His driving partner there was [[Ralf Schumacher]], the younger brother of Michael. In the first half of the season the car was off the pace and unreliable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Nicholson | first = Jon |coauthors=Hamilton, Maurice| title = Against the Odds | publisher=Macmillan U.K | year = 1999 | isbn = 0-333-73655-9|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[1998 Canadian Grand Prix|Canadian Grand Prix]] however, things began to improve. Hill moved up to second place as others retired or pitted for fuel. On lap 38, Schumacher, delayed by a stop-and-go penalty for forcing Frentzen's Williams off the track, caught Hill on the home straight; Hill moved across the track three times to block Schumacher, who missed his braking point and ran over the kerbs at the chicane to take the place. Hill was running fourth after his only pit stop when he retired with an electrical failure. After the race Schumacher accused Hill of dangerous driving. Hill responded that Schumacher &quot;cannot claim anyone drives badly when you look at the things he's been up to in his career. He took Frentzen out completely.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Nicholson 1999 115–1167&quot; /&gt; At the [[1998 German Grand Prix|German Grand Prix]] Hill scored his first point of the year, and at the [[1998 Belgian Grand Prix|Belgian Grand Prix]] in very wet conditions he took Jordan's first win. Hill was leading late in the race, with teammate Schumacher closing rapidly, when he suggested that team principal Eddie Jordan tell Schumacher to hold position, instead of risking losing a 1–2 finish. Jordan followed the suggestion, ordering Schumacher not to overtake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Meld je aan of registreer je om een reactie te plaatsen! |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0pfw5MWbSw |title=Formula 1 Belgium 1998-Jordan team orders |publisher=YouTube |date=2010-08-09 |accessdate=2011-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only eight drivers finished the race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grandprix.com/gpe/rr627.html|title=Grand Prix results: Belgian GP, 1998|work=GrandPrix.com|publisher=Inside F1, Inc.|accessdate=2008-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The victory was his first since being dropped by the Williams team, which won no races that season. Hill finished the year with a last lap move on Frentzen at the [[1998 Japanese Grand Prix|Japanese Grand Prix]] which earned him fourth place in the race, and Jordan fourth in the constructors' championship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grandprix.com/gpe/rr630.html|title=Grand Prix results: Japanese GP, 1998|work=Grandprix.com|publisher=Inside F1, Inc|accessdate=2008-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Damon Hill 1999 Britain.jpg|thumb|right|Hill driving for Jordan at the [[1999 British Grand Prix]].]]

Hopes were high for [[1999 Formula One season|1999]], but Hill did not enjoy a good season. Struggling with the new four-grooved tyres introduced that year, he was outpaced by his new team-mate—Heinz-Harald Frentzen, his replacement at Williams two years previously—and appeared to lose motivation.&lt;ref name=&quot;heroes139&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Walker|first=Murray|title=My Autobiography: Unless I'm Very Much Mistaken|publisher=HarperCollins Publishers London|year=2002|page=303|isbn=0-00-712696-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a crash at the [[1999 Canadian Grand Prix|Canadian Grand Prix]] he announced plans to retire from the sport at the end of the year, but after failing to finish the [[1999 French Grand Prix|French Grand Prix]], which Frentzen won, he considered quitting immediately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autosport-atlas.com/article.asp?id=5390 |title=Final fling for Damon at Silverstone |work=Autosport.com |date=1999-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jordan persuaded Hill to stay on for the [[1999 British Grand Prix|British Grand Prix]]. Going into the weekend, Hill announced he would retire after the race, so Jordan had [[Jos Verstappen]] test their car ready to replace Hill should the need arise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Verstappen tries Hill's car for size |first=Alan |last=Henry |work=The Guardian |page=28 |date=1999-06-30 |publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following a strong fifth place at his home event, Hill changed his mind, and decided to see out the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grandprix.com/ns/ns02082.html|title=Hill to go on racing|date=1999-07-19|work=GrandPrix.com|publisher=Inside F1, Inc.|accessdate=2008-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; His best result for the remainder of the season was sixth place, which he achieved in both Hungary and Belgium. With three races of 1999 to go, there were rumours that the [[Prost Grand Prix|Prost]] team would release [[Jarno Trulli]], who had signed for Jordan for [[2000 Formula One season|2000]], early to replace Hill, but the Briton completed the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grandprix.com/ns/ns02056.html|title=Verstappen to replace Hill?|date=1999-06-28|work=GrandPrix.com|publisher=Inside F1, Inc.|accessdate=2008-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, his team-mate Frentzen was a title contender going into the final few races, and eventually finished third in the championship. Hill and Frentzen helped Jordan to its best-ever finish of third in the constructors' championship. At the [[1999 Japanese Grand Prix|Japanese Grand Prix]], Hill's last race in Formula One ended when he spun off the track and pulled into the pits to retire a healthy car.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=No final glory as Hill grinds to a halt |work=Daily Mail |first=Ray |last=Matts |quote=Hill:I retired from the race as I decided that I was so far down the field, there was little point in me carrying on. |date=1999-11-01 |publisher=Associated Newspapers Ltd.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==After racing==
In retirement Hill has continued to be involved with cars and motorsport. He founded the Prestige and Super Car Private Members Club P1 International with Michael Breen in 2000;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Damon Hill: Formula for success |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/damon-hill-formula-for-success-516275.html |work=The Independent |publisher=Independent News and Media Limited |date=2005-11-21 |accessdate=2008-10-08 |first=Ian |last=Burrell}}&lt;/ref&gt; Breen bought Hill out in October 2006. Hill also became involved in a [[BMW]] dealership, just outside Royal Leamington Spa, that bore his name and an Audi dealership in Exeter. In April 2006, Hill succeeded [[Jackie Stewart]] as President of the [[British Racing Drivers' Club]] (BRDC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Stewart set to hand over to Hill |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/formula_one/4872104.stm |work=BBC News  |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=2006-04-03 |accessdate=2006-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2009 he received an [[Honorary title (academic)|Honorary Fellowship]] from the [[University of Northampton]] recognising his successful career and his connection with Northampton through Silverstone and the BRDC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.northampton.ac.uk/news/release/?id=UON9397|title=Damon Hill and Rupert Goold receive Honorary awards|date=10 February 2009|publisher=The University of Northampton|accessdate=2009-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hill has also regularly appeared in the British media. He has contributed many articles to [[F1 Racing]] magazine and has twice appeared in [[ITV F1]]'s commentary box, covering for Martin Brundle at the [[2007 Hungarian Grand Prix|2007]] and [[2008 Hungarian Grand Prix|2008 Hungarian Grands Prix]]. Hill also made a UK television advert with F1 commentator Murray Walker for [[Pizza Hut]], in which Walker commentated on Hill's meal as if it were a race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people=Aspel, Michael (presenter) |date=1997 |title=This Is Your Life – Murray Walker |medium=Television Production |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |location=London, UK |accessdate=2008-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hill has also appeared on many British television programmes, including ''[[Top Gear (current format)|Top Gear]]'', ''[[This Is Your Life (UK TV series)|This is Your Life]]'', ''[[TFI Friday]]'', ''[[Shooting Stars]]'' and ''[[Bang Bang, It's Reeves and Mortimer]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Damon Hill - Credits'' [http://www.tv.com/damon-hill/person/72476/appearances.html TV.com]. Retrieved 6 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Hill has raced both cars and motorcycles at the [[Goodwood Festival of Speed]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://specials.ft.com/goodwood2001/FT3A05Z1LPC.html |work=Financial Times  |publisher=The Financial Times Ltd |title=The Goodwood Revival Meeting |last=Court |first=Ian |date=2001-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2005 he tested the new [[GP2 Series]] car. Hill was back behind the wheel of a single-seater race car in the summer of 2006, when he took a {{convert|600|bhp|abbr=on}} [[Grand Prix Masters]] machine for a test run around the Silverstone circuit. Hill said that he enjoyed the experience and  &quot;I wouldn’t rule [a return to racing] out, but I can’t honestly say that right now I need to race. That is the bit that is missing. I love driving, I love pushing the limit and all the rest of it but racing for me…I don’t have an ambition to do it and I think that’s an important part of the equation.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itv-f1.com/Feature.aspx?Type=General&amp;id=37021&amp;PO=37021|title=Damon Hill exclusive|last=Galloway|first=James|date=2006-08-11|publisher=ITV|accessdate=2008-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2012, [[British Sky Broadcasting]] announced that they had signed Hill to join [[Martin Brundle]] as a commentator for the 2012 Formula One season. {{cite web|url=http://www1.skysports.com/news/19494/7438312/|title=Damon Hill joins Sky Team}}

===Music career===
Hill was interested in music from an early age and formed the [[punk rock|punk]] band &quot;Sex, Hitler and the Hormones&quot; with some friends while at school. After achieving success in Formula One, he was able to play guitar with several famous musicians, including his friend [[George Harrison]], and appeared on &quot;Demolition Man&quot;, the opening track of [[Def Leppard]]'s album ''[[Euphoria (Def Leppard album)|Euphoria]]''. Hill also made a regular appearance at the British Grand Prix alongside other Formula One musicians such as Eddie Jordan. After his retirement at the end of the 1999 season, Hill devoted more time to music and played with celebrity bands including [[Spike Edney]]'s SAS band,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sasband.com/pages/pagedisplay.php?part=2&amp;page=4|work=sasband.com|title=Artists|accessdate=2008-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Pat Cash]]'s Wild Colonial Boys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Notes of surprise |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2006/jan/14/popandrock |work=The Guardian |location=UK |publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited |first=John |last=Robinson |date=2006-01-14 |page=8 |accessdate=2008-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hill also formed his own band, The Conrods, which was active between 1999 and 2003 and played cover versions of well known songs from [[The Rolling Stones]], [[The Beatles]] and [[The Kinks]]. Since becoming president of the BRDC in 2006, Hill says he has abandoned the guitar, being &quot;too busy doing school runs and looking after pets.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/columnists/pandora/1066-all-over-again-as-snow-fights-to-save-battlefield-409063.html |title=Damon's guitar is put out to rust |first=Henry |last=Deedes  |work=The Independent |location=UK |publisher=Independent News and Media Limited |date=2006-07-24 |page=14 |accessdate=2008-10-24}} {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;
