'''Waisale Tikoisolomoni Serevi''' (born 20 May 1968 in [[Suva]], [[Fiji]]) is a former [[Fiji national rugby union team|Fijian rugby union]] footballer, and coach. Although he played fifteen-a-side rugby throughout his playing career, Serevi is most notable for his achievements in [[rugby sevens]]. He is widely considered one of the greatest rugby players ever, especially in the game of sevens. 

In the 15-man game, he played for [[Fiji national rugby union team|Fiji]] 39 times between 1989 and 2003, and scored 376 points. This included representing Fiji in the [[1991 Rugby World Cup|1991]], [[1999 Rugby World Cup|1999]], and [[2003 Rugby World Cup]]s. He has also played professionally for the [[Mitsubishi Juko Sagamihara|Mitsubishi]], [[Leicester Tigers|Leicester]], [[Stade Montois]], [[Stade Bordelais]] and Staines rugby teams.

His representative sevens career started in 1989 when he played for [[Fiji national rugby union team (sevens)|Fiji]] at the [[Hong Kong Sevens|Hong Kong]] tournament. With the exception of 2001, 2003 and 2004 he has played at Hong Kong every year since. Serevi has also played in the [[1993 Rugby World Cup Sevens|1993]], [[1997 Rugby World Cup Sevens|1997]], [[2001 Rugby World Cup Sevens|2001]], and [[2005 Rugby World Cup Sevens|2005]] [[Rugby World Cup Sevens]], winning the World Cup with Fiji in 1997 and 2005. He won silver at the [[Commonwealth Games]] in [[1998 Commonwealth Games|1998]] and [[2002 Commonwealth Games|2002]], and captured bronze in [[Rugby Sevens at the 2006 Commonwealth Games|2006]]. Serevi has played in the [[International Rugby Board]] [[IRB Sevens World Series|Sevens Series]] since its creation in 1999. In 2005 after winning the [[2005 Rugby World Cup Sevens]] Serevi was appointed the Fiji Sevens team's coach. He coached Fiji to the [[2005-06 World Sevens Series|2005/2006 IRB Sevens Series]] victory – the first time the series was not won by [[New Zealand national rugby union team (sevens)|New Zealand]].

== Early life ==
The third of five children, Serevi was born in Suva, on the island of [[Viti Levu]] on 20 May 1968.&lt;ref name=&quot;FijiTimes05&quot;&gt;{{Cite news| title=One tough road to the top |work=Fiji Times |date=31 December 2005 |page=1 |last=Qalo |first=Serafina}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Teivovo&quot;&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.teivovo.com/team_fiji/profiles/s/waisale_serevi.html |title=Waisale Serevi |publisher=teivovo.com |accessdate=14 March 2007|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070427162620/http://www.teivovo.com/team_fiji/profiles/s/waisale_serevi.html |archivedate = 27 April 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was raised by staunch Christian parents who were both heavily involved in the Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;FijiTimes05&quot;/&gt; Serevi's inspiration to play rugby stemmed from his childhood, when Fiji defeated the [[British and Irish Lions|British Lions]] in 1977. He missed watching the match, and decided to take up rugby after seeing how happy the victory made the people of Fiji.&lt;ref name=&quot;1977Lions&quot;&gt;{{Cite news| title=Lions spurred Serevi to play |work=Fiji Times |date=24 March 2005 |page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His family moved twice when he was a child; the second time settling in [[Suva]] where Serevi started secondary school.&lt;ref name=&quot;GodsGifts&quot;&gt;{{Cite news| title=God gave me the gifts, says Fiji sevens 'genius' |publisher=Waikato Times |page=10 |date=20 March 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; There he attended Lelean Memorial School.&lt;ref name=&quot;Teivovo&quot;/&gt; His schooling was unsuccessful however, and he failed his Fiji Junior Certificate Examination (tenth year) in 1984. Serevi's blamed his love for rugby, saying he &quot;played too much and didn't spend enough time studying.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;FijiTimes05&quot;/&gt;

After failing his examinations Serevi quit school and continued to play for his local club Rewa.&lt;ref name=&quot;GodsGifts&quot;/&gt; Although he trained with the team, he was omitted from playing as the coach, Jo Rauto, thought he was too small and would get hurt. He was eventually selected to play for the senior provincial side when he was 17.&lt;ref name=&quot;GodsGifts&quot;/&gt; Several months later he was asked to join the Nabua Rugby Club (under the guidance of coach Ratu Kitione Tuibua) by his uncle Vesito Rauluni.&lt;ref name=&quot;FijiTimes05&quot;/&gt; Serevi's Nabua team were highly successful in Fiji's sevens tournaments.&lt;ref name=&quot;GodsGifts&quot;/&gt;

== Fifteen-man (XVs) career ==
=== Club ===
Prior to 1993 he played for the Nasinu Rugby Club in the Suva Club Rugby Competition, and represented Suva on numerous occasions. In 1993 Serevi signed for the [[Mitsubishi Juko Sagamihara|Mitsubishi]] team from [[Kyoto]], Japan.&lt;ref name=&quot;CashStrapped&quot;&gt;{{Cite news| title=RUGBY WORLD CUP – The Cash-Strapped Nursery |work=Financial Times |date=6 October 1999 |page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Serevi initially played for Mitsubishi for A$70,000 a year before this increased to A$90,000 a year.&lt;ref name=&quot;GodMammon&quot;&gt;{{Cite news| title=God and Mammon Unit to Keep the Faith |work=Sydney Morning Herald |last=Masters |first=Roy |date=2 February 1994 |page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; While with Mitsubishi in 1994, Serevi was approached by [[Australian Rugby League]] clubs the [[Canberra Raiders]], and later the [[South Queensland Crushers|Brisbane Crushers]] to play for them.&lt;ref name=&quot;FijianLegend&quot;&gt;{{Cite news| title=Fijian Legend Set to be the Star |work=Sydney Morning Herald |date=9 November 1993 |last=Masters |first=Roy |page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; After being set to join the Crushers, Serevi decided to stay with Mitsubishi due to a pay rise, and pressure from Fiji's [[Methodist Church]] to stay with Rugby union.&lt;ref name=&quot;GodMammon&quot;/&gt;

Serevi continued to play for Mitsubishi until 1997 when he joined English club [[Leicester Tigers|Leicester]] on a two year contract.&lt;ref name=&quot;SlickSerevi&quot;&gt;{{Cite news| title=Slick Serevi Refuses to be Typecast |work=The Independent |location=London |last=Hewett |first=Chris |date=29 August 1997 |page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SevensSpecialist&quot;&gt;{{Cite news| title=Sevens Specialist Widens his Horizons |work=The Times |location=UK |last=Hands |first=David |date=30 August 1997 |page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was first approached by Leicester after he played against them for a World XV at [[Twickenham Stadium|Twickenham]] in 1996. He stayed at Leicester for only one season before moving to the French club [[Stade Montois]] in [[Mont-de-Marsan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;SlickSerevi&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Montois&quot;&gt;{{Cite news| title=Serevi prolongs stay in France |publisher=Agence France-Presse |date=2 June 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After joining Stade Montois, Serevi moved to the coaching staff due to the [[Pro D2|second level]] sides only being allowed to play two non-European Union players.&lt;ref name=&quot;BackMontois&quot;&gt;{{Cite news| title=Serevi back for Mont-De-Marsan |publisher=Agence France-Presse |date=10 October 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; After getting clearance from the [[French Rugby Federation]], Serevi was cleared to play for Stade Montois in 2001. He continued there until joining French Club [[Stade Bordelais]] in January 2004.&lt;ref name=&quot;StadeBordelais&quot;&gt;{{Cite news| title=Fiji legend Serevi joins Stade Bordelais. |publisher=Agence France-Presse |date=26 December 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2004 Serevi joined London club [[Staines]]; making his debut in a victory against Thurrock in December that year.&lt;ref name=&quot;SereviMeeting&quot;&gt;{{Cite news| title=Serevi Meeting |publisher=The Citizen |page=48 |date=14 December 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AboutRugby&quot;&gt;{{Cite news| title=About Rugby |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK |last=Gallagher |first=Brendan |date=23 December 2004 |page=06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Serevi stopped playing club rugby professionally in 2005.

=== International ===
In 1987 Serevi was selected for the Fiji B team. The following year he was selected for Fiji for the first time, playing against [[Wellington Rugby Football Union|Wellington]] in New Zealand.&lt;ref name=&quot;Teivovo&quot;/&gt; The Wellington game was his first in front of a large crowd. He had mixed feelings about playing an international for the first time in front of a huge crowd.&lt;ref name=&quot;FijiTimes05&quot;/&gt; The next year he made his international debut against [[Belgium national rugby union team|Belgium]] in Liege.&lt;ref name=&quot;Teivovo&quot;/&gt;

After being a regular selection for the team in 1989, and three times in 1990, Serevi was selected in the [[1991 Rugby World Cup]] squad.&lt;ref name=&quot;Teivovo&quot;/&gt; He played against [[France national rugby union team|France]] and [[Canada national rugby union team|Canada]], losing both games. Serevi only played four fifteen-aside games for Fiji in 1992 and 1993 (Fiji losing all four).&lt;ref name=&quot;Teivovo&quot;/&gt; This led to Fiji failing to qualify for the [[1995 Rugby World Cup]] in South Africa. In 1996 Serevi was selected for his first Fiji game since 1993. The game was against [[Northland Rugby Union|Northland]] in [[Whangarei]] and resulted in a 49-18 win; Serevi's first win with the national team since 1991.&lt;ref name=&quot;Teivovo&quot;/&gt; Serevi was selected for seven games in 1996, including matches against [[South Africa national rugby union team|South Africa]] and the [[New Zealand Māori rugby union team|New Zealand Māori]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Teivovo&quot;/&gt;

Serevi did not play for Fiji in the 1997 season, but did come on against [[Scotland national rugby union team|Scotland]] in Fiji's 51-26 win at Suva in 1998. He was continually selected throughout 1998, and played Tests against France, [[United States national rugby union team|USA]], [[Australia national rugby union team|Australia]], [[Tonga national rugby union team|Tonga]] and [[Samoa national rugby union team|Samoa]]. The following year he again played for Fiji; including consecutive wins over [[Spain national rugby union team|Spain]], [[Uruguay national rugby union team|Uruguay]], and [[Italy national rugby union team|Italy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Teivovo&quot;/&gt; Fiji qualified for the [[1999 Rugby World Cup]] in France, with Serevi playing in three of Fiji's matches (including wins over [[Namibia national rugby union team|Namibia]] and Canada).&lt;ref name=&quot;Teivovo&quot;/&gt;

Following the 1999 Rugby World Cup, Serevi did not play for Fiji again until 2001. In that year he came on against an Italian regional XV after 57 minutes and scored two tries, two conversions and two penalties to help his team to a 33-23 victory.&lt;ref name=&quot;Italy2001&quot;&gt;{{Cite news| title=Rugby union-Fijians looking to Britain for injury-hit team |publisher=Reuters News |date=21 November 2001 |last=Couret |first=Jean-Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by a match against Italy where he scored all of Fiji's points (Fiji lost 10-66).&lt;ref name=&quot;Italy2001&quot;/&gt; He played two more matches for Fiji that season, including a win over the [[French Barbarians]], in which Serevi was captain.&lt;ref name=&quot;FrenchBarbarians2001&quot;&gt;{{Cite news| title=Fiji bounce back with win over French Barbarians |publisher=Reuters News |date=19 November 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002 Serevi played four matches for Fiji. All were losses; first against [[Wales national rugby union team|Wales]], then [[Ireland national rugby union team|Ireland]], Scotland A, and [[Scotland national rugby union team|Scotland]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Teivovo&quot;/&gt; Serevi's last season for Fiji was in 2003, where he played several matches in build-up to the Rugby World Cup in Australia. These matches included wins over the [[Queensland Reds]], [[Tasman Rugby Union|Marlborough]], and [[Chile national rugby union team|Chile]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Teivovo&quot;/&gt; His last match for Fiji was a 41-13 win over [[Japan national rugby union team|Japan]] in the [[2003 Rugby World Cup]]; his third Rugby World Cup tournament.&lt;ref name=&quot;Teivovo&quot;/&gt;

== Sevens career ==
=== 1989–1993 ===
After playing domestics sevens in Fiji, Serevi was selected for Fiji for the Sydney Sevens tournament in 1989. Later that year he made his début at the [[Hong Kong Sevens]].&lt;ref&gt;The Hong Kong Sevens is the most prestigious Sevens tournament in the world, and is worth more than points the other tournaments in the IRB Sevens Series.&lt;/ref&gt; Although [[New Zealand national rugby union team (sevens)|New Zealand]] won the tournament, beating Fiji in their semi-final, Serevi was named player of the tournament.&lt;ref name=&quot;HK1989&quot;&gt;{{Cite news| title=New Zealand have the best of both worlds |work=The Times |location=UK |date=3 April 1989 |last=Barnes |first=Simon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Serevi returned in 1990 when Fiji won their first of three consecutive Hong Kong Sevens titles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Teivovo&quot;/&gt; Serevi again picked up player of the tournament after Fiji defeated New Zealand in the final.&lt;ref name=&quot;HK1990&quot;&gt;{{Cite news| title=LIFE, OLD 'GIRL', IS A SHOCK, HORROR CABARET |work=Sydney Morning Herald |date=3 April 1990 |page=53 |last=Growden |first=Greg}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;HK1991&quot;&gt;{{Cite news| title=FIJI CLINCH RUGBY UNION SEVENS TITLE WITH INJURY-TIME TRY. |publisher=Reuters News |date=24 March 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992 Serevi was again named the player of the tournament.&lt;ref name=&quot;HK1992&quot;&gt;{{Cite news| title=FIJIANS WIN THIRD SUCCESSIVE HONG KONG SEVENS TITLE |publisher=Reuters News |date=5 April 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 1993 Hong Kong Sevens, Serevi scored three tries to help Fiji to a 17-14 win over [[Australia national rugby union team (sevens)|Australia]] in the semi-final, but was unable to prevent his team being defeated 14-12 in the final by [[Samoa national rugby union team (sevens)|Samoa]].&lt;ref name=&quot;HK1993&quot;&gt;{{Cite news| title=Western Samoa battle to first Hong Kong Sevens title. |publisher=Reuters News| date=28 March 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fiji's next major tournament was the inaugural 1993 [[Rugby World Cup Sevens|Rugby Sevens World Cup]] held in [[Edinburgh]], Scotland.{{#tag:ref|Rugby sevens was invented in Scotland, and first played in [[Melrose, Scotland|Melrose]] in 1883.|group=n}} Serevi said that the team was working &quot;sometimes nine hours a day&quot; in preparation for the Sevens World Cup.&lt;ref name=&quot;NineHours&quot;&gt;{{Cite news| title=Fiji aim to avenge Hong Kong defeat |publisher=Agence France-Presse |date=13 April 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fiji were defeated by eventual champions [[England national rugby union team (sevens)|England]] 21-7 in their semi-final.&lt;ref name=&quot;Semi1993&quot;&gt;{{Cite news| title=England snatch world sevens title. |publisher=Reuters News |date=18 April 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; Serevi was the equal top point scorer for the tournament.&lt;ref name=&quot;Points1993&quot;&gt;{{Cite news| title=Leading World Cup Sevens scorers |publisher=Agence France-Presse |date=18 April 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1994–1999 ===
After playing in sevens tournaments in Fiji and [[Canberra]], Serevi returned to the Hong Kong sevens. After defeating [[South Africa national rugby union team (sevens)|South Africa]] in their quarter final, Fiji lost to eventual winners New Zealand in their semi-final.&lt;ref name=&quot;HK1994&quot;&gt;{{Cite news| title=Second days results in Hong Kong sevens. |publisher=Reuters News|date=27 March 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, Serevi captained Fiji to the Hong Kong Sevens final. Serevi scored three tries in Fiji's semi-final victory over Australia. They then faced New Zealand in the final, and although leading 17-14 at one point, eventually lost the game 35-17.&lt;ref name=&quot;HK1995&quot;&gt;{{Cite news| title=NZ storm to fifth Hong Kong title. |publisher=Reuters News |date=26 March 1995 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1996 tournament, Fiji again met New Zealand in the final. New Zealand led after Serevi tripped [[Christian Cullen]] close to Fiji's try line. This was followed by a break from  Serevi to give [[Setareki Naivaluwaqa]] a try. New Zealand scored twice more however, to give them a 19-17 victory.&lt;ref name=&quot;HK1996&quot;&gt;{{Cite news| title=MASIREWA SEALS HONG KONG SEVENS WIN FOR NEW ZEALAND. |publisher=Reuters News |date=31 March 1996 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Serevi finished the year by leading Fiji to victory in the [[Dubai Sevens]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Dubai1996&quot;&gt;{{Cite news| title=MORGAN AND CO CALL FOR BETTER PREPARATION FOR THE WORLD CUP. |publisher=The Herald |date=25 November 1996 |page=9 |last=Douglas |first=Derek}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following year the Hong Kong sevens doubled as the Rugby Sevens World Cup. Serevi was Fiji's captain for the tournament.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nobok&quot;&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.nobok.co.uk/page/RugbyBio/0,,10301~791285,00.html |title=The sevens wonder of the world |publisher=nobok.co.uk |accessdate=21 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the tournament Serevi made a promise to Fiji to &quot;bring back the Melrose Cup.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;BringMelrose&quot;&gt;{{Cite news| title=SEREVI VOWS TO RECOVER WORLD CUP SEVENS CROWN. |publisher=Reuters News |date=22 March 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his first three games of the tournament Serevi scored 59 points to help confirm Fiji as favourites for the title.&lt;ref name=&quot;1997FirstDay&quot;&gt;{{Cite news| title=Fiji's Serevi sets Sevens on fire&amp;nbsp;... |publisher=Agence France-Presse |date=22 March 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fiji did not concede a point until their semi-final (their sixth game of the tournament), and eventually faced South Africa in the final.&lt;ref name=&quot;1997Defence&quot;&gt;{{Cite news| title=Defence, not Serevi, the secret to Fiji glory |publisher=Agence France-Presse |date=23 March 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; South Africa scored two tries, before Fiji responded with four tries of their own; the final score was 24-21 to Fiji.&lt;ref name=&quot;HK1997&quot;&gt;{{Cite news| title=Fiji win Sevens. |work=The Australian |page=27 |date=24 March 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Serevi was the tournaments top scorer, with 117 points (including nine tries).&lt;ref name=&quot;Nobok&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;HK1997&quot;/&gt; Serevi also played for Fiji in the Japan and France sevens; the latter won by Fiji.&lt;ref name=&quot;France97&quot;&gt;{{Cite news| title=SPIRITS BOOSTED. |publisher=Evening Standard |page=20 |date=3 June 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After winning the Fiji Sevens Tournament with Fiji in March 1998, Serevi led his country at Hong Kong.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fiji1998&quot;&gt;{{Cite news| title=Fiji, New Zealand lay rival claims to Hong Kong crown |publisher=Agence France-Presse |date=26 March 1998 |last=Foley |first=Chris}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite a 21-21 draw against [[Argentina national rugby union team (sevens)|Argentina]] in pool play - where Serevi scored one try and set up two - Fiji qualified for the tournament's quarter-finals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Arg1998&quot;&gt;{{Cite news| title=Argentina give Fiji a fright. |publisher=Reuters News |date=28 March 1998 |last=Crean |first=John}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fiji beat Australia in the quarter-finals, and faced New Zealand in their semi-final.

Serevi was omitted from the team due to form, and the desire to develop new players for the 2004 Rugby World Cup Sevens. Fiji's coach at the time, [[Tomasi Cama]], suggested Serevi had lost some pace and age was catching up with him&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;2001HK&quot;&gt;{{Cite news| title=Fiji confident despite absence of Serevi |publisher=Associated Press |date=29 March 2001 |first=Helen |last=Luk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Serevi's last sevens tournament for the year was the World Games in [[Akita, Akita|Akita]], Japan.

For the entire 2005/2006 IRB Sevens Series Serevi was Fiji's player-coach (his assistant coach was Jo Savou). Fiji won the George leg in South Africa, the Wellington leg in New Zealand, the Singapore leg, and the London leg in England.&lt;ref name=&quot;IRBSeries0506&quot;&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.teivovo.com/intl_sevens/news/2006/2005-06_scoreboard.html |title=2005–06 IRB WORLD 7s Series Scoreboard |publisher=teivovo.com |accessdate=8 April 2007|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070929095803/http://www.teivovo.com/intl_sevens/news/2006/2005-06_scoreboard.html |archivedate = 29 September 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team also made the final of the Dubai, Los Angeles, and Hong Kong legs of the series.&lt;ref name=&quot;IRBSeries0506&quot;/&gt; Fiji won the Series - becoming the first team other than New Zealand to win the IRB Series.&lt;ref name=&quot;London06&quot;&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.teivovo.com/intl_sevens/london/2006/0603_london_results.html |title=IRB 7s – LONDON 2006 |publisher=teivovo.com |accessdate=8 April 2007|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070929090516/http://www.teivovo.com/intl_sevens/london/2006/0603_london_results.html |archivedate = 29 September 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the series win Prime Minister Qarase said of Serevi:

As well as coaching Fiji to the IRB Series win in 2006, Serevi also coached them to bronze at the [[2006 Commonwealth Games]] in Melbourne.&lt;ref name=&quot;Melbourne06&quot;&gt;{{Cite news| title=Elusive gold |work=Fiji Times |date=18 March 2006 |page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fiji faced England in their semi-final, but Serevi was unable to take the field due to &quot;a technical hitch with the fourth official.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sorry06&quot;&gt;{{Cite news| title=Serevi says sorry, names team to HK |work=Fiji Times |date=23 March 2006 |page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; After losing to England, Fiji recovered to defeat Australia 24-17 in the play-off for bronze.&lt;ref name=&quot;Melbourne06&quot;/&gt;

In December 2006 Serevi was offered a coaching position with the [[Falcons (rugby team)|Falcons]], a South African club. The offer was several times more than he received from the Fiji Rugby Union. The contract required him to be a backline coach and player for two years and then a coach for the next three years.&lt;ref name=&quot;SAjob&quot;&gt;{{Cite news| title=Stars unhappy |work=Fiji Times |date=1 January 2007 |last=Singh |first=Zanzeer |page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the end he decided to stay with Fiji Rugby and renewed his contract with the Fiji Rugby Union. In early 2007 the interim Sports Minister [[Lekh Ram Vayeshnoi]] appointed Serevi to the board of the interim [[Fiji Sports Council|Sports Council (Fiji)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.fijivillage.com/artman/publish/article_35432.shtml |title=Rajendra Chaudry accepts board appointment |publisher=fijivillage.com |accessdate=4 March 2007 |date=27 January 2007|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070509075729/http://www.fijivillage.com/artman/publish/article_35432.shtml |archivedate = 9 May 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Serevi coached Fiji to the final of the first Sevens Series leg of 2007 in [[2007 Wellington Sevens|Wellington]], where they lost to Samoa 17-14 in the final.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wellington2007&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.teivovo.com/intl_sevens/wellington/2007/0203_welly7s_day2.html |title=Samoa surprise Fiji in Wellington final |publisher=teivovo.com |accessdate=31 May 2007|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070510083914/http://www.teivovo.com/intl_sevens/wellington/2007/0203_welly7s_day2.html |archivedate = 10 May 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team then rebounded when they defeated Samoa to win the [[2007 USA Sevens|San Diego]] leg.

Serevi then coached Fiji to the final of the [[2007 London Sevens|London]] leg, where they were defeated by New Zealand. The final leg of the 2006/2007 Series was in [[2007 Edinburgh Sevens|Edinburgh]]. Fiji needed to qualify for the semi-finals to guarantee they would win the series. They qualified top of pool A and faced Wales in their quarter-final. Wales defeated Fiji in 21-14 in a major unpset. &amp;nbsp; &quot;Wales kept the ball well against us, and they scored tries. &amp;nbsp;They deserved to win,&quot; Serevi said of the loss.&lt;ref name=&quot;WalesLoss07&quot;&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.fijitimes.com.fj/story.aspx?id=63921 |title=Sevens shock: Fiji loses series to NZ |work=Fiji Times |accessdate=4 June 2007 |date=4 June 2007|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070928024636/http://www.fijitimes.com.fj/story.aspx?id=63921 |archivedate = 28 September 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; New Zealand then won the tournament, making them the series champions with 130 points to Fiji's 128.&lt;ref name=&quot;WalesLoss07&quot;/&gt;

=== 2007–2009: Coach ===
After several months of playing local games, the Chinese Taipei Rugby Union signed Serevi as a coach of their national Sevens squad. He reported for duties in March 2008. His first assignment for the team was the 2008 IRB Hong Kong Sevens. Serevi also took time to participate in the Yokohama Country and Athletic Club in Japan, on 5–6 April 2008, where his Yokohama squad won in the finals, 57-14.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fijivillage.com/?mod=story&amp;id=07040810ab5deb59d10b251cc27868 |title=FijiVillage.com - Fiji's home on the world wide web |publisher=Fijivillage.com |date= |accessdate=12 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 July 2008, the Fiji Rugby Union announced the return of Serevi as Fiji's coach for the 2008–2009 IRB World Sevens Series and the Rugby Sevens World Cup in Dubai.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Serevi is back as 7s coach: FRU|date=24 July 2008|url=http://www.fijilive.com/sports/rugby/news/2008/07/24/4178.Fijilive Serevi is back as 7s coach: FRU|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the announcement, Serevi was in England receiving an honorary sports degree from [[Leeds Metropolitan University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|work=The Fiji Times|title=Dr Serevi|date=24 July 2008|url=http://www.fijitimes.com/story.aspx?ref=archive&amp;id=95959 Dr Serevi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fiji Rugby Union chairman Keni Dakuidreketi denied that Serevi's selection was a result of the public clamor after the team's performance in the 2007–2008 World Sevens Series under coach Jo Savou.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=FRU buckles under pressure|author=Rodney Duthie|date=26 July 2008|work=The Fiji Times |url=http://www.fijitimes.com/story.aspx?ref=archive&amp;id=96196 FRU buckles under pressure}}&lt;/ref&gt; While in the UK Serevi played a game of [[rugby league]] for UK Fiji in the [[Carnegie Floodlit 9s]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.floodlit9s.co.uk/news/|title=Latest News|publisher=Carnige Flood Lit 9's|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite his return, Serevi's team did not do well in the first two legs of the 2008–2009 World Sevens Series, losing in the semi-final both times to South Africa. Serevi also clashed with the Fiji Rugby Union over being left out of player selection duties. As a result, the FRU dismissed him on 29 January 2009. Iliesa Tanivula took over the post for the rest of the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Serevi sacked as Fiji Sevens turmoil continues|publisher=Yahoo!Xtra Sport|author=Neil Reid|date=29, 2009|accessdate=|url=http://nz.sports.yahoo.com/news/article/-/5288174/serevi-sacked-fiji-sevens-turmoil-continues}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2009, the [[Rugby union in Papua New Guinea|Papua New Guinea Rugby Football Union]] hired Serevi to become their sevens development officer on a five-year contract. He was later tapped as the national sevens coach.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Serevi lands Papua New Guinea role|date=18 August 2009|accessdate=|publisher=Ultimate Rugby Sevens|url=http://ur7s.com/news/422/serevi_lands_papua_new_guinea_role}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on 27 March 2010, the union confirmed that the working relationship with Serevi was finished. Union president Richard Sapias said off-field decisions prompted the severing of relations,especially after PNG suffered humiliating losses at the Adelaide sevens. Serevi was also frequently seen with the Fijian team instead of the PNG squad.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Serevi axed|work=The Fiji Times |date=31 March 2010|url=http://www.fijitimes.com/story.aspx?id=143419}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thenational.com.pg/?q=node/7571|title=Sapias speaks out on Serevi saga|author=Keith Puaria|publisher=The National|location=Papua New Guinea}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2010 – present===
Seeking a fresh start a few months after his departure from the PNG team, Serevi moved his family to the United States and settled in Seattle, Washington, to run a business with Fijian expatriates. He used his experience in rugby to open a new brand, the Serevi Rugby Nation, to help pool funds for Pacific Islander players and also run rugby training workshops for the youth. He also worked with the Old Puget Sound Rugby club, and helped Central Washington University qualify for the Collegiate Rugby Championships.&lt;ref&gt;http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/othersports/2014801660_rugby18.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Serevi said many times during his stay in the US that he wants to move one with his life. {{citation needed|date=October 2011}} However, on October 6, 2011, Serevi flew home to Fiji and declared his availability to coach the team in qualifying for the [[2013 Rugby World Cup Sevens|2013 Sevens World Cup]] and help the team qualify for the [[2016 Olympic Games]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fijitimes.com/story.aspx?ref=archive&amp;id=182573&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
Serevi has a wife, Karalaini, whom he married in 1993. They have three children: daughters Una (born 1994) and Asinate (born 1995), and son Waisale Junior (born 2001).&lt;ref name=&quot;SlickSerevi&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SereviJunior&quot;&gt;{{Cite news| title=Serevi ponders son's future |publisher=Sunday Mail |date=25 July 2004 |last=Dhaliwal |first=S. S. |page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; His wife works for the Fijian Defence Force, and Serevi spent large parts of his career away from his family. He was apart from them when in Japan between 1992 and 1997, although his family joined him in France between 1999 and 2004.&lt;ref name=&quot;FijiTimes05&quot;/&gt; He is a committed Christian, and along with his family attends Church regularly.&lt;ref name=&quot;FamilyBackbone&quot;&gt;{{Cite news| title=Wife and family support the backbone of my success |work=Fiji Times |date=12 March 2005 |last=Serevi |first=Waisale |page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; On his boots, strapping, and jersey for every match Serevi has the words &quot;Philippians 4:13&quot; written. It is a reference to the biblical quote &quot;I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;AnotherTrophy&quot;&gt;{{Cite news| title=Another trophy for the 7s maestro  |work=Fiji Times |date=29 May 2005 |last=Rabuku |first=Otilly |page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Serevi learned Japanese while in Japan, and also taught English whilst there.&lt;ref name=&quot;SevensSpecialist&quot;/&gt; Despite living in France for several years he did not learn French, and required an interpreter for interviews.&lt;ref name=&quot;NoFrench&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.umc-europe.org/messager/0301/0301waisale.html|title=Interview - Waisale Serevi |publisher=umc-europe.org|language=French |accessdate=16 April 2007 |last=lame |first=René |year=2001|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070927230006/http://www.umc-europe.org/messager/0301/0301waisale.html |archivedate = 27 September 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Serevi's interests include listening to music, and watching movies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Teivovo&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mel06Profile&quot;&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://melbourne2006.com.au/Participants/Participants?ID=109661 Commonwealth Games Bio |title=SEREVI Waisale |publisher=melbourne2006.com.au |accessdate=5 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from rugby, he also likes to play touch rugby and volleyball.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mel06Profile&quot;/&gt; Other interests include meeting people, and traveling the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mel06Profile&quot;/&gt;

On 18 May 2007, Serevi was appointed a Special Inspector with the Fiji Police Force by the acting Commissioner of Police Romanu Tikotikoca.&lt;ref name=&quot;SpecialInspector&quot;&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.fijitimes.com.fj/story.aspx?id=62869 |title=Waisale Serevi appointed police inspector |work=Fiji Times |date=18 May 2007 |accessdate=4 June 2007|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070928024642/http://www.fijitimes.com.fj/story.aspx?id=62869 |archivedate = 28 September 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The appointment is in youth and community policing. &amp;nbsp;Serevi will not be a regular officer, but will be paid for the hours he works.&lt;ref name=&quot;PoliceJob&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.fijitimes.com/story.aspx?id=62977 |title=Officers welcome Serevi: Chief |work=Fiji Times |date=20 May 2007 |accessdate=4 June 2007|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070930165216/http://www.fijitimes.com/story.aspx?id=62977 |archivedate = 30 September 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;
