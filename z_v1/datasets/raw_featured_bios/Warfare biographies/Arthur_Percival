[[Lieutenant-General (UK)|Lieutenant-General]] '''Arthur Ernest Percival''', [[Order of the Bath|CB]], [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]] &amp; [[Medal bar|Bar]], [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]], [[Military Cross|MC]], [[Venerable Order of Saint John|OStJ]], [[Deputy Lieutenant|DL]] (26 December 1887 – 31 January 1966) was a [[British Army]] officer and World War I veteran. He built a successful military career during the [[interwar period]] but is most noted for his involvement in World War II, when he commanded the forces of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]] during the [[Battle of Malaya]] and the subsequent [[Battle of Singapore]].

Percival's surrender to the invading [[Imperial Japanese Army]] force is the largest capitulation in [[British military history]], and it permanently undermined Britain's prestige as an imperial power in the [[Far East]].&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, ''English History 1914–1945'', p657&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Morris&quot;&gt;Morris, ''Farewell the Trumpets'', p452&lt;/ref&gt; However, current knowledge about the years of under-funding of [[British Malaya|Malaya]]'s defences and the inexperienced, under-equipped nature of the Commonwealth army has enabled certain commentators to hold a more sympathetic view of his command.&lt;ref&gt;Smyth, ''Percival and the Tragedy of Singapore''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
===Childhood and employment===
Arthur Ernest Percival was born on 26 December 1887 in Aspenden Lodge, [[Aspenden]] near [[Buntingford]] in [[Hertfordshire]], England, the second son of Alfred Reginald and Edith Percival (née Miller). His father was the Land Agent of the Hamel's Park estate and his mother came from a [[Lancashire]] [[cotton]] family.

Percival was initially schooled locally in [[Bengeo]]. Then in 1901, he was sent to [[Rugby School|Rugby]] with his more academically successful brother, where he was a boarder in School House. A moderate pupil, he studied [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] and [[Latin]] but was described by a teacher as &quot;not a good classic&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Kinvig, ''Scapegoat: General Percival of Singapore'', p5&lt;/ref&gt; Percival's only qualification on leaving in 1906 was a higher school certificate. He was a more successful sportsman, playing [[cricket]] and [[tennis]] and running [[cross-country running|cross country]].&lt;ref&gt;Smith, ''Singapore Burning: Heroism and Surrender in World War II'', p23&lt;/ref&gt; He also rose to [[Colour Sergeant|colour sergeant]] in the school's Volunteer Rifle Corps. However, his military career began at a comparatively late age: although a member of Youngsbury Rifle Club, he was still working as a clerk for the iron-ore merchants Naylor, Benzon &amp; Company Limited in London, which he had joined in 1907, when the [[World War I|Great War]] broke out. But for this conflict, it seems certain that he would have remained a civilian.

===Enlistment and World War I===
Percival enlisted on the first day of the war as a [[Private (rank)|private]] in the [[Officer Training Corps]] of the [[Inns of Court]], at the age of 26, and was promoted after five weeks' basic training to temporary [[second lieutenant]].&lt;ref name=commision&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=29058|supp=yes|startpage=1176|endpage=1179|date=2 February 1915|accessdate=18 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly one third of his fellow recruits would be dead by the end of the war. By November Percival had been promoted to [[captain (OF-2)|captain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=29050|startpage=802|date=26 January 1915|accessdate=18 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The following year he was dispatched to [[France]] with the newly formed 7th (Service) Battalion of the [[Bedfordshire Regiment]],&lt;ref name=commision /&gt; which became part of the 54th Brigade, [[18th (Eastern) Division]] in February 1915. The first day of the [[Battle of the Somme (1916)|Battle of the Somme]] (1 July 1916) left Percival unscathed, but in September he was badly wounded in four places by [[Shrapnel shell|shrapnel]], as he led his company in an assault on the [[Schwaben Redoubt]], beyond the ruins of [[Thiepval]] village, and was awarded the [[Military Cross]].&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=29824|supp=yes|startpage=11044|endpage=11063|date=14 November 1916|accessdate=18 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Wiltshire Regiment Thiepval 7 August 1916.jpg|thumb|Near [[Thiepval]], 7 August. Photo by [[Ernest Brooks (photographer)|Ernest Brooks]].]]
Percival took a regular commission as a captain with the [[Essex Regiment]] in October 1916,&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=29783|startpage=9864|date=13 October 1916|accessdate=18 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; whilst recovering from his injuries in hospital. He was appointed a temporary [[major (United Kingdom)|major]] in his original regiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=30038|supp=yes|startpage=4042|date=27 April 1917|accessdate=18 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1917, he became battalion commander with the temporary rank of [[Lieutenant-Colonel (United Kingdom)|lieutenant-colonel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=30632|supp=yes|startpage=4550|date=12 April 1918|accessdate=18 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=31003|supp=yes|startpage=13282|date=8 November 1918|accessdate=18 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=31035|supp=yes|startpage=14044|date=26 November 1918|accessdate=18 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=31220|supp=yes|startpage=3257|date=7 March 1919|accessdate=18 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=32233|supp=yes|startpage=1434|date=18 February 1921|accessdate=18 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; During [[German Empire|Germany]]'s [[Spring Offensive]], Percival led a counter-attack that saved a unit of French artillery from capture, winning a [[Croix de guerre 1914–1918 (France)|Croix de Guerre]].&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p24&lt;/ref&gt; For a short period in May 1918, he acted as commander of the 54th Brigade. He was given [[brevet (military)|brevet]] promotion to major,&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=31092|supp=yes|startpage=15|endpage=16|date=24 June 1921|accessdate=18 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and awarded the [[Distinguished Service Order]], with his citation noting his &quot;power of command and knowledge of tactics&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=32371|supp=yes|startpage=5096|date=24 June 1921|accessdate=18 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He ended the war as a respected soldier, described as &quot;very efficient&quot; and was recommended for the [[Staff College, Camberley|Staff College]].&lt;ref&gt;Keegan, ''Churchill's Generals'', p257&lt;/ref&gt;

==Between the wars==
===Russia===
Percival's studies were delayed in 1919 when he decided to volunteer for service with the [[Arkhangelsk|Archangel]] Command of the British Military Mission during the [[North Russia Campaign]] of the [[Russian Civil War]]. Acting as second-in-command of the 45th [[The Royal Fusiliers (City of London Regiment)|Royal Fusiliers]], he earned a bar to his DSO in August, when his attack in the Gorodok operation along the [[Northern Dvina|Dvina]] netted 400 [[Bolshevik]] prisoners. The citation reads:

&lt;blockquote&gt;He commanded the [[Gorodok]]{{dn|date=March 2012}} column on the 9th–10 August 1919, with great gallantry and skill, and owing to the success of this column the forces on the right bank of the Dvina were able to capture all its objectives. During the enemy counter-attack from [[Selmenga]] on Gorodok he handled his men excellently. The enemy were repulsed with great loss, leaving 400 prisoners in our hands.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=31745|supp=yes|startpage=923|date=20 January 1920|accessdate=18 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[File:Percival.jpg|upright|left|thumb|Major Percival in Ireland]]

===Ireland===
In 1920 Percival served in Ireland against the [[Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) during the [[Anglo-Irish War]], first as a company commander and later the [[intelligence officer]] of the 1st Battalion of the [[Essex Regiment]], in [[Kinsale]], [[County Cork]].

Percival proved himself an energetic [[Guerrilla warfare#Counter-guerrilla warfare|counter-guerrilla]]. Enemies in the [[Irish Republican Army]] and others accused him of brutality,&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, ''The Battle for Singapore'', p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; among them [[Tom Barry]], leader of the West Cork Flying Column, whose general veracity, however, has been challenged by several historians.&lt;ref name=Burns&gt;John Burns, 'Tom Barry &quot;lied about massacre&quot;', ''Sunday Times'' (19 April 1998).&lt;/ref&gt; Following the killing of a [[Royal Irish Constabulary]] sergeant outside Bandon church in July 1920, Percival captured [[Tom Hales (Irish republican)|Tom Hales]], commander of the IRA's West Cork Brigade, and Patrick Harte, the brigade's quartermaster, for which service he was appointed [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] (OBE). Hostile accusations that these and other prisoners were maltreated by him while in custody: his supposed technique was the use of burning cigarettes, like others made against Percival's unit by adversaries, have not been substantiated. &lt;ref name=Burns/&gt; There is no dispute, however, that Hales had his fingernails pulled out and his teeth crushed with pliers at some point during his time in British captivity; Harte never recovered from whatever interrogation techniques were used on him and he died a few years later in a mental hospital.

The IRA badly wanted to kill him, accusing him of running what they called the 'Essex Battalion Torture Squad'. A first attempted assassination by Barry in [[Bandon, County Cork|Bandon]] failed when Percival departed from his dinnertime routine.  A second assassination squad was dispatched to London in March 1921, but was forced to flee [[Liverpool Street Station]] when the [[Metropolitan Police|police]] learned of their plans.

Whilst in Ireland, [[Bernard Law Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein|Bernard Montgomery]], who was serving in the same brigade, made Percival's acquaintance and they later exchanged letters on their experiences in this conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, ''Monty: The Making of a General 1887–1942'', p158–160&lt;/ref&gt;  [[David Lloyd George]] and [[Winston Churchill]] also met Percival in 1921, when he was called as an expert witness during an inquiry into the Anglo-Irish War.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, ''The Battle for Singapore'', p69–70&lt;/ref&gt;

===Staff officer===
Percival attended the [[Staff College, Camberley]] from 1923&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=32790|startpage=608|date=26 January 1923|accessdate=18 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; to 1924, then commanded by General [[Edmund Ironside, 1st Baron Ironside|Edmund Ironside]], where he was taught by [[J.F.C. Fuller]], who was one of the few sympathetic reviewers of his book, ''The War in Malaya'', twenty-five years later. He impressed his instructors, who picked him out as one of eight students for accelerated promotion, and his fellow students who admired his cricketing skills. Following an appointment as major with the [[Cheshire Regiment]], he spent four years with the [[Nigeria Regiment]] of the [[Royal West African Frontier Force]] in [[West Africa]] as a [[staff officer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=33043|startpage=2921|date=1 May 1925|accessdate=18 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=33470|startpage=1345|date=26 February 1929|accessdate=18 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was given brevet promotion to [[Lieutenant-Colonel (United Kingdom)|Lieutenant-Colonel]] in 1929.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=33454|startpage=152|date=4 January 1929|accessdate=18 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:United Kingdom - England - London - Greenwich - Old Royal Naval College.jpg|thumb|right|The Royal Naval College, where Percival studied in 1930]]
In 1930, Percival spent a year studying at the [[Royal Naval College, Greenwich]]. From 1931 to 1932, Percival was General Staff Officer Grade 2, an instructor at the Staff College. The College's commandant General Sir [[John Dill]], became Percival's mentor over the next 10 years, helping to ensure his protégé's advancement. Dill regarded Percival as a promising officer and wrote that &quot;he has an outstanding ability, wide military knowledge, good judgment and is a very quick and accurate worker&quot; but added &quot;he has not altogether an impressive presence and one may therefore fail, at first meeting him, to appreciate his sterling worth&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, p71&lt;/ref&gt; With Dill's support, Percival was appointed to command the 2nd Battalion, the Cheshire Regiment from 1932&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=33846|startpage=4627|date=15 July 1932|accessdate=18 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; to 1936, initially in [[Malta]]. In 1935, he attended the [[Royal College of Defence Studies|Imperial Defence College]].

Percival was made a full [[colonel (United Kingdom)|colonel]] in March 1936,&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=34264|startpage=1657|date=13 March 1936|accessdate=18 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and until 1938&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=34557|startpage=6139|endpage=6140|date=30 September 1938|accessdate=18 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was General Staff Officer Grade 1 in [[British Malaya|Malaya]], the [[Chief of staff (military)|Chief of Staff]] to [[General (United Kingdom)|General]] [[William Dobbie|Dobbie]], the [[General Officer Commanding]] in Malaya. During this time, he recognised that Singapore was no longer an isolated fortress.&lt;ref&gt;Hack and Blackburn, ''Did Singapore Have to Fall?: Churchill and the Impregnable Fortress'', p39&lt;/ref&gt; He considered the possibility of the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] landing in [[Thailand]] to &quot;burgle Malaya by the backdoor&lt;ref&gt;Kinvig, p106&lt;/ref&gt; and conducted an appraisal of the possibility of an attack being launched on Singapore from the North, which was supplied to the [[War Office]], and which Percival subsequently felt was similar to the plan followed by the Japanese in 1941.&lt;ref name=&quot;percival1&quot;&gt;Percival, ''The War in Malaya'', Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt; He also supported Dobbie's unexecuted plan for the construction of fixed defences in Southern [[Johore]]. In March 1938, he returned to Britain and was (temporarily) promoted to [[brigadier]] on the General Staff, [[Aldershot Garrison|Aldershot Command]].&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=34503|startpage=2594|date=19 April 1938|accessdate=18 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War II==
{{see|South-East Asian theatre of World War II}}
[[File:Lieutenant General Arthur Percival.jpg|thumb|upright|Lieutenant-General Percival arriving by aircraft in Singapore in 1941 as the new General Officer Commanding Malaya]]

Percival was appointed Brigadier, General Staff, of the [[I Corps (United Kingdom)|I Corps]], [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]], commanded by General Dill, from 1939 to 1940. He was then promoted to acting [[Major-General (United Kingdom)|major-general]],&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=34800|supp=yes|startpage=1151|date=23 February 1940|accessdate=18 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in February 1940 briefly became General Officer Commanding [[British 43rd (Wessex) Infantry Division|43rd (Wessex) Division]]. He was made [[Assistant Chief of the General Staff (United Kingdom)|Assistant Chief of the Imperial General Staff]] at the [[War Office]] in 1940 but asked for a transfer to an active command after the [[Operation Dynamo|Dunkirk evacuation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=34855|supp=yes|startpage=3091|date=21 May 1940|accessdate=18 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=34895|supp=yes|startpage=4273|date=9 July 1940|accessdate=18 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given command of the [[British 44th (Home Counties) Infantry Division|44th (Home Counties) Infantry Division]], he spent 9 months organising the [[British anti-invasion preparations of World War II|protection of {{convert|62|mi|km}}]] of the [[England|English]] coast from invasion.&lt;ref name=&quot;percival2&quot;&gt;Percival, Chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt; He was created Companion of the [[Order of the Bath]] (CB) in the 1941 [[King's Birthday Honours]].&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=35204|supp=yes|startpage=3735|endpage=3736|date=27 June 1941|accessdate=18 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Percival's early assessment of the vulnerability of Singapore===
In 1936, Major-General [[William Dobbie]], then General Officer Commanding ([[Malaya Command|Malaya]]), made an inquiry into whether more forces were required on mainland Malaya to prevent the Japanese from establishing forward bases to attack Singapore. Percival, then his Chief Staff Officer, was tasked to draw up a tactical assessment of how the Japanese were most likely to attack.
In late 1937, his analysis duly confirmed that north [[Malay Peninsula|Malaya]] might become the critical battleground. The Japanese were likely to seize the east coast landing sites on [[Thailand]] and Malaya in order to capture aerodromes and achieve air superiority. This could serve as a prelude to further Japanese landings in [[Johore]] to disrupt communications northwards and enable the construction of another main base in North Borneo. From North Borneo, the final sea and air assault could be launched against eastern Singapore -- against [[Changi]] area.&lt;ref&gt;Ong, Chit Chung (1997) ''Operation Matador : Britain's war plans against the Japanese 1918-1941''. Singapore : Times Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===General Officer Commanding (Malaya)===
In April 1941 Percival was given promotion to acting [[Lieutenant-General (United Kingdom)|lieutenant-general]],&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=35160|supp=yes|startpage=2731|date=9 May 1941|accessdate=18 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was appointed General Officer Commanding (GOC) Malaya. This was a significant promotion for him as he had never commanded an army [[Corps]]. He left Britain in a [[Sunderland flying boat]] and embarked on an arduous two week, multi-stage flight via [[Gibraltar]], [[Malta]], [[Alexandria]] (where he was delayed by the [[Anglo-Iraqi War]]), [[Basra]], [[Karachi]] and [[Yangon|Rangoon]], where he was met by an [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] transport.&lt;ref name=&quot;percival1&quot; /&gt;

Percival had mixed feelings about his appointment, noting that &quot;In going to Malaya I realised that there was the double danger either of being left in an inactive command for some years if war did not break out in the East or, if it did, of finding myself involved in a pretty sticky business with the inadequate forces which are usually to be found in the distant parts of our [[British Empire|Empire]] in the early stages of a war.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;percival2&quot; /&gt;

For much of the interwar period, Britain's defensive plan for Malaya had centred on the dispatch of a [[Royal Navy|naval]] fleet to the newly built [[Singapore Naval Base]]. Accordingly, the army's role was to defend Singapore and Southern [[Johore]]. While this plan had seemed adequate when the nearest Japanese base had been {{convert|1700|mi|km}} away, the outbreak of war in [[European Theatre of World War II|Europe]], combined with the partial Japanese occupation of the northern part of [[French Indochina]] and the signing of the [[Tripartite Pact]] in September 1940, had underlined the difficulty of a sea-based defence. Instead it was proposed to use the RAF to defend Malaya, at least until reinforcements could be dispatched from Britain. This led to the building of airfields in northern Malaya and along its east coast and the dispersal of the available army units around the peninsula to protect them.&lt;ref&gt;Percival, Chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt;

On arrival, Percival set about training his inexperienced army, with his Indian troops being particularly raw, with most of their experienced officers having been withdrawn to support the formation of new units as the Indian army expanded. Relying upon commercial aircraft or the Volunteer air force to overcome the shortage of RAF planes, he toured the peninsula and encouraged the building of defensive works around [[Jitra]].&lt;ref&gt;Percival, Chapter 4&lt;/ref&gt; A training manual approved by Percival, ''Tactical Notes on Malaya'', was distributed to all units.

In July 1941 when the Japanese occupied southern Indochina, economic [[international sanctions|sanctions]] were invoked by Britain, the United States and the Netherlands, freezing financial assets and cutting Japan from its supplies of [[petroleum|oil]], [[tin]] and [[rubber]]. Given their on-going [[Second Sino-Japanese War|involvement in China]], this put Japan in an unsustainable position. Both the Japanese navy and army were mobilised, but for the moment an uneasy state of cold war persisted. British Commonwealth reinforcements continued to trickle into Malaya. On 2 December, the [[battleship]] [[HMS Prince of Wales (1939)|HMS ''Prince of Wales'']] and the [[battle-cruiser]] [[HMS Repulse (1916)|HMS ''Repulse'']], escorted by four [[destroyer]]s, arrived in Singapore, the first time a battle fleet had been based there. They should have been accompanied by the aircraft carrier HMS Indomitable to provide air cover but she had run aground in the Caribbean en route. The following day [[Rear-Admiral]] [[Ernest John Spooner|Spooner]] hosted a dinner attended by the newly arrived Commander-in-Chief [[Eastern Fleet]] [[Admiral]] [[Thomas Phillips (Naval officer)|Tom Phillips]] and Percival.&lt;ref&gt;Percival, Chapter 7&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Japanese attack and the British surrender===
{{main|Japanese invasion of Malaya|Battle of Singapore}}
[[File:Pacific War - Malaya 1941-42 - Map.jpg|thumb|350px|Malaya Command and the [[Japanese invasion of Malaya]]]]

On 8 December 1941 the [[Twenty-Fifth Army (Japan)|Japanese 25th Army]] under the command of Lieutenant-General [[Tomoyuki Yamashita]] launched an [[amphibious assault]] on the Malay Peninsula (one hour before the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]; the difference in date was because the two places lie on opposite sides of the [[international date line]]). That night the first Japanese invasion force arrived at [[Kota Bahru]] on Malaya's east coast. This was just a diversionary force, and the main landings took place the next day at [[Singora]] and [[Pattani (town)|Pattani]] on the south-eastern coast of [[Thailand]], with troops rapidly deploying over the border into northern Malaya.

On 10 December Percival issued a stirring, if ultimately ineffective, Special Order of the Day:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In this hour of trial the General Officer Commanding calls upon all ranks Malaya Command for a determined and sustained effort to safeguard Malaya and the adjoining British territories. The eyes of the Empire are upon us. Our whole position in the Far East is at stake. The struggle may be long and grim but let us all resolve to stand fast come what may and to prove ourselves worthy of the great trust which has been placed in us.&lt;ref&gt;Percival, chapter 9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Royal Engineers prepare to blow up a bridge in Malaya.jpg|thumb|[[Royal Engineers]] prepare to blow up a bridge during the retreat]]

The Japanese advanced rapidly, and on 27 January 1942 Percival ordered a general retreat across the [[Johore Strait]] to the island of [[Singapore]] and organised a defence along the length of the island's {{convert|70|mi|km|sing=on}} coast line. But the Japanese did not dawdle, and on 8 February Japanese troops landed on the northwest corner of Singapore island. After a week of fighting on the island, Percival held his final command conference at 9 a.m. on 15 February in [[the Battle Box]] of [[Fort Canning]]. The Japanese had already occupied approximately half of Singapore and it was clear that the island would soon fall.  Having been told that ammunition and water would both run out by the following day, Percival agreed to surrender. The Japanese at this point were running low on artillery shells, but Percival did not know this.

The Japanese insisted that Percival himself march under a [[white flag]] to the [[Old Ford Motor Factory]] in [[Bukit Timah]] to negotiate the surrender. A Japanese officer present noted that he looked &quot;pale, thin and tired&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Warren, p265&lt;/ref&gt; After a brief disagreement, when Percival insisted that the British keep 1,000 men under arms in Singapore to preserve order, which Yamashita finally conceded, it was agreed at 6.10 p.m. that the British Empire troops would lay down their arms and cease resistance at 8.30 p.m. This was in spite of instructions from Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] for prolonged resistance.&lt;ref name =&quot;Morris&quot;/&gt; The [[Pacific War]] was just ten weeks old.

A common view holds that 138,708 [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] personnel surrendered or were killed by fewer than 30,000 Japanese. However, the former figure includes nearly 50,000 troops captured or killed during the Battle of Malaya, and perhaps 15,000 base troops. Many of the other troops were tired and under-equipped following their retreat from the Malayan peninsula. Conversely, the latter number represents only the front-line troops available for the invasion of Singapore. British Empire battle casualties since 8 December amounted to 7,500 killed and 11,000 wounded. Japanese losses totalled around 3,500 killed and 6,100 wounded.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, p9 and p424&lt;/ref&gt;

===Culpability for the fall of Singapore===
[[File:Singaporesurrender.jpg|thumb|Lieutenant-General Percival led by a Japanese officer, marches under a flag of [[truce]] to negotiate the capitulation of Allied forces in Singapore, on 15 February 1942. It was the largest surrender of British-led forces in history.]]
Churchill viewed the fall of Singapore to be &quot;the worst disaster and largest capitulation in British history.&quot; However, Britain's defence, the [[Middle East]] and the [[Soviet Union]] had all received higher priorities in the allocation of men and material, so the desired [[air force]] strength of 300 to 500 aircraft was never reached, and whereas the Japanese invaded with over two hundred [[tank]]s, the British Army in Malaya did not have a single one.&lt;ref&gt;Kinvig.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1918, Percival had been described as &quot;a slim, soft spoken man... with a proven reputation for bravery and organisational powers&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Kinvig, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; but by 1945 this description had been turned on its head with even Percival's defenders describing him as &quot;something of a damp squib&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Kinvig, p. 242.&lt;/ref&gt; The fall of Singapore switched Percival's reputation to that of an ineffective &quot;staff wallah&quot;, lacking ruthlessness and aggression, even though few doubted that he was a brave and determined officer. Over six feet in height and lanky, with a clipped moustache and two protruding teeth, and unphotogenic, Percival was an easy target for a caricaturist, being described as &quot;tall, bucktoothed and lightly built&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Warren, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; There was no doubt his presentation lacked impact as &quot;his manner was low key and he was a poor public speaker with the cusp of a lisp&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Kinvig, ''General Percival and the Fall of Singapore'', p. 241.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been argued that Percival's colleagues bear a share of the responsibility of defeat. Air Chief Marshal Sir [[Henry Robert Moore Brooke-Popham|Robert Brooke-Popham]], the [[Commander-in-Chief]] of the [[British Far East Command]], refused Percival permission to launch [[Operation Matador (1941)|Operation Matador]] in advance of the Japanese landings in Thailand, not wishing to run any risk of provoking the coming war. Brooke-Popham also had a reputation for being &quot;past it&quot;, falling asleep in meetings and not arguing forcefully for the air reinforcements required to defend Malaya. Whilst Admiral [[Thomas Spencer Vaughan Phillips|Tom Phillips]] was undoubtedly brave, his leadership of Force Z led to his demise and the [[Sinking of Prince of Wales and Repulse|destruction of the British fleet]] on 10 December 1941, early in the campaign.

Others suggest that the government in London was more to blame than any of the British commanders in the Far East.  Despite repeated requests, the British government did not provide the necessary reinforcements and they denied Brooke-Popham – and therefore Percival – the permission to enter neutral Thailand before it was too late to put in place forward defences.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot;&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, Percival had difficulties with his subordinates Sir [[Lewis Heath|Lewis &quot;Piggy&quot; Heath]], commanding [[Indian III Corps]], and the independent-minded [[Gordon Bennett (general)|Gordon Bennett]], commanding the [[Australian 8th Division]]. The former officer had been senior to Percival prior to his appointment as GOC (Malaya) and found it difficult to serve under him. Bennett was full of confidence in his [[Australia]]n troops and his own ability, but faced a mixed reaction in Australia when he escaped from Singapore immediately after [[Battle of Singapore|its surrender]].

Percival was ultimately responsible for the men who served under him, and with other officers – notably Major-General [[David Murray-Lyon]], commander of the [[Indian 11th Infantry Division]] – he had shown a willingness to replace them when he felt their performance was not up to scratch. Perhaps his greatest mistake was to resist the building of fixed defences in either Johore or the north shore of Singapore, dismissing them in the face of repeated requests to start construction from his Chief Engineer, Brigadier [[Ivan Simson]], with the comment &quot;Defences are bad for morale — for both troops and civilians&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt; In doing so, Percival threw away the potential advantages he could have derived from the 6,000 engineers under his command and perhaps missed his best chance to blunt the danger posed by the Japanese tanks.

Percival also insisted on defending the north-eastern shore of Singapore most heavily, against the advice of the [[American-British-Dutch-Australian Command|Allied supreme commander in South East Asia]], General [[Archibald Percival Wavell, 1st Earl Wavell|Archibald Wavell]]. Percival was perhaps fixed on his responsibilities for defending the Singapore Naval Base.&lt;ref&gt;Dixon, ''On the Psychology of Military Incompetence'', p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt; He also spread his forces thinly around the island and kept few units as a strategic reserve. When the Japanese attack came in the west, the [[Australian 22nd Brigade]] took the brunt of the assault.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, p. 414.&lt;/ref&gt; Percival refused to reinforce them as he continued to believe that the main assault would occur in the north east.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, p. 430.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Captivity===
Percival himself was briefly held prisoner in [[Changi Prison]], where &quot;the defeated GOC could be seen sitting head in hands, outside the married quarters he now shared with seven brigadiers, a colonel, his ADC and cook-sergeant. He discussed feelings with few, spent hours walking around the extensive compound, ruminating on the reverse and what might have been&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Kinvig, p221&lt;/ref&gt; In the belief that it would improve discipline, he reconstituted a Malaya Command, complete with staff appointments, and helped occupy his fellow prisoners with lectures on the [[Battle of France]].&lt;ref&gt;MacArthur, ''Surviving the Sword: Prisoners of the Japanese 1942–45'', p188&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Douglas MacArthur signs formal surrender.jpg|left|thumb|The signing of the Japanese surrender; [[Douglas MacArthur|MacArthur]] (sitting), behind him are Generals Percival and [[Jonathan Mayhew Wainwright IV|Wainwright]].]]

Along with the other senior British captives above the rank of colonel, Percival was removed from Singapore in August 1942. First he was imprisoned in [[Taiwan|Formosa]] and then sent on to [[Manchuria]], where he was held with several dozen other VIP captives, including the [[United States|American]] General [[Jonathan Mayhew Wainwright IV|Jonathan Wainwright]], in a [[prisoner-of-war camp]] near [[Xi'an District, Mudanjiang|Hsian]], about {{convert|100|mi|km}} to the north east of [[Mukden]].

As the war drew to an end, an [[Office of Strategic Services|OSS]] team removed the prisoners from Hsian. Percival was then taken, along with Wainwright, to stand immediately behind General [[Douglas MacArthur]] as he confirmed the terms of the Japanese surrender aboard [[USS Missouri (BB-63)|USS ''Missouri'']] (BB-63) in [[Tokyo Bay]] on 2 September 1945.&lt;ref&gt;''Battleship Missouri Memorial'', http://www.ussmissouri.org/surrender.aspx , accessed 2 February 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, MacArthur gave Percival a pen he had used to sign the treaty.&lt;ref&gt;Warren, p286&lt;/ref&gt;

Percival and Wainwright then returned together to the [[Philippines]] to witness the surrender of the Japanese army there, which in a twist of fate was commanded by General Yamashita. The Tiger of Malaya was momentarily surprised to see his former captive at the ceremony. The flag carried by Percival's party on the way to Bukit Timah was also a witness to this reversal of fortunes, being flown when the Japanese formally surrendered Singapore back to Lord [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Louis Mountbatten]].&lt;ref&gt;Morris, p458&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
Percival returned to Britain in September 1945 to write his despatch at the [[War Office]] but this was revised by the [[Her Majesty's Government|UK Government]] and only published in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=38215|startpage=1245|endpage=1346|date=20 February 1948|accessdate=18 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He retired from the army in 1946 with the honorary rank of lieutenant-general but the pension of his substantive rank of major-general.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=37706|startpage=4347|date=27 August 1946|accessdate=18 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter, he held appointments connected with the county of Hertfordshire, where he lived at Bullards in [[Widford, Hertfordshire|Widford]]: he was Honorary Colonel of the 479th (Hertfordshire Yeomanry) H.A.A. Regiment [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|T.A.]] from 1949 to 1954&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=38762|startpage=5465|date=18 November 1949|accessdate=18 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and acted as one of the [[Deputy Lieutenant]]s of Hertfordshire in 1951.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=39412|startpage=6600|date=18 December 1951|accessdate=18 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He continued his relationship with the Cheshire Regiment being appointed Colonel of the Cheshire Regiment between 1950 and 1955;&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=38940|supp=yes|startpage=3037|date=13 June 1950|accessdate=18 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=40680|supp=yes|startpage=208|date=6 January 1956|accessdate=18 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; an association continued by his son, [[Brigadier]] James Percival who became Colonel of the Regiment between 1992 and 1999.

While General Wainwright had become a public hero on his return to the United States, Percival found himself disparaged for his leadership in Malaya, even by Lieutenant-General Heath, his erstwhile subordinate. Percival's 1949 memoir, ''The War in Malaya'', did little to quell this criticism, being a restrained rather than self-serving account of the campaign. Unusually for a British lieutenant-general, Percival was not awarded a [[British honours system|knighthood]].

Percival was respected for the time he had spent as a Japanese [[prisoner of war]]. Serving as life president of the [[Far East Prisoners of War]] Association (FEPOW), he pushed for compensation for his fellow captives, eventually helping to obtain a token £5 million of frozen Japanese assets for this cause. This was distributed by the FEPOW Welfare Trust, on which Percival served as Chairman.&lt;ref name = &quot;MacArthur442&quot;&gt;MacArthur, p. 442.&lt;/ref&gt; He led protests against the film ''[[The Bridge on the River Kwai]]'' when it was released in 1957, obtaining the addition of an on-screen statement that the movie was a work of fiction. He also worked as President of the Hertfordshire [[British Red Cross]] and was made an Officer of the [[Venerable Order of Saint John]] in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=43367|startpage=5540|endpage=5542|date=26 June 1964|accessdate=18 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Percival died at the age of 78 on 31 January 1966, in King Edward VII's Hospital for Officers, Beaumont Street in [[City of Westminster|Westminster]], and was buried in Hertfordshire. [[John Leonard Wilson|Leonard Wilson]], formerly the [[Bishop of Singapore]], gave the address at his memorial service, which was held in [[St Martin-in-the-Fields]].

===Family===
On 27 July 1927 Percival married Margaret Elizabeth &quot;Betty&quot; MacGregor (who died in 1956) in [[Holy Trinity Brompton Church|Holy Trinity Church]], [[Brompton, London|Brompton]]. She was the daughter of Thomas MacGregor Greer of Tallylagan Manor, a [[Protestantism|Protestant]] [[linen]] merchant from [[County Tyrone]] in [[Ulster]]. They had met during his tour of duty in Ireland and it had taken Percival several years to propose. They had two children. A daughter, Dorinda Margery, was born in Greenwich and became [[Baron Dunleath|Lady Dunleath]]. [[Alfred James MacGregor]], their son, was born in [[Singapore]] and also served in the British Army. The family were well-to-do and Percival's estate on his death was valued at £102,515, a considerable sum in 1966.
