[[Air Vice Marshal]] '''Stanley James (Jimmy) Goble''' [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]], [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]], [[Distinguished Service Cross (United Kingdom)|DSC]] (21 August 1891 &amp;ndash; 24 July 1948) was a senior commander in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF). He served three terms as [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]], alternating with Wing Commander (later Air Marshal Sir) [[Richard Williams (RAAF officer)|Richard Williams]]. Goble came to national attention in 1924 when he and fellow RAAF pilot [[Ivor McIntyre]] became the first men to [[Circumnavigation|circumnavigate]] Australia by air, journeying {{convert|8450|mi|km}} in a single-engined [[floatplane]].

During World War I, Goble flew [[Fighter aircraft|fighters]] on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] with the British [[Royal Naval Air Service]]. He became an [[Flying ace|ace]] with ten victories, commanded No. 5 Squadron (later [[No. 205 Squadron RAF]]), and was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Order]] and the [[Distinguished Service Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Service Cross]]. Returning to Australia, Goble assisted in the formation of the RAAF as an independent branch of the Australian armed forces. On an exchange posting to Britain in the 1930s, he led [[No. 2 Group RAF|No. 2 (Bomber) Group RAF]].

As Chief of the Air Staff at the onset of World War II, Goble clashed with the [[Government of Australia|Federal Government]] over implementation of the [[British Commonwealth Air Training Plan|Empire Air Training Scheme]], which he believed would be detrimental to the defence of Australia. He stepped down as leader of the RAAF in early 1940, and spent the rest of the war in [[Ottawa]] as Air Liaison Officer to Canada. Goble died in 1948 at the age of fifty-six, two years after his retirement from the military.

==Early career==
Born in [[Croydon, Victoria|Croydon]], Victoria, Stanley James Goble was one of four sons to an Australian father, George, and an English mother, Ann.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;&gt;McCarthy, ''Australian Dictionary of Biography'', pp.33&amp;ndash;35&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.39-41&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.39&amp;ndash;41&lt;/ref&gt; He apparently received little schooling, and began his working life as a [[clerk (position)|clerk]] with the Victorian Railways at the age of sixteen. By twenty-three he was, like his father, a stationmaster.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Australia's Air Chiefs'', p.25&lt;/ref&gt;

Goble was prevented from joining the [[First Australian Imperial Force|Australian Imperial Force]] at the beginning of World War&amp;nbsp;I after failing the stringent medical criteria; he wrote later that &quot;only applicants of the finest physiques were considered suitable for the first contingent of Australian troops&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens p.10&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p.10&lt;/ref&gt; With his three brothers already on active service, however, he decided to travel to England at his own expense and enlist in the British armed forces.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;

==World War I==
Goble was accepted for flying training with the [[Royal Naval Air Service]] (RNAS) in July 1915. After graduating as a flight sub-lieutenant on 20 October 1915, he became a test pilot and undertook [[anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine patrols]] out of [[Dover]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Goble commenced operations with only three hours solo flying experience.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens p.10&quot;/&gt; Towards the end of the year he was posted across the [[English Channel|Channel]] to [[Dunkirk]], flying [[Caudron]] reconnaissance-bombers and [[Sopwith Pup]] fighters.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens p.10&quot;/&gt;

|quote=...I was detailed to carry out what was termed a fighting patrol in a twin-engined Caudron. My armament was a [[Flare gun|Very pistol]] and my gunner was supplied with a rifle... I discovered that my gunner had never been in the air, had never fired a rifle in his life... I had not seen a twin-engined Caudron until after dark on the previous evening and could not even obtain a map of the front... Fortunately this highly efficient fighting combination found nothing to fight.

Goble was a founding member of [[No. 208 Squadron RAF|No. 8 Squadron RNAS]] in 1916, during the latter part of the [[Battle of the Somme]], where he flew both Pups and [[Nieuport]] fighters.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; He earned the [[Distinguished Service Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Service Cross]] for his actions on 24 September 1916 when he engaged two enemy fighters near [[Gistel|Ghistelles]] in [[West Flanders]], &quot;and brought one of them down on fire in a spiral nose-dive&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=29799|supp=yes|startpage=10362|date=24 October 1916|accessdate=6 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; This victory was the first confirmed 'kill' achieved by an Allied pilot flying the Pup.&lt;ref name=&quot;Air Force&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last = Cardillo | first = Teena | date = 27 March 2003 | title = Aircraft's return is in the bag | url=http://www.defence.gov.au/news/raafnews/editions/4504/history/story02.htm | journal = Air Force| volume = 45 |issue =  4 |publisher =[[Department of Defence (Australia)|Department of Defence (Air Force)]]|accessdate=11 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Franks, ''Sopwith Pup Aces of World War I'', p.8&lt;/ref&gt; Goble was promoted to [[flight lieutenant]] on 1 October, and won the [[Croix de guerre|French Croix de guerre]] later that month.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;&gt;Dennis et al., ''The Oxford Companion to Australian Military History'', p.270&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 February 1917, Goble was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Order]] (DSO) for his &quot;conspicuous bravery and skill&quot; in three separate actions while operating with No. 8 Squadron: on 7 November 1916 when he forced a hostile fighter down in a field, where it crashed attempting to land; on 27 November when he engaged four enemy aircraft, destroying one; and on 4 December when, in repeated combats while escorting Allied bombers, he helped drive off attacking fighters and shot down one of them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gazette29947&quot;&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=29947|startpage=1648|date=16 February 1917|accessdate=6 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same month he was awarded the DSO, Goble was posted to [[No. 205 Squadron RAF|No. 5 Squadron RNAS]] at [[Petite-Synthe]] near the Franco-Belgian border, flying [[Airco DH.4]] two-seat light bombers.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; 

Goble was promoted twice in 1917, to flight commander in June,&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=30156|startpage=6413|endpage=6414|date=29 June 1917|accessdate=6 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; then squadron commander in December.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=30451|supp=yes|startpage=87|endpage=88|date=28 December 1917|accessdate=6 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He led No. 5 Squadron for the latter part of the year and into 1918.&lt;ref&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/01.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', p.7]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cutlack&quot;&gt;Cutlack, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/9/chapters/00.pdf ''The Australian Flying Corps'', p.xxvi]&lt;/ref&gt; His unit supported the [[Fifth Army (United Kingdom)|British Fifth Army]] as it bore the brunt of the German [[Spring Offensive]], and he had to evacuate his airfield when it was shelled by advancing enemy artillery.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Relocating twice to other landing grounds, however, he kept his squadron on the attack, and was subsequently recognised by a commendation circulated to all RNAS combat units.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp.28&amp;ndash;29&lt;/ref&gt; When the RNAS merged with the [[British Army]]'s [[Royal Flying Corps]] on 1 April 1918, Goble became a [[Major (rank)|major]] in the newly formed [[Royal Air Force]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;/&gt;  Twice [[mentioned in despatches]],&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; he finished the war an [[Flying ace|ace]], with ten victories.&lt;ref&gt;Stevens, ''The Royal Australian Navy'', p.49&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Franks, ''Sopwith Pup Aces of World War 1'', p.86&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Newton, ''Australian Air Aces'', pp.36,60&lt;/ref&gt; Although himself forced to crash land on two occasions, he had avoided any injury during his active service.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;

==Inter-war years==
===Establishment of the Royal Australian Air Force===

Goble returned to Australia on HT ''Gaika'' in November 1918.&lt;ref&gt;[http://naa12.naa.gov.au/scripts/ItemDetail.asp?M=0&amp;B=6032142 MT1487/1 2001/00494397] at [[National Archives of Australia]]. Retrieved 14 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; He was appointed an [[Order of the British Empire|Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] in the 1919 [[New Year Honours]],&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=31098|supp=yes|startpage=92|endpage=93|date=31 December 1918|accessdate=14 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and made an acting [[lieutenant colonel]] in May that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=31332|startpage=5800|date=9 May 1919|accessdate=14 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received a permanent commission as a [[squadron leader]] and honorary [[Wing Commander (rank)|wing commander]] in the RAF on 1 August 1919, and was seconded to the [[Royal Australian Navy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=32009|startpage=8183|date=6 August 1920|accessdate=14 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When a temporary Air Board was set up to examine the feasibility of an Australian Air Force (AAF), Goble was assigned as a Navy representative, with Lieutenant Colonel [[Richard Williams (RAAF officer)|Richard Williams]], an Australian Flying Corps veteran of World War I, acting as an [[Australian Army|Army]] spokesman. The permanent Australian Air Board was established on 9 November 1920, and recommended creation of the AAF as an independent branch of the armed services.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.26-31&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.26&amp;ndash;31&lt;/ref&gt; The AAF came into being on 31 March 1921&amp;mdash;the 'Royal' prefix being granted five months later&amp;mdash;and Goble resigned his commission in the RAF the same day to transfer to the new service as a wing commander.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.26-31&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=32767|startpage=8039|date=14 November 1922|accessdate=14 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Navy had nominated Goble as First Air Member (later [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]]), however Williams took the post and Goble became Second Air Member and Director of Personnel and Training.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.26-31&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/01.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', pp.15&amp;ndash;16]&lt;/ref&gt; Williams and Goble would serve as Chief of the Air Staff (CAS) three times each between 1922 and 1940. One motive suggested for the rotation was a ploy by Army and Navy interests to limit Williams' autonomy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Going Solo&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp.20&amp;ndash;23&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, according to RAAF historian Alan Stephens, the arrangement &quot;almost inevitably fostered an unproductive rivalry&quot; between the two officers,&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.26-31&quot;/&gt; which was &quot;exacerbated by the personality differences between the pedantic, autocratic Williams and the cheerful, easy-going Goble&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''High Fliers'', p.33&lt;/ref&gt; Although in a legal sense the Air Board led the RAAF rather than the CAS alone, Williams dominated the board to such an extent that Goble would later complain that his colleague appeared to consider the Air Force his personal command.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.52&amp;ndash;53&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Chief of the Air Staff===
The rivalry between Goble and Williams was such that it was later alleged that government practice was to ensure that they were never in the country at the same time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Helson&quot;&gt;Helson, ''Ten Years at the Top'', pp.29&amp;ndash;33&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1921, Goble was posted to Britain for a naval cooperation course; his place on the Air Board was taken by Squadron Leader [[William Anderson (RAAF officer)|Bill Anderson]].&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.37&lt;/ref&gt; Goble married Kathleen Wodehouse in London on [[Anzac Day]], 1922, and returned to Australia later that year.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; His first term as CAS began when Williams left the country in December 1922 for study in England. Goble developed a plan to establish a small [[seaplane]] base at [[Rushcutters Bay]] in Sydney, but Williams cancelled this shortly after he returned to Australia in February 1925 to resume the position of CAS.&lt;ref&gt;Roylance, ''Air Base Richmond'', p.19&lt;/ref&gt; Goble's suggestion of a separate [[Fleet Air Arm (RAN)|Fleet Air Arm]] fostered suspicions that he was too closely aligned with naval interests.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;/&gt; He departed for England to undertake study at the [[Staff College, Camberley|British Army Staff College in Camberley]] and [[RAF Staff College, Andover]], as Williams had done two years before. Goble also served as Air Liaison Officer with the Australian High Commission in London from May 1926 to September 1927. He was promoted to [[group captain]] on 1 April 1928.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;

Raised to temporary [[air commodore]], Goble took over as CAS for the second time between December 1932 and June 1934, while Williams attended the [[Royal College of Defence Studies|Imperial Defence College]] in London.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.airforce.gov.au/leaders/formerchiefs.aspx Royal Australian Air Force leaders: Former Chiefs of the Air Force] at [http://www.airforce.gov.au/ Royal Australian Air Force]. Retrieved 2 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  On secondment to the RAF from 1935 to 1937, Goble was attached to the British [[Air Ministry]] as Deputy Director of Air Operations.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; In this capacity he attended a conference in 1936 to examine a Commonwealth-wide air training plan, a concept that would be revived in World War II as the [[British Commonwealth Air Training Plan|Empire Air Training Scheme]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison p.79&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/04.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', p.79]&lt;/ref&gt;  Continuing his exchange posting, on 1 September Goble took over as [[Air Officer Commanding]] [[No. 2 Group RAF|No. 2 (Bomber) Group]], based in [[Hampshire]]. The group comprised fifteen squadrons, putting him in charge of a force stronger than the entire RAAF.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.93&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 February 1937, Goble was raised to temporary [[air vice marshal]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; He succeeded Williams as Chief of the Air Staff for the last time in February 1939, when the latter was dismissed from his position in the aftermath of the [[Edward Leonard Ellington|Ellington Report]] criticising the standards of training and air safety observed by the RAAF.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.66-67,113-116&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.66&amp;ndash;67,113&amp;ndash;116&lt;/ref&gt; When he replaced Williams, Goble was Air Member for Personnel and might therefore have been considered more closely responsible for such standards; he maintained however that Williams had personally overseen the service's air training since 1934.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp.347&amp;ndash;348&lt;/ref&gt;

===Circumnavigation of Australia===

The young air force was a small, close-knit organisation comparable to a [[flying club]]; however several pioneering flights were undertaken by its members.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.36&amp;ndash;37&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most notable was made by Goble and Flying Officer (later Flight Lieutenant) [[Ivor McIntyre]] in 1924, when they became the first men to circumnavigate Australia by air, in a single-engined [[Fairey III|Fairey IIID]] floatplane. The English-born McIntyre, who was lead pilot while Goble acted as commander and navigator, was also a World War I veteran of the Royal Naval Air Service.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.39-41&quot;/&gt; The purpose of the flight was to survey the northern coastline of Australia for defence planning, and to test the capabilities of the Fairey IIID.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/01.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', p.25]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Goble and McIntyre took off from [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Point Cook Base|Point Cook]], Victoria, on 6 April 1924 and flew {{convert|8450|mi|km}} in 44 days, in often arduous conditions. Though well-prepared with fuel stocks and spare parts pre-positioned along the intended route, they had to contend with illness and tropical storms, as well as mid-air engine trouble and fuel leaks.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.39-41&quot;/&gt; Their journey took them anticlockwise around the continent, along the Eastern Australian coast through [[Sydney]], [[Southport, Queensland|Southport]], [[Townsville, Queensland|Townsville]] and [[Thursday Island, Queensland|Thursday Island]], crossing the [[Gulf of Carpentaria]] to [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], and then continuing along the coast through [[Broome, Western Australia|Broome]], [[Carnarvon, Western Australia|Carnarvon]], [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], [[Albany, Western Australia|Albany]] and [[Port Lincoln, South Australia|Port Lincoln]], before arriving back in Victoria.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison&quot;/&gt; As they flew above Point Cook, twelve RAAF aircraft took to the air to escort them to their landing place at [[St Kilda, Victoria|St Kilda Beach]], where they were welcomed by a crowd of 10,000 people.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.39-41&quot;/&gt; 

[[Image:AWM128398.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Goble (left) and McIntyre on St Kilda Beach|alt=Two men being chaired by a crowd of people]]
Prime Minister [[Stanley Bruce]] called the expedition &quot;one of the most wonderful accomplishments in the history of aviation&quot;, his government presenting Goble with a gift of ₤500, and ₤250 to McIntyre.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison&quot;/&gt; The British [[Royal Aero Club]] awarded them the annual [[Britannia Trophy]], and they were appointed [[Order of the British Empire|Commanders of the Order of the British Empire]] in the [[Queen's Birthday Honours|King's Birthday Honours]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.39-41&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=32941|supp=yes|startpage=4414|date=30 May 1924|accessdate=6 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the flight is still acknowledged as one of the most important in Australian aviation, the necessity for the Air Force chief to personally command such a journey has been questioned, suggesting that it was motivated by the [[one-upmanship]] that characterised the Williams-Goble relationship.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.39-41&quot;/&gt; Two years later Williams would make a three-month, {{convert|10000|mi|km|sing=on}} round trip from Point Cook to the Pacific Islands, the first international flight undertaken by an RAAF plane and crew, amid similar suspicions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.39-41&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, [http://www.library.unsw.edu.au/~thesis/adt-ADFA/uploads/approved/adt-ADFA20031029.102545/public/02chapter1.pdf &quot;''The Eagle and the Albatross''&quot;], pp.24&amp;ndash;25&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War II==
[[Image:P00048.112Goble.jpg|thumb|left|180px||Air Vice Marshal Goble (left) as Air Liaison Officer to Canada, 1941|alt=Three men in light-coloured military uniforms with peaked caps]]
As Chief of the Air Staff at the outbreak of World War II, Goble planned the expansion and decentralisation of the RAAF in order to meet the needs of home defence and Australia's obligations in Europe, which included the transfer of [[No. 10 Squadron RAAF|No. 10 Squadron]] to Britain.&lt;ref name=&quot;Helson&quot;/&gt;  However his concept of an autonomous Air Expeditionary Force was abandoned by the Federal Government in favour of full commitment to the Empire Air Training Scheme, which Goble considered detrimental to local defence.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.66-67,113-116&quot;/&gt; His proposal to organise the RAAF along functional lines, with Home Defence, Training, and Maintenance Commands, would similarly be rejected.&lt;ref&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/05.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', pp.90–91]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ashworth&quot;&gt;Ashworth, ''How Not to Run an Air Force'', pp.24&amp;ndash;28&lt;/ref&gt; He also came into conflict with his deputy, Air Commodore John Russell, an RAF officer on exchange in Australia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Helson&quot;/&gt; These issues led to Goble tendering his resignation as CAS, which took effect in January 1940. ''[[The Argus (Australia)|The Argus]]'' in Melbourne reported that &quot;Goble wishes to resign 'on a matter of high principle'. It is known that he has been dissatisfied for some time with his relations with the Federal Government.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.75-77&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/03.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', pp.75&amp;ndash;77]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Prime Minister [[Robert Menzies]] had in any case been looking for a British officer to head the RAAF and confided to the [[List of High Commissioners of the United Kingdom to Australia|UK High Commissioner]], Sir Geoffrey Whiskard, that Goble's resignation was &quot;undoubtedly very convenient&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp.462&amp;ndash;463&lt;/ref&gt; Following the interim appointment of Air Commodore Anderson, the Royal Air Force's Air Chief Marshal [[Charles Burnett (RAF officer)|Sir Charles Burnett]] became Chief of the Air Staff; among other things, Burnett proceeded to reorganise the Air Force into a geographically based &quot;area&quot; system of command and control.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.66-67,113-116&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.91–92&quot;&gt;Gillison, ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', pp.91–92&lt;/ref&gt;  Goble had offered to submit his resignation from the RAAF as well as from the position of CAS, and was considering a return to Britain for service with the RAF. Menzies persuaded him to remain and take on the role of Australian Air Liaison Officer to Canada, based in [[Ottawa]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.66-67,113-116&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.75-77&quot;/&gt; Raised to substantive air vice marshal, Goble stayed at this post for the duration of the war and was the RAAF's representative at the Ottawa Conference in May&amp;ndash;June 1942 that negotiated the Joint Commonwealth Air Training Plan.&lt;ref&gt;Herington, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/28/chapters/20.pdf ''Air War Against Germany and Italy'', pp.530&amp;ndash;545]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ashworth, ''How Not to Run an Air Force'', p.20&lt;/ref&gt;
