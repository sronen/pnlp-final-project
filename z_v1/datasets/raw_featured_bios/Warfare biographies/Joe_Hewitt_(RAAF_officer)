[[Air Vice Marshal]] '''Joseph Eric''' ('''Joe''') '''Hewitt''', [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire|CBE]] (13 April 1901 &amp;ndash; 1&amp;nbsp;November 1985) was a senior commander in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF). A [[Royal Australian Navy]] (RAN) officer who transferred permanently to the Air Force in 1928, he commanded [[No. 101 Flight RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;101 (Fleet Cooperation) Flight]] in the early 1930s, and [[No. 104 Squadron RAF|No.&amp;nbsp;104 (Bomber) Squadron RAF]] on exchange in Britain shortly before [[World War II|World War&amp;nbsp;II]]. Appointed the RAAF's Assistant Chief of the Air Staff in 1941, Hewitt was posted the following year to Allied Air Forces Headquarters, [[South West Pacific theatre of World War II|South West Pacific Area]], as Director of Intelligence. In 1943, he took command of [[No. 9 Operational Group RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;9 Operational Group]], the RAAF's main mobile strike force, but was controversially sacked by the [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]], Air Vice Marshal [[George Jones (RAAF officer)|George Jones]], less than a year later over alleged morale and disciplinary issues.

Described as a &quot;small, dapper man&quot; who was &quot;outspoken, even 'cocky'&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;&gt;Stephens &amp; Isaacs, ''High Fliers'', pp.97&amp;ndash;99&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;&gt;Dennis et al., ''Oxford Military History of Australia'', p.259&lt;/ref&gt; Hewitt overcame the setback to his career during the war and made his most significant contributions afterwards, as Air Member for Personnel from 1945 to 1948. Directly responsible for the demobilisation of thousands of wartime staff and the consolidation of what was then the world's fourth largest air force into a much smaller peacetime service, he also modernised education and training within the RAAF. Hewitt was appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] in 1951, the same year he became Air Member for Supply and Equipment. Retiring from the military in 1956, he went into business and later managed his own publishing house. He wrote two books including ''Adversity in Success'', a first-hand account of the South West Pacific air war, before his death in 1985 at the age of 84.

==Early career==
Born in [[Tylden, Victoria|Tylden]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], Joe Hewitt was the son of [[Reverend]] J.H.&amp;nbsp;Hewitt.&lt;ref name=&quot;Who's Who in Australia&quot;&gt;Draper, ''Who's Who in Australia 1985'', p.409&lt;/ref&gt; He attended [[Scotch College, Melbourne]], before entering the [[HMAS Creswell|Royal Australian Naval College]], [[Jervis Bay]] in 1915, at age 13.&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; Graduating in 1919,&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/06.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p.100]&lt;/ref&gt;  Hewitt rose to [[Lieutenant]] in the RAN before volunteering for secondment to the [[Royal Australian Air Force|RAAF]] as a [[Flight Lieutenant]] in January 1923.&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942 pp.23-24&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/01.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', pp.23&amp;ndash;24]&lt;/ref&gt; He undertook the [[aviator|pilots']] course at [[No. 1 Flying Training School RAAF|No. 1 Flying Training School]], [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Point Cook Base|Point Cook]], and graduated at the end of the year.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p.34&lt;/ref&gt;  Hewitt was further seconded to the [[Royal Air Force]] on 4&amp;nbsp;May 1925,&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=33048|startpage=3382|date=19 May 1925|accessdate=16 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; holding a temporary commission as an RAF [[Flying Officer]]; this commission was cancelled on 25&amp;nbsp;September.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=33087|startpage=6206|date=25 September 1925|accessdate=16 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He married Lorna Bishop on 10&amp;nbsp;November; they had three daughters.&lt;ref name=&quot;Who's Who in Australia&quot;/&gt;

Hewitt joined the newly formed [[No. 101 Flight RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;101 (Fleet Cooperation) Flight]], operating [[Supermarine Seagull (1921)|Seagull&amp;nbsp;III]] [[Amphibious aircraft|amphibious]] [[biplane]]s, in August 1926. Prior to the unit deploying to [[Queensland]] to survey the [[Great Barrier Reef]] with [[HMAS Moresby (1918)|HMAS ''Moresby'']], he practiced manoeuvres around the centre of Melbourne, landing in the [[Yarra River]] near [[Flinders Street Station]]. Media criticism of the escapade led to him being brought before the [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]], [[Group Captain]] [[Richard Williams (RAAF officer)|Richard Williams]], who rather than upbraiding Hewitt expressed himself &quot;reservedly pleased about the publicity&quot;. After completing its survey work in November 1928, the unit served aboard the [[seaplane tender|seaplane carrier]] [[HMAS Albatross (seaplane tender)|HMAS ''Albatross'']].&lt;ref name=&quot;Third Brother pp.408-411&quot;&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp.408&amp;ndash;411&lt;/ref&gt; Hewitt's transfer to the Air Force was made permanent the same year.&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; He became [[Commanding Officer]] of No. 101 Flight in February 1931,&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.218&lt;/ref&gt; and supervised embarkation of the Seagull aboard the [[cruiser]] [[HMAS Australia (D84)|HMAS ''Australia'']] in September&amp;ndash;October 1932, by which time he had been promoted [[Squadron Leader]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, [http://unsworks.unsw.edu.au/vital/access/services/Download/unsworks:3183/SOURCE02?view=true ''The Eagle and the Albatross'', p.27]&lt;/ref&gt; Finishing his tour with No.&amp;nbsp;101 Flight the following year, Hewitt was posted to Britain in 1934. He attended [[RAF Staff College, Andover]] in his first year abroad, and served as Assistant Liaison Officer at [[High Commission of Australia in London|Australia House]], London in 1935.&lt;ref name=&quot;Who's Who in Australia&quot;/&gt; Although a specialist [[seaplane]] pilot, he converted to [[bomber]]s while in England, flying [[Hawker Hind]]s and [[Bristol Blenheim]]s as the Commanding Officer of [[No. 104 Squadron RAF|No.&amp;nbsp;104 Squadron RAF]] from 1936.&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, [http://unsworks.unsw.edu.au/vital/access/services/Download/unsworks:3183/SOURCE03?view=true ''The Eagle and the Albatross'', p.51]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Returning to Australia in 1938, Hewitt was appointed Senior Air Staff Officer at [[RAAF Base Richmond|RAAF Station Richmond]],  [[New South Wales]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Who's Who in Australia&quot;/&gt; and by July that year had been promoted [[Wing Commander (rank)|Wing Commander]]. In May 1939, he was chosen to lead [[No. 10 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;10 Squadron]], due to be formed on 1&amp;nbsp;July at the recently established [[RAAF Base Rathmines|RAAF Station Rathmines]], near [[City of Lake Macquarie|Lake Macquarie]]. Hewitt was preparing to depart for England to take delivery of the unit's planned complement of [[Short Sunderland]] flying boats when he broke his neck riding his motor cycle near Richmond, and had to forgo the assignment while he recovered. Fit for duty by August, he was given command of the Rathmines base to manage the deployment of No.&amp;nbsp;10 Squadron and its aircraft, but this was suspended due to the outbreak of [[World War II]] in September, and the Sunderlands and their RAAF crews remained in Britain for service alongside the RAF.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.150&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War II==
===Director of Personnel Services to AOC No. 9 Operational Group===

On 20 November 1939, the RAAF formed No.&amp;nbsp;1 Group in Melbourne,&lt;ref&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/03.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', p.67]&lt;/ref&gt; which evolved into Southern Area Command early in 1940 with Hewitt as Senior Administration Staff Officer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Who's Who in Australia&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/05.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', p.92]&lt;/ref&gt; Having been promoted [[Group Captain]], he was made Director of Personnel Services (DPS) after completing his posting to Southern Area,&lt;ref name=&quot;Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942 pp.23-24&quot;/&gt; and was appointed an [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] on 11&amp;nbsp;July.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=34893|supp=yes|startpage=4254|date=9 July 1940|accessdate=16 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Described as having &quot;a [[Calvinist]] background and rigid ideas on women's place in society&quot;, as DPS he opposed the creation of the [[Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force]] (WAAAF) and later advocated that its members be enrolled on a contractual basis rather than enlisted or commissioned as Permanent Air Force staff.&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, ''The WAAAF in Wartime Australia'', pp.58&amp;ndash;59&lt;/ref&gt; In 1941, Hewitt became Assistant Chief of the Air Staff,&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942 pp.23-24&quot;/&gt; before being assigned in April the following year to the newly formed Allied Air Forces Headquarters (AAF&amp;nbsp;HQ), [[South West Pacific theatre of World War II|South West Pacific Area]] (SWPA), as Director of Intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/24.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', p.473]&lt;/ref&gt; He established cordial working relations with his American peers at AAF&amp;nbsp;HQ, becoming a confidant of its commander, Major General [[George Kenney]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;/&gt;

Promoted [[Air Commodore]], in February 1943 Hewitt was appointed [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) [[No. 9 Operational Group RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;9 Operational Group]] (9OG).&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.122-123&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.122&amp;ndash;123&lt;/ref&gt; The RAAF's premier mobile strike force, 9OG initially comprised seven Australian combat squadrons and came under the control of the US [[Fifth Air Force]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.122-123&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Air War Against Japan p.6&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/01.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p.6]&lt;/ref&gt; The month he took over, Hewitt's squadrons were reorganised into two wings: [[No. 71 Wing RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;71 Wing]], comprising units based in [[Milne Bay]], [[Territory of New Guinea|New Guinea]], and [[No. 73 Wing RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;73 Wing]], comprising those in [[Port Moresby]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Air War Against Japan pp.23-24&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/02.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.23&amp;ndash;24]&lt;/ref&gt; In March, 9OG led the RAAF's contribution to the [[Battle of the Bismarck Sea]], &quot;the decisive aerial engagement&quot; in the SWPA according to General [[Douglas MacArthur]], resulting in 12&amp;nbsp;[[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] ships being sunk.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.160-165&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.160&amp;ndash;165&lt;/ref&gt;

Two of the men are in the foreground and the rest in a row behind them.]]
By April 1943, however, Hewitt had been dragged into the [[George Jones (RAAF officer)#Divided command|divisive personal conflict]] between  the [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]], Air Vice Marshal [[George Jones (RAAF officer)|George Jones]], and the AOC of [[RAAF Command]], Air Vice Marshal [[William Bostock|Bill Bostock]]. RAAF Command was the Air Force's main operational formation in the Pacific, controlling 24&amp;nbsp;Australian squadrons. Jones, administrative and ''[[de jure]]'' head of the RAAF, sought to extend his authority into the sphere of operations by posting a &quot;more accountable&quot; officer into Bostock's position, namely Hewitt.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.122-123&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Helson p.122&quot;&gt;Helson, ''Ten Years at the Top'', pp.122&amp;ndash;126&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Minister for Defence (Australia)|Minister for Air]], [[Arthur Drakeford]], backed Jones' manoeuvre but was informed by [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] [[John Curtin]] that General MacArthur, as Supreme Commander SWPA, &quot;would insist on the replacement of AVM Bostock by an equally able officer&quot;, and that &quot;Air Commodore Hewitt&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;was not considered an adequate replacement.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.16&amp;ndash;18&lt;/ref&gt; 

No changes were made to command arrangements in the South West Pacific following this episode, and Hewitt continued to lead 9OG in its bombing and strafing campaign against Japanese airfields and lines of communication in [[New Britain]], north-east of New Guinea. By mid-June 1943, he had set up Group Headquarters at Milne Bay, and No.&amp;nbsp;73 Wing HQ at [[Goodenough Island]]. On 22&amp;nbsp;July, he mounted an operation against [[Gasmata Airport|Gasmata airfield]] using 62&amp;nbsp;aircraft from five of his squadrons, the largest strike undertaken by the Australians to that date.&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.33&amp;ndash;35&lt;/ref&gt; 9OG would take most of the credit for the RAAF reaching a peak of 254&amp;nbsp;tons of bombs dropped in October, as against 137&amp;nbsp;tons delivered the previous month.&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/06.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.93&amp;ndash;95]&lt;/ref&gt; On 8&amp;nbsp;November, Hewitt sent out a formation of three [[Bristol Beaufort]]s in a severe electrical storm to attack the heavily defended harbour at [[Rabaul]]. This was conceived as a &quot;make or break&quot; effort to prove the worth or otherwise of the Beaufort as a [[torpedo bomber]], in which role it had so far been a disappointment; in what the [[Australia in the War of 1939–1945|official history of the RAAF in World War II]] described as &quot;an heroic attack&quot;, at least one enemy [[Tank ship|tanker]] was struck, for the loss of one Beaufort.&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.100&amp;ndash;102&lt;/ref&gt;

===AOC No. 9 Operational Group to Air Member for Personnel===

Although Hewitt was performing an &quot;excellent job&quot; according to Fifth Air Force commander Major General [[Ennis Whitehead]], he was controversially removed from his post in mid-November 1943 by Air Vice Marshal Jones, over accusations of poor discipline and morale within 9OG.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.122-123&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers&quot;&gt;Odgers, ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.102&amp;ndash;103&lt;/ref&gt; RAAF historian Alan Stephens later described the circumstances of Hewitt's dismissal as &quot;murky&quot;, and the allegations leading to it as unofficial.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.122-123&quot;/&gt; Drakeford defended Hewitt's service record, informing the Prime Minister that &quot;the present position may be largely, if not entirely, due to some temporary physical stress brought about by the strain of his important duties as A.O.C. of No.&amp;nbsp;9 Group.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers&quot;/&gt; Hewitt himself believed that he had been smeared by a disgruntled former staff officer;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;/&gt; historian Kristen Alexander later identified Wing Commander Kenneth Ranger, who would play a leading part in the &quot;[[Morotai Mutiny]]&quot; of 1945, as having made allegations regarding Hewitt's supposed &quot;lack of balance, vanity and lack of purpose in the prosecution of the war&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cleaning the Augean stables&quot;&gt;Alexander, &quot;Cleaning the Augean stables&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; As a result,  Hewitt returned to his previous position as Director of Intelligence at Allied Air Headquarters, while the Air Member of Personnel, Air Commodore [[Frank Lukis]], took over as AOC&amp;nbsp;9OG in December.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.122-123&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A150167b.htm?hilite=lukis Lukis, Francis William Fellowes (1896 - 1966)] at [[Australian Dictionary of Biography]]. Retrieved on 1 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; General Kenney considered Hewitt's removal &quot;bad news&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.122-123&quot;/&gt; 

After completing his tour as Director of Intelligence at AAF HQ at the end of 1944, Hewitt became acting Air Member for Personnel (AMP) in 1945.&lt;ref name=&quot;Helson p.224&quot;&gt;Helson, ''Ten Years at the Top'', p.224&lt;/ref&gt; As AMP, Hewitt sat on the Air Board, the RAAF's controlling body that consisted of its most senior officers and was chaired by the Chief of the Air Staff.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p.112&lt;/ref&gt; Along with the other members of the board, he reviewed the findings of the inquiry by Justice [[John Vincent Barry]] into the &quot;Morotai Mutiny&quot;, which had involved senior pilots of the [[Australian First Tactical Air Force]] (1TAF) attempting to resign their commissions to protest the relegation of RAAF fighter squadrons to strategically unimportant ground attack missions. Hewitt recommended that the AOC&amp;nbsp;1TAF, Air Commodore [[Arthur Henry Cobby|Harry Cobby]], be removed from command, along with his two senior staff officers. The majority of the Air Board saw no reason to take such action, leaving Hewitt to append a dissenting note to its decision. However, Minister for Air Arthur Drakeford supported Hewitt's position, and the three senior 1TAF officers were later dismissed from their posts by Air Vice Marshal Jones.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cleaning the Augean stables&quot;/&gt;

==Post-war career==
===Demobilisation and rationalisation===
Hewitt's appointment as Air Member for Personnel was made permanent following the end of World War&amp;nbsp;II in August 1945.&lt;ref name=&quot;Helson p.224&quot;/&gt; In this role he was directly responsible for the demobilisation of what had become the world's fourth largest air force, and its transition to a much smaller peacetime service.&lt;ref name=&quot;Helson p.224&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.170&amp;ndash;171&lt;/ref&gt; Hewitt considered that the RAAF was in danger of losing some of its best staff through rapid, unplanned demobilisation, and recommended that its workforce be stabilised for two years at a strength of 20,000 while it reviewed its post-war requirements. Although the Air Board supported Hewitt's proposal, government cost-cutting resulted in the strength of the so-called Interim Air Force remaining lower than planned, being reduced to some 13,000 by October 1946 and under 8,000 by the end of 1948.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.176&amp;ndash;179&lt;/ref&gt; Despite claiming that employing women in the Air Force was an important factor in reducing &quot;antagonism and prejudice&quot; against them in the work force in general, Hewitt also recommended that the WAAAF be disbanded after the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;Going Solo&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.335&lt;/ref&gt; 

As AMP, Hewitt was responsible for reviewing the potential employment of senior officers in the post-war Air Force. This review led to the early retirement of such figures as Air Marshal [[Richard Williams (RAAF officer)|Richard Williams]] and Air Vice Marshals [[Stanley Goble]], [[William Bostock|Bill Bostock]], [[Frank Hubert McNamara|Frank McNamara]], [[William Anderson (RAAF officer)|Bill Anderson]], [[Henry Wrigley]] and [[Adrian Cole (RAAF officer)|Adrian Cole]], ostensibly to make way for the advancement of younger and equally capable officers.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp.22&amp;ndash;24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Helson p.237&quot;&gt;Helson, ''Ten Years at the Top'', pp.234&amp;ndash;239&lt;/ref&gt; Hewitt helped draft the letters to each of the retirees, explaining the reasons for the decision and redundancy payments involved.&lt;ref name=&quot;Helson p.237&quot;/&gt; He also had the &quot;thankless task&quot; of rationalising the ''Air Force List'' of officers and their seniority, which had become a source of numerous irregularities due to the temporary and acting promotions granted during wartime. This resulted in many officers of senior rank being 'demoted' as many as three levels, such as Group Captain to Flight Lieutenant, in the first post-war ''List'' released in June 1947.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp.24&amp;ndash;25&lt;/ref&gt;

===RAAF education and other work===

The central figure in the portrait, facing the camera, has two rows of braid on the visor of his cap, and pilot's wings on the left breast pocket.]]
Hewitt was responsible for initiating major improvements in Air Force education that took place  between 1945 and 1953, playing a key role in the establishment of [[RAAF College]] and the introduction of an apprenticeship training programme. The purpose of the College was, in Hewitt's words, to &quot;sow the seeds of service&quot; for future leaders, helping create a special RAAF ''[[Morale|esprit de corps]]''. He added that it was &quot;almost a truism that the future RAAF can be no better than the Air Force College&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p.186&lt;/ref&gt;  Founded at [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Point Cook Base|Point Cook]] in January 1948, RAAF College's inaugural Commandant was Air Commodore [[Valston Hancock|Val Hancock]], who also drafted its first charter.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp.120&amp;ndash;123&lt;/ref&gt; With the support of the Air Member for Engineering and Maintenance, Air Vice Marshal [[Ellis Wackett]], Hewitt developed the Apprenticeship Training Scheme to raise the standard of technical roles in the Air Force, introducing it with a nationwide publicity campaign to attract recruits. Its base was the Ground Training School, which opened at [[RAAF Base Wagga|Wagga]], New South Wales, in early 1948 to provide education and technical training for youths aged 15&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;17. It was renamed RAAF Technical College in 1950 and then the RAAF School of Technical Training (RSTT) in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp.129&amp;ndash;131&lt;/ref&gt; 

Parallel to his initiatives in Air Force education and training, Hewitt introduced a revised aircrew ranking scheme that consisted of skill categories with various levels, such as navigator level&amp;nbsp;4 or pilot level&amp;nbsp;1, rather than the regular military ranks such as sergeant or flight lieutenant. This was abandoned in 1950 due to dissatisfaction caused by the lack of obvious equivalence between these specialist 'ranks' and the traditional ranking system common to the rest of the RAAF and other defence forces.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp.92&amp;ndash;95&lt;/ref&gt; After completing his term as Air Member for Personnel in 1948, he was posted to London as the Australian Defence Representative.&lt;ref name=&quot;Who's Who in Australia&quot;/&gt; By now promoted Air Vice Marshal, Hewitt was appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] in the 1951 [[New Year Honours]].&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=39105|supp=yes|startpage=36|date=29 December 1950|accessdate=16 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Returning from Britain the same year, he took over as Air Member for Supply and Equipment (AMSE) from Air Vice Marshal [[George Mackinolty]], who had died suddenly of  cancer.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens &amp; Isaacs, ''High Fliers'', pp.104&amp;ndash;107&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Going Solo p.500&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.500&lt;/ref&gt; Hewitt served as AMSE until his retirement from the RAAF in April 1956.&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Going Solo p.500&quot;/&gt; In this role, he again cooperated with Air Vice Marshal Wackett&amp;mdash;now the Air Member for Technical Services&amp;mdash;to introduce the concept of acquiring spare parts based on 'life-of-type', whereby the forecast number and type of spares necessary for an aircraft's projected service life would be ordered when it was first deployed operationally, to reduce support costs and delivery times.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.182&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life and legacy==
Following his retirement from the Air Force in 1956, Hewitt joined [[International Harvester|International Harvester Co. Australia]] as Manager of Education and Training. He became a trustee of the Services Canteen Trust the same year, serving in this position until 1977.
