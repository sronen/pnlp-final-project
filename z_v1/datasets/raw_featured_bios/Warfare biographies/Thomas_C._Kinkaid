'''Thomas Cassin Kinkaid''' (3 April 1888&amp;nbsp;– 17 November 1972) was an [[Admiral (United States)|admiral]] in the [[United States Navy]] during [[World War II]]. He built a reputation as a &quot;fighting admiral&quot; in the aircraft carrier battles of 1942 and commanded the Allied forces in the [[Aleutian Islands Campaign]]. He was Commander Allied Naval Forces and the [[United States Seventh Fleet|Seventh Fleet]] under [[General of the Army (United States)|General of the Army]] [[Douglas MacArthur]] in the [[South West Pacific Area (command)|Southwest Pacific Area]], where he conducted numerous [[Amphibious warfare|amphibious operations]], and commanded an Allied fleet during the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf]], the last [[List of naval battles between battleships|naval battle between battleships]] in history.

Born into a naval family, Kinkaid was ranked in the lower half of his class on his graduation from the [[United States Naval Academy]] in June 1908. His early commissioned service was spent aboard [[battleship]]s. In 1913, he began instruction in ordnance engineering and served in that field for many years. He saw action during [[1916 United States occupation of the Dominican Republic]]. During [[World War I]], he was attached to the [[Royal Navy]] before serving as Gunnery Officer aboard the [[battleship]] {{USS|Arizona|BB-39|6}}. After the war, he was Assistant Chief of Staff to the Commander U.S. Naval Detachment in [[Turkey]]. Kinkaid received his first command, the [[destroyer]] {{USS|Isherwood|DD-284|6}}, in 1924. He was [[Executive Officer]] of the battleship {{USS|Colorado|BB-45|6}} when the [[1933 Long Beach earthquake]] struck, and participated in relief efforts. He received his second command in 1937, the [[heavy cruiser]] {{USS|Indianapolis|CA-35|6}}.

From 1938 to 1941, Kinkaid was a [[Naval Attaché]] in [[Italy]] and [[Yugoslavia]]. In the months prior to U.S. entry into World War II, he commanded a destroyer [[Squadron (naval)|squadron]]. Promoted to [[Rear Admiral (United States)|rear admiral]] in 1941, he assumed command of a [[United States Pacific Fleet|U.S. Pacific Fleet]] cruiser division. His cruisers defended the [[aircraft carrier]] {{USS|Lexington|CV-2|6}} during the [[Battle of the Coral Sea]] and {{USS|Hornet|CV-8|6}} during the [[Battle of Midway]]. After that battle he took command of [[Task Force 16]], a task force built around the carrier {{USS|Enterprise|CV-6|6}}, which he led during the long and difficult [[Solomon Islands campaign]], participating in the [[Battle of the Eastern Solomons|Battles of the Eastern Solomons]] and the [[Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands|Santa Cruz Islands]]. Kinkaid was placed in charge of the North Pacific Force in January 1943 and commanded the [[Aleutian Islands Campaign|operations that regained control of the Aleutian Islands]]. He was promoted to [[Vice Admiral (United States)|vice admiral]] in June 1943.

In November 1943, Kinkaid became Commander Allied Naval Forces [[South West Pacific Area]], and Commander of the [[Seventh Fleet]], directing U.S. and [[Royal Australian Navy]] forces supporting the [[New Guinea campaign]]. During the [[Battle of the Surigao Strait]] he commanded the Allied ships in the last naval battle between battleships in history. Following the demise of Japanese naval power in the region, the Allied navies supported the campaigns in the [[Philippines campaign (1944–45)|Philippines]] and [[Borneo campaign (1945)|Borneo]]. Kinkaid was promoted to [[Admiral (United States)|admiral]] on 3 April 1945. After the [[Pacific War]] ended in August 1945, the Seventh Fleet assisted in operations on the [[Korea]]n and China coasts. Admiral Kinkaid was Commander Eastern Sea Frontier and the [[United States Navy reserve fleets#History|Sixteenth Fleet]] from 1946 until his retirement in May 1950. He was a member of the National Security Training Commission for much of the rest of the decade. He also served with the [[American Battle Monuments Commission]] for 15 years.

==Early life==
Thomas Cassin Kinkaid was born in [[Hanover, New Hampshire]], on 3 April 1888,&lt;ref name=&quot;Ancell and Miller&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Ancell|Miller|1996|p=566}}&lt;/ref&gt; the second child and only son of Thomas Wright Kinkaid, a naval officer, and his wife Virginia Lee née Cassin. At the time, Thomas Wright Kinkaid was on leave from the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] and employed at the [[New Hampshire College of Agriculture and the Mechanic Arts]]. When Thomas was only a year old, his father was posted to the {{USS|Pinta||6}}, and the family moved to [[Sitka, Alaska]], where a third child, Dorothy, was born in 1890. Over the next few years the family successively moved to [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]; [[Norfolk, Virginia]]; [[Annapolis, Maryland]] and [[Georgetown, Washington, D.C.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wheeler|1994|pp=1–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas attended [[Duke Ellington School of the Arts|Western High School]] for three years before entering a [[U.S. Naval Academy]] preparatory school. He sought and secured an appointment to Annapolis from [[President of the United States|President]] [[Theodore Roosevelt]], and was asked to take the admission examination. The Navy was undergoing a period of expansion, and the intake of midshipmen was double that of two years earlier. Of the 350 who took the examination, 283 were admitted. The class was the largest since the Academy had opened in 1845.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wheeler|1994|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kinkaid was admitted to Annapolis as a [[midshipman]] in July 1904. His instructors included four future [[Chief of Naval Operations|Chiefs of Naval Operations]]: [[William S. Benson]], [[William V. Pratt]], [[William D. Leahy]] and [[Ernest J. King]]. In 1905 he took an instructional cruise on {{USS|Nevada|BM-8|6}}. He also spent six weeks on {{USS|Hartford|1858|6}}, his only experience of a warship under sail. In subsequent years, his training cruises were on the {{USS|Newark|C-1|6}} and {{USS|Arkansas|BM-7|6}} which, while much newer, were by this time also obsolete. He participated in sports, particularly in [[Rowing (sport)|rowing]], earning a seat in the Academy′s eight-oar [[racing shell]]. He graduated on 5 June 1908, ranked 136th in his class of 201.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wheeler|1994|pp=4–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early career==
Kinkaid′s first posting was to [[San Francisco]] where he joined the crew of the [[battleship]] {{USS|Nebraska|BB-14|6}}, part of the [[Great White Fleet]]. During the next year, he circumnavigated the globe with the fleet, visiting [[New Zealand]] and [[Australia]]. The fleet returned to its [[home port]] of Norfolk, Virginia in February 1909. In 1910, Kinkaid took his examinations for the rank of [[Ensign (rank)|ensign]] but failed [[navigation]]. While his classmates were promoted in June 1910, Kinkaid remained a midshipman, pending the result of a makeup examination in December 1910. In July, he developed [[pleurisy]] and was hospitalized in [[New York, New York]] before being sent to Annapolis to recuperate. At the time his father was in charge of the [[Naval Engineering Experiment Station, Annapolis, Maryland|Naval Engineering Experiment Station]] there, which allowed Kinkaid to stay with his parents while studying for his navigation examination. In October, he was posted to the battleship {{USS|Minnesota|BB-22|6}} whose skipper, [[Commander (United States)|Commander]] [[William Sims]], an Annapolis classmate of his father′s, encouraged Kinkaid′s early interest in gunnery. Kinkaid passed his navigation examination on 7 December and was promoted to ensign on 14 February 1911, backdated to 6 June 1910. While still at Annapolis, Kinkaid met Helen Sherburne Ross, the daughter of a Philadelphia businessman. The two were married on 24 April 1911 in the Silver Chapel of [[St. Mark's Episcopal Church (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania)|St. Mark′s Episcopal Church in Philadelphia]] in a ceremony attended by a small number of guests. Their marriage produced no children. They enjoyed playing [[contract bridge]] and [[golf]], and Helen was the women′s golf champion for the [[District of Columbia]] in 1921 and 1922.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wheeler|1994|pp=9–16, 28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1913, Kinkaid, now a [[lieutenant (junior grade)]], commenced a course in ordnance at the Naval Academy Postgraduate School. This consisted of four months of classroom instruction followed by tours with the leading naval ordnance manufacturers, and concluded with a tour of duty at the [[Indian Head Naval Proving Ground]]. Students had to undertake to remain in the Navy for at least eight years. After completing the four months in the classroom at Annapolis, Kinkaid commenced a three-month assignment at [[Midvale Steel]], but this was interrupted after two months by the [[United States occupation of Veracruz]]. Kinkaid was ordered to report to the gunboat {{USS|Machias|PG-5|6}} for duty in the [[Caribbean]], during which the ship participated in the [[1916 United States occupation of the Dominican Republic]]. Kinkaid came under fire for the first time when the ship was fired upon from ashore. ''Machias'' replied with its [[M1895 Colt-Browning machine gun|machine guns]]. When one jammed, Kinkaid exposed himself to fire to assist in clearing the weapon. He fired it in response to gunfire against the ship. ''Machias'' returned home in December, and in February Kinkaid resumed his ordnance studies and went to [[Bausch &amp; Lomb]] in [[Rochester, New York]], where he studied the manufacture of spotting and [[fire control system]]s. In March he reported to the [[Washington Navy Yard]], where he wrote a pamphlet on fire control. He also created a design for a [[human torpedo]], but the [[Bureau of Ordnance]] decided that his concept was unsound. He completed his ordnance studies with tours at [[Bethlehem Steel]], the [[Indian Head Naval Proving Ground]] and the [[Sperry Gyroscope Company]] in [[Brooklyn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wheeler|1994|pp=17–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1916, Kinkaid reported to {{USS|Pennsylvania|BB-38|6}}, the navy′s newest battleship, as a gunfire spotter. He was promoted to [[lieutenant]] in January 1917. In November 1917, he was ordered to supervise the delivery of a newly developed {{convert|20|ft|m|adj=on|abbr=on}} [[rangefinder]] from the [[Norfolk Navy Yard]] to the [[Grand Fleet]]. On reaching [[London]], Kinkaid reported to Sims, now a [[Vice admiral (United States)|vice admiral]], who then ordered Kinkaid to deliver secret documents to [[Admiral (United States)|Admiral]] [[William S. Benson]] at a meeting with Allied naval leaders in [[Paris]]. Afterwards, Kinkaid returned to the United Kingdom and tested the rangefinder at {{HMS|Excellent|shore establishment|6}} on [[Whale Island, Hampshire]]. He visited optical works in London, [[York]] and [[Glasgow]] to study the British [[Royal Navy]]′s rangefinders, and the Grand Fleet at its anchorages. On returning to the United States in January 1918, he visited Sperry Gyroscope and Ford Instruments to consult with them on fire control systems. Promoted to [[Lieutenant commander (United States)|lieutenant commander]] in February 1918, he was posted to ''Pennsylvania''′s sister ship, {{USS|Arizona|BB-39|6}}. In May 1919, ''Arizona'' was sent to cover the [[Occupation of İzmir|Greek occupation of Smyrna]]. For his services from September 1918 to July 1919, Kinkaid was recommended for the [[Navy Distinguished Service Medal]], but it was not awarded.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wheeler|1994|pp=22–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Between the wars==
Following the normal pattern of alternating assignments afloat and ashore, Kinkaid was posted to a shore billet as the Chief of the Supply Section of the Bureau of Ordnance in Washington D.C. During this time he published two articles in the [[United States Naval Institute]] magazine ''[[Proceedings (magazine)|Proceedings]]''. The first, on the &quot;Probability and Accuracy of Gun Fire&quot;, was a technical article arguing for more rather than bigger guns on battleships and cruisers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kinkaid|1921|pp=1543–1552}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Washington Naval Conference]] would prevent these ideas from being put into practice, by restricting the number and size of warships and their guns. The second, entitled &quot;Naval Corps, Specialization and Efficiency&quot;, argued for increasing the specializations of line officers rather than creating separate corps of specialists, a more controversial topic at a time when [[naval aviator]]s were agitating for the creation of a new specialist branch of their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kinkaid|1922|pp=1491–1500}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1922, Kinkaid became Assistant Chief of Staff to the Commander U.S. Naval Detachment in [[Turkey|Turkish]] Waters, Rear Admiral [[Mark L. Bristol]]. This tour saw the end of the Greek occupation of Smyrna. The ratification of the [[Treaty of Lausanne]] by Turkey resulted in a draw-down of U.S. naval forces in the region, reducing Bristol′s post to a primarily diplomatic one. In 1924, Kinkaid, whose father had died in August 1920, requested a posting back to the United States owing to his mother′s ill-health. The ship taking him back, the [[light cruiser]] {{USS|Trenton|CL-11|6}}, had to sail by way of [[Iran]] in order to collect the body of Vice Consul [[Robert Imbrie]], who had been killed by an angry mob in [[Tehran]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Wheeler, pp. 29-37&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Wheeler|1994|pp=29–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:USS Indianapolis CA-35.jpg|thumb|USS Indianapolis at Pearl Harbor, c. 1937|alt=A large warship.]]

Kinkaid received his first command, the [[destroyer]] {{USS|Isherwood|DD-284|6}}, on 11 November 1924. Since its home port was the [[Philadelphia Navy Yard]] and ships′ captains did not have to spend their nights on board, Kinkaid was able to live with Helen at her parents′ residence in Philadelphia. In July 1925, he was assigned to the [[Naval Gun Factory]]. He was promoted to [[Commander (United States)|commander]] in June 1926. For the next two years, he served as Fleet Gunnery Officer and Aide to the [[Commander in Chief, U.S. Fleet]], Admiral [[Henry A. Wiley]]. In 1929 and 1930, Kinkaid attended the [[Naval War College]]. This was followed by duty on the [[General Board of the United States Navy|Navy General Board]]. He was then seconded to the [[State Department]] as a Naval Advisor at the [[Geneva Disarmament Conference]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Reynolds|1978|p=180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kinkaid next became [[Executive Officer]] of the {{USS|Colorado|BB-45|6}}, one of the navy's newest battleships, in February 1933.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wheeler|1994|pp=69–72}}&lt;/ref&gt; By coincidence the ship was at anchor in [[Long Beach, California]] when the [[1933 Long Beach earthquake]] struck. Over the next few days thousands of sailors and marines participated in relief activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cherpak|2004|pp=81–83}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kinkaid convinced the captain to allow homeless families of crew members to stay on the ship, and erected tarpaulins on the quayside to create family areas. He sent medical and relief supplies ashore from ''Colorado''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wheeler|1994|pp=78–79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1934, he returned to Washington for a tour of duty with the [[Bureau of Navigation]], in charge of the Officers′ Detail Section. During this time, Kinkaid came up for promotion to [[Captain (United States)|captain]]. Classmates including [[Richmond K. Turner]] and [[Willis A. Lee]] were selected in January 1935, but Kinkaid was passed over for promotion. However, with the help of strong [[United States Navy#Commissioned officer|fitness reports]] from his superiors, Rear Admirals [[William D. Leahy]] and [[Adolphus Andrews]], he was selected in January 1936 and, after passing the required physical and professional examinations, was promoted on 11 January 1937.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wheeler|1994|pp=88–91}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kinkaid was then given his second seagoing command, the heavy cruiser {{USS|Indianapolis|CA-35|6}}. He assumed command from Captain [[Henry K. Hewitt]] on 7 June 1937.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cherpak|2004|p=101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War II==
===Attaché===
Kinkaid hoped his next assignment would be that of [[naval attaché]] to London but the job went to Captain [[Alan G. Kirk]]. Kinkaid was offered and accepted the post in [[Rome]] instead. He took up his posting there in November 1938. In 1939, he was also accredited with the American embassy in [[Belgrade]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wheeler|1994|pp=103–107}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kinkaid reported that Italy was unprepared for war. Only in May 1940 did he warn that Italy was mobilizing. Soon after, he learned from Count [[Galeazzo Ciano]] that Italy would declare war on France and Britain between 10 and 15 June 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wheeler|1994|pp=109, 114–115}}&lt;/ref&gt; He provided accurate reports on the damage inflicted by the British in the [[Battle of Taranto]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wheeler|1994|pp=118–119}}&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to the U.S. in March 1941.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wheeler|1994|p=122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kinkaid now faced the prospect of selection to rear admiral. He knew that captains normally required command experience to be considered, but it was unlikely that a billet as captain of a battleship or cruiser would come up in sufficient time before the next round of selections. He discussed the matter with head of the Officers′ Detail Section at the Bureau of Navigation, Captain [[Arthur S. Carpender]], an Annapolis classmate who had himself recently been selected for flag rank. Carpender came up with a solution: he recommended Kinkaid for command of a destroyer squadron. This was a seagoing command, although Kinkaid was somewhat senior for it.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wheeler|1994|p=124}}&lt;/ref&gt; Good fitness reports as commander of Destroyer Squadron 8, based in Philadelphia, resulted in Kinkaid′s promotion to rear admiral in August 1941, despite having no more than two years′ worth of total command experience. He became the last of his class to be promoted to flag rank before the United States entered the war. No one ranking lower in the class was promoted to flag rank before retirement.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wheeler|1994|pp=131–132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coral Sea and Midway===
[[File:USS Lexington under attack at Coral Sea.jpg|thumb|{{USS|Lexington|CV-2|6}} (center right), afire and under heavy attack, in a photograph taken from a Japanese aircraft|alt=A large ship is surrounded by explosions in the air and water.]]

Kinkaid was ordered to relieve Rear Admiral [[Frank J. Fletcher]] as commander of Cruiser Division 6, consisting of the heavy cruisers {{USS|Astoria|CA-34|6}}, ''Minneapolis'' and ''San Francisco''. This was part of the [[United States Pacific Fleet|U.S. Pacific Fleet]], based at [[Pearl Harbor]]. He did not reach his new command until after the Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], which brought the U.S. into the war. When he reached Hawaii, Kinkaid stayed with his brother-in-law, the [[Commander in Chief]], [[United States Fleet|U.S. Fleet]], Admiral [[Husband E. Kimmel]], who was married to Kinkaid′s sister Dorothy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wheeler|1994|pp=135–138}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kinkaid accompanied Fletcher as an observer during the [[Battle of Wake Island|attempt to relieve Wake Island]], and did not formally assume command of the division until 29 December 1941.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wheeler|1994|p=148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional job of cruisers was scouting and screening, but with the loss of most of the battleships at Pearl Harbor these roles largely passed to the [[aircraft carrier]]s, while the cruisers′ main mission became defending the carriers against air attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wheeler|1994|p=153}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kinkaid's cruisers formed part of Rear Admiral [[Aubrey W. Fitch]]′s [[Task Force 11]], which was built around the carrier {{USS|Lexington|CV-2|6}}. Task Force 11 rendezvoused with Fletcher′s [[Task Force 17]], built around the carrier {{USS|Yorktown|CV-5|6}}, on 1 May 1942. Kinkaid then became commander of the Task Group 17.2, the screening cruisers and destroyers of both carriers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morison|1949|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carrier warfare was in its infancy, and at this stage American carriers neither embarked adequate numbers of fighters, nor skillfully employed what they had. When Task Force 17 was attacked three days later in the [[Battle of the Coral Sea]], the burden of defending the Task Force fell on Kinkaid′s gunners. Their task was complicated by the radical maneuvering of the carriers under attack, which made it impossible for the screen to keep station. Despite the gunners′ best efforts, both carriers were hit, and ''Lexington'' caught fire and sank.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morison|1949|pp=52–56}}&lt;/ref&gt; For his part in the battle, Kinkaid was awarded the [[Navy Distinguished Service Medal]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DSM&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Wheeler|1994|p=265}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kinkaid was detached with the cruisers ''Astoria'', ''Minneapolis'' and ''New Orleans'', and four destroyers on 11 May 1942 and sailed for [[Nouméa]], while Fletcher took the rest of Task Force 17 to [[Tongatapu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lundstrom|1984|pp=279–282}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kinkaid then headed north to join the Vice Admiral [[William F. Halsey]]′s [[Task Force 16]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lundstrom|1976|pp=144–149}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kinkiad's force became part of its screen which was under the command of Rear Admiral [[Raymond A. Spruance]]. Shortly after Task Force 16 returned to Pearl Harbor, Halsey was hospitalized with a severe case of [[dermatitis]] and, on his recommendation, was replaced as commander of Task Force 16 by Spruance. Kinkaid then became commander of the screen, also known as Task Group 16.2.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lundstrom|2006|pp=223–230}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of only four American flag officers present during the subsequent [[Battle of Midway]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wheeler|1994|p=209}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he saw little action, as Task Force 16 did not come under attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wheeler|1994|p=217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Solomon Islands===
After the battle, Spruance became chief of staff to Admiral [[Chester W. Nimitz]], the Commander in Chief, U.S. Pacific Fleet (CINCPAC) and [[Pacific Ocean Areas (command)|Pacific Ocean Areas]] (CINCPOA). In Halsey′s continued absence, Kinkaid became commander of Task Force 16, built around the carrier {{USS|Enterprise|CV-6|6}}, although he was not an [[aviator]], and his experience with carriers had been restricted to commanding their screens at the Battle of the Coral Sea and the Battle of Midway.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lundstrom|2006|pp=302–306}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early July Kinkaid was briefed by Nimitz about plans for a [[Solomon Islands campaign|landing in the Solomon Islands]], codenamed [[Operation Watchtower]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morison|1949|p=268}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this operation, Kinkaid′s Task Force 16 would be one of three carrier task forces under Fletcher′s overall command. To protect his flagship, the ''Enterprise'', Kinkaid had the battleship {{USS|North Carolina|BB-55|6}}, heavy cruiser {{USS|Portland|CA-33|6}}, antiaircraft cruiser {{USS|Atlanta|CL-51|6}}, and five destroyers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morison|1949|p=271}}&lt;/ref&gt; The addition of the new battleship and its twenty [[5&quot;/38 caliber gun|{{convert|5|in|mm|abbr=on}}/38 caliber dual-purpose guns]] greatly strengthened Task Force 16′s antiaircraft defenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wheeler|1994|p=239}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Kinkaid July 1942.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Rear Admiral Thomas C. Kinkaid on board his flagship, {{USS|Enterprise|CV-6|6}}, 22 July 1942.|alt=A man wearing a garrison cap and windbreaker paces on the deck of a ship.]]

The American landing on Guadalcanal evoked a furious reaction from the Japanese, who sent their fleet to reinforce the Japanese garrison on Guadalcanal. Fletcher′s carriers had the mission of protecting the sea lanes to the Solomons.The two carrier forces clashed in the [[Battle of the Eastern Solomons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morison|1948|pp=79–80}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kinkaid disposed his carrier task force in a circular formation, with ''Enterprise'' at the center, the cruisers at 10 and 2 o'clock and the battleship aft at 6 o'clock. This proved to be a mistake. With a top speed of {{convert|27|kn|mph km/h|lk=on|abbr=on}}, the battleship fell behind the carrier when the latter accelerated to {{convert|30|kn|mph km/h|abbr=on}} while under attack, depriving itself of the protection of the battleship′s guns.''Enterprise'' came under direct attack by Japanese fighters, taking three bomb hits that killed 74 of its crew. Extraordinary efforts permitted the carrier to continue operating aircraft,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morison|1948|pp=93–100}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it was forced to return to Pearl Harbor for repairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morison|1948|p=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his report after the battle, Kinkaid recommended that the number of fighters carried by each carrier be further increased.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lundstrom|1994|pp=163–164}}&lt;/ref&gt; For his part in the battle, he was awarded his second Distinguished Service Medal.&lt;ref name=&quot;DSM&quot;/&gt;

Task Force 16 returned to the South Pacific in October 1942, just in time to take part in the decisive action of the campaign, the [[Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands]], when the Japanese Army and Navy made an all-out effort to recapture the airfield of Guadalcanal.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morison|1948|p=189}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to ''Enterprise'', Kinkaid's force included the battleship ''South Dakota'', heavy cruiser ''Portland'', anti-aircraft cruiser ''San Juan'', and eight destroyers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morison|1948|pp=199–205}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fortunately, both ''Enterprise'' and ''South Dakota'' had been fitted with the new [[Bofors 40 mm]] [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft gun]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morison|1948|p=215}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the three early carrier battles, Kinkaid had been a subordinate commander. This time he was in overall command, in charge of Task Force 61, which included both his own Task Force 16 and Rear Admiral [[George D. Murray]]′s Task Force 17, built around the aircraft carrier {{USS|Hornet|CV-8|6}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lundstrom|1994|p=340}}&lt;/ref&gt; The battle unfolded badly. ''Hornet'' was sunk, and ''Enterprise'', ''South Dakota'' and ''San Juan'' were severely damaged.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lundstrom|1994|pp=453–457}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aviators like Murray and [[John H. Towers]] blamed Kinkaid, as a non-aviator, for the loss of the ''Hornet''. It became a black mark on Kinkaid′s record.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lundstrom|1994|pp=286–292}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Japanese had won another tactical victory, but Kinkaid′s carriers had gained the Americans precious time to prepare and reinforce.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morison|1948|p=224}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aleutian Islands===
[[File:Kinkaid May 1943.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Kinkaid as Commander, North Pacific Force, reading in his quarters on Adak, Aleutian Islands, 14 May 1943.|alt=A man wearing a bomber jacket and ski boots sitting in an armchair, reading.]]

On 4 January 1943, Kinkaid became Commander of the North Pacific Force (COMNORPACFOR) following the failure of his predecessor, Rear Admiral [[Robert A. Theobald]], to work harmoniously with the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morison|1951|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Command relationships in the North Pacific were complicated. Naval forces came under Fletcher′s [[Northwestern Sea Frontier]]. The troops in [[Alaska]], including [[Brigadier General (United States)|Brigadier General]] [[William O. Butler]]′s [[Eleventh Air Force]], were commanded by [[Major General (United States)|Major General]] [[Simon B. Buckner, Jr.]], who was answerable to the head of the [[Western Defense Command]], [[Lieutenant General (United States)|Lieutenant General]] [[John L. DeWitt]]. Kinkaid′s command was responsible for coordinating these forces and [[Aleutian Islands Campaign|retaking the Aleutian Islands]] captured by the Japanese.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wheeler|1994|pp=295–206}}&lt;/ref&gt; He found the Army eager to cooperate, but encountered more difficulty with Rear Admiral [[Francis W. Rockwell (admiral)|Francis W. Rockwell]], the commander of the [[Amphibious Force, Pacific Fleet]], and later the [[IX Amphibious Force]]. Rockwell was an Academy classmate of Kinkaid's, who was senior to him in rank, and convinced that he would both plan and command the amphibious phase of the operation rather than Kinkaid.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ancell|Miller|1996|p=604}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kinkaid′s first major decision was to bypass [[Kiska]] in favor of an assault on the less heavily defended [[Attu Island]]. He moved his headquarters to Adak to be with those of Buckner and Butler, and at Buckner′s suggestion established a joint mess where their two staffs ate meals together. However, the amphibious planning was done in [[San Diego]] by Rockwell and his [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine Corps]] advisor, Brigadier General [[Holland M. Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wheeler|1994|pp=300–312}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Battle of Attu]] was only the third American amphibious operation of the war, and was carried through to a costly success under difficult conditions. The slow rate of progress ashore caused Kinkaid to relieve the Army commander, Major General [[Albert E. Brown]] and replace him with Major General [[Eugene M. Landrum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morison|1951|pp=47–51}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1943 Kinkaid was promoted to vice admiral, thereby removing any lingering doubts about who was in charge,&lt;ref name=&quot;Ancell and Miller&quot;/&gt; and awarded his third Distinguished Service Medal.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leary|1988|p=115}}&lt;/ref&gt; He now prepared [[Operation Cottage]], the much larger invasion of Kiska. This was carried out as planned, but the invaders found that the Japanese had already evacuated the islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morison|1951|pp=54–66}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1943, Kinkaid was replaced by Vice Admiral Frank Fletcher.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lundstrom|2006|pp=501–502}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Southwest Pacific===

Two officers lean on the railing, staring off into the distance.]]

In November 1943, Kinkaid replaced Carpender as Commander Allied Naval Forces, [[South West Pacific Area (command)|Southwest Pacific Area]], and the [[Seventh Fleet]], known as &quot;MacArthur′s Navy&quot;. [[General (United States)|General]] [[Douglas MacArthur]] had twice requested Carpender′s relief, and Kinkaid′s record working with the Army in Alaska made him a logical choice. Australian newspapers hailed the appointment of a &quot;fighting admiral&quot;, but neither MacArthur nor the Australian government had been consulted about the appointment, which was made by the Commander in Chief, [[United States Fleet]], Admiral [[Ernest King]]. The was a violation of the international agreement that had established the Southwest Pacific Area. The [[Navy Department]] then announced that the replacement of Carpender with Kinkaid was merely a proposal, and MacArthur and the [[Prime Minister of Australia]], [[John Curtin]], were asked if Kinkaid was acceptable. They agreed that he was.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wheeler|1994|pp=343–344}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his new role, Kinkaid had two masters. As commander of the Seventh Fleet, he was answerable to King; but as Commander Allied Naval Forces, Kinkaid was answerable to MacArthur. Operations were conducted on the basis of &quot;mutual cooperation&quot; rather than &quot;[[unity of command]]&quot;, and relations between the Army and Navy were not good. Kinkaid was not the most senior naval officer in the theater, for the [[Royal Australian Navy]]′s [[Admiral (Royal Navy)|Admiral]] Sir [[Guy Royle]] and the [[Royal Netherlands Navy]]′s Admiral [[Conrad Emil Lambert Helfrich|Conrad Helfrich]] were both senior to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wheeler|1994|pp=346–349}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Daniel E. Barbey.jpg|thumb|left|Kinkaid (right) with Rear Admiral Daniel E. Barbey (left)|alt=Two men sit at a small table. A map is laid out on the table. Its four corners are held down by a small propeller, a glass, and a book.]]

Despite the unpromising relationship with the army, Kinkaid′s most troublesome subordinate was a U.S. Navy officer, as had been the case with Rockwell in the Aleutians. This time, the subordinate was Rear Admiral [[Ralph W. Christie]], the commander of Task Force 71, the Seventh Fleet′s submarines. Christie commonly greeted a returning submarine at the pier and awarded decorations on the spot. This practice bypassed military and naval award boards, and annoyed Kinkaid because confirmation of sinkings was accomplished by [[Ultra]], and news of awards given so quickly could constitute a security breach. Kinkaid gave Christie and his other subordinates orders forbidding pierside awards, and the award of army medals to navy personnel.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Blair|1975|pp=584–585}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1944, Christie accompanied a war patrol on Commander [[Samuel David Dealey|Samuel D. Dealey]]′s submarine {{USS|Harder|SS-257|6}}. Afterward, Christie met with MacArthur and related the events of the war patrol to the general, who decided to award Dealey the [[Distinguished Service Cross (United States)|Distinguished Service Cross]] and Christie the [[Silver Star]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Blair|1975|p=674}}&lt;/ref&gt; When ''Harder'' was lost with Dealey and all hands on its next patrol, Christie recommended Dealey for the [[Medal of Honor]]. Kinkaid turned down the recommendation on the grounds that Dealey had already received the Distinguished Service Cross for the same patrol. Angered, Christie sent a dispatch to Kinkaid in an easily decipherable low-order code that criticized him and urged him to reconsider.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Blair|1975|pp=720–721}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upset by both Christie′s attitude and his losses, which included Dealey and Kinkaid′s nephew, Lieutenant Commander [[Manning Kimmel]] on {{USS|Robalo|SS-273|6}} in July 1944, Kinkaid requested Christie′s relief. On 30 December 1944, Christie was replaced by Captain [[James Fife]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Blair|1975|pp=814–815}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other forces under Kinkaid′s command included the cruisers of Task Force 74 under Rear Admiral [[Victor Crutchley]] and Task Force 75 under [[Russell S. Berkey]], and Task Force 76, the [[VII Amphibious Force]], under Rear Admiral [[Daniel E. Barbey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morison|1953|p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main role of the Seventh Fleet was supporting MacArthur′s drive along the northern coast of [[New Guinea]] with a series of 38 amphibious operations, usually directed by Barbey.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barbey|1969|pp=351–358}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kinkaid accompanied MacArthur for the [[Admiralty Islands campaign|landing in the Admiralty Islands]], where the two men came ashore a few hours after the assault troops.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morison|1950|pp=435–438}}&lt;/ref&gt; With 215 vessels involved, [[Operations Reckless and Persecution]] in April 1944 was the largest operation in New Guinea waters.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morison|1953|p=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was followed in quick succession by four more operations, at [[Battle of Wakde|Wakde]], [[Battle of Biak|Biak]], [[Battle of Noemfoor|Noemfor]] and [[Battle of Sansapor|Sansapor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morison|1953|p=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For MacArthur′s long-awaited return to the Philippines in October 1944, the Seventh Fleet was massively reinforced by Nimitz′s Pacific Fleet. Kinkaid commanded the assault personally, with Barbey′s VII Amphibious Force as Task Force 78, joined by Vice Admiral [[Theodore S. Wilkinson]]′s [[III Amphibious Force]] from the Pacific Fleet as Task Force 79. Kinkaid was also given Rear Admiral [[Jesse B. Oldendorf]]′s Task Force 77.2, a bombardment force built around six old battleships that had survived the attack on Pearl Harbor, and Rear Admiral [[Thomas L. Sprague]]′s Task Force 77.4, a force of [[escort carrier]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morison|1958|pp=415–423}}&lt;/ref&gt; However Vice Admiral [[Marc Mitscher]]′s Task Force 38, the covering force of the fast carriers and battleships, remained part of Admiral Halsey′s [[United States Third Fleet|Third Fleet]], which was not under MacArthur or Kinkaid′s command.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morison|1958|pp=55–59}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Thomas C. Kinkaid;h84675.jpg|thumb|Kinkaid watches landing operations in Lingayen Gulf, Luzon, from the bridge of his flagship, {{USS|Wasatch|AGC-9|6}}, 9 January 1945|alt=Head and shoulders of man wearing a steel helmet.]]

Halsey′s orders, which gave priority to the destruction of the Japanese fleet, led to the most controversial episode of the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf]]. Four Japanese task forces converged on Kinkaid's forces in Leyte Gulf: a carrier task force under Vice Admiral [[Jisaburō Ozawa]], from the north; a force under Vice Admiral [[Takeo Kurita]] through the [[Sibuyan Sea]]; and two task forces commanded by Vice Admirals [[Shōji Nishimura]] and [[Kiyohide Shima]], which approached via the [[Surigao Strait]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morison|1958|p=158}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carrier aircraft from Task Force 38 engaged Kurita in the [[Battle of the Sibuyan Sea]], and forced him to withdraw.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morison|1958|pp=183–189}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a controversial decision, Halsey concluded that Kurita was no longer a threat and headed north after Ozawa′s force but, due to a misunderstanding, Kinkaid believed that Halsey was still guarding the [[San Bernardino Strait]]. Kinkaid deployed all available Seventh Fleet vessels in the Surigao Strait under Oldendorf facing Nishimura and Shima.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morison|1958|pp=193–198}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Battle of the Surigao Strait]] that night, Kinkaid engaged the Japanese with his PT boats, destroyers, cruisers and battleships, and was able to &quot;[[cross the T]]&quot; of the enemy fleet. It was the last occasion in history in which battleships fought each other. The Japanese lost two battleships, {{Ship|Japanese battleship|Yamashiro||2}} and {{Ship|Japanese battleship|Fusō||2}}, and three destroyers; Kinkaid′s Force did not lose a single vessel.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morison|1958|pp=239–241}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the victory was marred when Kurita′s force doubled back and engaged Sprague′s escort carriers in the [[Battle off Samar]] the next day. Oldendorf′s force headed back but Kurita withdrew after sinking an escort carrier, two destroyers and a destroyer escort.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morison|1958|pp=293–296}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the war, Halsey defended his actions in his memoirs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wheeler|1994|pp=458–459}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kinkaid′s position was that: {{quote|Of course it would have been sound practice and better to have an overall commander of naval forces.... However, the Third Fleet and the Seventh Fleet each had an assigned mission which, if fulfilled, would have resulted in the destruction of the Japanese fleet then and there. The question of an overall commander at the scene of action would have been purely academic. Most surely Nimitz′s orders to Halsey did not contemplate the withdrawal of covering forces at the height of battle. &quot;Divided Command&quot; is not the key to what happened at Leyte. &quot;Mission&quot; is the key.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wheeler|1994|p=484}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Following the demise of Japanese naval power in the region, Kinkaid′s Seventh Fleet supported the land campaigns in the [[Philippines]] and the [[Borneo campaign (1945)|Borneo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hoyt|1989|pp=191–198}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kinkaid was promoted to [[Admiral (United States)|admiral]] on 3 April 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wheeler|1994|pp=427–428}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Pacific War]] ended in August 1945, the Seventh Fleet assisted in landing troops in [[Korea]] and northern [[China]] to occupy these areas and repatriate Allied prisoners of war. Kinkaid elected not to land troops at [[Chefoo]] as originally instructed because the city was in the hands of the Communist [[Eighth Route Army]]; [[Tsingtao]] was substituted instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Frank|Shaw|1968|pp=555–558}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded the [[Legion of Merit]] by the theater commander in China, Lieutenant General [[Albert C. Wedemeyer]], and the [[List of orders, decorations and medals of the Republic of China|Grand Cordon of the Order of Precious Tripod]] by the Chinese government.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wheeler|1994|pp=455–457}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
Kinkaid returned to the United States to replace Vice Admiral [[Herbert F. Leary]] as Commander [[Eastern Sea Frontier]] and Commander [[Atlantic Reserve Fleet|Sixteenth Fleet]], making his home in the historic [[Quarters A, Brooklyn Navy Yard]]. He served on a board chaired by [[Fleet Admiral (United States)|Fleet Admiral]] Halsey which also included Admirals Spruance, Towers and Vice Admiral [[Marc Mitscher]], whose task was to nominate 50 of the 215 serving rear admirals for early retirement.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wheeler|1994|pp=449–452}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kinkaid was soon facing this fate himself, when the [[House Armed Services Committee]] sought to reduce the number of [[four-star rank]] officers in 1947. Kinkaid was one of three admirals, the others being Spruance and Hewitt, who would have to retire or be reduced in rank to rear admiral. After some lobbying, this was averted, and they were permitted to remain in the grade until 1 July 1950, past Kinkaid′s retirement age. Retirement ceremonies, including a parade through [[New York City]], were held on 28 April 1950 and Kinkaid formally retired two days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wheeler|1994|pp=462–469}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1946, it was announced that Halsey, Spruance and Turner had been awarded the [[Distinguished Service Medal (Army)|Army Distinguished Service Medal]]. A message soon arrived from MacArthur stating that he could not see why Kinkaid should not merit the same award, which had been recommended by Krueger during the war. The medal was duly presented by General [[Courtney Hodges]] in a ceremony on [[Governors Island]] on 10 April 1947.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wheeler, pp. 456-457&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Wheeler|1994|pp=456–457}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Australian government chose to honor Kinkaid with an honorary [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]], which was presented by the Ambassador at a ceremony at the embassy in Washington on [[Australia Day]], 26 January 1948.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/AWM192/00303/003030845.pdf |publisher=[[Australian War Memorial]]|accessdate=3 May 2010|title=Honours and Awards – Thomas C Kinkaid}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kinkaid had already been created Grand Officer of the [[Order of Orange-Nassau]] by Queen [[Wilhelmina of the Netherlands]] in 1944. In March 1948, he was made a Grand Officer of the [[Order of Leopold (Belgium)|Order of Leopold]] and presented with the [[Croix de guerre]] with Palm in a ceremony at the Belgian embassy in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wheeler, pp. 456-457&quot;/&gt;

He served as the naval representative with the [[National Security Training Commission]] from 1951 until it was abolished in 1957. He also served with the [[American Battle Monuments Commission]] for fifteen years, beginning in 1953. In this capacity, he attended the dedication of the [[Cambridge American Cemetery and Memorial]], [[Brittany American Cemetery and Memorial]], [[Rhone American Cemetery and Memorial]], [[Manila American Cemetery and Memorial]] and the [[East Coast Memorial]]. He also paid a visit to Australia and New Zealand in 1951. Until 1961, he attended the annual reunions held to celebrate General MacArthur's birthday, 26 January, joining MacArthur and his old colleagues, including Krueger and Kenney. Kinkaid died at [[Bethesda Naval Hospital]] on 17 November 1972 and was buried with military honors at [[Arlington National Cemetery]] on 21 November. The Navy decided to name a {{sclass|Spruance|destroyer}} after him. The {{USS|Kinkaid|DD-965|6}} was launched by his widow Helen at the [[Ingalls Shipbuilding]] Division of [[Litton Industries]] at [[Pascagoula, Mississippi]] on 1 June 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wheeler|1994|pp=473–488}}&lt;/ref&gt;
