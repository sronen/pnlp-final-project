'''William Ellis (Bill) Newton''' [[Victoria Cross|VC]] (8&amp;nbsp;June 1919 – 29&amp;nbsp;March 1943) was an [[List of Australian Victoria Cross recipients|Australian recipient]] of the [[Victoria Cross]], the highest decoration for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to a member of the [[United Kingdom|British]] and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] armed forces. He was honoured for his actions as a bomber pilot in [[Papua New Guinea]] during March 1943 when, despite intense anti-aircraft fire, he pressed home a series of attacks on the [[Salamaua|Salamaua Isthmus]], the last of which saw him forced to [[Water landing|ditch]] his aircraft in the sea. Newton was still officially posted as missing when the award was made in October 1943. It later emerged that he had been taken captive by the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]], and executed by [[beheading]] on 29&amp;nbsp;March.

Raised in [[Melbourne]], Newton excelled at sport, playing cricket at youth state level. He joined the [[Australian Army Reserve|militia]] in 1938, and enlisted in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) in February 1940. Described as having the dash of &quot;an [[Errol Flynn]] or a [[Keith Miller]]&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Macklin&quot;&gt;Macklin, ''Bravest'', pp. 195–197&lt;/ref&gt; Newton  served as a [[Flight instructor|flying instructor]] in Australia before being posted to [[No. 22 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;22 Squadron]], which began operating [[A-20 Havoc|Boston]] light bombers in New Guinea late in 1942. Having just taken part in the [[Battle of the Bismarck Sea]], he was on his fifty-second mission when he was shot down and captured. Newton was the only Australian airman to receive a Victoria Cross for action in the [[South West Pacific theatre of World War II]], and the sole Australian to be so decorated while flying with an RAAF squadron.

==Family, education and sport==
Born in the [[Melbourne]] suburb of [[St Kilda, Victoria|St Kilda]] on 8 June 1919, Bill Newton was the youngest child of dentist Charles Ellis Newton and his second wife Minnie.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;&gt;[http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A150546b.htm Newton, William Ellis (Bill) (1919–1943)] at [[Australian Dictionary of Biography]].

Bill entered [[Melbourne Grammar School]] in 1929, but two years later switched to the nearby St Kilda Park Central School as the family income was reduced through the impact of the [[Great Depression]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Weate&quot;/&gt; In 1934, aged fifteen, he was able to return to Melbourne Grammar where, despite struggling with his schoolwork, he completed his [[Intermediate Certificate]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weate, ''Bill Newton VC'', p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; He gave up further study when his father died suddenly of a heart attack at the age of fifty-one, and began working in a silk warehouse.&lt;ref&gt;Weate, ''Bill Newton VC'', p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Page&quot;&gt;Page, ''Wings of Destiny'', pp. 141–142,151&lt;/ref&gt; 

Considered while at school to be a future leader in the community, Newton was also a talented all-round sportsman, playing [[cricket]], [[Australian rules football]], [[golf]] and [[water polo]].&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;&gt;Stephens; Isaacs, ''High Fliers'', pp. 88–90&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/32.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', p. 699]&lt;/ref&gt; A [[fast bowling|fast bowler]] in cricket, he was friends with [[Keith Miller]], and collected the [[Cricket Victoria|Victorian Cricket Association]] (VCA) [[VCA Colts cricket team|Colts]] bowling trophy for 1937–38, while Miller collected the equivalent batting prize.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, ''Miller's Luck'', pp. 30–31&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1938, Newton dismissed [[Test cricket|Test]] batsman [[Bill Ponsford]]—still the only Australian to twice score 400 in a [[first-class cricket|first-class innings]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://stats.cricinfo.com/ci/content/records/94177.html First-class matches: Most runs in an innings] at [http://www.cricinfo.com/ Cricinfo].

==Early career==
Newton had been a [[sergeant]] in his [[Australian Army Cadets|cadet corps]] at school, and joined the [[Citizens Military Force|militia]] on 28&amp;nbsp;November 1938, serving as a [[Private (rank)|private]] in the machine-gun section of the [[6th Battalion (Australia)#Inter war years|6th Battalion, Royal Melbourne Regiment]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Staunton&quot;&gt;Staunton, ''Victoria Cross'', pp. 253–255&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weate, ''Bill Newton VC'', p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;  Still employed in the silk warehouse when World War II broke out in September 1939, he resigned to join the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) on 5&amp;nbsp;February 1940.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AWM Timeline&quot;&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/people/timeLine_658.asp Flight Lieutenant William Ellis Newton, VC: Timeline] at [[Australian War Memorial]].

[[File:IR001Newton.JPG|thumb|left|280px|Newton relaxing at Wagga in 1941|alt=Informal outdoor portrait of dark-haired moustachioed man in suit leaning on fence, flanked by two dark-haired women]]
Newton undertook his initial training with No.&amp;nbsp;1 Elementary Flying Training School in [[Parafield Airport|Parafield]], South Australia, flying [[De Havilland Tiger Moth]]s, and with [[No. 21 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;21 (City of Melbourne) Squadron]] at [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Laverton Base|RAAF Station Laverton]], Victoria, flying [[CAC Wirraway]]s. He was awarded his [[Aircrew brevet|wings]] and commissioned as a [[Pilot Officer]] on 28&amp;nbsp;June 1940. Following advanced training on [[Avro Anson]]s with [[No. 1 Flying Training School RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Service Flying Training School]] at [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Point Cook Base|RAAF Station Point Cook]] in September, he was selected to become a [[flight instructor]]. He completed the requisite course at [[Central Flying School RAAF|Central Flying School]], [[Camden, New South Wales|Camden]], New South Wales, and was promoted to [[Flying Officer]] on 28&amp;nbsp;December.&lt;ref name=&quot;Staunton&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Weate pp. 19-22&quot;&gt;Weate, ''Bill Newton VC'', pp. 19–22&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently began training students under the [[British Commonwealth Air Training Plan|Empire Air Training Scheme]] at [[No. 2 Service Flying Training School RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;2 Service Flying Training School]] near [[RAAF Base Wagga|Wagga Wagga]], commanded by Group Captain [[Frederick Scherger]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Weate pp. 19-22&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowyer&quot;&gt;Bowyer, ''For Valour'', pp. 306–312&lt;/ref&gt; 

In October 1941, Newton transferred to [[No. 5 Service Flying Training School RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;5 Service Flying Training School]] at [[Uranquinty]]. He found instruction frustrating, as he longed for a combat assignment. His fortunes changed in February 1942, when he was selected for the navigation course on Ansons at the General Reconnaissance School based at Laverton. From there he was sent to [[No. 1 Operational Training Unit RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Operational Training Unit]] at [[Sale, Victoria|Sale]], Victoria for conversion to [[Lockheed Hudson]] twin-engined light bombers during March and April.&lt;ref&gt;Weate, ''Bill Newton'' VC, pp. 26–28&lt;/ref&gt; 

Raised to [[Flight Lieutenant]] on 1&amp;nbsp;April 1942, Newton was posted the following month to [[No. 22 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;22 (City of Sydney) Squadron]], based at [[RAAF Base Richmond|RAAF Station Richmond]], New South Wales.&lt;ref name=&quot;Page&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Staunton&quot;/&gt; Previously equipped with Hudsons, the unit had just begun converting to the more advanced [[A-20 Havoc|Douglas Boston]] when Newton arrived.

==New Guinea campaign==
Newton undertook the first of his fifty-two operational [[sortie]]s on 1&amp;nbsp;January 1943, under the leadership of his Commanding Officer, [[Squadron Leader]] Keith Hampshire. During February, Newton flew low-level missions through [[monsoon]] conditions and hazardous mountain terrain, attacking Japanese forces ranged against Allied troops in the [[Morobe Province|Morobe]] province.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilson&quot;&gt;Wilson, ''The Brotherhood of Airmen'', pp. 125–127&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weakes, ''Bill Newton VC'', pp. 40–42&lt;/ref&gt; In early March, he took part in the [[Battle of the Bismarck Sea]], one of the key engagements in the [[South West Pacific theatre of World War II|South West Pacific theatre]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp. 164-167&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 164–167&lt;/ref&gt; bombing and strafing [[Lae]] airfield to prevent its force of enemy fighters taking off to intercept Allied aircraft attacking the Japanese fleet.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilson&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wilson|first=David|url=http://defence.gov.au/news/raafnews/editions/4503/history/story01.htm |title=A brave and determined man|journal=Air Force News, Vol. 45, No. 3|date=13 May 2003|accessdate=on 20 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newton gained a reputation for driving straight at his targets without evasive manoeuvre, and always leaving them in flames; this earned him the nickname &quot;The Firebug&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; The Japanese gunners, however, reportedly knew him as &quot;Blue Cap&quot;, from his habit of wearing an old blue cricket cap on operations. In spite of the hazards of the air war in New Guinea, he was quoted as saying, &quot;The troops on the ground should get two medals each, before any airman gets one&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Page, ''Wings of Destiny'', pp. 186,197,229&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attacks on Salamaua===
[[File:AC0031Boston.jpg|thumb|right|280px|Douglas Bostons of No. 22 Squadron over New Guinea, c. 1942–43|alt=Three twin-engined military aircraft flying low above a valley]]

On 16 March 1943, Newton led a sortie on the [[Salamaua|Salamaua Isthmus]] in which his Boston was hit repeatedly by Japanese anti-aircraft fire, damaging fuselage, wings, fuel tanks and undercarriage. In spite of this he continued his attack and dropped his bombs at low level on buildings, ammunition dumps and fuel stores, returning for a second pass at the target in order to strafe it with machine-gun fire.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilson&quot;/&gt; Newton managed to get his crippled machine back to base, where it was found to be marked with ninety-eight bullet holes.&lt;ref&gt;Weate, ''Bill Newton VC'', pp. 58–61&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later, he and his two-man crew made a further attack on Salamaua with five other Bostons. As he bombed his designated target, Newton's plane was seen to burst into flames, raked by cannon fire from the ground.&lt;ref name=&quot;Macklin&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weate, ''Bill Newton VC'', p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; Attempting to keep his aircraft aloft as long as possible to get his crew away from enemy lines, he was able to [[Water landing|ditch]] in the sea approximately {{convert|1000|yd|m}} offshore.&lt;ref name=&quot;Macklin&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;

The Boston's [[navigator]], Sergeant Basil Eastwood, was killed in the forced landing but Newton and his [[radio operator|wireless operator]], [[Flight Sergeant]] John Lyon, survived and managed to swim ashore.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilson&quot;/&gt; Several of the other aircraft in the flight circled the area; one returned to base straight away to inform Hampshire, and the remainder were later forced to depart through lack of fuel. Newton and Lyon originally made their way inland with the help of natives, aiming to contact an Australian [[Coastwatchers|Coastwatcher]], but subsequently returned to the coast. There they were captured by a Japanese patrol of No.&amp;nbsp;5 Special Naval Landing Force.&lt;ref name=&quot;AWM Timeline&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Weate pp. 64-65&quot;&gt;Weate, ''Bill Newton VC'', pp. 64–65&lt;/ref&gt; The two airmen were taken to Salamaua and interrogated until 20&amp;nbsp;March, before being moved to Lae where Lyon was [[bayonet]]ed to death on the orders of [[Rear Admiral]] Ruitaro Fujita, the senior Japanese commander in the area.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilson&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wigmore&quot;&gt;Wigmore et al., ''They Dared Mightily'', pp. 163–164&lt;/ref&gt; Newton was brought back to Salamaua where, on 29&amp;nbsp;March 1943, he was ceremonially beheaded with a [[Katana|Samurai sword]] by [[Sub-Lieutenant]] Uichi Komai, the naval officer who had captured him.&lt;ref name=&quot;Macklin&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowyer&quot;/&gt; Komai was killed in the [[Philippines]] soon after, and Fujita committed suicide at the end of the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowyer&quot;/&gt;

===Revelations and reactions===
It was initially believed that Newton had failed to escape from the Boston after it ditched into the sea, and he was posted as missing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Macklin&quot;/&gt; Squadron Leader Hampshire had  immediately dispatched a sortie to recover the pair that were last seen swimming for shore, but no sign of them was found. Two weeks later, he wrote a letter to Newton's mother in which he described her son's courage and expressed the hope that he might yet be found alive. Hampshire concluded, &quot;Bill is one of those rare fellows I shall miss for a long time, and if it is to be, remember for an age&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weate pp. 64-65&quot;/&gt; The details of his capture and execution were only revealed later that year in a diary found on a Japanese soldier. Newton was not specifically named, but circumstantial evidence clearly identified him, as the diary entry recorded the beheading of an Australian Flight Lieutenant who had been shot down by anti-aircraft fire on 18&amp;nbsp;March 1943 while flying a Douglas aircraft.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison&quot;/&gt; The Japanese observer described the prisoner as &quot;composed&quot; in the face of his impending execution, and &quot;unshaken to the last&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp. 164-167&quot;/&gt; After the decapitation, a seaman slashed open the dead man's stomach, declaring &quot;Something for the other day. Take that.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Page, ''Wings of Destiny'', p. 283&lt;/ref&gt;  

General Headquarters South West Pacific Area, however, while releasing details of the execution on 5 October, initially refused to name Newton. Aside from the lack of absolute certainty as to identification, Air Vice Marshal [[William Bostock|Bill Bostock]], Air Officer Commanding [[RAAF Command]], contended that naming him would change the impact of the news upon Newton's fellow No.&amp;nbsp;22 Squadron members &quot;from the impersonal to the closely personal&quot; and hence &quot;seriously affect morale&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison&quot;/&gt; News of the atrocity provoked shock in Australia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp. 164-167&quot;/&gt; In an attempt to alleviate anxiety among the families of other missing airmen, the Federal government announced on 12&amp;nbsp;October that the relatives of the slain man had been informed of his death.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison&quot;/&gt;

===Victoria Cross===
Newton was awarded the [[Victoria Cross]] for his actions on 16–18 March, becoming the only Australian airman to earn the decoration in the South West Pacific theatre of World War&amp;nbsp;II, and the only one while flying with an RAAF squadron.&lt;ref name=&quot;Staunton&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp. 164-167&quot;/&gt; The citation, which incorrectly implied that he was shot down on 17&amp;nbsp;March rather than the following day, and as having failed to escape from his sinking aircraft, was promulgated in the ''[[London Gazette]]'' on 19&amp;nbsp;October 1943:&lt;ref name=&quot;Staunton&quot;/&gt;

{{quote|''Air Ministry, 19th October, 1943.''

The KING has been graciously pleased, on the advice of Australian Ministers, to confer the
VICTORIA CROSS on the undermentioned officer in recognition of most conspicuous bravery: —

Flight Lieutenant William Ellis NEWTON (Aus. 748), Royal Australian Air Force, No. 22 (R.A.A.F.) Squadron (missing).

Flight Lieutenant Newton served with No. 22 Squadron, Royal Australian Air Force, in New Guinea from May, 1942, to March, 1943, and completed 52 operational sorties.

Throughout, he displayed great courage and an iron determination to inflict the utmost damage on the enemy. His splendid offensive flying and fighting were attended with brilliant success.
Disdaining evasive tactics when under the heaviest fire, he always went straight to his objectives. He carried out many daring machine-gun attacks on enemy positions involving low-flying over long distances in the face of continuous fire at point-blank range.

On three occasions, he dived through intense anti-aircraft fire to release his bombs on important targets on the Salamaua Isthmus. On one of these occasions, his starboard engine failed over the target, but he succeeded in flying back to an airfield 160 miles away.
When leading an attack on an objective on 16th March, 1943, he dived through intense and accurate shell fire and his aircraft was hit repeatedly. Nevertheless, he held to his course and bombed his target from a low level. The attack resulted in the destruction of many buildings and dumps, including two 40,000-gallon fuel installations. Although his aircraft was crippled, with fuselage and wing sections torn, petrol tanks pierced, main-planes and engines seriously damaged, and one of the main tyres flat, Flight Lieutenant Newton managed to fly it back to base and make a successful landing.

Despite this harassing experience, he returned next day to the same locality. His target, this time a single building, was even more difficult but he again attacked with his usual courage and resolution, flying a steady course through a barrage of fire. He scored a hit on the building but at the same moment his aircraft burst into flames.

Flight Lieutenant Newton maintained control and calmly turned his aircraft away and flew along the shore. He saw it as his duty to keep the aircraft in the air as long as he could so as to take his crew as far away as possible from the enemy's positions. With great skill, he brought his blazing aircraft down on the water. Two members of the crew were able to extricate themselves and were seen swimming to the shore, but the gallant pilot is missing. According to
other air crews who witnessed the occurrence, his escape-hatch was not opened and his dinghy was not inflated. Without regard to his own safety, he had done all that man could do to prevent his crew from falling into enemy hands.

Flight Lieutenant Newton's many examples of conspicuous bravery have rarely been equalled and will serve as a shining inspiration to all who follow him.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=36215|supp=yes|startpage=4617|date=15 October 1943|accessdate=27 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
