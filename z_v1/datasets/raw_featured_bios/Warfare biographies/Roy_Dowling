[[Vice Admiral (Australia)|Vice Admiral]] '''Sir Roy Russell Dowling''' [[Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order|KCVO]], [[Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire|KBE]], [[Companion of the Order of the Bath|CB]], [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]] (28&amp;nbsp; May 1901 &amp;ndash; 15&amp;nbsp;April 1969) was a senior commander in the [[Royal Australian Navy]] (RAN). He served as [[Chief of Navy (Australia)|Chief of Naval Staff]] (CNS), the RAN's highest-ranking position, from 1955 until 1959, and as Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee (COSC), forerunner of the role of Australia's [[Chief of the Defence Force (Australia)|Chief of the Defence Force]], from 1959 until 1961.

Born in northern [[New South Wales]], Dowling entered the [[HMAS Creswell|Royal Australian Naval College]] in 1915. After graduating in 1919 he went to sea aboard various [[Royal Navy]] and RAN vessels, and later specialised in gunnery. In 1937, he was given command of the sloop {{HMAS|Swan|U74|6}}. Following the outbreak of World War&amp;nbsp;II, he saw action in the [[Mediterranean, Middle East and African theatres of World War II|Mediterranean theatre]] as [[Executive officer#Military|executive officer]] of the Royal Navy cruiser {{HMS|Naiad|93|6}}, and survived her sinking by a German [[U-boat]] in March 1942. Returning to Australia, he served as Director of Plans and later Deputy Chief of Naval Staff before taking command of the light cruiser {{HMAS|Hobart|D63|6}} in November 1944. His achievements in the [[South West Pacific theatre of World War II|South West Pacific]] earned him the [[Distinguished Service Order]].  
 
Dowling took command of the RAN's first [[aircraft carrier]], {{HMAS|Sydney|R17|6}}, in 1948. He became Chief of Naval Personnel in 1950, and [[Commander Australian Fleet|Flag Officer Commanding HM Australian Fleet]] in 1953. Soon after taking up the position of CNS in February 1955, he was promoted to vice admiral and appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]]. As CNS he had to deal with shortages of money, manpower and equipment, and with the increasing role of the United States in Australia's defence planning, at the expense of traditional ties with Britain. [[Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire|Knighted]] in 1957, Dowling was Chairman of COSC from March 1959 until May 1961, when he retired from the military. In 1963 he was appointed a [[Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order]] and became Australian Secretary to [[Elizabeth II|HM Queen Elizabeth II]], serving until his death in 1969.

==Pre-war career==
Roy Russell Dowling was born on 28&amp;nbsp;May 1901 in Condong, a township on the [[Tweed River (New South Wales)|Tweed River]] in northern New South Wales. His parents were sugar cane inspector Russell Dowling and his wife Lily. The youth entered the [[Royal Australian Naval College]] (RANC) at [[Jervis Bay]], [[Australian Capital Territory|Federal Capital Territory]], in 1915. An underachiever academically, he excelled at sports, and became chief cadet captain before graduating in 1918 with the King's Medal, awarded for &quot;gentlemanly bearing, character, good influence among his fellows and officer-like qualities&quot;.&lt;ref name=adb&gt;[http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A140028b.htm Dowling, Sir Roy Russell] at [[Australian Dictionary of Biography]].

After his return to Australia in December 1926, Dowling spent eighteen months on {{HMAS|Platypus|1917|6}} and {{HMAS|Anzac|1917|6}}, where he continued to specialise in gunnery. In July 1928, he took on an instructional role at the gunnery school in [[HMAS Cerberus (naval base)|Flinders Naval Depot]] on [[Western Port Bay]], Victoria.

==World War II==
Dowling became [[Executive officer#Military|executive officer]] on HMS ''Naiad'' when the ship was commissioned in 1940. Following service with the British [[Home Fleet]], the cruiser transferred to the [[Mediterranean Fleet|Mediterranean Station]] in May 1941, where she took part in the [[Battle of Crete]].&lt;ref name=adb/&gt;&lt;ref name=Legge&gt;Legge, Whos Who in Australia 1968, p. 261&lt;/ref&gt; She was involved in action against German [[torpedo boat]]s on the night of 20&amp;ndash;21 May.

Dowling joined the Australian contingent at the [[surrender of Japan]] in Tokyo Bay on 2&amp;nbsp;September 1945. Following the cessation of hostilities, ''Hobart'' became flagship of HM Australian Squadron, and Dowling flag captain and chief of staff to Commodore [[John Augustine Collins|John Collins]], the squadron commander.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Commonwealth of Australia (Navy Office)|date=| title=The Navy List (October 1945)| location=Melbourne| url=http://www.navy.gov.au/w/images/Navy_List-October-1945.pdf|pages=8, 12|accessdate=on 30 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The war had taken a toll on Dowling's health, however, and he required leave before commencing his next appointment in May 1946 as Director of Ordnance, Torpedoes and Mines at the Navy Office.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt;&lt;ref name=ranc/&gt; Rear Admiral [[James Goldrick]], in the ''[[Australian Dictionary of Biography]]'', observed that Dowling &quot;was thrust into the highest positions of the R.A.N. largely as a result of the heavy casualties of World War&amp;nbsp;II&quot;. When John Armstrong&amp;mdash;the only similarly qualified and more senior Navy captain&amp;mdash;was pronounced unfit for seagoing duty, Dowling was given the chance to command Australia's first aircraft carrier, {{HMAS|Sydney|R17|6}}, commissioned in England on 16&amp;nbsp;December 1948. In April the following year, two months after the ship's belated acceptance into service due to teething troubles, Dowling embarked ''Sydney'' for Australia with two squadrons of fighters aboard.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.navy.gov.au/HMAS_Sydney_(III) HMAS Sydney (III)] at Royal Australian Navy.

His term coincided with the outbreak of the [[Korean War]], and resultant increased demands on manpower.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dennis/&gt; Dowling was appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (CBE) in the 1953 [[New Year Honours]], before travelling to London to attend the [[Royal College of Defence Studies|Imperial Defence College]].&lt;ref name=Dennis/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=39734|supp=yes|startpage=39|date=1 January 1953|accessdate=on 30 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Raised to [[rear admiral]] in July 1953, he returned home to take up the post of [[Commander Australian Fleet|Flag Officer Commanding HM Australian Fleet]] that December, serving through the following year.

On 24&amp;nbsp;February 1955, Dowling succeeded Vice Admiral Sir John Collins as [[Chief of Navy (Australia)|First Naval Member, Australian Commonwealth Naval Board, and Chief of Naval Staff]] (CNS).&lt;ref name=RAN&gt;Stevens, ''The Royal Australian Navy'', pp. 310&amp;ndash;312&lt;/ref&gt; He was promoted to [[vice admiral]] on 7&amp;nbsp;June, and appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] (CB) in the [[Queen's Birthday Honours]] two days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Commonwealth of Australia (Navy Office)|date=| title=The Navy List (July 1955)| location=Melbourne| url=http://www.navy.gov.au/w/images/Navy_List-July-1955.pdf|page=20|accessdate=on 30 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=40498|supp=yes|startpage=3297|date=9 June 1955|accessdate=on 30 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 June, he joined fellow chiefs of staff Lieutenant General [[Henry Wells (general)|Henry Wells]] and Air Marshal [[John McCauley]], Prime Minister [[Robert Menzies]], and senior government members in approving a draft directive for the role of the [[Far East Strategic Reserve]] (FESR); this made Commonwealth forces available for the fight against [[Malayan Emergency|communist insurgents in Malaya]], as well as for the security of Malaya and [[Singapore]] against external aggression.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, ''Crises and Commitments'', pp. 174&amp;ndash;175&lt;/ref&gt; The Navy's contribution to the FESR was to be at least two destroyers or frigates on an ongoing basis, as a well as a yearly visit by an aircraft carrier. The destroyers {{HMAS|Arunta|I30|6}} and {{HMAS|Warramunga|I44|6}}, already in the region on an exercise, were immediately committed, and Dowling flew to Singapore to personally announce the plan and the reasons for it to the ships' crews.&lt;ref&gt;Pfennigwerth, ''Tiger Territory'', pp. 56&amp;ndash;58, 75&lt;/ref&gt; 

Dowling was an early advocate for the establishment of an Australian submarine fleet; it was not until 1963 however, after several false starts, that the first of six [[Oberon class submarine|''Oberon'' class submarine]]s were ordered.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dennis et al., ''Oxford Companion to Australian Military History'', p. 399&lt;/ref&gt;  As part of a general Western trend that viewed with alarm the increasing capability of the [[Soviet Navy]]'s surface fleet, Dowling also worked to improve the offensive power of the [[Fleet Air Arm (RAN)|Fleet Air Arm]]. In March 1956, he went so far as proposing purchase of nuclear weaponry for the RAN's [[De Havilland Sea Venom]]s. During much of Dowling's remaining time as CNS, faced with the obsolescence of HMAS ''Sydney'' and in accordance with its two-carrier policy, the Navy tried unsuccessfully to acquire a new and larger aircraft carrier to augment {{HMAS|Melbourne|R21|6}}.&lt;ref&gt;Stevens, ''The Royal Australian Navy'', pp. 186&amp;ndash;187&lt;/ref&gt; Believing in the maintenance of traditionally close ties between the RAN and the Royal Navy, he worked to coordinate his policies as CNS with those of Britain's [[First Sea Lord]], [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Earl Mountbatten]].&lt;ref name=adb/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dennis/&gt; Taking into account the provisions of the [[ANZUS]] treaty and the absence of suitable supplies from Britain, however, the RAN began to turn reluctantly towards the United States in terms of strategy and equipment,&lt;ref name=Dennis/&gt; as Dowling explained to Mountbatten:

[[File:An014908Dowling&amp;Son1952.jpg|thumb|left|Commodore Dowling congratulates his son Tony on graduating from RANC, 1952|alt=Two men in full winter naval uniform, shaking hands]]
{{quote|We now find ourselves at the crossroads because we very much doubt whether the United Kingdom can provide us with what we want in the future. We have no wish to become Americans but there is a strong belief in this country that the sensible course of action for Australians is to acquire war equipment from the United States now. Our very telling reason is of course that, certainly in a global war, our salvation in the Pacific will depend chiefly on the aid of that country. For that we are not less loyal members of the Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Frame, ''No Pleasure Cruise'', pp. 219&amp;ndash;220&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Other issues facing the RAN during Dowling's term as CNS were its relegation&amp;mdash;since the beginning of the 1950s&amp;mdash;to third place behind the other armed forces in terms of Federal budget allocations, its replacement by the RAAF as the country's first line of defence, and a shortage of manpower. Dowling himself considered &quot;separation from families, lack of houses, over employment, high wages and overtime payment in civvie street&quot; as the causes for the Navy's inability to attract and retain personnel; the Allison Report in 1958 resulted in various improvements to service conditions, which helped reduce wastage.&lt;ref&gt;Stevens, ''The Royal Australian Navy'', pp. 189, 194&lt;/ref&gt; The RANC had moved to Flinders Naval Depot in 1930, and Dowling was pleased to be able to oversee its return to Jervis Bay in 1958, the year before he relocated the office of the CNS to Canberra.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.navy.gov.au/HMAS_Creswell HMAS ''Creswell''] at Royal Australian Navy.
