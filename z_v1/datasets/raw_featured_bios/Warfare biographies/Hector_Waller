'''Hector Macdonald Laws (Hec) Waller''', [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]] and [[Medal bar|Bar]] (4 April 1900&amp;nbsp;– 1 March 1942) was a senior officer in the [[Royal Australian Navy]] (RAN). In a career spanning almost thirty years, he served in both world wars. At the helm of [[HMAS Stuart (D00)|HMAS ''Stuart'']] in the [[Mediterranean, Middle East and African theatres of World War II|Mediterranean]] from 1939 to 1941, he won recognition as a skilful ship's captain and [[flotilla]] commander. He then transferred to the [[South West Pacific theatre of World War II|South West Pacific]] as captain of the light cruiser [[HMAS Perth (D29)|HMAS ''Perth'']], and went down with his ship against heavy odds during the [[Battle of Sunda Strait]] in early 1942.

Born in [[Benalla]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], Waller entered the [[HMAS Creswell|Royal Australian Naval College]] at the age of thirteen. After graduating, he served with the [[Royal Navy]] (RN) in the closing stages of World War&amp;nbsp;I. Between the wars, he specialised in communications and was posted as signals officer to various British and Australian warships. He gained his first sea-going command in 1937, as captain of [[HMS Brazen (H80)|HMS ''Brazen'']]. In September 1939, he took charge of HMAS ''Stuart'' and four other obsolete destroyers that together became known as the &quot;[[Scrap Iron Flotilla]]&quot;. In 1940, these were augmented by other ships to form the 10th Destroyer Flotilla, supporting Allied troops in [[North African Campaign|North Africa]].

Waller was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Order]] and [[Medal bar|Bar]], and twice [[mentioned in despatches]], for his achievements in the Mediterranean. He assumed command of HMAS ''Perth'' in October 1941, taking part in the [[Battle of the Java Sea]] shortly before his final action in Sunda Strait. He received a third mention in despatches posthumously, and in 2011 came under formal consideration for the award of the [[Victoria Cross]] (VC) for his performance as ''Perth'''s captain. The submarine [[HMAS Waller (SSG 75)|HMAS ''Waller'']] is named in his honour.

==Early life and World War I==
Born on 4 April 1900 in [[Benalla, Victoria|Benalla]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], Hector MacDonald Laws Waller was the son of William Frederick Waller, a grocer, and his wife Helen Waller (née Duncan).&lt;ref name=&quot;Goldrick2002&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Goldrick, J.

In February 1919, Waller was assigned to the light cruiser [[HMAS Melbourne (1912)|HMAS ''Melbourne'']], and two months later returned to Australia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goldrick2002&quot;/&gt; He transferred to the light cruiser [[HMAS Sydney (1912)|HMAS ''Sydney]] as an acting [[sub-lieutenant]] in September; his rank was made substantive the following month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Commonwealth of Australia (Navy Office)|date=| title=The Navy List (1 October 1919)| location=Melbourne|url=http://www.navy.gov.au/w/images/Navy_List-October-1919.pdf|page=33|accessdate=on 12 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Commonwealth of Australia (Navy Office)|date=| title=The Navy List (1 October 1920)| location=Melbourne| url=http://www.navy.gov.au/w/images/Navy_List-October-1920.pdf|page=22|accessdate=on 12 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1920 he was again posted aboard ''Melbourne''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Commonwealth of Australia (Navy Office)|date=| title=The Navy List (1 January 1921)| location=Melbourne| url=http://www.navy.gov.au/w/images/Navy_List-January-1921.pdf|page=30|accessdate=on 12 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Promoted to [[lieutenant (navy)|lieutenant]] in March 1921, he went through further training in Britain before returning to join the staff of the RANC. Waller married Nancy Bowes, a [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]]'s daughter, on 7&amp;nbsp;April 1923 in the [[Sydney]] suburb of [[Lewisham, New South Wales|Lewisham]]; the couple had two sons, Michael and John. In April 1924, he was posted to the light cruiser [[HMAS Adelaide (1918)|HMAS ''Adelaide'']]. Later that year, he began training as a signals officer in England; his classmates included [[Louis Mountbatten|Lord Louis Mountbatten]]. Waller finished at the top of the advanced course and, in May 1926, took charge of the Signals and Wireless-Telegraphy School at [[HMAS Cerberus (naval base)|Flinders Naval Depot]] in [[Western Port|Westernport]], Victoria.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goldrick2002&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lewis 2&quot;/&gt; From 1928 to 1930, he served with the RN as a signals officer aboard the destroyer [[HMS Broke (1914)|HMS ''Broke'']].&lt;ref name=&quot;Goldrick2002&quot;/&gt; He was promoted to [[lieutenant commander]] in March 1929.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lewis 2&quot;/&gt;

By this stage of his career, Waller had acquired a strong reputation for his communications work. In July 1930, he was posted aboard the [[Royal Australian Navy]]'s (RAN) flagship, the heavy cruiser [[HMAS Australia (D84)|HMAS ''Australia'']], as squadron signals officer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goldrick2002&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lewis 2&quot;/&gt; He continued to perform this role upon transferring to ''Australia''{{'}}s sister ship, [[HMAS Canberra (D33)|HMAS ''Canberra'']], in May 1931.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Commonwealth of Australia (Navy Office)|date=| title=The Navy List (1 October 1931)| location=Melbourne| url=http://www.navy.gov.au/w/images/Navy_List-October-1931.pdf|page=35|accessdate=on 12 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 1932, he was assigned to the Navy Office in [[Melbourne]], returning to ''Canberra'' as squadron signals officer in August 1933.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Commonwealth of Australia (Navy Office)|date=| title=The Navy List (1 April 1932)| location=Melbourne| url=http://www.navy.gov.au/w/images/Navy_List-April-1932.pdf|page=14|accessdate=on 12 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Commonwealth of Australia (Navy Office)|date=| title=The Navy List (1 October 1933)| location=Melbourne|url=http://www.navy.gov.au/w/images/Navy_List-October-1933.pdf|page=37|accessdate=on 12 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was promoted to [[commander]] in June 1934 and the following month became executive officer of the RANC.

==World War II==
===HMAS ''Stuart'' in the Mediterranean===

At the [[Military history of Australia in World War II|outbreak of World War II]], Waller was appointed captain of [[HMAS Stuart (D-00/100)|HMAS ''Stuart'']], taking charge of a group of four other obsolete ex-RN destroyers—[[HMAS Vampire (D68)|HMA Ships ''Vampire'']], [[HMAS Vendetta (D69)|''Vendetta'']], [[HMAS Voyager (D31)|''Voyager'']], and [[HMAS Waterhen (D22)|''Waterhen'']]—that the Germans later nicknamed the &quot;[[Scrap Iron Flotilla]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goldrick2002&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frame (2004), ''No Pleasure Cruise'', p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; The ships were en route to [[Singapore]] for training when the British and Australian governments agreed that they should be assigned to the [[Mediterranean, Middle East and African theatres of World War II|Mediterranean]] as the 19th Destroyer Division, under Waller's control.&lt;ref name=&quot;RAN in WWII&quot;&gt;Stevens (1996), ''The Royal Australian Navy in World War II'', p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; Arriving at [[Malta]] in late December, Waller made a positive initial impression on senior RN commanders; this was soon borne out by his actions during the salvage of the ''Trocas'', a disabled tanker. In May 1940, he was appointed to command the 10th Destroyer Flotilla, which included the vessels of the &quot;Scrap Iron Flotilla&quot; plus four modern British destroyers, and a month later was promoted to [[Captain (Royal Navy)|captain]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Goldrick2002&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;RAN in WWII&quot;/&gt;

Following Italy's entry into the war on 10&amp;nbsp;June 1940, Waller was involved in the search for minefields off the North African coast. A keen shooter, he personally blew up floating mines using a rifle and armour-piercing bullets. On 21&amp;nbsp;June, ''Stuart'' shelled the Italian-held town of [[Bardia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Lewis 9&quot;&gt;Lewis (2004), &quot;The Navy's Finest Fighting Leader&quot;, pp. 9–10.&lt;/ref&gt; The next month, his 10th Destroyer Flotilla participated in the [[Battle of Calabria]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Goldrick2002&quot;/&gt; Waller's ships carried out bombardments on [[Fort Capuzzo]] on 17&amp;nbsp;August and an Italian seaplane base in the [[Gulf of Bomba]] one week later.&lt;ref&gt;Gill (1957), [http://www.awm.gov.au/collection/records/awmohww2/navy/vol1/awmohww2-navy-vol1-ch5.pdf ''Royal Australian Navy, 1939–1942'', pp. 206–207].&lt;/ref&gt; In September, he was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Order]] (DSO) for &quot;courage, enterprise, and devotion to duty on recent engagements&quot;—in particular, his pinpointing of enemy minefields.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lewis 9&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=34943|date=10 September 1940|startpage=5469|supp=yes|accessdate=on 12 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same month, he transferred to HMAS ''Vampire'' while ''Stuart'' went in for refit.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lewis 10&quot;&gt;Lewis (2004), &quot;The Navy's Finest Fighting Leader&quot;, pp. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt; As the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] armies began to [[Operation Compass|counterattack Italian forces]] in December 1940, the Commander-in-Chief of the [[Mediterranean Fleet (United Kingdom)|Mediterranean Fleet]], Admiral [[Andrew Cunningham, 1st Viscount Cunningham of Hyndhope|Sir Andrew Cunningham]], gave Waller command of the newly formed Inshore Squadron, comprising destroyers, minesweepers, and auxiliaries. In his role as Cunningham's Senior Officer Afloat, Waller took charge of naval support for the [[Battle of Bardia|attack on Bardia]], which fell to the Allies on 5&amp;nbsp;January 1941.&lt;ref name=&quot;RAN in WWII 70-75&quot;&gt;Stevens (1996), ''The Royal Australian Navy in World War II'', pp. 70–75.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gill 292&quot;&gt;Gill (1957), [http://www.awm.gov.au/collection/records/awmohww2/navy/vol1/awmohww2-navy-vol1-ch7.pdf ''Royal Australian Navy, 1939–1942'', p. 292].&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly afterwards, he handed over command of the Inshore Squadron and transferred back aboard ''Stuart''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gill 292&quot;/&gt;
