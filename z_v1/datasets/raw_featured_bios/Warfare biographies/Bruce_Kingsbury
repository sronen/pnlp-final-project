'''Bruce Steel Kingsbury''', [[Victoria Cross|VC]] (8 January 1918 &amp;ndash; 29 August 1942) was an Australian soldier of the [[World War II|Second World War]]. Serving initially in the Middle East, he gained renown for his actions during the [[Kokoda Track campaign#Battle of Isurava|Battle of Isurava]], one of many battles forming the [[Kokoda Track campaign]] in [[New Guinea]]. His bravery during the battle was recognised with the [[Victoria Cross]], the highest decoration for gallantry &quot;in the face of the enemy&quot; that can be awarded to members of the British and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] armed forces. The first serviceman to [[List of Australian Victoria Cross recipients|receive]] the VC in Australian territory, Kingsbury was a member of the highly decorated 2/14th Infantry Battalion.

On 29 August 1942, during the Battle of Isurava, Kingsbury was one of the few survivors of a platoon that had been overrun by the Japanese. He immediately volunteered to join a different platoon, which had been ordered to counterattack. Rushing forward and firing his [[Bren light machine gun|Bren gun]] from the hip, he cleared a path through the enemy and inflicted a number of casualties. Kingsbury was then seen to fall, shot by a Japanese sniper and killed instantly. His actions, in delaying the Japanese long enough for the Australians to fortify their positions, were instrumental in saving Battalion Headquarters, and he was awarded the Victoria Cross as a result.

==Early life==
Born in [[Preston, Victoria|Preston]], [[Melbourne]] on 8 January 1918, Kingsbury was the second son of Philip Blencowe Kingsbury, an estate agent, and his wife Florence Annie, née Steel.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt; Growing up in the suburb of [[Prahran]], Kingsbury befriended Allen Avery when he was five years old. The two often raced billycarts down the hilly streets, and would remain lifelong friends.&lt;ref name=Dornan1&gt;{{Harvnb|Dornan|1999|pp=11&amp;ndash;18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kingsbury attended [[Windsor, Victoria|Windsor]] State School as a child, and his results were good enough to earn a scholarship at [[RMIT University|Melbourne Technical College]]. Avery began an agricultural course in Longerenong. Although qualified as a printer, Kingsbury began working at his father's real estate business,&lt;ref name=adb&gt;{{Australian Dictionary of Biography|last=McAllester|first=James|id=A150032b|title=Kingsbury, Bruce Steel (1918 &amp;ndash; 1942)|publisher=Australian Dictionary of Biography|year=2000|accessdate=7 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; a job which he disliked.&lt;ref name=Dornan1/&gt;

Unhappy in the estate agency, Kingsbury took up the position of caretaker on a farm at [[Boundary Bend, Victoria|Boundary Bend]], not far from where Avery was working. After three months, the pair decided that they would go on an adventure &amp;ndash; walking through western Victoria and [[New South Wales]].&lt;ref name = Dornan1/&gt; In February 1936, Kingsbury and Avery left their jobs and began travelling north, working on various farms and estates. The pair eventually arrived in Sydney several months later, and returned to Melbourne on the first train back. Kingsbury resumed working as a real estate agent, while Avery worked as a nurseryman.&lt;ref name=Dornan1/&gt; They spent their free time at dances and parties. During this time, Kingsbury met and became close to Leila Bradbury.&lt;ref name = Dornan1/&gt; As the war in Europe escalated, Kingsbury and Avery made up their minds to enlist. Despite his parents' disapproval, Kingsbury signed up to the [[Second Australian Imperial Force|Australian Imperial Force]] on 29 May 1940.&lt;ref name=WW2Roll&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/script/veteran.asp?ServiceID=A&amp;VeteranID=431320|title=Kingsbury, Bruce Steel|work=World War II Nominal Roll|publisher=Commonwealth of Australia|date=|accessdate=7 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Middle East==
Kingsbury was originally assigned to the 2/2 Pioneers, but requested a transfer to the 2/14th Infantry Battalion to join Avery who had, coincidentally, enlisted on the same day at a different recruitment centre.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dornan2&gt;{{Harvnb|Dornan|1999|pp=19&amp;ndash;26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pair undertook basic training at [[Puckapunyal]], a part of Seventh Section of 9 Platoon, where they were given drill instruction, rifle drill and mock battle training.&lt;ref name = Dornan2/&gt; After the Seventh Section learned they would be sent overseas, Kingsbury informed Avery that he planned to propose to Leila. The pair went to Melbourne to try to organise the wedding. Although Kingsbury gave Leila a wristwatch as an engagement present, they could not arrange a marriage licence before he left, and the marriage never took place.&lt;ref name = Dornan2/&gt;

Kingsbury, along with the rest of the [[7th Division (Australia)|7th Division]], was shipped to the Middle East aboard [[RMS Aquitania#World War II|HMT ''Aquitania'']]. Spending time in [[Tel Aviv]] and the surrounding areas, the 7th Division continued training and awaited further orders.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dornan3&gt;{{Harvnb|Dornan|1999|pp=29&amp;ndash;41}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 April, the division was sent forward to [[Mersa Matruh]] in [[Egypt]] to support the Commonwealth force's defences.&lt;ref name = Dornan3/&gt; They replaced a Scottish unit and took up positions in the garrison.&lt;ref name=Dornan3/&gt; On 23 May, Kingsbury's brigade was sent back to Palestine, en route to battle in [[Syria-Lebanon Campaign|Syria and Lebanon]].&lt;ref name=Dornan4&gt;{{Harvnb|Dornan|1999|pp=49&amp;ndash;78}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2/14th fought alongside British troops against the [[Vichy French]] on the Lebanese mountain ranges,&lt;ref name = Dornan4/&gt; coordinating a three-pronged attack on [[Beirut]]. During this time, the division fought in many towns, including a major [[Battle of Jezzine (1941)|battle in Jezzine]], where Avery was wounded by a grenade&amp;mdash;which drove metal splinters into his spine&lt;ref name=Dornan4/&gt;&amp;mdash;and awarded the [[Military Medal]] for his &quot;cool courage and devotion&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/awm192/00309/003090045.pdf|title=Recommendation for Alan Richard Avery to be awarded a Military Medal|accessdate=26 March 2009|format=PDF|work=Index to Recommendations: Second World War|publisher=Australian War Memorial}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the war with the Vichy French was winding down, on 11 July Kingsbury and Avery were selected for a contingent to collect and bury the dead.&lt;ref name=Dornan4/&gt; The battalion stayed in Beirut for a few months, until setting up a semi-permanent camp at Hill 69, outside [[Jerusalem]].&lt;ref name = Dornan4/&gt;

On 30 January 1942, the 7th Division left Egypt for Australia, sailing via [[Bombay]].&lt;ref name=Dornan5&gt;{{Harvnb|Dornan|1999|pp=81&amp;ndash;87}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kingsbury's battalion made landfall at [[Adelaide]] and continued to Melbourne by rail. The battalion arrived on 16 March, and was given a week's leave. After this, the battalion underwent training in [[Glen Innes, New South Wales|Glen Innes]], before camping in [[Yandina, Queensland|Yandina]], [[Queensland]]. On 5 August, the  battalion moved north to [[Brisbane]], boarding a ship to [[Port Moresby]].&lt;ref name=Dornan5/&gt;

==Kokoda Track Campaign==
[[File:9 platoon 2-14Bn 16Aug42.jpg|thumb|Kingsbury with the other members of his platoon on 16 August 1942]]
The Japanese Army had for several months been making great progress in its [[Pacific War]] campaign. After the [[Battle of Singapore|Japanese captured Singapore]] in February 1942, many Australians believed that New Guinea was the next major target, effectively isolating Australia from its allies. The Japanese had captured [[Rabaul]] in [[New Britain]] in January, and on 21 July, landed at [[Buna, Papua New Guinea|Buna]], northeast Papua.&lt;ref name=McCarthy&gt;{{citation|last=McCarthy|first=Dudley|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/histories/chapter.asp?volume=21|title= South-West Pacific Area - First Year|work=Australia in the War of 1939-45|year=1959|accessdate=7 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; After capturing the town of [[Kokoda]] for the second time on 9 August, the Japanese began marching along the [[Kokoda Track]] towards Port Moresby. The 2,500 strong Japanese army met the 39th, 49th and 53rd Infantry Battalions, collectively 400 strong, at the town of [[Isurava, Papua New Guinea|Isurava]].&lt;ref name=Brune&gt;{{Harvnb|Brune|2004|p=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the Japanese attacked, they managed to push the 53rd back to a junction behind Isurava.

The annihilation of the Australians is near, but there are still some remnants&amp;nbsp;... and their fighting spirit is extremely high.|Japanese Commander's Progress Report|Kokoda}}
It was at the height of the battle, on 26 August, that the members of the 2/14th, including Kingsbury, arrived at Isurava to provide reinforcements.&lt;ref name=Dornan5/&gt; Despite the reinforcements, the Australians were outnumbered five to one.&lt;ref name=Brune/&gt;

===Battle of Isurava===
The two combined battalions began digging in around Isurava. A headquarters had been set up at the top of the hill, which was vital to the defence of the position. While the Australians dug themselves in, the Japanese, led by Japanese Major General [[Tomitarō Horii]], prepared to attack. On 28 August, the Japanese launched their offensive. The Australians were outnumbered by as many as six to one, yet resisted in the face of heavy machine-gun fire and hand-to-hand combat. On 29 August, the Japanese broke through the right flank, pushing the Australians back with heavy fire, threatening to cut off their headquarters.&lt;ref name=Lindsay&gt;{{Harvnb|Lindsay|2002|pp=77&amp;ndash;81}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Australians began to prepare a counter-offensive, and men volunteered to join an attack party. Kingsbury, one of the few survivors of his platoon, ran down the Track with the group.&lt;ref name=Brune/&gt; {{quote|You could see his Bren gun held out and his big bottom swaying as he went with the momentum he was getting up, followed by Alan Avery.

The sniper fired one shot before disappearing. Avery, who had been about 6&amp;nbsp;ft (1.8m) from Kingsbury, briefly chased after the sniper, but returned to carry Kingsbury to the Aid Post;&lt;ref name=Lindsay/&gt; Kingsbury was dead by the time he arrived there.&lt;ref name=Ham&gt;{{Harvnb|Ham|2004|pp=176&amp;ndash;177}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kingsbury's actions were a turning point in the battle.&lt;ref name=Lindsay/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ham/&gt; The Japanese had begun to gather momentum in their attack, and were threatening to overrun Battalion Headquarters.&lt;ref name=Brune&gt;{{Harvnb|Brune|1992|p=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; His attack inflicted damage to the Japanese force, effectively halting their advance. This allowed the Australian troops to stabilise their positions, eventually regaining control and defending the Battalion Headquarters.&lt;ref name=LonGaz&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=35893|supp=yes|startpage=695|date=5 February 1943|accessdate=7 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; His act of bravery served as an inspiration to the troops.&lt;ref name=Lindsay/&gt;

Authors and military analysts have speculated that had Kingsbury not attacked, the Japanese may have destroyed the battalion.&lt;ref name=Ham/&gt;&lt;ref name=730Report&gt;{{citation|last=Bannerman|first=Mark|url=http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2002/s637883.htm|title=7.30 Report - 01/08/2002: Cosgrove calls for recognition for soldiers on Kokoda Trail|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]|date=1 August 2002|accessdate=25 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Japanese had been attacking in waves, and had started to climb a steep hill to outflank the Australians, in an effort to win the battle.&lt;ref name=Ham/&gt; The Australians were low on supplies and the Japanese were on the verge of breaking through the Australian line. Had they broken through, they would have been able to isolate the Battalion Headquarters from the soldiers on the flanks. This would have prevented the Australians from retreating to [[Alola, Papua New Guinea|Alola]], allowing the Japanese to overrun them.&lt;ref name=Ham/&gt;

For his actions, Kingsbury was awarded the Victoria Cross,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=|first=|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/honours/honours/person.asp?p=VX19139|title=Honours and awards (gazetted)|publisher=Australian War Memorial|date=|accessdate=7 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JohnstonChagas&gt;{{Harvnb|Johnston|Chagas|2007|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was [[London Gazette|gazetted]] on 9 February 1943. His citation read:

{{quote|''War Office, 9th&amp;nbsp;February, 1943.''

The KING has been graciously pleased to approve the posthumous award of the VICTORIA CROSS to: —

No. VX 19139 Private. Bruce Steel Kingsbury, Australian Military Forces.

In New Guinea, the Battalion to which Private Kingsbury belonged had been holding a position in the Isurava area for two days against continuous and fierce enemy attacks. On the 29th&amp;nbsp;August, 1942, the enemy attacked in such force that they succeeded in breaking through the Battalion's right flank, creating a serious threat both to the rest of the Battalion and to its Headquarters. To avoid the situation becoming more desperate, it was essential to regain immediately the lost ground on the right flank.

Private Kingsbury, who was one of the few survivors of a Platoon which had been over-run and severely cut about by the enemy, immediately volunteered to join a different platoon which had been ordered to counter-attack.

He rushed forward firing his Bren Gun from the hip through terrific machine-gun fire and succeeded in clearing a path through the enemy. Continuing to sweep the enemy positions with his fire and inflicting an extremely high number of casualties on them, Private Kingsbury was then seen to fall to the ground shot dead, by the bullet from a sniper hiding in the wood.

Private Kingsbury displayed a complete disregard for his own safety. His initiative and superb courage made possible the recapture of the position which undoubtedly saved Battalion Headquarters, as well as causing heavy casualties amongst the enemy. His coolness, determination and devotion to duty in the face of great odds was an inspiration to his comrades.&lt;ref name=LonGaz /&gt;}}
