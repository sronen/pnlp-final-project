[[Air Vice Marshal]] '''Adrian Lindley Trevor Cole''', [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire|CBE]], [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]], [[Military Cross|MC]], [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|DFC]] (19&amp;nbsp;June 1895 – 14&amp;nbsp;February 1966) was a senior commander in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF). Joining the [[Australian Military Forces|army]] at the outbreak of World War&amp;nbsp;I, he transferred to the Australian Flying Corps in 1916 and flew with [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron]] in the [[Middle Eastern theatre of World War I|Middle East]] and [[No. 2 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;2 Squadron]] on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]. He became an [[Flying ace|ace]], credited with victories over ten enemy aircraft, and earned the [[Military Cross]] and the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross]]. In 1921, he was a founding member of the RAAF. 

&quot;King&quot; Cole rose to the position of Air Member for Supply in 1933 and gained promotion to [[group captain]] in 1935. The following year he was appointed the first commanding officer of [[RAAF Base Richmond|Headquarters RAAF Station Richmond]]. During World War&amp;nbsp;II, he led North-Western Area Command in [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], Northern Territory, and held a series of overseas posts in North Africa, England, Northern Ireland, and Ceylon. As Forward Air Controller during the [[Dieppe Raid]] in 1942, he was wounded in action and awarded the [[Distinguished Service Order]]. Cole served on corporate [[boards of directors]] following his retirement from the RAAF in 1946. He died in 1966 at the age of seventy.

==Early life and World War I==
Adrian Cole was born in [[Glen Iris, Victoria|Glen Iris]], a suburb of [[Melbourne]], to [[barrister]] and [[Physician|doctor]] Robert Cole and his wife Helen (née Hake). He was educated at [[Geelong Grammar School]] and [[Melbourne Grammar School]], where he was a member of the [[Australian Army Cadets|cadet corps]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;&gt;Eaton, ''Australian Dictionary of Biography'', pp.459–460&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Who's Who 1935&quot;&gt;Knox, ''Who's Who in Australia 1935'', p.123&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Malvern, Victoria|Malvern]], a neighbouring suburb of Glen Iris, has also been given as Cole's birthplace, for example in Cutlack, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/9/chapters/38.pdf ''The Australian Flying Corps'', p.466]&lt;/ref&gt; When World War I broke out in August 1914, Cole gained a [[Commissioned officer|commission]] in the [[Australian Military Forces]], serving with the 55th (Collingwood) Infantry Regiment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;&gt;Dennis et al, ''The Oxford Companion to Australian Military History'', p.136&lt;/ref&gt; He resigned his commission to join the [[Australian Imperial Force]] on 28&amp;nbsp;January 1916, intending to become a pilot in the Australian Flying Corps.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AIF Project&quot;&gt;[http://www.aif.adfa.edu.au:8080/showPerson?pid=57302 Adrian Trevor Cole] at [http://www.aif.adfa.edu.au:8080/index.html The AIF Project].

North-Western Area [[B-24 Liberator]]s, [[Lockheed Hudson|Hudsons]], [[Bristol Beaufighter|Beaufighters]] and [[PBY Catalina|Catalinas]] carried out raids to destroy Japanese bases and aircraft, and divert enemy forces from Allied columns.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers pp.111-112&quot;/&gt; Through March and April 1944, Cole had thirteen squadrons under his control, and was supporting [[amphibious warfare|amphibious operations]] against [[Operations Reckless and Persecution|Hollandia and Aitape]].&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/13.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.215–219]&lt;/ref&gt; In May, he directed bombing from North-Western Area on [[Surabaya]] as part of [[Operation Transom]].&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/14.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p.229]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chief of the Air Staff, Air Vice Marshal [[George Jones (RAAF officer)|George Jones]], received an anonymous letter alleging that Cole had become drunk and lost control at a mess meeting on 8&amp;nbsp;November.

Cole was summarily retired from the RAAF in 1946, along with a number of other senior commanders and veterans of World War&amp;nbsp;I, primarily to make way for the advancement of younger and equally capable officers.
