'''Cedric Ernest''' &quot;'''Spike'''&quot; '''Howell''' [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]], [[Military Cross|MC]], [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|DFC]] (17 June 1896 – 10 December 1919) was an Australian [[fighter pilot]] and [[flying ace]] of the [[First World War]]. Born in [[Adelaide]], [[South Australia]], he enlisted in the [[First Australian Imperial Force|Australian Imperial Force]] in 1916 for service in the First World War and was posted to the 46th Battalion on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]. During November 1916, he was accepted for a transfer to the [[Royal Flying Corps]] and was shipped to the United Kingdom for flight training. Graduating as a pilot, he was commissioned as a [[second lieutenant]] and posted to [[No. 45 Squadron RAF|No.&amp;nbsp;45 Squadron RFC]] in France during October 1917; two months later the unit sailed to the [[Italian Campaign (World War I)|Italian theatre]].

Howell spent eight months flying operations over Italy, conducting attacks against ground targets and engaging in sorties against aerial forces. While in Italy, he was credited with shooting down a total of nineteen aircraft. In one particular sortie on 12 July 1918, Howell attacked, in conjunction with one other aircraft, a formation of between ten and fifteen German machines; he personally shot down five of these planes and was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Order]]. Howell had previously been awarded the [[Military Cross]] and [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] for his gallantry in operations over the front. He was posted back to the United Kingdom in July 1918. In 1919, Howell was killed while taking part in the [[England to Australia flight|England to Australia air race]]. Piloting a Martinsyde A1 aircraft, he attempted to make an emergency landing on [[Corfu]] but the plane fell short, crashing into the sea just off the island's coast. Both Howell and his companion subsequently drowned.

==Early life==
Cedric Ernest Howell was born in [[Adelaide]], [[South Australia]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Aces&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Garrisson|1999|pp=90–91}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Aircraft&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Franks|2003|p=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; on 17 June 1896 to Ernest Howell, an accountant, and his wife Ida Caroline (née Hasch).

By 1914, he held a [[Officer (armed forces)|commission]] in the 49th (Prahran) Cadet Battalion, [[Australian Army Reserve|Citizens Military Force]], as a [[second lieutenant]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Aces&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Aircraft&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;

==First World War==
===Australian Imperial Force to Royal Flying Corps===
On the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914, Howell attempted to enlist in the newly raised [[First Australian Imperial Force|Australian Imperial Force]] but was initially rejected. The following year, he resigned his commission in the Citizens Military Force and re-applied to join the Australian Imperial Force for active service in the war;&lt;ref name=&quot;Newton&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Newton|1996|pp=40–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was accepted on 1 January 1916.&lt;ref name=&quot;Embark&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/AWM8/23_31_4/PDF/0283.pdf|title=Cedric Ernest Howell|accessdate=8 January 2010|format=PDF|work=First World War Embarkation Roll|publisher=Australian War Memorial}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to his age, Howell was ineligible for a commission in the force and was instead granted the rank of [[Private (rank)|private]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Aviator Honoured&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|title=Gallant Aviator Honoured|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/1875219?searchTerm=Cedric+Howell|publisher=[[The Argus (Australia)|''The Argus'']]|date=12 February 1923|accessdate=8 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Captain Howell Lost|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/12403809?searchTerm=Cedric+Howell|publisher=''The Mercury''|date=16 December 1919|accessdate=8 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Allotted to the 16th Reinforcements of the [[14th Battalion (Australia)|14th Battalion]], he embarked aboard HMAT ''Anchises'' in [[Melbourne]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], on 14 March.&lt;ref name=&quot;Embark&quot;/&gt; Arriving in France, he was posted to the newly raised 46th Battalion on 20 May and promoted to [[corporal]] four days later. While the unit was engaged in [[Battle of the Somme|action along the Somme]], Howell was temporarily raised to [[sergeant]] in July, before taking part in the [[Battle of Pozières]] the following month. He relinquished his temporary appointments and reverted to [[lance corporal]] in August.&lt;ref name=&quot;ServRec&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/units/unit_11233.asp|title=46th Battalion|accessdate=8 January 2010|work=Australian military units|publisher=Australian War Memorial}}&lt;/ref&gt; Considered an expert shot, Howell had been trained as a [[sniper]] during his service with the 46th Battalion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Newton&quot;/&gt;

On 11 November 1916, Howell was among a group of 200 Australian applicants selected for a transfer to the [[Royal Flying Corps]] to undergo flight training.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aces&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Shipped to the United Kingdom, he was posted to No.&amp;nbsp;1 Royal Flying Officers' Cadet Battalion at [[Durham, England|Durham]] for his initial instruction.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ServRec&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;RAFrecord&quot;/&gt; On graduating as a pilot, he was formally discharged from the Australian Imperial Force on 16 March 1917 and commissioned as a probationary [[second lieutenant]] in the Royal Flying Corps the following day.&lt;ref name=&quot;ServRec&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=30014|date=11 April 1917|startpage=3467|supp=yes|accessdate=8 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Howell was posted to No.&amp;nbsp;17 Reserve Squadron in April,&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; where his rank was made substantive. Appointed a flight officer on 25 July,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=30232|date=15 August 1917|startpage=8312|supp=yes|accessdate=8 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was attached to the [[Central Flying School]] for duties.&lt;ref name=&quot;RAFrecord&quot;/&gt; On 12 September, Howell wed Cicely Elizabeth Hallam Kilby in a ceremony at St Stephen's Anglican Church, [[Bush Hill Park]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;

===Fighter pilot over Italy===
In October 1917, Howell was posted to [[No. 45 Squadron RAF|No.&amp;nbsp;45 Squadron RFC]] in France, piloting [[Sopwith Camel]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aces&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Just prior to joining the unit, Howell had suffered a bout of [[malaria]] while still in England giving him a &quot;tall, thin and dismal looking&quot; appearance; he was consequently nicknamed &quot;Spike&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Newton&quot;/&gt; His service over the Western Front was short-lived, however, as the squadron moved to Italy in late December.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aircraft&quot;/&gt; While operating over the [[Italian Campaign (World War I)|Italian Front]], Howell was engaged in both aerial combat missions and ground-attack sorties, which included &quot;destroy[ing] enemy transport crossing the [[Alps]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MC&quot;&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=30901|date=16 September 1918|startpage=10968|supp=yes|accessdate=9 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 April 1918, the Royal Flying Corps and [[Royal Naval Air Service]] were combined to form the [[Royal Air Force]], with personnel from the former services transferred to the new branch; Howell thus became a [[lieutenant]] in the new service from this date.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;RAFrecord&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documentsonline/details-result.asp?queryType=1&amp;resultcount=1&amp;Edoc_Id=8230432|title=RAF officers' service records 1918–1919—Image details—Howell, Cedric Ernest|work=DocumentsOnline|publisher=[[The National Archives]]|format=fee usually required to view pdf of full original service record|accessdate=19 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the first half of 1918, Howell conducted several raids on ground targets,&lt;ref name=&quot;Aces&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; including one on an [[Power station|electrical power plant]]. From a height of approximately {{convert|100|ft|m}}, Howell, with &quot;great skill&quot;, scored three direct hits with his bombs on the facility.&lt;ref name=&quot;MC&quot;/&gt; He was also active in aerial engagements against [[Central Powers|Central]] aircraft during this period, achieving flying ace status early in the year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aces&quot;/&gt; During a particular patrol with two other members of his squadron on 13 May, the trio intercepted a party of twelve rival planes. In the ensuring battle, Howell &quot;carried out a most dashing attack&quot;, being personally credited with the destruction of three of the aircraft and with driving a fourth down out of control, despite suffering &quot;frequent jams in both of his machine guns&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Newton&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MC&quot;/&gt; Cited for his &quot;conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty&quot; in carrying out ground-attack missions, coupled with his destruction of seven Central aircraft, Howell was awarded the [[Military Cross]]. The announcement of the decoration was promogulated in a supplement to the ''[[London Gazette]]'' on 16 September 1918.&lt;ref name=&quot;MC&quot;/&gt;

Promoted to temporary [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|captain]] on 1 June 1918,&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;RAFrecord&quot;/&gt; Howell led a party of three machines out on patrol eight days later. The trio spotted a formation of six Austrian scout planes and went in to attack; Howell shot down two of the aircraft.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aces&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Newton&quot;/&gt; Later that month, he took off on a similar sortie with two other aircraft. They intercepted a party of nine machines, and during the consequent battle no less than six of the Central planes were destroyed with a seventh shot down as out of control; Howell was credited with two of these. Described as a &quot;fine fighting officer, skilful and determined&quot;, Howell was commended for his efforts in destroying five aircraft during June, which resulted in his award of the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross]]. The notice for the decoration was gazetted on 21 September 1918.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=30913|date=21 September 1918|startpage=11252|supp=yes|accessdate=9 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Howell was out on patrol on 15 June 1918 when German and Austrian forces initiated the [[Battle of the Piave River]] by striking Allied lines on the opposite bank. After landing back at base at 11:40, he was the first to bring news of the attack. With the aircraft refuelled and loaded with bombs, he—in company with the rest of the squadron—then led his flight on a total of four sorties against the enemy insurgents. No.&amp;nbsp;45 Squadron succeeded in destroying with its bombs a pontoon bridge, a boat, and a trench filled with soldiers, before inflicting at least a hundred casualties with machine gun fire. Heavy rain washed other bridges away and by 18 June the stranded Austrian forces on the Allied bank of the river were routed by a counterattack.&lt;ref name=&quot;Newton&quot;/&gt;

On 12 July 1918, Howell and Lieutenant [[Alan Rice-Oxley]] took to the sky in their Camels.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rice-Oxley&quot;&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=30989|date=2 November 1918|startpage=12971|supp=yes|accessdate=12 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pair were soon confronted by a formation of between ten and fifteen Central aircraft.

On 15 July, he led a trio of Camels in an assault on sixteen scout planes; he destroyed two of the machines.&lt;ref name=&quot;Newton&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;DSO&quot;/&gt; The two scouts were to prove Howell's final aerial victories of the war, bringing his total to nineteen aerial victories which were composed of fifteen aircraft destroyed, three driven down as out of control and one captured.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shores|Franks|Guest|1990|p=201}}&lt;/ref&gt; His total made him No.&amp;nbsp;45 Squadron's second highest-scoring ace after [[Matthew Frew]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Aircraft&quot;/&gt; although some sources place Howell's score as high as thirty aerial victories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Grinnell-Milne|1980|p=223}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Driggs|2008|p=293}}&lt;/ref&gt; Late in July, following ten months of active service in the cockpit, Howell was posted back to the United Kingdom where he spent the remainder of the war attached to training units as a flight instructor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aircraft&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;RAFrecord&quot;/&gt; Cited for his &quot;distinguished and gallant services&quot; in Italy, he was [[Mentioned in Despatches|mentioned in the despatch]] of General [[Frederick Lambart, 10th Earl of Cavan]] on 26 October 1918.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=31106|date=6 January 1919|startpage=287|supp=yes|accessdate=18 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; For his efforts in destroying eight aircraft over a four-day period in July, Howell was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Order]]. A supplement of the ''London Gazette'' carried the announcement on 2 November 1918, reading:&lt;ref name=&quot;DSO&quot;/&gt;

{{quote|''Air Ministry, 2nd November, 1918.''

His Majesty the KING has been graciously pleased to confer the undermentioned Rewards on Officers and other ranks of the Royal Air Force, in recognition of gallantry in Flying Operations against the Enemy: —

AWARDED THE DISTINGUISHED SERVICE ORDER.

Lieut. (T./Capt.) Cedric Ernest Howell, M.C., D.F.C.

This officer recently attacked, in company with one other machine, an enemy formation of fifteen aeroplanes, and succeeded in destroying four of them and bringing one down out of control. Two days afterwards he destroyed another enemy machine, which fell in our lines, and on the following day he led three machines against sixteen enemy scouts, destroying two of them. Captain Howell is a very gallant and determined fighter, who takes no account of the enemy's superior numbers in his battles.}}

==England-to-Australia flight and legacy==
While stationed in England, Howell attended an investiture ceremony at [[Buckingham Palace]] on 13 December 1918, where he was presented with his Distinguished Service Order and Military Cross by [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ServRec&quot;/&gt; Howell was discharged from the Royal Air Force on 31 July 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=31510|date=19 August 1919|startpage=10479|accessdate=9 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; During 1919, the [[Australian Government]] offered a prize of [[Australian pound|£]]10,000 to the first aviator to pilot a British or [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]]-built aircraft from England to Australia within a period of 30 days. On 15 August, Howell was approached by British aircraft manufacturer [[Martinsyde]] to take part in the race flying their Type A Mk.I aircraft, powered by a [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls-Royce]] engine; he accepted the offer.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Aviator Honoured&quot;/&gt; He was to be accompanied by Lieutenant [[George Henry Fraser]], a qualified navigator and engineer who had served with the [[Royal Australian Air Force|Australian Flying Corps]] during the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aif.adfa.edu.au:8080/showPerson?pid=103660|title=George Henry Fraser|accessdate=9 January 2010|work=The AIF Project|publisher=Australian Defence Force Academy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 December 1919, Howell and Fraser took off in their Martinsyde from [[Hounslow Heath Aerodrome]]. The pair, however, soon ran into poor weather and were forced to land the aircraft in [[Dijon, France]] later that day. Airborne again, they reached [[Pisa, Italy]] the following day, where a replacement tail skid was fitted to the A1; by 6 December, the pair were in [[Naples]]. On 10 December, Howell and Fraser took off in their fully fuelled plane from [[Taranto]] in the afternoon.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; They intended to reach Africa next, but poor weather conditions forced them to alter their plan and they instead headed for [[Crete]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Aviator Honoured&quot;/&gt; Their Martinsyde was reported flying over St George's Bay, [[Corfu]] at 20:00 that evening. For unknown reasons, Howell and Fraser attempted to execute an emergency landing at Corfu. They were, however, unable to make it to the coast and were forced to crash into the sea.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;RAFrecord&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Nasht&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Nasht|2006|pp=85, 92}}&lt;/ref&gt; Citizens in the area later reported that they heard cries for help coming from the sea that night, but that a rescue was not possible in the rough conditions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Newton&quot;/&gt; Both Howell and Fraser were drowned.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Nasht&quot;/&gt;

Howell's body later washed ashore and was returned to Australia for burial; Fraser's remains were never discovered.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Howell was accorded a funeral with full military honours,&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; which took place at Warringal Cemetery, [[Heidelberg, Victoria|Heidelberg]] on 22 April 1920, with several hundred mourners in attendance; his widow, parents and sister were chief among these. A firing party of the [[Royal Australian Artillery|Royal Australian Garrison Artillery]] led the gun carriage bearing the coffin to the cemetery. Captains [[Adrian Cole (RAAF officer)|Adrian Cole]], [[Frank Lukis]] and [[Raymond Brownell]] acted as [[pallbearer]]s along with five other officers who had served in either the Royal or Australian Flying Corps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Late Captain Howell|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/1694457?searchTerm=Cedric+Howell|publisher=[[The Argus (Australia)|''The Argus'']]|date=23 April 1920|accessdate=10 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 February 1923, a stained-glass window dedicated to the memory of Howell was unveiled by General [[Henry George Chauvel|Sir Harry Chauvel]] at St. Anselm's Church of England in [[Middle Park, Victoria|Middle Park]]; Howell had been a member of the congregation there in his youth.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aviator Honoured&quot;/&gt; Following the closure of St. Anselm's in 2001, the window was moved to St. Silas's Church, [[Albert Park, Victoria|Albert Park]], which is now also the parish church for the former parish of St. Anselm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.saintsilas.org.uk/section/150|title=History of St Silas, Albert Park|publisher=Saint Silas Church, Kentish Town, London, NW5|accessdate=16 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
