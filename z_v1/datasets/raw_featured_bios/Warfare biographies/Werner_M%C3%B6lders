'''Werner Mölders''' (18 March 1913 &amp;ndash; 22 November 1941) was a [[World War II]] German ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' pilot and the leading German [[flying ace|fighter ace]] in the [[Spanish Civil War]]. Mölders became the first pilot in [[aviation history]] to claim 100 aerial victories—that is, 100 aerial combat encounters resulting in the destruction of the enemy aircraft, and was highly decorated for his achievements. He was instrumental in the development of new fighter tactics which led to the [[finger-four]] formation. He died in an [[Aviation accidents and incidents|air crash]] in which he was a passenger.

Mölders joined the ''Luftwaffe'' in 1934 at the age of 21. In 1938, he volunteered for service in the ''[[Condor Legion]]'', which supported General [[Francisco Franco]]'s Nationalist side in the Spanish Civil War, and shot down 15 aircraft.&lt;ref name=&quot;Obermaier page34&quot;&gt;Obermaier and Held 1996, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;  In World War II, he lost two wingmen in the [[Battle of France]] and the [[Battle of Britain]], but shot down 53 enemy aircraft. With his tally standing at 68 victories, Mölders and his unit, the [[Jagdgeschwader 51]] (JG 51), were transferred to the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] in June 1941 for the opening of ''[[Operation Barbarossa]]''. By the end of 22 June 1941, the first day of ''Barbarossa'', he had added another four victories to his tally and a week later, Mölders surpassed [[Manfred von Richthofen]]'s 1918 record of 80 victories. By mid-July, he had 100.

Prevented from flying further combat missions for propaganda reasons, at the age of 28 Mölders was promoted to ''[[Oberst]]'', and appointed [[Inspector of Fighters|Inspector General of Fighters]]. He was inspecting the ''Luftwaffe'' units in the [[Crimea]] when he was ordered to Berlin to attend the state funeral of [[Ernst Udet]], the [[World War I]] flying ace. On the flight to Berlin, the [[Heinkel He 111]] in which he was travelling as a passenger encountered a heavy thunderstorm during which one of the aircraft's engines failed. While attempting to land, the Heinkel crashed at [[Breslau]], killing Mölders and two others. The German ''[[Wehrmacht]]'' of the [[Third Reich]] and the ''[[Bundeswehr]]'' of the [[Federal Republic of Germany]] both honoured him by naming two fighter wings, a destroyer and barracks after him.

==Childhood, education and early career==
Mölders was born on 18 March 1913 in [[Gelsenkirchen]], the son of teacher Viktor Mölders and his wife Annemarie, née Riedel. He was the third of four children, with an older sister, Annemarie, an older brother, Hans, and a younger brother, Victor.&lt;ref&gt;Obermaier and Held 1996, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; After his father, a [[Military reserve force|Reserve]] ''[[Leutnant]]'' in the King's 145th Infantry Regiment, was [[killed in action]] on 2 March 1915 in the [[Forest of Argonne|Argonne Forest]] in France, his mother moved the family into her parents' house in [[Brandenburg an der Havel]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Obermaier page31&quot;&gt;Obermaier and Held 1996, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Brandenburg, Mölders found a father figure in [[Chaplain]] Erich Klawitter, who instilled firm religious beliefs in him.&lt;ref name=&quot;Obermaier page10&quot;&gt;Obermaier and Held 1996, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1919 to 1931, Mölders attended, first, the [[Grundschule|elementary school]] and then the Saldria-[[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]], or secondary school. At school he discovered his love for water sports, especially [[Rowing (sport)|rowing]]. He joined two rowing clubs, first the ''Saldria-Brandenburg'' and later the ''Brandenburger Ruderclub'', and enjoyed success at rowing-[[regatta]]s. He was also a  member of the ''Bund Neudeutschland in der katholischen Jugendbewegung'', a [[Catholic]] youth organisation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Obermaier page10&quot;/&gt; Mölders graduated from school in early 1931 with the ''[[Abitur]]'' (diploma) and expressed a desire to become an officer in the armed forces.&lt;ref name=&quot;Obermaier page31&quot;/&gt;

Mölders joined the II./2 infantry regiment of the [[Reichswehr]] in [[Allenstein]], [[East Prussia]] on 1 April 1931, serving as an officer cadet in the infantry. He attained the rank of ''[[Fahnenjunker]]''-''[[Gefreiter]]'' on 1 October 1931, rising to ''Fahnenjunker''-''[[Unteroffizier]]'' on 1 April 1932.&lt;ref name=&quot;Obermaier page31&quot;/&gt; After completing his basic military training in October 1932, he transferred to the [[Kriegsschule|Military School]] [[Dresden]]. On 1 June 1933, he successfully completed his training in Dresden and was promoted to [[Fähnrich|ensign]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Obermaier page31&quot;/&gt; He again was transferred, this time to the 1st Prussian Pioneer Battalion (Infantry Regiment 2) at the [[Pioneer (military)|Pioneer]] School in [[Munich]]. During his training years, Mölders made his first attempt to fulfil his dream of flying and volunteered for pilot training, but was declared unfit for flying. He tried again and was given conditional permission (''bedingt tauglich''—with constraints) to begin flight training.&lt;ref&gt;Obermaier and Held 1996, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

After his promotion to ''[[Oberfähnrich]]'' on 1 February 1934, Mölders began his pilot training at the ''[[Deutsche Verkehrsfliegerschule]]'' (German transport flying school) in [[Cottbus]], lasting from 6 February 1934 to 31 December 1934.&lt;ref&gt;Obermaier and Held 1996, pp. 11, 32.&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 March 1934, he was promoted to ''[[Leutnant]]'' and assigned to the recently established ''[[Luftwaffe]]''. In the early stages of his pilot training, he suffered continually from [[nausea]] and vomiting, but he eventually overcame these problems and finished the course at the top of his class. The next phase of his military pilot's training was from 1 January 1935 to 30 June 1935 at the combat flying school in [[Tutow]] and the ''[[Jagdfliegerschule]]'' (fighter pilot school) at [[Schleißheim]] near [[Munich]]. He received the newly created [[Aviator badge#Germany|Pilot's Badge of the Luftwaffe]] on 21 May 1935.&lt;ref&gt;Obermaier and Held 1996, pp. 11, 32, 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 July 1935, ''Leutnant'' Mölders was posted to ''Fliegergruppe Schwerin'' (I./JG 162 &quot;Immelmann&quot;). On 7 March 1936, during the [[remilitarisation of the Rhineland]], Mölders and his squadron (''[[Organization of the Luftwaffe (1933–1945)#Staffel|Staffel]]'') flew from [[Lippstadt]] across the [[Ruhrgebiet|Ruhr region]]; his unit was the first to arrive in [[Düsseldorf]]. During this period, Mölders met Luise Baldauf, whom he was to marry a few years later, shortly before his death. On 20 April 1936, [[Adolf Hitler]]'s birthday, numerous promotions were handed out, and Mölders advanced to ''[[Oberleutnant]]'', effective as of 1 April 1936. At the same time, he became leader of the fighter training squadron of the 2nd Group of [[Jagdgeschwader 134]] &quot;Horst Wessel&quot;. This group was under the command of ''[[Major]]'' [[Theo Osterkamp]], who became another of Mölders' early mentors. Mölders was appointed squadron leader (''[[Staffelkapitän]]'') of the 1st squadron of [[Jagdgeschwader 334]] on 15 March 1937 and served as an instructor in [[Wiesbaden]].&lt;ref&gt;Obermaier and Held 1996, pp. 11–12, 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Condor Legion==
In 1936, the Germans sent a ''Luftwaffe'' force, the [[Condor Legion]], to assist the [[Falange|Falangists]] in the [[Spanish Civil War]]. Mölders volunteered for service, and arrived by sea in [[Cadiz]] on 14 April 1938. He was assigned to the 3rd squadron of [[Jagdgruppe 88]] (J 88) commanded by ''Oberleutnant'' [[Adolf Galland]]. The unit, stationed at the [[Valencia (province)|Valencia]]–[[Battle of the Ebro|Ebro front]], was equipped with the [[Heinkel He 51]], but later switched to the [[Messerschmitt Bf 109|Messerschmitt Bf 109 B-2]].&lt;!-- The He 51s were turned over to the 4th squadron, commanded by ''Hauptmann'' Eberhard d'Elsa, and continued in service until the end of the Spanish Civil War.--&gt; Mölders assumed command of the squadron on 24 May 1938, when Galland returned to Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Obermaier and Held 1996, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed his first aerial victory, shooting down a [[Polikarpov I-15]] &quot;Chato&quot; (&quot;Curtiss&quot; to the Germans) near [[Algar, Spain|Algar]], on 15 July 1938.&lt;ref&gt;Obermaier and Held 1996, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Over the remaining months of the year, Mölders became the leading ace of the Condor Legion, shooting down 15 aircraft in Spain: two I-15 &quot;Curtiss&quot;, 12 [[Polikarpov I-16|I-16 &quot;Rata&quot;]] and one [[Tupolev SB]] (one &quot;Rata&quot; claimed on 23 September 1938 was not confirmed).&lt;ref name=&quot;Obermaier and Held 1996, p. 40&quot;&gt;Obermaier and Held 1996, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Cross-Over.jpg|thumb|upright|''Schwarm'' formation and cross-over turn&lt;ref&gt;Spick 1996, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;|alt=The flight paths of four aircraft travelling in an asymmetrical V formation: the leading aircraft at the tip of the V-shape is aircraft 1, followed by aircraft 2 on its left, and aircraft 3 and 4 on its right. For the entire formation to execute a 90-degree right-hand turn, aircraft 2 is the first aircraft to make the turn, rising and passing over the flight paths of aircraft 1, 3 and 4. The flight path of aircraft 1 is next to curve right, passing over the flight paths of aircraft 3 and 4. Then the flight path of aircraft 3 curves right at a 90° angle, passing over the path of aircraft 4, which is the last to turn right. Once all four aircraft have completed the turn, aircraft 2 is to the right of aircraft 1, which has aircraft 3 on its left, followed by aircraft 4 on the far left of the formation.]]
In recognition of his exceptional performance as a commander and fighter pilot, Mölders was promoted to ''[[Hauptmann]]'' ([[Captain (land)|captain]]) on 18 October 1938, effective as of 1 October 1938. He claimed his 14th and final confirmed aerial victory of the conflict by downing a [[Polikarpov I-16]] &quot;Rata&quot; near Mola on 3 November 1938&lt;ref&gt;Obermaier and Held 1996, pp. 12, 32.&lt;/ref&gt; and returned to Germany on 5 December 1938.&lt;ref&gt;Obermaier and Held 1996, pp. 14, 33, 40.&lt;/ref&gt; From 6 December 1938 until March 1939, Mölders was a member of the 1st group of [[Jagdgeschwader 133]] (JG 133) and held a staff position with the [[Inspector of Fighters]] at the ''[[Reichsluftfahrtministerium]]'' (Imperial Air Ministry) in Berlin. His task was to devise new fighter pilot tactics.  In March 1939 he was given command as ''[[Staffelkapitän]]'' of 1./JG 133, taking over command from ''Oberleutnant'' [[Hubertus von Bonin]]. JG 133 was later renamed [[Jagdgeschwader 53]] ''Pik As'' (''Ace of Spades'').&lt;ref name=&quot;Obermaier page33&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Prien 1997, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=&quot;Notes&quot;&gt;For an explanation of ''Luftwaffe'' unit designations see [[Luftwaffe Organisation|Organisation of the Luftwaffe during World War II]].&lt;/ref&gt;

For his achievements in Spain, Mölders was honoured with the Spanish ''Medalla de la Campaña'' and ''[[Medalla Militar]]'' on 4 May 1939 and the German [[Spanish Cross|Spanish Cross in Gold with Swords and Diamonds]] (''Spanienkreuz in Gold mit Schwertern und Brillanten'') on 6 June 1939.&lt;ref&gt;Obermaier and Held 1996, pp. 33, 89.&lt;/ref&gt; The Condor Legion officially returned to Germany on 6 June 1939 and troops marched through Berlin to the [[Lustgarten]], where the fallen were honoured. A formal state [[banquet]] for the most highly decorated soldiers was held in the marble gallery of the [[Reich Chancellery]]. Mölders was seated at table 1, with ''[[General der Flieger]]'' [[Hugo Sperrle]], General Don Antonio Aranda, General [[Gonzalo Queipo de Llano]], ''Oberst'' [[Walter Warlimont]], ''Oberstleutnant'' von Donat, ''Leutnant'' [[Reinhard Seiler]] and ''Oberfeldwebel'' Ignatz Prestele.&lt;ref&gt;Obermaier and Held 1996, pp. 88–92.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tactical innovations===
With other airmen in Spain, Mölders developed the formation known as the &quot;[[finger-four]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spick p15&quot; /&gt; This improved the all-round field of vision and combat flexibility of a [[Flight (military unit)|flight]] ([[Luftwaffe Organisation#Schwarm, Rotte and Kette|''Schwarm'']]), enhanced mutual protection, and encouraged pilot initiative. In the &quot;finger-four&quot;, the aircraft assumed positions corresponding to the fingertips of an outstretched hand. The fighters flew in two elements (''Rotten'') of two aircraft each; two ''Rotten'' (four aircraft) made up a ''[[Schwarm]]'' (swarm).&lt;ref name=&quot;Spick p15&quot; /&gt;

Mölders is often credited with inventing the cross-over turn.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spick p15&quot;&gt;Spick 1996, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; An early version of the manoeuvre, as used by a [[V formation|&quot;Vic&quot;]] of five aircraft (a tight formation forming the letter &quot;V&quot;), appeared in the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) Training Manual of 1922, and the manoeuvre may even date back to 1918. However, it had fallen into disuse due to the difficulty of performing it in a multi-aircraft formation with the contemporary spacing of less than {{convert|100|ft|m}} between aircraft. The wide lateral separation of {{convert|1800|ft|m}} introduced by J 88 both necessitated such a turning manoeuvre, to enable a ''Schwarm'' to turn as a unit, and minimised the risk of midair collisions previously associated with it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spick p15&quot;&gt;Spick 1996, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War II==
===Phoney War and the Battle of France===
At the outbreak of [[World War II]] on 1 September 1939, Mölders' ''Staffel'' was stationed in the west protecting Germany's border in the [[Moselle River|Mosel]]–[[Saar (protectorate)|Saar]]–[[Palatinate (region)|Pfalz]] region.&lt;ref name=&quot;Obermaier and Held 1996, p. 14&quot;&gt;Obermaier and Held 1996, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 September 1939, Mölders' fighter suffered an engine failure; he crash-landed, flipping the aircraft over and injuring his back. The injury kept him out of combat for several days.&lt;ref&gt;Prien 1997, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to flying on 19 September. The following day, between [[Contz]] and  [[Sierck]], at the apex of the ''Dreiländereck'',&lt;ref name=&quot;Weal p. 13.&quot;&gt;Weal 2007, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;
over the [[Vaalserberg|three borders area]], he shot down his first aircraft of the war, a [[Curtiss P-36 Hawk|Curtiss P-36]] (according to other historians, it was one of a trio of French Hawk H-75As &lt;ref name=&quot;Weal p. 13.&quot;/&gt;), of ''Groupe de Chasse'' II/5 (Sgt Queginer baled out). Thanks to that victory, he earned the [[Iron Cross]] 2nd Class.&lt;ref name=&quot;Obermaier page33&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Prien 1997, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;
He recalled his first victory:
{{Cquote|I took off with my ''Schwarm'' at 14.27 hrs to intercept six enemy monoplanes reported south of [[Trier]]. As the ''Schwarm'' overflew the river [[Saar (river)|Saar]] near [[Merzig]] at 4500 meters, six machines were sighted south of Conz at 5000 meters. I climbed above the enemy in a wide curve to the north and carried out a surprise  attack on the rearmost machine. I opened fire from approximately 50 metres, whereupon the Curtiss began to fishtail. After a further lengthy burst, smoke came out or the machine and individual pieces flew off it. It then tipped forward into a dive and I lost sight of it, as I had to  defend myself against other opponents newly arriving on the scene.}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Weal p. 13.&quot;/&gt;

On 26 September 1939, JG 53 was ordered to form its ''III. Gruppe''. Mölders  relinquished command  of 1./JG 53 to ''Oberleutnant'' [[Hans-Karl Mayer]] and organized the formation of III./JG 53 at [[Wiesbaden]]–[[Erbenheim]]; within two weeks, ''[[Gruppenkommandeur]]'' Mölders  reported that the ''Gruppe'' was conditionally operational with 40 pilots and 48 aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;Prien 1997, pp. 50–51.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 December, Mölders, leading four Bf 109s from III./JG 53, engaged three [[Hawker Hurricane]]s over the Saar River, between [[Metz]] and [[Thionville]], that were trying to intercept an unidentified aircraft.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weal p. 44.&quot;&gt;Weal 1999, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; Mölders and [[Hans von Hahn]] shot down two Hurricanes flown by Sergeants R.M. Perry and J. Winn, becoming the first German fighter pilots to shoot down a Hawker Hurricane. Mölders shot down another Hurricane on 2 April, when he forced Flight Lieutenant C.D. &quot;Pussy&quot; Palmer of [[No. 1 Squadron RAF]], to bail out, and on 20 April, he destroyed a French Curtiss P-36 HawkA east of [[Saarbrücken]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Weal p. 46.&quot;&gt;Weal 1999, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time the [[Phoney War]] ended and [[Battle of France#May: Fall Gelb, Low Countries and northern France|Operation Case Yellow]] (''Fall Gelb'', the invasion of France and the [[Low Countries]] on 10 May 1940) opened the [[Battle of France]], Mölders' tally of aerial victories on the Western Front had increased to nine. This number included one [[Bristol Blenheim]], two Curtiss P-36 Hawks, two [[Morane-Saulnier M.S.406]]s and four Hawker Hurricanes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Obermaier and Held 1996, p. 40&quot;/&gt; On 14 May, while engaging enemy bombers over [[Battle of Sedan (1940)|Sedan]], Mölders was shot down, but bailed out safely.&lt;ref&gt;Hooton 2007, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed his 19th and 20th victories on 27 May 1940, downing two Curtiss Hawks {{convert|15|km|mi}} southwest of [[Amiens]]. Subsequently, he became the first fighter pilot to be awarded the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross]] (''Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes'') and on 29 May 1940 was honourably mentioned in the ''[[Wehrmachtbericht]]'' radio report, the first of 11 such mentions.&lt;ref&gt;Obermaier and Held 1996, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 June 1940, on his 133rd combat mission of the war, engaging in aerial combat for the 32nd time, Mölders was shot down near [[Compiègne]] at about 18:40 by ''[[Sous lieutenant]]'' [[René Pomier Layrargues]], flying a [[French Air Force]] [[Dewoitine D.520]].&lt;ref&gt;Hooton 2007, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; Mölders was taken prisoner but liberated three weeks later upon the armistice with France.&lt;ref name=&quot;Obermaier page33&quot;/&gt; While in French captivity, Mölders asked to shake hands with the pilot who had shot him down, and learned that Pomier-Layrargues had been [[killed in action]] 30 minutes after their encounter. His initial experience in French captivity was harsh; he sustained abrasions to his face and his Knight's Cross was stolen from him. A French officer, ''Capitaine'' Giron, intervened, ensured he was treated fairly, and returned the stolen medal. When a French soldier was later sentenced to death by the Germans for beating Mölders, Mölders approached [[Hermann Göring]] and requested clemency, which was granted.&lt;ref&gt;Obermaier and Held 1996, pp. 16–18, 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

Returning to Germany, Mölders was promoted to ''[[Major]]'' on 19 July 1940 and took command the following day of [[Jagdgeschwader 51|Fighter Wing 51]] (JG 51) from the recently promoted ''[[Generalmajor]]'' [[Theo Osterkamp]].&lt;ref&gt;Aders and Held 1993, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, JG 51 were based at [[Saint-Inglevert Airfield|Saint-Inglevert]], [[Pas-de-Calais]], France.&lt;ref name=Old&gt;[http://www.anciens-aerodromes.com/?p=2150 &quot;Saint-Inglevert&quot; (in French).] ''Les Anciens Aérodromes.'' Retrieved: 7 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Mölders flew his first combat sortie with JG 51 on 28 July, attacking a No. 41 Squadron [[Supermarine Spitfire]] flown by [[Flying Officer]] A.D.J. Lovell.&lt;ref name=&quot;Obermaier and Held p19&quot;/&gt; On this mission, according to legend, Mölders was hit in a dogfight over [[Dover]] by the South African ace [[Sailor Malan]], sustaining three splinter wounds in the lower leg, one in the knee and one in the left foot. ''Oberleutnant'' [[Richard Leppla]] shot down the pursuing Spitfire, and Mölders was able to make an emergency landing at [[Wissant]], France.&lt;ref&gt;Aders and Held p63&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan 2007, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; Recent research suggests Mölders was actually wounded in combat by [[Flight Lieutenant]] J.L. Webster in a Spitfire of [[No. 41 Squadron RAF|41 Squadron]]. Webster was killed in action on 5 September 1940.&lt;ref name=&quot;Obermaier and Held p19&quot;&gt;Obermaier and Held 1996, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shores and Williams 1994, p. 622.&lt;/ref&gt; His wounds, although not serious, kept Mölders from further operational flying for a month. ''Generalmajor'' Osterkamp briefly led the'' Geschwader'' again during Mölders' convalescence. On 7 August 1940, Mölders returned to the ''Geschwader'' without medical clearance for combat, to participate in [[Operation Eagle Attack]] (code name ''[[Adlertag]]''). [[Adolf Hitler]] had issued [[Führer Directives|Führer Directive]] no. 17 (''Weisung Nr.'' 17) on 1 August 1940; the strategic objective was to engage and defeat the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) so as to achieve [[air superiority]] in preparation for [[Operation Sea Lion]] (''Unternehmen Seelöwe''), the proposed amphibious invasion of Great Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Aders and Held p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mölders returned to approved operational flying status and flew his next two combat missions on 28 August 1940. His aide and wingman, ''Oberleutnant'' Kircheis, was shot down and taken [[prisoner of war|prisoner]] during one of these missions; ''Oberleutnant'' Georg Claus took his place.&lt;ref&gt;Aders and Held 1993, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; Mölders claimed two Hurricanes on 31 August and was mentioned again in the ''[[Wehrmachtbericht]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Obermaier and Held p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Oberleutnant'' Victor Mölders, his younger brother, who had been appointed ''Staffelkapitän'' of the 2./JG 51 on 11 September, was shot down and taken prisoner of war on 5 October 1940.&lt;ref&gt;Aders and Held 1993, pp. 69, 71.&lt;/ref&gt; Two Spitfires of  [[No. 92 Squadron RAF]] (Sgt PR Eyles and P/O HP Hill both killed) were shot down near [[Dungeness (headland)|Dungeness]] on 20 September increased Mölders' tally of aerial victories to 40. He was the first fighter pilot to reach this number during the war and was awarded the 2nd [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross#Knight's Cross with Oak Leaves (mit Eichenlaub)|Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves]] (''Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes mit Eichenlaub'') on 21 September 1940. The award was presented by Adolf Hitler on 23 September in the new ''[[Reichskanzlei]]'' in Berlin.  After the award ceremony, Hermann Göring invited Mölders to his hunting lodge in the [[Rominter Heide]].&lt;ref&gt;Obermaier and Held 1996, pp. 19–20, 34, 122.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mölders returned to his unit by the end of September and continued to win aerial victories. On 11 October, Mölders claimed his 43rd victory. The [[No. 66 Squadron RAF|66 Squadron]] [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire I]] ''X4562'' was flown by [[Pilot Officer]] J. H. T. Pickering, who bailed out, wounded, over [[Canterbury]].&lt;ref&gt;Weal 1999, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Three Hurricanes on 12 October brought his tally to 51 victories, and he received a preferential promotion to ''[[Oberstleutnant]]'' in recognition of his 50 victories on 25 October 1940.&lt;ref name=&quot;Obermaier page34&quot;/&gt; While a severe bout of [[influenza]] then kept him grounded for a few weeks, his wingman in over 60 aerial combats, ''Oberleutnant'' Georg Claus, was killed over the [[Thames]].&lt;ref&gt;Obermaier and Held 1996, pp. 20, 124–125.&lt;/ref&gt;  On 1 December, Mölders claimed his last and 55th victory of 1940, 25 of which occurred in the [[Battle of France]] and 30 in the [[Battle of Britain]].&lt;ref&gt;Obermaier and Held 1996, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mölders and members of JG 53 spent a couple of weeks of [[R&amp;R (military)|R&amp;R]] skiing in the [[Vorarlberg]] before continuing operations against the RAF over the Channel and occupied France during early 1941.&lt;ref&gt;Obermaier and Held 1996, pp. 21, 137–141.&lt;/ref&gt; His new wingman from January 1941 was ''Oberleutnant'' [[Hartmann Grasser]].&lt;ref&gt;Obermaier and Held 1996, p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt; Mölders claimed his first aerial victory after the lengthy vacation on 10 February 1941; his tally reached 60 on 26 February and stood at 68&amp; when the ''Geschwader'' was recalled from the Channel front. His logbook showed 238 combat missions plus an additional 71 reconnaissance flights; he had engaged in aerial combat 70 times.&lt;ref&gt;Obermaier and Held 1996, pp. 21, 40–41.&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1941, JG 51 and the majority of the ''Luftwaffe'' were transferred to the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] in preparation for [[Operation Barbarossa]], the invasion of the [[Soviet Union]]. On the first day of combat operations, 22 June 1941, Mölders shot down three [[Tupolev SB]] bombers and one [[P-36 Hawk|Curtis Hawk]], earning him the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross#Knight's Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords (mit Eichenlaub und Schwertern)|Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords]] (''Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes mit Eichenlaub und Schwertern''). Mölders was only the second German serviceman to receive this award; [[Adolf Galland]], Fighter Squadron Commodore (''Geschwaderkommodore'') of [[Jagdgeschwader 26|Fighter Squadron 26]], had received one the day before.&lt;ref&gt;Obermaier and Held 1996, pp. 21, 41.&lt;/ref&gt; The award was presented by Adolf Hitler on 3 July 1941 in the ''[[Wolfsschanze]]'' [[Führerhauptquartier|Hitler's Headquarters]] in [[Rastenburg]]. On 30 June, Mölders had become the highest-scoring fighter pilot in the history of aerial warfare after downing five Soviet bombers&lt;ref&gt;Bergström 2007, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; and bringing his tally to 82, two more than the record set in [[World War I]] by the &quot;Red Baron&quot;, [[Manfred von Richthofen]].&lt;ref&gt;Weal 2001, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 July 1941, JG 51 under the leadership of Mölders reported that it had destroyed 500 Soviet aircraft since the beginning of hostilities against the Soviets on 22 June, and had suffered three casualties. That day, JG 51 also reported its 1,200th aerial victory of the war, the credit going to ''Hauptmann'' Leppla.&lt;ref&gt;Aders and Held 1993, p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; Three days later, on 15 July 1941, Mölders surpassed the ''[[100 (number)|C]]'' mark, claiming victories Nos. 100 and 101, and celebrated with a [[Aileron roll|victory roll]] over the airfield.&lt;ref&gt;Weal 2001, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; The following day he received news that he had been awarded the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross#Knight's Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords, and Diamonds (mit Eichenlaub, Schwertern und Brillanten)|Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords and Diamonds]] (''Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes mit Eichenlaub, Schwertern und Brillanten'').&lt;ref&gt;Obermaier and Held 1996, pp. 21, 35.&lt;/ref&gt; Mölders was the first of 27 German servicemen to receive this award. The diamonds added to the Knight's Cross were introduced officially on 28 September 1941, more than two months after Mölders earned the award. Mölders was promoted to ''[[Oberst]]'' on 20 July 1941, effective immediately, and banned from further combat flying. Surrendering command of JG 51 to Major [[Friedrich Beckh]] he was transferred to the [[Reichsluftfahrtministerium|Reich Air Ministry]], a temporary position he held until 6 August 1941. Mölders was summoned to the ''Wolfsschanze'' again, where he received the Diamonds from Adolf Hitler on 26 July 1941. On 7 August 1941, he was appointed [[Inspector of Fighters]] (''Inspekteur der Jagdflieger'').&lt;ref name=&quot;Obermaier&amp;Held p35&quot;/&gt;

===High command===
An ''[[Oberst]]'' at 28, Mölders was appointed [[Inspector of Fighters|Inspector General of Fighters]], a post responsible for deciding the ongoing tactical and operational doctrine of the ''Luftwaffe'''s fighter strategies. Returning to Russia in September 1941, he set up a command post at Chaplinka airfield, from where he flew in his personal [[Fieseler Fi 156]] ''Storch'' (stork) on tours of the ''[[Jagdwaffe]]'' and personally directed German fighter operations.&lt;ref&gt;Obermaier and Held 1996, pp. 188–189.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mölders also flew unofficially on missions, and actively commanded his old unit, JG 51, for several more months. On 9 August 1941, he took [[Herbert Kaiser]] on a &quot;teaching&quot; mission against a formation of [[Ilyushin Il-2|Il-2 ''Stormoviks'']]. Mölders showed Kaiser how to shoot them down.
He recalled later: &quot;He positioned himself off to one side of-and some distance away from-the last Il-2 in a formation of six. He then turned in quickly and opened fire at the enemy's cockpit from an angle of some 30 degrees. The Il-2 immediately burst into flames and crashed. 'Do you see how it's done?', Oberst Mölders' voice came over the R/T. 'Right, now you take the next one.' I carried out the same manoeuvre and, sure enough, the next Il-2 went down on fire. 'And again!' It was like being on a training flight. Another short burst and the third Il-2 was ablaze. The whole lesson had lasted no more than 12 minutes!&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Weal 2001, p. 29&quot;&gt;Weal 2001, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, Kaiser scored his 23rd and 24th kills. But because Mölders was officially banned from operational flying, the first Russian aircraft was never officially credited to him.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weal 2001, p. 29&quot;/&gt; Within the next two months, it is speculated that Mölders unofficially shot down around another 30 Soviet aircraft. At least six of Mölders' unofficial victories are recorded in his fellow pilots' private log books.&lt;ref&gt;Weal 2007, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===

Trees are seen in the background; the area in front of the cross is covered with low-growing plants bearing flowers.]]
On 22 November 1941, Mölders traveled as a passenger in a [[Heinkel He 111]] of [[Kampfgeschwader 27]] &quot;Boelcke&quot; from the [[Crimea]] to Germany to attend the funeral of his superior, [[Ernst Udet]], who had committed suicide. Attempting to land at [[Breslau]] during a thunderstorm, the aircraft crashed. Mölders, pilot ''Oberleutnant'' Kolbe and flight engineer ''Oberfeldwebel'' Hobbie were killed. Major Dr. Wenzel and radio operator ''Oberfeldwebel'' Tenz survived the crash landing. Dr. Wenzel sustained a broken arm and leg as well as a concussion, and Tenz a broken ankle. Mölders' fatal injuries included a broken back and a crushed ribcage. Accident investigators then and since have speculated whether Mölders would have survived the crash if he had used his seat belt.&lt;ref&gt;Obermaier and Held 1996, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mölders was given a state funeral in Berlin on 28 November 1941. His coffin was laid out in the honour court of the [[Reichsluftfahrtministerium|Imperial Air Ministry]]. The [[guard of honour]] consisted of [[Johann Schalk]], [[Günther Lützow]], [[Walter Oesau]], [[Joachim Müncheberg]], [[Adolf Galland]], [[Wolfgang Falck]], [[Herbert Kaminski]] and [[Karl-Gottfried Nordmann]]. Mölders was buried next to [[Ernst Udet]] and [[Manfred von Richthofen]] at the ''[[Invalidenfriedhof Cemetery|Invalidenfriedhof]]'' in Berlin. The [[88 mm gun|8.8 cm flak]] in Berlin [[Tiergarten]] fired a [[21-gun salute|salute]]; [[Hermann Göring]] gave the [[eulogy]].&lt;ref&gt;Obermaier and Held 1996, pp. 200–206.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life and character==

Mölders was well known for his strength of character.  His men nicknamed him &quot;Vati&quot; (Daddy), in recognition of his paternal attitude toward them, and the care he took of their well-being.&lt;ref name=&quot;Obermaier and Held 1996, p. 14&quot;/&gt;  He was a devoutly religious individual who demanded that all Allied aviators captured by those under his command be treated civilly, and often would invite captured pilots to dine with him.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weal 2006, p. 120&quot;&gt;Weal 2006, p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote box

Mölders married Luise Baldauf, née Thurner, the widow of a friend who had been killed in active service, on 13 September 1941.&lt;ref&gt;Obermaier and Held 1996, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;  Erich Klawitter, Mölders' childhood mentor, performed the religious ceremony in [[Königstein im Taunus|Falkenstein]], [[Taunus]]. Witnesses to the wedding included ''Leutnant'' [[Erwin Fleig]] and ''Oberleutnant'' Hartmann Grasser. The marriage produced a posthumous daughter, Verena.&lt;ref&gt;Obermaier and Held 1996, pp. 35, 180–182, 209.&lt;/ref&gt;

Third Reich authorities disapproved of his choice of a [[Catholic marriage]] ceremony, performed by Klawitter. Klawitter had been barred from membership in the ''[[Reichskulturkammer]]'' (Reich Culture Chamber) and was considered politically unreliable after a 1936 breach of the [[Pulpit Law]], a remnant of the 1870s ''[[Kulturkampf]]'' that barred Catholics from criticizing the state from the pulpit.&lt;ref&gt;Hagena 2008, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==

Werner Mölders' old unit, ''Jagdgeschwader 51'', was christened &quot;Mölders&quot; in his honour, on 22 November 1941, only hours after his death. Its members were entitled to wear the &quot;Mölders&quot; [[cuff title|cuffband]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Obermaier&amp;Held p35&quot;&gt;Obermaier and Held 1996, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;  His death, however, was also put to other uses.  Shortly after Mölders died, the British [[Intelligence agency]] dropped a [[Flyer (pamphlet)|flyer]] over Germany. The so called ''Möldersbrief'' (Mölders-letter) was a copy of correspondence supposedly written by Mölders to the [[Provost (religion)|provost]] of [[Schwerin]]. In this letter, he expressed his strong belief in [[Catholicism]] and stated that, especially in the face of death, many supporters of National Socialism still find strength and courage with Catholicism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hagena p67&quot;&gt;Hagena 2008, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mölders' premature death, just shortly after [[Udet]]'s own suicide, was too great an opportunity for [[Sefton Delmer]], the chief of the British [[black propaganda]] in the [[Political Warfare Executive]] (PWE), to ignore. His idea was to use Mölders' popularity in Germany, distributing a letter thus creating the assumption that Mölders strong belief led him to oppose the Nazi regime in Germany. The letter was extremely well conceived. It did not bluntly call for opposition against the state. It never even mentioned the National Socialists by name but rather used metaphors like &quot;the godless&quot;. Nevertheless every German reader knew what was meant.&lt;ref&gt;Hagena 2008, pp. 67–68.&lt;/ref&gt;

The letter caused a stir in the upper echelons of the Nazi regime. In his diaries, [[Joseph Goebbels]] assumed that someone in the German Catholic church organization wrote, and distributed, the letter. A bounty of 100,000 [[Reichsmark]], posted by the Führer himself, revealed no clues to its origins. Even the strongest repressive actions could not hinder the distribution of the letter.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hagena p67&quot;/&gt;

===Post-war honors===
[[Image:Moelders.jpg|thumb|right|Werner Mölders re-established grave site (1991) in the [[Invalidenfriedhof Cemetery|Invalidenfriedhof]] Berlin|alt=A marbled-grey stone slab, lying flat on the ground, surrounded by grass and weeds, bearing the golden inscription &quot;Oberst Werner Mölders 18.3.1913–22.11.1944&quot; just below the centre of the slab. Above the inscription, there is a small Christian cross and a terracotta bowl with flowers towards the right-hand edge of the slab.]]
The ''Invalidenfriedhof'', where Mölders is buried, lay in [[East Berlin]] and in 1975 [[East German]] officials ordered all the graves leveled. After the 1990 [[German reunification]], Mölders' grave was rebuilt and rededicated on 11 October 1991 by Mölders' school friend and ''Domherr'' of the [[St. Hedwig's Cathedral]], Heribert Rosal. The ceremony was witnessed by guests from the United States, Great Britain, Austria, Spain and Hungary.&lt;ref&gt;Obermaier and Held 1996, p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hagena 2008, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, on 13 April 1968, a [[destroyer]] of the ''[[Bundesmarine]]'' (Federal German Navy) was christened ''[[Mölders (D186)|Mölders]]'' in [[Bath, Maine]] (USA). It was in service between 1969 and 2003. As of 24 June 2005, it is the central attraction at the Navy Museum in Wilhelmshaven.&lt;ref name=&quot;Obermaier&amp;Held p35&quot;/&gt;  On 9 November 1972, a base of a battalion of the 34th Signal Regiment of the ''[[Bundeswehr]]'' (Federal German Army) in [[Visselhövede]] received the name &quot;Mölders&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Obermaier&amp;Held p36&quot;&gt;Obermaier and Held 1996, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;  Most recently, the Fighter Wing 74 ([[Jagdgeschwader 74]]), stationed in [[Neuburg an der Donau]], received the name &quot;Mölders&quot; in 1973. Fighter Ace ''[[Generalleutnant]]'' [[Günther Rall]] presented the cuffbands.&lt;ref&gt;Obermaier and Held 1996, pp. 214–218.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reversal of honors: report by the Office for Military History and its consequences===
Mölders' career and legacy offer an example of the challenges posed in placing the heroism of the German armed forces in the post-war cultural, political and social setting.  In 1998, on the occasion of the 61st anniversary of the bombing of the Spanish town of [[Guernica (town)|Guernica]] during the Spanish Civil War, the [[Bundestag|German Parliament]] decided that members of the Condor Legion, such as Mölders, should &quot;no longer be honoured&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Obermaier&amp;Held p36&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hagena 2008, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2005, the German Ministry of Defence (''[[Bundesministerium der Verteidigung]]'') decided to remove the name &quot;Mölders&quot; from the JG 74. The decision was confirmed  on 11 March 2005 by the Federal Minister of Defence [[Peter Struck]], and at 10:00, the flags and cufftitles were removed.&lt;ref&gt;Hagena 2008, p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mölders' supporters challenged the ruling, and pointed out that Mölders had been posted to Spain well after the [[bombing of Guernica]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Weal 2006, p. 120&quot;/&gt; They pointed to his equivocal political attitude towards National Socialism and his unequivocal moral commitment to Catholicism.  Not only did he have a Catholic ''religious'' marriage ceremony but Klawitter, regarded by the Third Reich as politically &quot;unreliable,&quot; had performed the ceremony.  Furthermore, Mölders had joined the Catholic youth organisation ''Bund Neudeutschland'' ''(Union for New Germany)'' on 1 October 1925 and had been a youth leader of the organization from 1929 to 1931. The Third Reich clearly had considered the  ''Bund Neudeutschland'' as a threat:  The ''[[Völkischer Beobachter]]'' (''The People's Observer'', the official newspaper of the party) had reported on 26 January 1938 that  the ''Bund'' had been outlawed for its proven subversive activities against the Reich, based on the ''Verordnung des Reichspräsidenten zum Schutz von Volk und Staat'' (''Reich Presidential Decree for the Protection of People and State'') of 28 February 1933.&lt;ref&gt;Hagena 2008, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite petitions from politicians and high-ranking active and retired servicemen, among them [[Horst Seehofer]], [[Günther Rall]] and [[Jörg Kuebart]], the [[German Armed Forces Military History Research Office|Office for Military History]] (MGFA) noted that Mölders' membership in the ''Bund Neudeutschland'' did not provide sufficient evidence of his having been critical of the regime, but rather showed the contrary and  concluded that it was questionable whether Mölders had distanced himself enough from National Socialism before his death in 1941.  Consequently, the decision remained in force.&lt;ref&gt;Hagena 2008, p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan 2007, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other evidence has surfaced illustrating Mölders' ambiguous relationship with the National Socialist regime. Mölders may have been in contact with [[bishop]] [[Clemens August Graf von Galen]], who was highly critical of the Nazi regime. Von Galen publicly criticized the regime for the [[Gestapo|Gestapo's]] tactics and the deportation and [[euthanasia]] of the mentally ill. According to the diary kept by Heinrich Portmann, von Galen's secretary and chaplain, Mölders threatened to return his awards if von Galen's euthanasia accusation turned out to be true. Furthermore, Portmann stated that Hitler had asked Mölders during the presentation of the Diamonds to the Knight's Cross if there was anything he wished for. Mölders reportedly responded, &quot;Please leave the bishop of Münster alone.&quot; Hitler assured him that &quot;Yes, nothing will happen to the bishop of Münster.&quot; The MGFA concluded in 2004 that this story was most likely false. The MGFA revised its position again on 28 June 2007, concluding that there had been contact between Mölders and von Galen.&lt;ref&gt;Hagena 2008, pp. 60–64.&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence also demonstrates Mölders' propensity to value friendships over political expediency. According to Viktor Mölders, his brother had saved Georg Küch, one of Werner Mölders' closest friends, who had been classified as a [[Mischling|half-Jew]] by the [[Nuremberg Laws]], from death in the concentration camps. Mölders' and Küch's friendship dated to their school days at the Saldria-Gymnasium in Brandenburg an der Havel. Küch's mother, Alice née Siegel, was of Jewish birth.&lt;ref&gt;Hagena 2008, p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; Küch's father, Richard Küch, owned and operated a [[pharmacy]] in Brandenburg. Georg, himself a pharmacy student, was expelled from university under the Nuremberg Laws, just two semesters shy of his graduation. In 1940, Richard Küch fell ill, and owning and operating the pharmacy became a bureaucratic problem for the family. Georg Küch contacted his friend Mölders in mid-February 1941, asking for help. Werner Mölders immediately responded to Küch on 16 February 1941, stating that he had taken care of the matter and asking Küch not to pursue the issue on his own. When Richard Küch died in June 1941, his wife was able to sell the pharmacy for fair market value. Normally, since she was Jewish, it would have been confiscated.  She also remained exempt from wearing the detested [[yellow badge]] until late 1943. She was then taken to the [[Theresienstadt]] concentration camp, where she worked as a cook. Georg Küch, Alice Küch, and Georg's sister Friedel survived the [[Holocaust]]. Friedel Küch repeatedly stated that Werner Mölders had been responsible for protecting the family; the mantle of his protection had persisted beyond his death.&lt;ref&gt;Hagena 2008, 74–83.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[German Armed Forces Military History Research Office|MGFA]] ruled this assertion &quot;highly speculative,&quot; and did not investigate further.&lt;ref&gt;Hagena 2008, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;
