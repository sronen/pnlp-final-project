[[Lieutenant General (Australia)|Lieutenant General]] '''Sir Edmund Francis Herring''', [[Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George|KCMG]], [[Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire|KBE]], [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]], [[Military Cross|MC]], [[Venerable Order of Saint John|KStJ]], [[Efficiency Decoration|ED]], [[Queen's Counsel|QC]] (2&amp;nbsp;September&amp;nbsp;1892 – 5&amp;nbsp;January&amp;nbsp;1982) was an [[Australian Army]] officer during the Second World War, [[Lieutenant Governor]] of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], and [[Chief Justice]] of the [[Supreme Court of Victoria]].

A [[Rhodes Scholarship|Rhodes scholar]], Herring was at [[New College, Oxford]], when the First World War broke out and served with the [[Royal Field Artillery]] on the [[Macedonian front (World War I)|Macedonian front]], for which he was awarded the [[Military Cross]] and [[Distinguished Service Order]]. After the war he carved out a successful career as a [[barrister]] and [[King's Counsel]]. He also joined the Australian Army, rising to the rank of [[colonel]] by 1939.

During the Second World War, he commanded the [[Australian 6th Division|6th Division]] Artillery in the [[Western Desert Campaign]] and the [[Battle of Greece]]. In 1942, as a corps commander, he commanded the land forces in the [[Kokoda Track campaign]]. The following year, he directed operations at [[Lae]] and [[Nadzab]].

Herring left his corps to become the longest-serving Chief Justice and Lieutenant Governor of Victoria, serving for three decades. In the latter capacity, he was patron of many charitable organisations.

==Education and early life==
Edmund Francis Herring, known as Ned to his family, was born in [[Maryborough, Victoria]], on 2&amp;nbsp;September&amp;nbsp;1892, the third of five children of Edmund Selwyn Herring, a solicitor, and his Irish-born wife Gertrude Stella Herring, formerly Fetherstonhaugh. He was educated at Maryborough College and High School and at [[Melbourne Grammar]], where he excelled at tennis and [[cricket]], and was both [[School Captain]] and [[Dux]] in 1910. While at Melbourne Grammar, he served in the [[Australian Army Cadets|Commonwealth Cadet Corps]], reaching the rank of [[sergeant]].&lt;ref&gt;Sayers, ''Ned Herring'', pp. 1, 5, 9, 15–20.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1911, Herring entered [[Trinity College (University of Melbourne)|Trinity College]], the [[Church of England]] residential college at the [[University of Melbourne]], where he played cricket and tennis. In 1912, he won a [[Rhodes Scholarship]] to the University of Oxford in England. There, he joined the [[Officers Training Corps]] in 1913. In November of that year he enlisted as a trooper in [[King Edward's Horse]], a cavalry unit in the [[British Army]].&lt;ref&gt;Sayers, ''Ned Herring'', pp. 20–26, 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

==First World War==
King Edward's Horse was mobilised in August 1914, but was not immediately sent overseas. In December 1914, Herring was commissioned as a [[second lieutenant]] in the [[Royal Field Artillery]], and was posted to B Battery, 99th Field Artillery Brigade of the [[22nd Division (United Kingdom)|British 22nd Division]].&lt;ref&gt;Sayers, ''Ned Herring'', pp. 39–41.&lt;/ref&gt; The division moved to the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] in August 1915, but was there only a month before being transferred to the [[Macedonian front (World War I)|Macedonian front]], where it served for the rest of the war. 

In the [[Battle of Doiran (1917)|Battle of Doiran]] in April 1917, Herring served as an [[artillery observer]], directing artillery fire in support of the 22nd Division's attack from a front line [[observation post]] on Pip Ridge. There was a furious artillery duel. Twenty minutes after Captain Thomas Winwood took Herring's place as forward observer, the observation post took a direct hit from an enemy shell, killing Winwood.&lt;ref&gt;Sayers, ''Ned Herring'', p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; Herring succeeded Winwood as battery captain, and was promoted to acting [[Captain (army/air force)|captain]] in April 1917.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette |issue=30191 |supp=yes |date=17 July 1917 |startpage=7318 |accessdate=25 February 2008}} ''Promotion to acting captain.''&lt;/ref&gt; For his &quot;conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty&quot; under heavy shellfire, Herring received an immediate award of the [[Military Cross]].&lt;ref name=LondonGazette30204&gt;{{LondonGazette |issue=30204 |date=24 July 1917 |startpage=7630 |accessdate=31 October 2007 |supp=yes}} ''Military Cross (MC).''&lt;/ref&gt;

After three years' service, Herring was granted three weeks' leave in Australia in October 1917. He returned to Maryborough, where he met [[Mary Herring|Mary Ranken Lyle]], the daughter of the mathematical physicist [[Thomas Ranken Lyle|Thomas Lyle]], then a medical student at the [[University of Melbourne]], on New Year's Day 1918. The two became constant companions and agreed to correspond regularly.&lt;ref&gt;Hilton, ''Dr Mary'', pp. 7–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Herring departed for Salonika in February, returning to duty there in March 1918, and was promoted to acting [[Major (United Kingdom)|major]] on 24 October 1918 on assuming command of B Battery, 99th Field Artillery Brigade.&lt;ref&gt;Sayers, ''Ned Herring'', pp. 58–59, 67.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette |issue=31103 |supp=yes |date=31 December 1918 |startpage=154 |accessdate=25 February 2008}} ''Promotion to acting major.''&lt;/ref&gt; For his service as a [[Artillery battery|battery]] commander, he was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Order]].&lt;ref name=LondonGazette31373&gt;{{LondonGazette |issue=31373 |date=30 May 1919 |startpage=6951 |accessdate=31 October 2007 |supp=yes}} ''Companion of the Distinguished Service Order (DSO).''&lt;/ref&gt;  He reverted to lieutenant on ceasing to command the battery on 22 January 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette |issue=31272 |supp=yes |date=4 April 1919 |startpage=4498 |accessdate=25 February 2008}}  ''Reversion to lieutenant.''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Between the wars==
When the war ended, Herring wished to return to Australia and see Mary before resuming his studies at the University of Oxford in October 1919. Mary wrote back pointing out the impracticality of this idea; while she would be disappointed not to see him, he should remain in England and complete his course at Oxford first.&lt;ref&gt;Hilton, ''Dr Mary'', p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; The university had awarded him a wartime Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree in 1915; the [[Rhodes Scholarship]] Trust allowed him to resume his scholarship, and he studied for a [[Bachelor of Civil Law]] (BCL) degree. Since it had been five years since he had been awarded his BA, he was entitled to a [[Master of Arts (postgraduate)|MA]] as well, and graduated with both degrees in July 1920. After a holiday in Britain and France with his sister Kathleen, he arrived back in Melbourne on 26 November 1920.&lt;ref&gt;Sayers, ''Ned Herring'', pp. 72–77.&lt;/ref&gt;

Herring was admitted to practice in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] as a [[barrister]] and solicitor on 1&amp;nbsp;March&amp;nbsp;1921 and signed the roll of counsel of the Victorian Bar on 8&amp;nbsp;June of that year, while Mary graduated with her [[Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery]] (MB&amp;nbsp;BS) and became a [[Residency (medicine)|resident]] surgeon at [[Royal Melbourne Hospital]]. The two were married on 6&amp;nbsp;April&amp;nbsp;1922, and had three daughters, Mary Cecile (Molly), born in 1924, Judith Ann (Judy), born in 1926, and Margaret Lyle, born in 1933. Herring worked as a barrister, and lectured in law at the [[University of Melbourne]]. He became a [[King's Counsel]] on 25&amp;nbsp;February&amp;nbsp;1936. Mary worked as a physician at antenatal clinics.&lt;ref&gt;Sayers, ''Ned Herring'', pp. 82–83, 87–88, 100, 106.&lt;/ref&gt;

Herring joined the [[Australian Army]] on 1&amp;nbsp;October&amp;nbsp;1922 as a legal staff officer in the part time [[Australian Army Reserve|militia]], with the rank of [[Captain (army/air force)|captain]]. On 1&amp;nbsp;August&amp;nbsp;1923 he transferred to [[Royal Regiment of Australian Artillery|Australian Field Artillery]]. He was promoted to major on 1&amp;nbsp;July&amp;nbsp;1925, [[lieutenant colonel]] on 1&amp;nbsp;July&amp;nbsp;1929, and temporary [[colonel]] on 1&amp;nbsp;August&amp;nbsp;1939, commanding the [[Australian 3rd Division|3rd Division]] Artillery.&lt;ref&gt;''The Army List of Officers of the Australian Military Forces'', October 1950.&lt;/ref&gt;

Herring was involved in politics throughout the 1930s. He was elected to the [[Melbourne Club]] in 1927, a year before Sir Thomas Lyle became its president. He joined the [[Nationalist Party of Australia|Young Nationalists]], an organisation founded by [[Robert Menzies]] and [[Wilfrid Kent Hughes]].&lt;ref&gt;Sayers, ''Ned Herring'', pp. 94–96.&lt;/ref&gt; Along with many senior army and ex-army officers, he was also a member of the clandestine far-right wing paramilitary organisation known as the White Guard, White Army or League of National Security. Composed primarily of former soldiers, the White Guard saw themselves as defenders of order who stood ready to stop a Catholic or Communist revolution in the wake of an emergency like the [[1923 Victorian Police strike]].&lt;ref&gt;Sayers, ''Ned Herring'', pp. 91–92.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''Soldiers in Politics'', pp. 168–169.&lt;/ref&gt; After failing to gain [[United Australia Party]] preselection for the Victorian Legislative Assembly seat of [[Prahran, Victoria|Prahran]] in 1931, he ran as an unendorsed candidate (i.e. one lacking formal [[political endorsement]]) for the seat of [[Brighton, Victoria|Brighton]] in 1936. He gained 12,258 votes, losing by just 528.&lt;ref&gt;Sayers, ''Ned Herring'', pp. 103–105.&lt;/ref&gt; Herring also joined the Christian service organisation [[Toc H]] in 1925 and became its Victorian Area Commissioner in 1936.&lt;ref&gt;Sayers, ''Ned Herring'', p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second World War==
On 6 October 1939, Herring was informed that [[Major General (Australia)|Major General]] Sir [[Thomas Blamey]] had decided to appoint him as Commander, Royal Artillery, of the [[Australian 6th Division|6th Division]], of the new [[Second Australian Imperial Force]] (AIF) being raised for service overseas. A week later, Herring was promoted to substantive [[colonel]] and temporary [[brigadier]], and given the AIF serial number VX15. His first task was to organise his new command, which was equipped with World War I vintage [[Ordnance QF 18 pounder|18 pounder]] guns and [[QF 4.5 inch Howitzer|4.5 inch howitzers]]. Herring left for [[Palestine]] on 15&amp;nbsp;April&amp;nbsp;1940, along with the [[Australian 6th Division|6th Division's]] commander, Major General [[Iven Mackay]] and his headquarters. Training was difficult as the old ammunition was in short supply. His command was only partially reequipped with the new [[Ordnance QF 25 pounder|25 pounders]] before being committed to the [[Western Desert Campaign]] in December 1940.&lt;ref&gt;Sayers, ''Ned Herring'', pp. 121, 125, 127.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Western desert===
[[Image:Awm 005307 Gun crew.jpg|thumb|240px|left|[[25-pounder]] gun crew of the [[1st Regiment, Royal Australian Artillery|2/1st Field Artillery Regiment]] at Bardia]]
At the [[Operation Compass|Battle of Bardia]], Herring controlled all 120 guns used in the division's attack, in which the infantry were supported by Great-War-style barrages.&lt;ref&gt;Long, Gavin, ''To Benghazi'', pp. 155–159.&lt;/ref&gt; After the victory at Bardia, Herring's gunners supported the attack on [[Tobruk]]. More than half of his guns were British, and some were commanded by regular British officers who were sceptical of the ability of an Australian Militia officer. War Correspondent [[Chester Wilmot]] noted that:{{quote|Herring has a quiet, easy manner and his last war service has given him an understanding of the British to which they were quick to respond. After Bardia and Tobruk those officers who had been most skeptical were his strongest champions. In building up the artillery plan, Herring brought to bear the same thorough, relentless logic and attention to detail with which he had so often built up a legal argument.&lt;ref&gt;Wilmot, ''Tobruk, 1941'', p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Greece===
In the [[Battle of Greece|campaign in Greece]], Herring had, in addition to his own gunners, the 2nd Regiment, [[Royal Horse Artillery]], 64th Medium Regiment, [[Royal Artillery]] and, for a time, the 6th Field Regiment, [[Royal Regiment of New Zealand Artillery|Royal New Zealand Artillery]], under his command.&lt;ref&gt;Long, Gavin, ''Greece, Crete and Syria'', pp. 43–44, 75.&lt;/ref&gt; His Australian, New Zealand and British gunners demonstrated &quot;the extent to which, in such rugged country, artillery, with reliable infantry ahead, could halt and confuse a pursuer&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Long, Gavin, ''Greece, Crete and Syria'', p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt; but they were unable to stop the enemy advance.

Herring was ordered to evacuate from Greece. He was one of between 7,000 and 8,000 troops that gathered at [[Nafplion]] on 24&amp;nbsp;April&amp;nbsp;1941, although transportation had been arranged for only 5,000. The ship that he was to sail on, the ''Ulster Prince'' ran aground near the harbour entrance. She was refloated but then ran aground again near the wharf. Despite this, some 6,600 men and women were embarked.&lt;ref name=lg161/&gt; Herring and fellow Brigadier [[Clive Steele]] were among 5,100 that managed to reach [[Crete]] on the [[Royal Navy]] transport {{HMS|Glenearn|I44|6}}. From there they flew back to [[Alexandria]].&lt;ref&gt;Sayers, ''Ned Herring'', pp. 178–179.&lt;/ref&gt; Others were transported by {{HMS|Phoebe|43|6}}, {{HMS|Hyacinth|K84|6}}, {{HMAS|Stuart|DE 48|6}} and {{HMAS|Voyager|D31|6}}, which carried 150 Australian and New Zealand nurses.&lt;ref name=&quot;lg161&quot;&gt;Long, Gavin, ''Greece, Crete and Syria'', p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt; For his service in Libya and Greece, Herring was made a Commander of the [[Order of the British Empire]] (CBE).&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette |issue=35209 |supp=yes |startpage=3882 |date=4 July 1941 |accessdate=31 October 2007}} ''Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE).''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Defence of Australia===
[[Image:Herring NT Force (150093).jpg|thumb|240px|right|Members of the 6th Division march past Major General Herring at Darwin during 1942]]
Herring was promoted to the temporary rank of [[Major General (Australia)|Major General]] on 14&amp;nbsp;August&amp;nbsp;1941 when he took over command of the [[Australian 6th Division|6th Division]]. He returned to Australia with it in March 1942. Unaware that the government had already decided that [[General (Australia)|General]] Sir Thomas Blamey should be appointed Commander in Chief, Herring, along with Major General [[George Alan Vasey]] and Brigadier Clive Steele, approached Army Minister [[Frank Forde]] with a proposal that all officers over the age of 50 be immediately retired and Major General [[Horace Robertson]] appointed Commander in Chief. The 'revolt of the generals' collapsed with the announcement that General Blamey was returning from the Middle East to become Commander in Chief, but seems to have done the participants no harm.&lt;ref&gt;Sayers, ''Ned Herring'', pp. 195–199.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Blamey's reorganisation of the Army in April 1942, Herring was given command of [[Northern Territory Force]]. At this time [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]] was being subjected to Japanese air raids. As supply by sea or air was impractical, Herring developed a land line of communications running across the [[outback]] from [[Alice Springs, Northern Territory|Alice Springs]].&lt;ref&gt;Sayers, ''Ned Herring'', pp. 200–204.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14&amp;nbsp;August&amp;nbsp;1942, Herring was ordered to [[Esk, Queensland]], to assume command of [[II Corps (Australia)|II Corps]] with the temporary rank of [[Lieutenant General (Australia)|Lieutenant General]]. As such, he was responsible for the defence of [[Brisbane]]. At this time he was criticised in [[Parliament of Australia|Parliament]] by [[Arthur Calwell]] for allegedly issuing a verbal order whilst commander of the [[Australian 6th Division|6th Division]] that no officer was to be commissioned unless they had at least attained an [[Intermediate Certificate]]. There was no evidence that such an order was ever issued, but the allegation reflected a suspicion that Herring was an [[elitist]].&lt;ref&gt;Sayers, ''Ned Herring'', pp. 214–216.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Papuan campaign===
In the wake of the dismissal of Lieutenant General [[Sydney Rowell]] for insubordination, Blamey ordered Herring to join him in [[Port Moresby]] as the new commander of [[I Corps (Australia)|I Corps]]. Before departing, Herring met with General [[Douglas MacArthur]], who emphasised that the first duty of a soldier was obedience to his superiors.&lt;ref&gt;Sayers, ''Ned Herring'', p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:MacArthur and Herring AWM150813.jpg|thumb|left|240px|Herring (second from left) in Papua with General Douglas MacArthur (centre) and Major General Arthur Samuel Allen (right)]] 
As at Darwin, Herring's primary difficulty was [[logistics]]. The troops on the [[Kokoda Track]] had to be supplied from [[Port Moresby]] either by air or by [[Papuan peoples|Papuan]] native carriers who lugged stores over the track on their backs. MacArthur created the Combined Operation Service Command (COSC), an unusual combined Australian-American logistical organisation, under U.S. [[Brigadier General]] [[Dwight Johns]], who in turn was answerable to Herring. Herring backed a plan to take American engineers off working on the airstrips in order to develop the port by building a causeway to Tatana Island, the successful completion of which doubled the port's capacity and was the logistical turning point of the campaign.&lt;ref&gt;Johns, &quot;We Are Doing What We Can With What We Have&quot;, pp. 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt;

More controversial was Herring's relief of Brigadier [[Arnold Potts]] and Blamey's of Major General [[Arthur Samuel Allen]] at Herring's urging. Herring acknowledged that the two men had faced a difficult task but felt that they were tired and that Brigadier [[Ivan Dougherty]] and Major General [[George Alan Vasey]] could do better. Supporters of Allen, who left school at age 14, saw this as the action of an autocratic elitist who &quot;ran his staff as he had controlled junior counsel in his barrister's chamber; they did his bidding, his way, or were forthwith dispensed with&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Braga, ''Kokoda Commander'', pp. 8, 275–276.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a letter to Herring in 1959, General [[Robert L. Eichelberger]] (who had himself relieved two division commanders – Major Generals [[Edwin F. Harding]] and [[Horace H. Fuller]]) had this to say about the matter:{{quote|It is a funny thing about war historians. If a general dismisses a subordinate at any time he is immediately attacked; whereas in our football game, if you have a better player for a particular place, you always play him, and everybody expects you to do this. I have little doubt that the same is true of your ball game. War historians never seem to give generals credit for having thought that X might be better than Y for the next phase of operations.&lt;ref&gt;Letter, Eichelberger to Herring, 27 November 1959, Herring Papers, State Library of Victoria MSS11355.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In November, Herring flew across the mountains to take control of the fighting around [[Battle of Buna-Gona|Buna]], leaving Blamey to control operations elsewhere in New Guinea.&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy, ''South West Pacific Area – First Year'', p. 372.&lt;/ref&gt; Herring planned the systematic reduction of the Japanese positions at Buna and Sanananda. He struggled to amass enough troops, equipment, guns, and supplies to allow Australian troops under Vasey and Americans under Eichelberger to overcome the Japanese and capture the area.&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy, ''South West Pacific Area – First Year'', pp. 510–511.&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Guinea campaign===
Following the victory at Buna, for which Herring and Eichelberger were appointed Knights Commander of the [[Order of the British Empire]],&lt;ref name=&quot;KBE&quot;&gt;{{LondonGazette |issue=36031 |startpage=2373 |supp=yes |date=25 May 1943 |accessdate=14 October 2008}} ''Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE).''&lt;/ref&gt; Blamey ordered him to return to Australia for a rest. While in Melbourne, Herring had an attack of [[malaria]], but recovered to resume command in New Guinea in May. Blamey charged him with responsibility for the next phase of [[Operation Cartwheel]], the capture of [[Lae]]. Herring would command [[I Corps (Australia)|I Corps]], which would be part of [[New Guinea Force]], under Blamey and later [[Iven Mackay|Mackay]]. Blamey intended to have Lieutenant General [[Leslie Morshead]] command the subsequent phase of the operation, the assault on [[Madang]].&lt;ref&gt;Sayers, ''Ned Herring'', pp. 247–251.&lt;/ref&gt;

At this time operations were in train to drive the Japanese back to [[Salamaua]]. Once again, the difficulties of supplying the attacking force were formidable. Out of sensitivity towards the sensibilities of the Americans, Herring left the command arrangements between Major General [[Stanley Savige]]'s [[Australian 3rd Division (World War II)|3rd Division]] and units of the American [[41st Infantry Division (United States)|41st Infantry Division]] ambiguous. This backfired, producing acrimony between the Australian and American commanders. Herring prepared to fire Savige, but an investigation by Major General [[Frank Horton Berryman|Frank Berryman]] determined that the dispute was not Savige's fault.&lt;ref&gt;Keating, ''The Right Man for the Right Job'', pp. 123–125.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Senior AIF officers (AWM 057633).jpg|left|thumb|240px|Herring (left) with other senior Australian officers in the Ramu Valley of New Guinea in October 1943]]
The new offensive, which opened on 5 September 1943 with the [[Australian 7th Division|7th Division]] [[landing at Nadzab]] by air and [[Australian 9th Division|9th Division]] [[landing at Lae]] from the ships of Rear Admiral [[Daniel E. Barbey]]'s [[VII Amphibious Force]], saw the rapid capture of [[Lae]]. While the [[Australian 7th Division|7th Division]] moved up the [[Ramu Valley campaign|Markham and Ramu Valleys]], the [[Australian 9th Division|9th Division]] made another landing at [[Battle of Scarlet Beach|Scarlet Beach]] near [[Finschhafen]]. The timing of the landing was contentious, with Barbey, who feared air attack, wanting to land at night while Herring held out for a dawn landing, threatening to take the issue to General MacArthur. Eventually Berryman managed to persuade Herring to accept a compromise H-hour in the darkness before dawn. The U.S. Naval Historian [[Samuel Eliot Morison]] noted: &quot;The Australians proved to be right; 'Uncle Dan's' outfit was not prepared for a neat night landing. The usual [[SNAFU]] developed.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Morison, ''Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier'', p. 270.&lt;/ref&gt; But Berryman saw Herring as being uncooperative, and his intransigence as a sign of battle weariness.&lt;ref&gt;Extracts from Berryman Diary, 20 September 1943, AWM93 50/2/23/331.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the subsequent [[battle of Finschhafen]], it soon became clear that the strength of the Japanese forces there had been seriously underestimated, and the [[Australian 9th Division|9th Division]] needed to be resupplied and reinforced, and its casualties evacuated. Herring strove to get the necessary amphibious lift from the navy but the commander of the [[United States Seventh Fleet]], [[Vice Admiral]] [[Arthur S. Carpender]], was reluctant to expose his ships to the Japanese air threat. The matter went up the chain of command to Mackay, to Blamey, and ultimately to MacArthur, who could do little, given that he had no real authority over the U.S. Navy.&lt;ref&gt;Coates, ''Bravery Above Blunder'', pp. 136–143.&lt;/ref&gt;

Carpender was not inflexible, and reached a compromise with Mackay to transport a battalion to Finschhafen in [[high speed transport|high speed transports (APDs)]]. Herring was in [[Dobodura]], lunching with [[Lieutenant general (United States)|Lieutenant General]] [[Brehon B. Somervell]], when he heard this news. He decided to fly to [[Milne Bay]] to discuss the matter of resupply in general with Barbey. On 28 September, Herring and two of his staff officers, Brigadiers R. B. Sutherland and R. Bierwirth, boarded a U.S. [[Fifth Air Force]] [[B-25 Mitchell]] bomber at Dobodura. As the plane was about to take off, the undercarriage collapsed and the plane ploughed into the [[Marston mats|Marston Mat]] runway. A propeller shattered, splinters ripped through the fuselage into the cabin and Sutherland, who was sitting in the navigator's compartment next to Herring, was struck by a flying fragment that killed him instantly. The crew, Herring and Bierwirth escaped shaken but unscathed. The trip to Milne Bay was cancelled. Brigadier Sutherland was buried with full military honours at Soputa the next day, with a fly past by B-25s. When next he flew, Herring once again took a B-25 and made a point of requesting the major who had been in charge of the crashed plane to be his pilot.&lt;ref&gt;Sayers, ''Ned Herring'', pp. 274–276.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mackay became convinced that Herring was becoming increasingly difficult to work with as a result of stress and fatigue and asked Blamey for permission to relieve him. Blamey's response was characteristic: Morshead would be on the next plane.&lt;ref&gt;Gavin Long interview with Lieutenant General F. H. Berryman, 11 September 1956, AWM93 50/2/23/331.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet Blamey maintained his faith in Herring, who retained command of [[I Corps (Australia)|I Corps]] on the [[Atherton Tableland]], where he trained his men for the next operation.&lt;ref&gt;Sayers, ''Ned Herring'', p. 278.&lt;/ref&gt; He did not know when or where this would be, so he focused on [[amphibious warfare]]. He created the [[1st Beach Group]] and developed tactics and doctrine for amphibious operations based on his own experience in the [[New Guinea Campaign]] and reports from the [[Allied invasion of Sicily]].  The benefits of his work would be realised in the [[Borneo campaign (1945)|Borneo Campaign]].&lt;ref&gt;Mallett, &quot;Together Again for the First Time: The Army, RAN and Amphibious Warfare 1942–45&quot;, pp. 124–125.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chief Justiceship and later life==
[[Image:Mary Herring.jpg||thumb|240px|right|Lady Herring (with hat) looks on as Sir Edmund Herring, the new Chief Justice of Victoria, greets guests at an informal reception in his rooms. Major General C. E. M. Lloyd, Adjutant General, congratulates Herring on his appointment.]]
On 2 February 1944, the Victorian government decided to appoint Herring as [[Chief Justice]] of the [[Supreme Court of Victoria]]. Blamey advised the Prime Minister that:{{quote|General Herring is prepared to accept the appointment and I recommend he be released from the Army. He has had two serious attacks of Malaria. I am afraid that in view of his age, further tropical service may seriously injure his health and that the command may suffer as a result. He has rendered excellent service over four years, mainly on active service in the field.&lt;ref&gt;Blamey to Curtin, 2 February 1944, NAA (ACT) A2684/3 1392.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It was not quite the end of his military service. Herring was recalled to duty for a year as Director General of Recruiting in August 1950 when the [[Korean War]] spurred efforts to build up the Army again.&lt;ref&gt;Sayers, ''Ned Herring'', p. 304.&lt;/ref&gt;  In January 1953, Herring was selected as leader of the Australian Services Contingent for the [[Coronation of the British monarch|coronation]] of Queen [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II]]. This saw Australian soldiers as the [[Queen's Guard]] at [[Buckingham Palace]] on 26 May 1953, with Herring personally taking part in the procession. On 10 July, he was made a Knight of the [[Venerable Order of Saint John|Order of St John]] at Buckingham Palace.&lt;ref name=&quot;KStJ&quot;&gt;{{LondonGazette |issue=39898 |startpage=3540 |date=26 June 1953 |accessdate=25 February 2008}} ''Knight of the Order of St John (KStJ).''&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, Mary was made a commander of the same order for her charity work.&lt;ref&gt;Sayers, ''Ned Herring'', pp. 320–327.&lt;/ref&gt;

Herring maintained connections with his comrades from both World Wars. On the way back from the coronation, the Herrings stayed with the Eichelbergers in [[Asheville, North Carolina]]. The two generals remained close friends, exchanging regular letters until Eichelberger's death in 1961. In 1962, Herring visited [[Richard O'Connor]] at his home in [[Ross]]. In 1967 and 1971, the Herrings again travelled to America where they were guests of [[Dwight Johns]] and his wife. In 1973, he visited Washington, D.C. for the annual reunion of MacArthur's staff, and resolved that the next reunion should be held in Australia. He obtained government backing for his idea, and arranged for more than twenty former American generals, including [[Leif J. Sverdrup]], [[Hugh John Casey]], [[William C. Chase]], [[Clyde D. Eddleman]] and [[LeGrande A. Diller]], and their wives to visit Australia in 1974, with commemorative functions being held in Melbourne, Sydney and [[Brisbane]]. Herring steadfastly believed that MacArthur, like Blamey, was a great commander who was not fully appreciated in his own country.&lt;ref&gt;Sayers, ''Ned Herring'', pp. 338–340, 345, 347.&lt;/ref&gt;

Herring's twenty years as Chief Justice was a period of significant change and growth in the administration of the law. During his period of office the number of judges on the Court increased from six to fourteen, reflecting the growth in cases. Herring earned a reputation as a fine judge and able administrator. He set up the Chief Justice's Law Reform Committee to try to ensure justice in Victoria's courts was abreast of the times, and a committee for religious observances and services to arrange the religious services marking the opening of the legal year. Herring retired as Chief Justice in 1964 but stayed on as Lieutenant Governor until his 80th birthday in 1972, serving in the position for a record 27 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Innes&quot;&gt;Innes, Prue, &quot;[http://home.vicnet.net.au/~herring/edmund.htm A full Life of Service in Khaki and Silk]&quot;, The Age (Melbourne), 6 January 1982. Accessed 13 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; For his service as Lieutenant Governor, Herring was made a Knight Commander of the [[Order of St Michael and St George]] in the [[King's Birthday Honours]] of 9 June 1949.&lt;ref name=&quot;KCMG&quot;&gt;{{LondonGazette |issue=38628 |supp=yes |startpage=2796 |date=3 June 1949 |accessdate=25 February 2008}} ''Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG).''&lt;/ref&gt;

In a speech given on the occasion of his retiring as Chief Justice of Victoria, Herring said:
{{quote|And now the time has come for me to lay down my office, but before I do so there are two matters to which I feel bound to draw attention. The first is this, that under the Australian constitution the great common law courts of Australia are the Supreme Courts of the States. Federal Parliament has no power to set up common law courts and so it is to the Supreme Courts of the States the citizen must look for protection from illegal arrest and other encroachments on his liberty. It is to these Courts that he must come for a writ of habeas corpus. These Courts and their prestige must, therefore, at all costs be sustained so that they will continue to attract the finest characters and best legal brains that we can produce. As a community we will pay heavily if we allow our Supreme Court to be relegated to a position of inferiority. The second matter I feel I should mention is that the principle of the independence of the judiciary from the executive is fundamental to our freedom. What happens when this principle is departed from is evident from what is going on in many lands today. We must see to it that our citizens all understand that an independent judiciary is the greatest bulwark of their liberties and their best protection from totalitarian rule.&lt;ref&gt;''Victorian Reports'', p. 47, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

While opening the Victorian [[Returned Services League]] Conference shortly before his retirement as Lieutenant Governor, Herring criticised anti-war protesters and praised Australian soldiers who had served in the [[Vietnam War]]. &quot;People who throw stones at Americans,&quot; he said, &quot;should stop and think where we would have been in 1942 without the Americans.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Innes&quot; /&gt; Such remarks earned him a rebuke from the then acting State Opposition Leader, [[Frank Wilkes]], as &quot;untactful&quot; for a representative of the Crown.&lt;ref name=&quot;Innes&quot; /&gt;

Herring again became the subject of controversy in May 1978 when [[Barry Jones (Australian politician)|Barry Jones]] revealed in [[Parliament of Australia|Federal Parliament]] that during World War II Herring had confirmed death sentences on 22 Papuans convicted of handing over seven Anglican missionaries to the Japanese, which Jones called &quot;the darkest secret in modern Australian history&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, ''A Thinking Reed'', pp. 96–97.&lt;/ref&gt; The Papuans had been convicted of offences including murder and treason. Herring claimed that they had been treated fairly under the conventions and circumstances applicable in wartime. &quot;I have a clear conscience about it&quot; he said.&lt;ref name=&quot;Innes&quot; /&gt; The seven missionaries had all been murdered by the Japanese. Four of them were women who had been raped as well. The Papuans had also handed over to the Japanese for execution two planters, six Australian soldiers, and two American airmen, and they had murdered Australian soldiers of the 39th Infantry Battalion near Kokoda. They were handed over to [[ANGAU]], which had carried out the executions at Higaturu in September 1943.&lt;ref&gt;Sayers, ''Ned Herring'', pp. 232–233.&lt;/ref&gt;

Herring was president of the [[The Scout Association|Boy Scouts' Association]] of Victoria for 23 years, and was later the first president of the Australian Boy Scouts' Association from 1959 to 1977.&lt;ref name=&quot;Innes&quot; /&gt; He was chairman of trustees of the [[Shrine of Remembrance]] from 1945 to 1978 (and remained a trustee until his death) and chairman of trustees of the [[Australian War Memorial]] from 1959 to 1974. He was made a fellow of [[New College, Oxford]], in 1949, received an honorary [[Doctor of Civil Law|DCL]] from Oxford in 1953, became an honorary bencher of the [[Inner Temple]] in 1963 and received an honorary [[Doctor of Laws|LLD]] from [[Monash University]] in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;Sayers, ''Ned Herring'', pp. 320, 334, 345.&lt;/ref&gt; He was also active in the [[Anglican Communion|Anglican Church]], and for many years was [[Chancellor (ecclesiastical)|chancellor]] of the [[diocese]] of Melbourne, the highest church office that could be held by a layman.&lt;ref name=&quot;Innes&quot; /&gt;

Herring died at a [[Camberwell, Victoria]], nursing home on 5 January 1982. He was given a state funeral at [[St Paul's Cathedral, Melbourne]], planned by Mary, who had died three months before.&lt;ref&gt;Hilton, ''Dr. Mary'', p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt;

Victoria's [[Herring Island (Victoria)|Herring Island]] is named after him&lt;ref name=&quot;Innes&quot; /&gt;; fittingly, it is beside the [[Monash Freeway]] (named for Herrings fellow 'civilian soldier', General, and lawyer, Sir [[John Monash]]) in [[Melbourne]]'s [[Yarra River]] at [[South Yarra]], approximately {{convert|3|km|mi}} from the city. 

His wartime portraits are in the [[Australian War Memorial]] in [[Canberra]], which featured him as one of the fifty most prominent Australians with a military background.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.awm.gov.au/fiftyaustralians/22.asp |title=Fifty Australians | publisher=[[Australian War Memorial]] |accessdate=27 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; His papers are in the [[State Library of Victoria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Latrobe Journal |title=Select List of Accessions to the Manuscript Collection |page=p. 68}}&lt;/ref&gt;
