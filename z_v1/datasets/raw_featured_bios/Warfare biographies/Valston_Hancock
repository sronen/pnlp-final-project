[[Air Marshal]] '''Sir Valston Eldridge''' ('''Val''') '''Hancock''', [[Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire|KBE]], [[Companion of the Order of the Bath|CB]], [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|DFC]] (31 May 1907 &amp;ndash; 29&amp;nbsp;September 1998) was a senior commander in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF). He served as [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]] from 1961 to 1965. A graduate of the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]], Hancock transferred to the RAAF in 1929 and qualified as a pilot. His administrative training at Duntroon saw him primarily occupy staff posts, including Deputy Director of Operations and Intelligence at RAAF Headquarters from 1931 to 1935, and Director of Works and Buildings from 1937 to 1939. During the early years of World War&amp;nbsp;II, he commanded No.&amp;nbsp;1 Bombing and Gunnery School, and held senior planning and administrative positions. He eventually saw combat in the [[Aitape–Wewak campaign]] of the [[Pacific War]] during 1945.  Flying [[Bristol Beaufort]] light bombers, he led first [[No. 100 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;100 Squadron]], and later [[No. 71 Wing RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;71 Wing]]. His actions earned him the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross]].

After the war, Hancock became the inaugural commandant of [[RAAF College]]. His subsequent positions included [[Deputy Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Deputy Chief of the Air Staff]] from 1951 to 1953, Air Member for Personnel from 1953 to 1955, and [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) No.&amp;nbsp;224 Group [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] [[Federation of Malaya|Malaya]], responsible for all [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] air forces in the region, from 1957 to 1959. Appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in 1958, he served as AOC [[RAAF Air Command|RAAF Operational Command]] from 1959 to 1961, before being promoted to air marshal and commencing his term as Chief of the Air Staff. He was [[Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire|knighted]] in 1962. In his role as the Air Force's senior officer, Hancock initiated redevelopment of [[RAAF Base Learmonth]] in north [[Western Australia]], as part of a chain of [[RAAF Bare Bases|forward airfields]] for the defence of the continent. He also evaluated potential replacements for the RAAF's [[English Electric Canberra]] bomber, selecting the American &quot;TFX&quot; (later the [[General Dynamics F-111C|General Dynamics F-111]]) as the most suitable for Australia's needs, though he did not recommend its immediate purchase due to its early stage of development.  After his retirement from the military in May 1965, Hancock co-founded the Australia Defence Association. He died in 1998, aged 91.

In March 1940, Hancock's Directorate of Works and Buildings was transferred from the office of the Chief of the Air Staff to the newly formed Organisation and Equipment Branch under Air Marshal [[Richard Williams (RAAF officer)|Richard Williams]].

Hancock finally achieved a combat command in January 1945, when he took charge of [[No. 100 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;100 Squadron]], flying [[Bristol Beaufort]] light bombers during the [[Aitape-Wewak campaign]] in New Guinea.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers pp.337-342&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/20.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp. 337&amp;ndash;342]&lt;/ref&gt; That month, the unit attacked Japanese positions at [[Maprik District|Maprik]], below the [[Prince Alexander Mountains|Prince Alexander Ranges]], and Cape Moem, near [[Wewak]]. On 1&amp;nbsp;April, Hancock took over [[No. 71 Wing RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;71 Wing]], which came under overall control of RAAF Northern Command and nominally comprised [[No. 7 Squadron RAAF|Nos.&amp;nbsp;7]], [[No. 8 Squadron RAAF|8]] and 100 Beaufort Squadrons, as well as a [[Flight (military unit)|flight]] of [[CAC Boomerang]] fighter-bombers from [[No. 4 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;4 (Army Cooperation) Squadron]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers pp.337-342&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers pp.342-348&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/20.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp. 342&amp;ndash;348]&lt;/ref&gt;  It was soon augmented by two more Beaufort units, [[No. 6 Squadron RAAF|Nos.&amp;nbsp;6]] and [[No. 15 Squadron RAAF|15 Squadrons]]. Providing [[close air support]] to Australian ground troops in the lead-up to the final assault on Wewak, the wing flew over 1,400 [[sortie]]s and dropped more than 1,200 tons of bombs in May alone. By mid-year, however, Hancock's forces were acutely short of fuel and ordnance, to the extent that his squadrons took to arming their Beauforts with captured Japanese bombs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers pp.342-348&quot;/&gt; In July, enough supplies arrived to enable the wing to continue operating at normal strength.&lt;ref&gt;Long, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/23/chapters/15.pdf ''The Final Campaigns'', p. 360]&lt;/ref&gt; No.&amp;nbsp;71 Wing was active to the very last day of the Pacific War, flying its final combat mission involving 30 Beauforts only hours before news of victory arrived on 15&amp;nbsp;August 1945.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers pp.342-348&quot;/&gt; Hancock's &quot;distinguished flying on operations in Northern Command&quot; earned him the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross]]; the award was published in the ''[[London Gazette]]'' on 22&amp;nbsp;February 1946.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/awm192/00304/003040861.pdf|title=Recommendation: Distinguished Flying Cross|accessdate=on 14 April 2011|work=Index to Recommendations: Second World War|publisher=[[Australian War Memorial]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=37479|date=22 February 1946|startpage=1075|supp=yes|accessdate=14 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among a small coterie of wartime RAAF commanders considered suitable for future senior roles, Hancock retained his rank of group captain following the end of hostilities.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 24–25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Helson, ''Ten Years at the Top'', pp. 238–239&lt;/ref&gt; As Director of Personnel Services during 1946, he was involved in restructuring the Air Force into a dramatically smaller peacetime service.&lt;ref name=&quot;AM&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Going Solo pp.254-255&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 254&amp;ndash;255&lt;/ref&gt; He recalled this time as a &quot;twilight period&quot; when &quot;no-one wanted to know about us&quot; and many good people were let go due to the government's parsimonious retention policies.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Power Plus Attitude'', p. 116&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 11, 18&amp;ndash;19&lt;/ref&gt; In 1947, Hancock was promoted to [[air commodore]] and appointed inaugural commandant of the newly formed [[Air Force Training Group RAAF#RAAF College|RAAF College]], Point Cook, the Air Force's equivalent of [[Royal Military College, Duntroon|Duntroon]] and the [[HMAS Creswell|Royal Australian Naval College]]. He also drafted the institution's charter.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p. 186&lt;/ref&gt;  Departing in late 1949, he spent the following year in Britain, where he attended the [[Royal College of Defence Studies|Imperial Defence College]]. On his return to Australia in 1951, he was promoted to acting [[air vice marshal]] and made [[Deputy Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Deputy Chief of the Air Staff]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;/&gt; He was raised to a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (CBE) in the 1953 [[Orders, decorations, and medals of the United Kingdom|New Years Honours]].&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue= 39734|date=1 January 1953|startpage=40|supp=yes|accessdate=on 14 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In October that year, Hancock took over from Air Vice Marshal [[Frank Bladin]] as Air Member for Personnel (AMP). As AMP, he occupied a seat on the Air Board, the service's controlling body that consisted of its most senior officers and which was chaired by the [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Going Solo pp.499-500&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 499&amp;ndash;500&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; Completing his term in January 1955, Hancock was posted to Britain as Head of the Australian Joint Services Staff in London.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Going Solo pp.499-500&quot;/&gt; He spent much of the latter half of 1955 and early 1956 laid low by a stomach ailment that was initially diagnosed as [[Amoebiasis|amoebic dysentery]] but was later thought to be [[Brucellosis|Malta fever]] or [[malaria]].&lt;ref&gt;Department of Defence, ''Personal Correspondence'', pp. 14&amp;ndash;21&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1957, Hancock was one of three candidates, along with Air Vice Marshals [[Frederick Scherger]] and [[Allan Walters]], touted as possible successors to Air Marshal [[John McCauley (RAAF officer)|Sir John McCauley]] as Chief of the Air Staff (CAS), the RAAF's senior position. Scherger gained selection,&lt;ref&gt;Stephens; Isaacs, ''High Fliers'', p. 123&lt;/ref&gt; and Hancock was posted in June to [[Federation of Malaya|Malaya]] as [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) No.&amp;nbsp;224 Group [[Royal Air Force|RAF]], responsible for all Commonwealth air forces in the region.&lt;ref name=&quot;Going Solo pp.254-255&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Helson, ''Ten Years at the Top'', pp. 274&amp;ndash;275&lt;/ref&gt; Though fastidious in appearance and a strict [[teetotaller]], he was known for his enthusiasm in meeting staff and as &quot;an indefatigable participant in mess functions and games&quot;. He also made a point of getting out to units in the field, taking every opportunity to fly himself around his command.&lt;ref name=&quot;Going Solo pp.254-255&quot;/&gt; For his &quot;distinguished service in Malaya&quot;, Hancock was appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] (CB) on 9&amp;nbsp;December 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=41568|date=9 December 1958|startpage=7505|supp=yes|accessdate=on 14 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He returned to Australia in July 1959 to serve as AOC Operational Command (now [[RAAF Air Command|Air Command]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Liddell Hart Centre&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;/&gt; When Scherger's term as CAS was due to complete, Hancock and Walters were once more put forward to the [[Minister for Defence (Australia)|Minister for Air]] as potential replacements. His &quot;professional ability, operational experience and personal qualities&quot; being deemed more appropriate for the role, Hancock was promoted to [[air marshal]] and took over as CAS in May 1961.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens; Isaacs, ''High Fliers'', p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; He was appointed a [[Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (KBE) in the 1962 Queen's Birthday Honours, [[London Gazette|gazetted]] on 2&amp;nbsp;June.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=42684|date=2 June 1962|startpage=4344|supp=yes|accessdate=on 14 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:MALTA0754Hancock.jpg|thumb|260px|Hancock (right) greeting personnel of [[No. 78 Wing RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;78 Wing]] in [[Malta]], where the unit was on garrison duty, 1953|alt=Two men in light-coloured military uniforms with peaked caps, shaking hands in front of a row of similarly dressed men]]
As CAS, Hancock worked to enhance the RAAF's deterrent capability in the Pacific region, particularly in light of heightened tensions with [[Indonesia]] during its period of [[Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation|''Konfrontasi'']] with [[Malaysia]]. In June 1963, Hancock undertook a mission to Britain, France and the United States to consider potential replacements for the [[English Electric Canberra]] bomber as Australia's prime aerial strike platform. After investigating the US [[General Dynamics F-111 Aardvark|&quot;TFX&quot;]], [[North American A-5 Vigilante]] and [[McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II]], the British [[BAC TSR-2]], and the French [[Dassault Mirage IV]], Hancock decided that the swing-wing TFX, forerunner of the General Dynamics F-111, would be the aircraft best suited for this role. However, as the TFX had not yet flown, he recommended purchase of the already operational Vigilante to counteract a perceived imminent threat from Indonesia. In the event, the Federal Government did not go ahead with an immediate replacement for the Canberra, and Hancock's original choice of the TFX was taken up as a long-term solution, leading to Australia's agreement in October to purchase the [[General Dynamics F-111C|F-111C]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.283-286&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 283&amp;ndash;286&lt;/ref&gt; The same month, as ''Konfrontasi'' continued to simmer, Hancock approved simplification to the rules of engagement for Australian [[CAC Sabre|Sabre]] fighters based at [[RMAF Butterworth|RAAF Butterworth]] to engage and destroy Indonesian aircraft violating Malay air space.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 264&amp;ndash;265&lt;/ref&gt; The following month he urged using RAAF Canberras from Butterworth to make pre-emptive strikes against Indonesian air bases, in retaliation for incursions into West Malaysia, but Britain, which had initially requested Australia's involvement, held back on action.&lt;ref&gt;Dennis; Grey, ''Emergency and Confrontation'', pp. 228&amp;ndash;229&lt;/ref&gt;

Once the F-111 had been ordered, Hancock sought a suitable forward airfield from which they could operate. In this, he continued a policy initiated by his predecessor as CAS, Air Marshal Scherger, of developing a chain of so-called &quot;[[RAAF Bare Bases|bare bases]]&quot; in Northern Australia.  Hancock recommended redeveloping [[RAAF Base Learmonth]] in the northern part of  Western Australia, due to its proximity to Indonesia. Flying out of this airfield, the F-111s could destroy &quot;vital centres in [[Java]]&quot;; just as importantly for deterrence purposes, Hancock contended, enhancing the base's capability would send a clear message to Indonesia's hierarchy. Though the project was delayed, in part due to thawing in relations between Australia and Indonesia, Learmonth's upgrade was completed in 1973, the same year that the F-111 finally entered RAAF service.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 57&amp;ndash;58&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p. 290&lt;/ref&gt; The latter part of Hancock's tour as CAS coincided with the beginning of large-scale [[Military history of Australia during the Vietnam War|Australian involvement in the Vietnam War]].  By mid-1964, the Commonwealth had already sent a small team of military advisors, plus a detachment of newly acquired [[de Havilland Canada DHC-4 Caribou|DHC-4 Caribou]] cargo planes, to the region at the request of the [[South Vietnam]]ese government.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, ''100 Years of Australians at War'', pp. 300&amp;ndash;312&lt;/ref&gt; Under Hancock, the Caribou had itself only been reluctantly ordered by the Air Force following intense pressure from the Army and the Federal government for an [[STOL]] transport.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 422&amp;ndash;423&lt;/ref&gt;  Concerned at the potential drain on the RAAF's resources, Hancock tried to resist calls for commitments to Vietnam. His negative views were in contrast to the hawkish attitudes of his deputy, Air Vice Marshal [[Colin Hannah]], and Air Chief Marshal Scherger, now [[Chief of the Defence Force (Australia)|Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee]] and Australia's senior soldier.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The RAAF in Vietnam'', pp. 28&amp;ndash;29, 80&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1965, as part of American operations in Indochina, [[United States Air Force]] strike aircraft took up residence at [[Ubon Royal Thai Air Force Base|Ubon Air Force Base]], Thailand, which since 1962 had been home to [[No. 79 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;79 Squadron]] Sabres and run by the RAAF under [[Southeast Asia Treaty Organisation|SEATO]] arrangements. Hancock proposed that Australia continue to command the facility and provide local air defence, though this effectively made the Sabres a support unit in the war effort and therefore potential targets of [[North Vietnam]]ese attack; none occurred, however.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 277&amp;ndash;278&lt;/ref&gt;
