[[Air Vice Marshal]] '''Francis Hubert (Frank) McNamara''' [[Victoria Cross|VC]], [[Order of the Bath|CB]], [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] (4&amp;nbsp;April 1894 – 2&amp;nbsp;November 1961) was an [[List of Australian Victoria Cross recipients|Australian recipient]] of the [[Victoria Cross]], the highest decoration for valour in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to a member of the [[United Kingdom|British]] and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] forces. Serving with the Australian Flying Corps, he was honoured for his actions on 20&amp;nbsp;March 1917, when he rescued a fellow pilot who had been forced down behind enemy lines. McNamara was the first Australian aviator&amp;mdash;and the only one in World War&amp;nbsp;I&amp;mdash;to receive the Victoria Cross. He later became a senior commander in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF).

Born and educated in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], McNamara was a teacher when he joined the [[Australian Army Reserve|militia]] prior to World War&amp;nbsp;I. In 1915, he was selected for pilot training at [[Central Flying School RAAF|Central Flying School]], [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Point Cook Base|Point Cook]], and transferred to the Australian Flying Corps the following year. He was based in the [[Middle Eastern theatre of World War I|Middle East]] with [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron]] when he earned the Victoria Cross. In 1921, McNamara enlisted as a [[flying officer]] in the newly formed RAAF, rising to the rank of air vice marshal by 1942. He held senior posts in England and [[Aden]] during World War&amp;nbsp;II. Retiring from the Air Force in 1946, McNamara continued to live in Britain until his death from heart failure in 1961.

==Early life==
Born in [[Rushworth, Victoria|Rushworth]], Victoria, McNamara was the first of eight children to William Francis McNamara, a State Lands Department officer, and his wife Rosanna.&lt;ref name=&quot;Who's Who&quot;&gt;Chisholm, ''Who's Who in Australia 1947'', pp.567–568&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Macklin pp.84-93&quot;&gt;Macklin, ''Bravest'', pp.84–93&lt;/ref&gt; He began his schooling in Rushworth, and completed his secondary education at [[Shepparton High School|Shepparton Agricultural High School]], which he had entered via a [[scholarship]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Macklin pp.84-93&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;&gt;Stephens and Isaacs, ''High Fliers'', pp.20–22&lt;/ref&gt; The family moved to [[Melbourne]] in 1910.&lt;ref name=&quot;Macklin pp.84-93&quot;/&gt;

McNamara joined the [[Australian Army Cadets|school cadets]] in 1911, and was [[officer (armed forces)|commissioned]] a [[second lieutenant]] in the 49th&amp;nbsp;Battalion (Brighton Rifles), a [[Citizens Military Force|militia unit]], in July 1913.&lt;ref name=&quot;AWM&quot;&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/people/258.asp Air Vice Marshal Francis Hubert (Frank) McNamara] at [[Australian War Memorial]].

As a militia officer, McNamara was mobilised for service in Australia when war was declared in August 1914.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;/&gt; After serving briefly at bases in [[Queenscliff, Victoria|Queenscliff]] and [[Point Nepean, Victoria|Point Nepean]], Victoria, McNamara passed through Officers Training School at [[Broadmeadows, Victoria|Broadmeadows]] in December.

Selected for flying training at Point Cook in August 1915, McNamara made his first solo flight in a [[Bristol Boxkite]] on 18&amp;nbsp;September, and graduated as a pilot in October.&lt;ref name=&quot;Macklin pp.84-93&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Garrison&quot;/&gt; On 6&amp;nbsp;January 1916, he was assigned as [[adjutant]] to [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron, Australian Flying Corps]] (also known until 1918 as No.&amp;nbsp;67 Squadron, [[Royal Flying Corps]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;AIF Project&quot;&gt;[http://www.aif.adfa.edu.au:8080/showPerson?pid=203935 Frank Hubert McNamara] at [http://www.aif.adfa.edu.au:8080/index.html The AIF Project].

Completing his course at Upavon, McNamara was posted back to Egypt in August, but was hospitalised on 8&amp;nbsp;September with [[orchitis]]. Discharged on 6&amp;nbsp;October, he served briefly as a [[Flight instructor|flying instructor]] with [[No. 22 Squadron RAF|No.&amp;nbsp;22 Squadron RFC]], before returning to No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron.&lt;ref name=&quot;AWM&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AIF Project&quot;/&gt; McNamara flew with C&amp;nbsp;Flight, commanded by Captain (later Air Marshal Sir) [[Richard Williams (RAAF officer)|Richard Williams]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AIF Project&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cutlack, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/9/chapters/02.pdf ''The Australian Flying Corps'', p.32]&lt;/ref&gt; On his first [[sortie]], a [[aerial reconnaissance|reconnaissance]] mission over [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]], McNamara was unaware that his plane had been hit by [[anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft fire]]; he returned to base with his engine's oil supply almost exhausted.

On 20 March 1917, McNamara, flying a Martinsyde, was one of four No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron pilots taking part in a raid against a Turkish railway junction near [[Gaza]]. Owing to a shortage of bombs, the aircraft were each armed with six specially modified 4.5-inch [[howitzer]] shells.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilson&quot;&gt;Wilson, ''The Brotherhood of Airmen'', pp.11–13&lt;/ref&gt; McNamara had successfully dropped three of his shells when the fourth exploded prematurely, badly wounded him in the leg with [[Shrapnel shell|shrapnel]], an effect he likened to being &quot;hit with a sledgehammer&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Macklin pp.84-93&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilson&quot;/&gt; Having turned to head back to base, he spotted a fellow squadron member from the same mission, Captain David Rutherford, on the ground beside his crashlanded B.E.2.&lt;ref name=&quot;Garrison&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.14-15&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.14–15&lt;/ref&gt; Allied airmen had been hacked to death by enemy troops in similar situations, and McNamara saw that a company of Turkish cavalry was fast approaching Rutherford's position.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.14-15&quot;/&gt; Despite the rough terrain and the gash in his leg, McNamara landed near Rutherford in an attempt to rescue him.&lt;ref name=&quot;AIF Project&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilson&quot;/&gt; 

As there was no spare cockpit in the single-seat Martinsyde, the downed pilot jumped on to McNamara's wing and held the struts. McNamara crashed while attempting to take off, however, due to the effects of his leg wound and Rutherford's weight overbalancing the aircraft. The two men, who had escaped further injury in the accident, set fire to the Martinsyde and dashed back to Rutherford's B.E.2. Rutherford repaired the engine while McNamara used his [[revolver]] against the attacking cavalry, who had opened fire on them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Garrison&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.14-15&quot;/&gt; Two other No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron pilots overhead, Lieutenant (later Air Marshal Sir) [[Peter Roy Maxwell Drummond|Roy &quot;Peter&quot; Drummond]] and Lieutenant Alfred Ellis, also began strafing the enemy troops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Macklin pp.84-93&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilson&quot;/&gt; McNamara managed to start the B.E.2's engine and take off, with Rutherford in the observer's cockpit.

Lt. Frank Hubert McNamara, Aus. Forces, R.F.C.

For most conspicuous bravery and devotion to duty during an aerial bomb attack upon a hostile construction train, when one of our pilots was forced to land behind the enemy's lines.

Lt. McNamara, observing this pilot's predicament and the fact that hostile cavalry were approaching, descended to his rescue. He did this under heavy rifle fire and in spite of the fact that he himself had been severely wounded in the thigh.

He landed about 200 yards from the damaged machine, the pilot of which climbed on to Lt. McNamara's machine, and an attempt was made to rise. Owing, however, to his disabled leg, Lt. McNamara was unable to keep his machine straight, and it turned over. The two officers, having extricated themselves, immediately set fire to the machine and made their way across to the damaged machine, which they succeeded in starting.

Finally Lt. McNamara, although weak from loss of blood, flew this machine back to the aerodrome, a distance of seventy miles, and thus completed his comrade's rescue.}}

Promoted to [[Captain (OF-2)|captain]] on 10&amp;nbsp;April 1917, McNamara became a [[Flight (military unit)|flight commander]] in [[No. 4 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;4 Squadron AFC]] (also known until 1918 as No.&amp;nbsp;71 Squadron RFC), but was unable to continue flying due to the leg wound he suffered on 20&amp;nbsp;March.&lt;ref name=&quot;AWM&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AWM Timeline&quot;/&gt;  He was invalided back to Australia in August aboard HT&amp;nbsp;''Boorara'', and given a hero's welcome on arrival in Melbourne.&lt;ref name=&quot;AWM&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Macklin pp.94-99&quot;&gt;Macklin, ''Bravest'', pp.94–99&lt;/ref&gt; Found to be medically unfit for active service, McNamara was discharged from the Australian Flying Corps on 31&amp;nbsp;January 1918.&lt;ref name=&quot;AWM&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AWM Timeline&quot;/&gt; However, panic caused by the intrusion into Australian waters of the German raider [[SMS Wolf (auxiliary cruiser)|''Wolf'']] resulted in him being recalled to the AFC and put in charge of an aerial reconnaissance unit based in [[South Gippsland]], Victoria, flying a [[Royal Aircraft Factory F.E.2]]B and later a [[Farman MF.11|Maurice Farman Shorthorn]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Macklin pp.94-99&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''A Hero's Dilemma'', pp.54–55&lt;/ref&gt;  In September 1918, he was posted as a flying instructor to Point Cook, where he saw out the remainder of the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;AWM&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Macklin pp.94-99&quot;/&gt;

McNamara was summarily retired from the RAAF in 1946, along with a number of other senior commanders and veterans of World War&amp;nbsp;I, officially to make way for the advancement of younger and equally capable officers. In addition, McNamara's role overseas had become redundant.&lt;ref name=&quot;Helson pp.234-237&quot;&gt;Helson, ''Ten Years at the Top'', pp.234–237&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens p.179&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.179–181&lt;/ref&gt; He was discharged from the Air Force on 11&amp;nbsp;July.&lt;ref name=&quot;AWM Timeline&quot;/&gt; In May 1946, the British government offered McNamara the position of Senior Education Control Officer in [[Westphalia]], Germany, under the auspices of the [[Allied Control Council|Allied Control Commission]]. He later became Deputy Director of Education for the [[Allied Occupation Zones in Germany|British Zone of Occupation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Macklin pp.94-99&quot;/&gt; McNamara continued to live in England after completing his work with the Commission in October 1947, and served on the [[National Coal Board]] in London from 1947 to 1959.&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;/&gt; He died of [[Hypertensive heart disease|hypertensive heart failure]] on 2&amp;nbsp;November 1961, aged 67, after suffering a fall at his home in [[Buckinghamshire]]. Survived by his wife and two children, he was buried at St Joseph's Priory, Austin Wood, [[Gerrards Cross]], following a large funeral.&lt;ref name=&quot;Garrison&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bowyer, ''For Valour'', p.88&lt;/ref&gt; 

Embittered by his dismissal from the RAAF and the meagre [[Severance package|severance]] he received from the Australian Government, McNamara had insisted that his Victoria Cross not be returned to Australia after his death; his family donated it to the [[Royal Air Force Museum|RAF Museum]], London.&lt;ref name=&quot;Macklin pp.94-99&quot;/&gt; A fellow No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron pilot, Lieutenant (later Air Vice Marshal) [[Adrian Cole (RAAF officer)|Adrian Cole]], described McNamara as &quot;quiet, scholarly, loyal and beloved by all&amp;nbsp;... the last Officer for whom that high honour would have been predicted&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Garrison&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cutlack, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/9/chapters/04.pdf ''The Australian Flying Corps'', p.52]&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of the few Victoria Cross recipients to subsequently attain senior rank in the armed services, however RAAF historian Alan Stephens considered that his appointments were &quot;in the main routine&quot; and that his one great deed led to &quot;a degree of fame that he perhaps found burdensome&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.14-15&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;A Hero's Dilemma&quot;/&gt; Biographer Chris Coulthard-Clark summed up McNamara's &quot;dilemma&quot; as that of &quot;an essentially ordinary man&quot; thrust into the limelight by one &quot;truly amazing episode&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;A Hero's Dilemma&quot;&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''A Hero's Dilemma'', pp.114–115&lt;/ref&gt; His name is borne by Frank McNamara Park in [[Shepparton, Victoria|Shepparton]], Victoria,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greatershepparton.com.au/leisure.asp?id=frankmcnamarapark Frank McNamara Park] at [http://www.greatershepparton.com.au/ Greater Shepparton Online Network].
