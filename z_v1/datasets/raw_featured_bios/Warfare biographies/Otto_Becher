[[Rear Admiral#Australia|Rear Admiral]] '''Otto Humphrey Becher''' [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]], [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]], [[Distinguished Service Cross (United Kingdom)|DSC]] [[Medal bar|&amp; Bar]] (13 September 1908 &amp;ndash; 15 June 1977) was a senior officer in the [[Royal Australian Navy]]. Born in [[Harvey, Western Australia|Harvey]], [[Western Australia]], Becher entered the [[Royal Australian Naval College]] in 1922. After graduating in 1926, he was posted to a series of staff and training positions prior to specialising in [[gun]]nery.

A [[lieutenant commander]] at the outbreak of the [[Second World War]], Becher assisted in the extraction of Allied troops from the [[Namsos Campaign|Namsos]] region of Norway while aboard the [[heavy cruiser]] [[HMS Devonshire (39)|HMS ''Devonshire'']], and was decorated with the [[Distinguished Service Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Service Cross]]. Following service in the [[Mediterranean, Middle East and African theatres of World War II|Mediterranean theatre]], he returned to Australia in 1942 as officer-in-charge of the gunnery school at [[HMAS Cerberus, Victoria|HMAS ''Cerberus'']]. He spent two years at ''Cerberus'' before being given command of the [[Q and R class destroyer|Q class destroyer]] [[HMAS Quickmatch (G92)|HMAS ''Quickmatch'']] in March 1944.  While commanding the ''Quickmatch'' in operations against Japanese forces in the [[Pacific War|Pacific]], Becher earned a [[Medal bar|Bar]] to his Distinguished Service Cross.

At the war's end Becher was posted to the Navy Office and later to the aircraft carrier [[HMAS Sydney (R17)|HMAS ''Sydney'']]; in 1951 he was given command of the destroyer [[HMAS Warramunga (I44)|HMAS ''Warramunga'']]. ''Warramunga'' formed part of Australia's contribution to the [[United Nations]] forces engaged in the [[Korean War]]; Becher was promoted to [[Captain (naval)|captain]] and awarded the [[Distinguished Service Order]] while carrying out operations in Korean waters. On returning to Australia, he filled several staff positions and commanded the aircraft carriers [[HMAS Melbourne (R21)|HMAS ''Melbourne'']] and [[HMS Vengeance (R71)|HMAS ''Vengeance'']]. Promoted to rear admiral in 1959, he served as [[Flag officer|Flag Officer Commanding]] [[Commander Australian Fleet|Australian Fleet]] from 1964 to 1965, before taking up the post of Flag Officer-in-Charge East Australia Area. Becher retired from the Navy in 1966, and died in 1977 at the age of 68.

==Early life and career==
Otto Becher was born in [[Harvey, Western Australia|Harvey]], Western Australia, on 13 September 1908, to Francis Joseph Becher, an [[orchardist]], and Antonia Amalie (née Vetter). On 1 January 1922, at the age of thirteen, he enrolled in the [[Royal Australian Naval College]] at [[Jervis Bay Territory|Jervis Bay]],&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;&gt;{{Australian Dictionary of Biography|last=Frame|first=Tom|year=1993|id=A130170b|title=Becher, Otto Humphrey (1908 &amp;ndash; 1977)|accessdate=19 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WWII&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/script/veteran.asp?ServiceID=N&amp;VeteranID=1186816|title=Becher, Otto Humphrey |accessdate=19 April 2009|work=World War II Nominal Roll|publisher=Commonwealth of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he performed well both academically and at sport, receiving [[Sporting colours|colours]] for [[field hockey|hockey]] and [[tennis]]. Graduating in 1926, he served as a [[Midshipman#Royal Australian Navy|midshipman]] aboard [[HMAS Adelaide (1918)|HMAS ''Adelaide'']] and later [[HMAS Brisbane (1915)|HMAS ''Brisbane'']], before being posted to the [[United Kingdom]] in September of that year for further sea-training and professional development with the [[Royal Navy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ServRec&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://naa12.naa.gov.au/scripts/imagine.asp?B=5218133&amp;I=1&amp;SE=1|title=Becher, Otto Humphrey |accessdate=19 April 2009|work=Records Search|publisher=National Archives of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Becher was promoted to acting [[sub-lieutenant]] in September 1928; the rank was made substantive the following March. He returned to Australia in January 1930 and was raised to [[lieutenant]], gaining further seafaring experience over the next two years on [[HMAS Australia (D84)|HMAS ''Australia'']] and [[HMAS Canberra (D33)|HMAS ''Canberra'']]. Deciding to specialise in gunnery, he attended an advanced course at the Royal Navy's gunnery school at [[HMS Excellent (shore establishment)|HMS ''Excellent'']] in England from 1932 until 1934. Returning to Australia after completing the course, on 7 January 1935, Becher married Valerie Chisholm Baird at St Michael's Anglican Church in [[Vaucluse, New South Wales|Vaucluse]], [[New South Wales]]; the couple would have three sons.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ServRec&quot;/&gt;

From May 1934 to June 1935, Becher was posted to the gunnery school at the shore establishment HMAS ''Cerberus'' in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. He later completed two years aboard HMAS ''Canberra'' as her [[intelligence officer]], and in 1937 was transferred to [[HMAS Stuart (D00)|HMAS ''Stuart'']] for [[flotilla]] duties. Promoted to lieutenant commander on 16 June 1938, Becher briefly returned to ''Cerberus'' before embarking for the United Kingdom on exchange with the Royal Navy in January 1939.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ServRec&quot;/&gt;

==Second World War==
Becher was serving as squadron gunnery officer aboard the Royal Navy [[heavy cruiser]] [[HMS Devonshire (39)|HMS ''Devonshire'']] when the Second World War broke out. In May 1940, ''Devonshire'' was dispatched to the [[Namsos Campaign|Namsos]] region of [[Norway]] to assist in the extraction of [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] troops.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Commended for his &quot;daring, resource and devotion&quot; during the operation, Becher was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Service Cross]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DSC&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/awm192/00309/003090504.pdf|title=Recommendation for Otto Humphrey Becher to be awarded a Distinguished Service Cross |accessdate=19 April 2009|format=PDF|work=Index to Recommendations: Second World War|publisher=Australian War Memorial}}&lt;/ref&gt; The notification for the decoration was published in a supplement to the ''[[London Gazette]]'' on 19 July 1940,&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=34901|date=19 July 1940|startpage=4492|supp=yes|accessdate=19 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the investiture ceremony was held by [[George VI of the United Kingdom|King George VI]] at [[Buckingham Palace]] on 11 March 1941.&lt;ref name=&quot;DSC&quot;/&gt;

In late November 1940, Becher transferred to the recently launched destroyer [[HMAS Napier (G97)|HMAS ''Napier'']] as part of the ship's commissioning crew.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ServRec&quot;/&gt; While completing working-up exercises, ''Napier'' was tasked with transferring [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] [[Winston Churchill]] and his wife from [[Thurso]] in Scotland to the battleship [[HMS King George V (41)|HMS ''King George V'']], and later returning them to the mainland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gill|1957|p=337}}&lt;/ref&gt; With her working-up complete, ''Napier'' was initially posted to convoy duties in the [[North Atlantic]], before setting sail in April 1941 with [[HMAS Nizam (G38)|HMAS ''Nizam'']] for the [[Battle of the Mediterranean|Mediterranean Sea]]. Arriving in May, she formed up as part of the [[Mediterranean Fleet (United Kingdom)|Mediterranean Fleet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gill|1957|p=338}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

''Napier'' assisted in the evacuation of British and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] troops from the island of Crete in late May, following the successful [[Battle of Crete|Axis invasion]]. On one such occasion the vessel embarked 296 soldiers, three women, one Greek and one Chinese civilian, ten sailors, two children and a dog. Returning to [[Alexandria, Egypt|Alexandria]], the destroyer came under attack but arrived unscathed. Two days later ''Napier'' was less fortunate; having taken 705 soldiers on board, she was targeted on her return journey by a formation of twelve [[Junkers Ju 88|German dive-bombers]]. The ship was struck twice by bombs and suffered damage to the [[stern]], the engine room and boiler room. One of the aircraft was shot down and a further three damaged. Although no allied casualties were sustained and the destroyer arrived safely in Alexandria, she spent the next two-and-a-half months in [[Port Said]] under repair.&lt;ref name=&quot;Napier&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.navy.gov.au/HMAS_Napier|title=HMAS ''Napier'' |accessdate=28 May 2009|work=Royal Australian Navy|publisher=Australian Government}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gill|1957|p=360}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Becher returned to Australia in early 1942, and from 17 May was appointed officer-in-charge of the gunnery school at HMAS ''Cerberus''. He remained at this post for almost two years until, on 12 March 1944, he was given command of the destroyer [[HMAS Quickmatch (G92)|HMAS ''Quickmatch'']]—formed up as part of the [[Eastern Fleet]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ServRec&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sabang&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Gill|1968|pp=463&amp;ndash;464}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 July, ''Quickmatch'' was among a 23-vessel strong task force that set out from [[Trincomalee]] to assault the Japanese naval base off northern [[Sumatra]] at [[Sabang, Indonesia|Sabang Island]]. The formation approached Sabang on the night of 24/25 July, launching fighter strikes on airfields in the area at first light. At 06:55, the fleet bombarded the harbour installations, coastal defence batteries and the military barracks. As the formation's two battleships maintained their fire, ''Quickmatch'' joined three other ships that entered the harbour to carry out close-range bombardment. After completing their task, ''Quickmatch'' and her fellows withdrew under the cover of fire from two cruisers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sabang&quot;/&gt; Praised for his &quot;outstanding courage and skill&quot; in pressing home the assault,&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/awm192/00309/003090503.pdf|title=Recommendation for Otto Humphrey Becher to be awarded a Bar to Distinguished Service Cross |accessdate=19 April 2009|format=PDF|work=Index to Recommendations: Second World War|publisher=Australian War Memorial}}&lt;/ref&gt; Becher was awarded a [[Medal bar|Bar]] to his Distinguished Service Cross, announced in a supplement to the ''London Gazette'' on 31 October 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=36771|date=31 October 1944|startpage=4977|supp=yes|accessdate=19 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1944, ''Quickmatch'' was transferred to Australian waters and underwent her annual refit at Sydney from November to December. Once the refit was completed she operated mainly off the Australian coast.&lt;ref name=&quot;HMAS_Quickmatch_history&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.navy.gov.au/HMAS_Quickmatch|title=HMAS Quickmatch|work=RoyalAustralian Navy|publisher=Australian Government|accessdate=20 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the early hours of 25 December 1944, the Navy Office in [[Melbourne]] received an [[SOS]] from the SS ''Robert J. Walker'', reporting that she had been torpedoed by a submarine while travelling from [[Fremantle, Western Australia]] to Sydney. Aircraft were dispatched to provide aerial cover, and HMA Ships ''Quickmatch'', ''Kiama'' and ''Yandra'' were directed to ''Robert J. Walker''{{'}}s position. ''Quickmatch'' and ''Yandra'' were to operate against the submarine, while ''Kiama'' was to take the ''Robert J. Walker'' under tow.  Arriving at the reported location at approximately 23:30 that evening, ''Quickmatch'', under the command of Becher, and ''Kiama'' patrolled the vicinity in search of the submarine and ''Robert J. Walker''{{'}}s crew. Sixty-seven men were discovered in [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboats]] at 05:45 the following morning and were taken aboard ''Quickmatch''; ''Robert J. Walker'' had sunk two hours earlier with the loss of two crew.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gill|1968|pp=551&amp;ndash;552}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Becher was promoted to [[Commander#Royal Australian Navy|commander]] on 31 December 1944,&lt;ref name=&quot;ServRec&quot;/&gt; and the following month ''Quickmatch'' was transferred to the recently established [[British Pacific Fleet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gill|1968|p=572}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 February, the British Pacific Fleet, including ''Quickmatch'', sailed from [[Sydney Harbour]] for [[Manus Island]] to prepare for its role in support of the planned United States [[Battle of Okinawa|invasion of Okinawa]]. The fleet engaged in eleven days of exercises at Manus before departing for [[Ulithi]], and on 23 March was attached to the [[United States Fifth Fleet]] with the designation &quot;Task Force 57&quot;. Setting sail for Okinawa two days later,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gill|1968|pp=603&amp;ndash;604}}&lt;/ref&gt; the fleet launched air strikes against airfield targets in the [[Sakishima Islands]] on 26 and 27 March.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gill605&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Gill|1968|pp=605&amp;ndash;606}}&lt;/ref&gt; During these operations ''Quickmatch'' formed part of the escort for the fleet's aircraft carriers.&lt;ref name=&quot;HMAS_Quickmatch_history&quot; /&gt; Becher later stated: &quot;These two days' operations were successful, the enemy airstrips being neutralised and a number of aircraft being destroyed on the ground.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gill605&quot; /&gt; Task Force 57 continued operations around the Sakishima Islands for the following two months to cover the United States' left flank, with ''Quickmatch'' forming part of the carrier force's escort throughout this period.&lt;ref name=&quot;HMAS_Quickmatch_history&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gill605&quot;/&gt;

On 25 June 1945, Becher relinquished command of HMAS ''Quickmatch'' and returned to Australia, where he was attached to the shore base [[HMAS Penguin (naval base)|HMAS ''Penguin'']].&lt;ref name=&quot;ServRec&quot;/&gt; For his &quot;distinguished service&amp;nbsp;... in the Pacific&quot; he received a [[Mention in Despatches]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/awm192/00309/003090505.pdf|title=Recommendation for Otto Humphrey Becher to be awarded a Mention in Despatches |accessdate=19 April 2009|format=PDF|work=Index to Recommendations: Second World War|publisher=Australian War Memorial}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=37603|date=11 June 1946|startpage=2885|supp=yes|accessdate=19 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August, he transferred to HMAS ''Cerberus'' for duties with the Navy Office.&lt;ref name=&quot;ServRec&quot;/&gt;

==Interbellum and Korean War==
Becher remained with the Navy Office until November 1947, when he was posted to the United Kingdom to join the aircraft carrier [[HMAS Sydney (R17)|HMAS ''Sydney''{{'}}s]] commissioning crew. Embarking from Melbourne during February 1948, he was temporarily attached to [[HMNB Devonport|HMS ''Drake'']] and later [[HMS Glory (R62)|HMS ''Glory'']] until ''Sydney''{{'}}s commissioning on 16 December. His service aboard the aircraft carrier lasted for two years, and was followed on 23 January 1950 by an appointment as Commanding Officer to the shore establishment [[HMAS Watson|HMAS ''Watson'']]. However, Becher's time at ''Watson'' was cut short when, on 28 July, he relieved Captain [[Alan McNicoll]] as commander of the destroyer HMAS ''Warramunga'', which had been selected for service in the Korean War.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ServRec&quot;/&gt; ''Warramunga'' was to be attached to a force of five Royal Navy destroyers led by a captain, making it expedient to have the Australian ship commanded by an officer of lower rank.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|O'Neill|1985|p=420}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:HMAS Warramunga (AWM 017128).jpg|thumb|alt=Photograph of a war ship in a body of water. Large cannons can be seen on the deck, along with sailors.|right|200px|HMAS ''Warramunga'', which served in the Korean War under Captain Otto Becher from 1950 to 1951]]

''Warramunga'' arrived in Korean waters  in late August 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.koreanroll.gov.au/veteran.aspx?id=1218478|title=Becher, Otto Humphrey |accessdate=19 April 2009|work=Korean War Nominal Roll|publisher=Commonwealth of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; After some initial escort work, she joined [[HMAS Bataan (I91)|HMAS ''Bataan'']] as part of the carrier [[HMS Triumph (R16)|HMS ''Triumph''{{'}}s]] protective screen while the latter contributed air cover to the Allied [[Battle of Incheon|landing at Incheon]] on 15 September.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|O'Neill|1985|pp=422&amp;ndash;425}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the next three months, ''Warramunga'' engaged in patrol and screening duties, in addition to transporting food for famine relief.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|O'Neill|1985|pp=426&amp;ndash;429}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 December, ''Warramunga'' and ''Bataan'' supported the emergency withdrawal of Allied troops from [[Nampho|Chinnampo]]. Becher decided to sail up a channel of the [[Taedong River]] known as Short Cut, which according to his charts should have allowed him five to ten feet of clearance. The chart proved inaccurate, and ''Warramunga'' ran aground at 23:15; Becher's only option was to wait for the rising tide to float the destroyer off. ''Warramunga'' came free at 23:50 without having sustained damage, and was able to resume her mission, escorting troop transports south. Later, Becher brought ''Warramunga'' alongside ''Bataan'' and entreated the latter's commander, via megaphone, to keep quiet about the incident. With Becher's promotion to captain due, he was concerned that if the Naval Board became aware of the grounding his promotion would be delayed until an investigation had taken place. His &quot;well-earned&quot; rise in rank came through as scheduled on 31 December.&lt;ref name=&quot;ServRec&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;O'Neill&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|O'Neill|1985|pp=431&amp;ndash;435}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the journey south, ''Warramunga''{{'}}s crew developed a new way of signalling between ships that was considerably quicker than using international code flags. Known to the crew as the &quot;Murphy Method&quot;, it involved wrapping messages around potatoes and throwing them from one ship to the other.&lt;ref name=&quot;O'Neill&quot;/&gt;

''Warramunga'' participated in the [[Siege of Wonsan]] during late February 1951, where she engaged and partially destroyed North Korean shore batteries, as well as shelling buildings and transport infrastructure. Despite coming under fire the destroyer sustained no damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|O'Neill|1985|pp=441&amp;ndash;443}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the remainder of her tour in Korea, ''Warramunga'' took part in patrols and shore bombardments, earning special praise from Vice Admiral [[C. Turner Joy]], Commander US Naval Forces Far East, for the accuracy of her gunnery.&lt;ref name=&quot;O'Neill459&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|O'Neill|1985|pp=459&amp;ndash;461}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 July 1951, it was announced that Becher had been appointed as an honorary [[aide-de-camp]] to the [[Governor-General of Australia]] for a period of three years.&lt;ref name=&quot;ServRec&quot;/&gt; Following ''Warramunga''{{'}}s departure from Korean waters on 1 August, Rear Admiral [[Alan Scott-Moncrieff]], Commander West Coast Blockade Force, commented: &quot;She has been a tower of strength and done an incredible amount of steaming with no troubles at all. I cannot speak too highly of Captain O. H. Becher and his men&amp;nbsp;...&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;O'Neill459&quot;/&gt; Together with ''Bataan'', ''Warramunga'' had borne the brunt of Australia's naval contribution to the Korean War.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|O'Neill|1985|p=528}}&lt;/ref&gt; Noting his &quot;courage, skill and determination&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;DSO&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/awm192/00308/003080288.pdf|title=Recommendation for Otto Humphrey Becher to be awarded a Distinguished Service Order |accessdate=19 April 2009|format=PDF|work=Index to Recommendations: Korean War|publisher=Australian War Memorial}}&lt;/ref&gt; a recommendation for Becher to be awarded the [[Distinguished Service Order]] was approved by the [[Australian Government]] on 17 August 1951,&lt;ref name=&quot;DSO&quot;/&gt; and announced in the ''London Gazette'' the following month.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=39336|date=18 September 1951|startpage=4884|accessdate=19 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; For his &quot;meritorious service&amp;nbsp;... as C.O. of ''Warramunga''&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/awm192/00308/003080289.pdf|title=Recommendation for Otto Humphrey Becher to be awarded a US Legion of Merit |accessdate=19 April 2009|format=PDF|work=Index to Recommendations: Korean War|publisher=Australian War Memorial}}&lt;/ref&gt; Becher was also decorated by the United States with the [[Legion of Merit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=40406|date=15 February 1955|startpage=919|supp=yes|accessdate=19 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Senior command==
Becher retained command of ''Warramunga'' until October 1951, when he was posted to the shore base HMAS ''Lonsdale'' for service with the Navy Office as Deputy Chief of Naval Personnel and Director of Personal Services. In September that year he was additionally appointed trustee of the Services Canteens Trust Fund; a position he held until October 1952 and for which he received a letter of appreciation from the [[Minister for Defence (Australia)|Minister for Defence]]. The same month he assumed the position of Deputy [[Chief of Navy (Australia)|Chief of Naval Staff]]. On 25 August 1954, Becher was given command of the aircraft carrier [[HMS Vengeance (R71)|HMAS ''Vengeance'']],&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ServRec&quot;/&gt; and in October he returned with his new command to the Korean theatre to transport the aircraft, equipment and personnel of [[No. 77 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;77 Squadron RAAF]] back to Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|O'Neill|1985|p=593}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1956, Becher embarked for the United Kingdom to attend the [[Imperial Defence College]]. A month after his December graduation, he travelled back to Australia and assumed command of [[HMAS Melbourne (R21)|HMAS ''Melbourne'']]. Becher remained with ''Melbourne'' until December 1958, at which time he returned to the Navy Office at HMAS ''Lonsdale'' to resume his role as Deputy Chief of Naval Staff. He was promoted to acting [[Rear Admiral (Australia)|rear admiral]] on 3 January 1959, the rank being made substantive twelve months later.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ServRec&quot;/&gt; In the [[Queen's Birthday Honours]] of 1961, Becher was appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=42371|date=10 June 1961|startpage=4179|supp=yes|accessdate=19 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Relinquishing his position with the Navy Office in 1962, Becher was sent to the United Kingdom as Head of the Australian Joint Services Staff in London. In January 1964 he returned to Australia, and was made [[Commander Australian Fleet|Flag Officer Commanding HM Australian Fleet]]. During his time in this role Becher became embroiled in the controversy that followed the [[Melbourne-Voyager collision|collision of HMA Ships ''Voyager'' and ''Melbourne'']], which took place in February that year. Prior to giving evidence before the [[Royal Commission]] that had been established to investigate the incident, Becher had discussed events with ''Melbourne''{{'}}s Commanding Officer, Commander Ronald Robertson. The discussion became public knowledge, and led to suggestions of conspiracy. Becher stated to the commission that ''Melbourne'' should have questioned ''Voyager''{{'}}s final movements; his evidence is alleged to have influenced the Royal Commissioner, [[John Spicer (Australian politician)|Sir John Spicer]], to place a degree of blame on Robertson.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com.rp.nla.gov.au:2048/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t271.e183|title=Becher, Rear Admiral Otto Humphrey |accessdate=19 April 2009|author=Peter Dennis, Jeffrey Grey, Ewan Morris, Robin Prior and Jean Bou|work=The Oxford Companion to Australian Military History|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1965, Becher assumed his final command as Flag Officer-in-Charge East Australia Area,&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; before retiring from the Royal Australian Navy on 6 March 1966.&lt;ref name=&quot;WWII&quot;/&gt;

==Retirement==
Following his retirement, Becher accepted the position of Director-General of Recruiting for the Australian armed forces from 1966 until 1969, a period during which [[conscription in Australia|conscription]] was in effect. Minister of Defence [[Allen Fairhall]] asked Becher to find enough volunteers to fill the armed forces, and Becher believed that conscription eroded professional standards, but he found this task difficult given that the military was &quot;competing with industry, and the country was short of labour.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Battle for Volunteers|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=6 October 1966|page=10|url =http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=vmsRAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=q-YDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=874,1733084&amp;dq=otto-becher}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also held the post of chairman of the Council of the Institute of Marine Sciences at the [[University of New South Wales]]. On 15 June 1977, aged 68, Becher died from a [[myocardial infarction]] at [[Sydney Hospital]]. Survived by his wife and their three sons, he was cremated.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;
