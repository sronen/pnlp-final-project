'''William Ford Gibson''' (born March 17, 1948) is an [[Canadians of American origin|American-Canadian]] [[speculative fiction]] novelist who has been called the &quot;noir prophet&quot; of the [[cyberpunk]] subgenre.&lt;ref name=&quot;smh&quot;/&gt; Gibson coined the term &quot;[[cyberspace]]&quot; in his short story &quot;[[Burning Chrome]]&quot; (1982) and later popularized the concept in his [[debut novel]], ''[[Neuromancer]]'' (1984). In envisaging cyberspace, Gibson created an [[iconography]] for the [[information age]] before the ubiquity of the Internet in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Schactman |first=Noah | work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |title=26 Years After Gibson, Pentagon Defines 'Cyberspace' |url=http://blog.wired.com/defense/2008/05/pentagon-define.html |date=2008-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also credited with predicting the rise of [[reality television]] and with establishing the conceptual foundations for the rapid growth of virtual environments such as video games and the [[World Wide Web]].

Having changed residence frequently with his family as a child, Gibson became a shy, ungainly teenager who often read science fiction. After spending his adolescence at a private boarding school in [[Arizona]], Gibson [[draft dodger|evaded the draft]] during the [[Vietnam War]] by emigrating to Canada in 1968, where he became immersed in the [[counterculture]] and after settling in Vancouver eventually became a full-time writer. He retains [[dual citizenship]].&lt;ref name=&quot;seattle pi&quot;/&gt; Gibson's early works are bleak, noir near-future stories about the effect of [[cybernetics]] and [[computer network]]s on humans—a &quot;combination of lowlife and high tech&quot;.&lt;ref name=mao/&gt; The short stories were published in popular science fiction magazines. The themes, settings and characters developed in these stories culminated in his first novel, ''Neuromancer'', which garnered critical and commercial success, virtually initiating the cyberpunk literary genre.

Although much of Gibson's reputation has remained associated with ''Neuromancer'', his work has continued to evolve. After expanding on ''Neuromancer'' with two more novels to complete the dystopic [[Sprawl trilogy]], Gibson became an important author of another science fiction sub-genre—[[steampunk]]—with the 1990 alternate history novel ''[[The Difference Engine]]'', written with [[Bruce Sterling]]. In the 1990s, he composed the [[Bridge trilogy]] of novels, which focused on sociological observations of near-future urban environments and [[late capitalism]]. His most recent novels—''[[Pattern Recognition (novel)|Pattern Recognition]]'' (2003), ''[[Spook Country]]'' (2007) and ''[[Zero History]]'' (2010)—are set in a contemporary world and have put his work onto mainstream bestseller lists for the first time.

Gibson is one of the best-known North American science fiction writers, fêted by ''The Guardian'' in 1999 as &quot;probably the most important novelist of the past two decades&quot;. Gibson has written more than twenty short stories and ten critically acclaimed novels (one in collaboration), and has contributed articles to several major publications and collaborated extensively with performance artists, filmmakers and musicians. His thought has been cited as an influence on science fiction authors, design, academia, [[cyberculture]], and technology.

=== Childhood, itinerance, and adolescence ===

In October 1982, Gibson traveled to Austin, Texas for [[ArmadilloCon]], at which he appeared with Shirley, Sterling and Shiner on a panel called &quot;Behind the Mirrorshades: A Look at Punk SF&quot;, where Shiner noted &quot;the sense of a movement solidified&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;shiner&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Shiner | first = Lewis |authorlink=Lewis Shiner |coauthors=George Edgar Slusser, Tom Shippey | title = Fiction 2000:Cyberpunk and the Future of Narrative | publisher = University of Georgia Press | location = Athens | year = 1992 | chapter=Inside the Movement: Past, Present and Future |isbn = 978-0-8203-1425-9 |oclc = 24953403}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a weekend discussing rock and roll, MTV, Japan, fashion, drugs and politics, Gibson left the cadre for Vancouver, declaring half-jokingly that &quot;a new axis has been formed.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;shiner&quot;/&gt; Sterling, Shiner, Shirley and Gibson, along with [[Rudy Rucker]], went on to form the core of the radical [[cyberpunk]] literary movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

== Literary career ==
=== Early short fiction ===
{{details|Burning Chrome (short story collection)}}
Gibson's early writings are generally near-future stories about the influences of [[cybernetics]] and [[cyberspace]] (computer-simulated reality) technology on the human race. His themes of hi-tech [[shanty town]]s, recorded or broadcast stimulus (later to be developed into the &quot;sim-stim&quot; package featured so heavily in ''Neuromancer''), and dystopic intermingling of technology and humanity, are already evident in his first published short story, &quot;Fragments of a Hologram Rose&quot; (1977).&lt;ref name=&quot;project cyberpunk interview&quot;/&gt; The latter thematic obsession was described by his friend and fellow author, Bruce Sterling, in the introduction of Gibson's short story collection ''[[Burning Chrome (short story collection)|Burning Chrome]]'', as &quot;Gibson's classic one-two combination of lowlife and high tech.&quot;&lt;ref name=mao&gt;{{cite book |last=Gibson |first=William |coauthors=[[Bruce Sterling]] | chapter= Introduction | title=[[Burning Chrome (short story collection)|Burning Chrome]] |year=1986 |publisher=Harper Collins |location=New York |isbn=0-06-053982-8 |oclc = 51342671}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1980s, Gibson's stories appeared in ''[[Omni (magazine)|Omni]]'' and ''Universe 11'', wherein his fiction developed a bleak, ''[[film noir]]'' feel. He consciously distanced himself as far as possible from the mainstream of science fiction (towards which he felt &quot;an aesthetic revulsion&quot;, expressed in &quot;[[The Gernsback Continuum]]&quot;), to the extent that his highest goal was to become &quot;a minor [[cult following|cult figure]], a sort of lesser [[J. G. Ballard|Ballard]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;project cyberpunk interview&quot;/&gt; When Sterling started to distribute the stories, he found that &quot;people were just genuinely baffled... I mean they literally could not parse the guy's paragraphs... the imaginative tropes he was inventing were just beyond peoples' grasp.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;nomaps&quot;/&gt;

While [[Larry McCaffery]] has commented that these early short stories displayed flashes of Gibson's ability, science fiction critic [[Darko Suvin]] has identified them as &quot;undoubtedly [cyberpunk's] best works&quot;, constituting the &quot;furthest horizon&quot; of the genre.&lt;ref name=&quot;storming&quot;/&gt; The themes which Gibson developed in the stories, [[the Sprawl]] setting of &quot;[[Burning Chrome]]&quot; and the character of [[Molly Millions]] from &quot;[[Johnny Mnemonic]]&quot; ultimately culminated in his first novel, ''[[Neuromancer]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;storming&quot;/&gt;

''Neuromancer'' was commissioned by [[Terry Carr]] for the third series of [[Ace Science Fiction Specials]], which was intended to exclusively feature [[debut novel]]s.

''Neuromancer'''s release was not greeted with fanfare, but it hit a cultural nerve,&lt;ref name=&quot;hollinger&quot;/&gt; quickly becoming an underground [[word-of-mouth]] hit.&lt;ref name=&quot;storming&quot;/&gt; It became the first novel to win the &quot;triple crown&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;project cyberpunk interview&quot;/&gt; of science fiction awards (the [[Nebula Award|Nebula]], the [[Hugo Award|Hugo]], and [[Philip K.

Although much of Gibson's reputation has remained rooted in ''Neuromancer'', his work continued to evolve conceptually and stylistically.&lt;ref name=&quot;spike&quot;/&gt; Despite adding the final sentence of ''Neuromancer'', &quot;He never saw Molly again&quot;, at the last minute in a deliberate attempt to prevent himself from ever writing a sequel, he did precisely that with ''[[Count Zero]]'' (1986), a character-focused work set in [[the Sprawl]] alluded to in its predecessor.&lt;ref name=&quot;sequel&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.williamgibsonbooks.com/blog/2003_01_01_archive.asp#90158337 |title= (untitled weblog post) |accessdate=2008-01-21 |last=Gibson |first=William |date=2003-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; He next intended to write an unrelated postmodern [[space opera]], titled ''The Log of the Mustang Sally'', but reneged on the contract with [[Arbor House]] after a falling out over the [[dustjacket]] art of their hardcover of ''Count Zero''.&lt;ref name=&quot;mustang&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.williamgibsonbooks.com/blog/2005_08_01_archive.asp#112417337358385397 |title=The Log of the Mustang Sally |accessdate=2008-01-21 |last=Gibson |first=William |date=2005-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abandoning ''The Log of the Mustang Sally'', Gibson instead wrote ''[[Mona Lisa Overdrive]]'' (1988), which in the words of Larry McCaffery &quot;turned off the lights&quot; on cyberpunk literature.&lt;ref name=&quot;project cyberpunk interview&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;storming&quot;/&gt; It was a culmination of his previous two novels, set in the same [[fictional universe|universe]] with shared characters, thereby completing the [[Sprawl trilogy]].

The Sprawl trilogy was followed by the 1990 novel ''[[The Difference Engine]]'', an [[alternate history (fiction)|alternate history]] novel Gibson wrote in collaboration with Bruce Sterling. Set in a technologically advanced [[Victorian era]] Britain, the novel was a departure from the authors' cyberpunk roots. It was nominated for the [[Nebula Award for Best Novel]] in 1991 and the [[John W. Campbell Memorial Award]] in 1992, and its success drew attention to the nascent [[steampunk]] literary genre of which it remains the best-known work.&lt;ref name=&quot;steampunkt&quot;&gt;{{cite news | first = Peter | last = Bebergal | title = The age of steampunk | url = http://www.boston.com/news/globe/ideas/articles/2007/08/26/the_age_of_steampunk/ | publisher = The Boston Globe | page = 3 | date = 2007-08-26 | accessdate = 2007-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/booksblog/2009/jan/07/steampunk-chiang-lake-macleod |work=[[The Guardian]] |title=Steampunk: the future of the past |first=Damien G |last=Walter |date=January 7, 2009 |accessdate=January 11, 2009 |publisher=Guardian Media Group | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gibson's second series, the &quot;[[Bridge trilogy]]&quot;, is composed of ''[[Virtual Light]]'' (1993), a &quot;darkly comic urban detective story&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;cyberhero&quot;/&gt; ''[[Idoru]]'' (1996), and ''[[All Tomorrow's Parties (novel)|All Tomorrow's Parties]]'' (1999).

In 1993, Gibson contributed lyrics and featured as a guest vocalist on Yellow Magic Orchestra's ''[[Technodon]]'' album,&lt;ref name=&quot;skier&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/release/432896 |title=Yellow Magic Orchestra - Technodon |accessdate=2008-01-10 |work=[[Discogs]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; and wrote lyrics to the track &quot;Dog Star Girl&quot; for Deborah Harry's ''[[Debravation]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;debravation&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Degen |last=Pener |title= EGOS &amp; IDS; Deborah Harry Is Low-Key -- And Unblond |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE6DC1239F931A1575BC0A965958260&amp;n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/People/H/Harry,%20Debbie |publisher=The New York Times |date=1993-08-22 |accessdate=2007-11-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Film adaptations, screenplays, and appearances ===
Gibson was first solicited to work as a screenwriter after a film producer discovered a waterlogged copy of ''Neuromancer'' on a beach at a [[Thailand|Thai]] resort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=[[Details (magazine)|Details]] |url=http://www.textfiles.com/sf/cyberlit.txt |title=Cyber Lit |year=1992 |month=June |first=Gavin |last=Edwards |issue=134 |accessdate=2008-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; His early efforts to write film scripts failed to manifest themselves as finished product; &quot;Burning Chrome&quot; (which was to be directed by [[Kathryn Bigelow]]) and &quot;Neuro-Hotel&quot; were two attempts by the author at film adaptations that were never made.&lt;ref name=&quot;salza&quot;&gt;{{cite interview |last=Gibson |first=William |interviewer=Giuseppe Salza |city=Cannes |year=1994 |month=May |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/235 |accessdate=2007-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1980s he wrote an early version of ''[[Alien 3]]'' (which he later characterized as &quot;[[Andrei Tarkovsky|Tarkovskian]]&quot;), few elements of which survived in the final version.&lt;ref name=&quot;salza&quot;/&gt;
Gibson's early involvement with the film industry extended far beyond the confines of the Hollywood blockbuster system. At one point, he collaborated on a script with Kazakh director [[Rashid Nugmanov]] after an American producer had expressed an interest in a Soviet-American collaboration to star Russian-Korean star [[Victor Tsoi]].&lt;ref name=&quot;victor tsoi&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.williamgibsonbooks.com/blog/2003_03_01_archive.asp#90416069
|title=Victor Tsoi |accessdate=2007-12-03 |last=Gibson |first=William |date=2003-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being occupied with writing a novel, Gibson was reluctant to abandon the &quot;wonderfully odd project&quot; which involved &quot;ritualistic gang-warfare in some sort of sideways-future [[Leningrad]]&quot; and sent [[Jack Womack]] to Russia in his stead. Rather than producing a motion picture, a prospect that ended with Tsoi's death in a car crash, Womack's experiences in Russia ultimately culminated in his novel ''[[Let's Put the Future Behind Us]]'' and informed much of the Russian content of Gibson's ''[[Pattern Recognition (novel)|Pattern Recognition]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;victor tsoi&quot;/&gt; A similar fate befell Gibson's collaboration with Japanese filmmaker [[Sogo Ishii]] in 1991,&lt;ref name=&quot;storming&quot;/&gt; a film they plotted on shooting in the [[Walled City of Kowloon]] until the city was demolished in 1993.&lt;ref name=&quot;sogo&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.williamgibsonbooks.com/blog/2006_07_01_archive.asp#115354123358489417 |title=Burst City Trailer |first=William |last=Gibson |date=2006-07-21 |accessdate=2007-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:The Neuromancer.jpg|thumb|left|Aside from his short stories and novels, Gibson has written several film screenplays and [[television episode]]s.]]
Adaptations of Gibson's fiction have frequently been optioned and proposed, to limited success. Two of the author's short stories, both set in the [[Sprawl trilogy]] universe, have been loosely adapted as films: ''[[Johnny Mnemonic (film)|Johnny Mnemonic]]'' (1995) with screenplay by Gibson and starring Keanu Reeves, Dolph Lundgren and [[Takeshi Kitano]], and ''[[New Rose Hotel (film)|New Rose Hotel]]'' (1998), starring Christopher Walken, Willem Dafoe, and Asia Argento. The former was the first time in history that a book was launched simultaneously as a film and a [[CD-ROM]] interactive video game.&lt;ref name=&quot;mail&amp;guardian&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mg.co.za/articledirect.aspx?articleid=293681&amp;area=%2farts_movies%2f |title=Blade Runner on electro-steroids |accessdate=2007-11-11 |last=Walker |first=Martin |date=1996-09-03 |work=[[Mail &amp; Guardian#The Mail &amp; Guardian Online|Mail &amp; Guardian Online]] |publisher= M&amp;G Media}}{{dead link|date=May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Neuromancer'', after a long stay in [[development hell]], is in the process of adaptation {{as of|2007|lc=on}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.joblo.com/index.php?id=15997 |title=Neuromancer comes |accessdate=2007-08-27 |work=[[JoBlo.com]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Count Zero]]'' was at one point being developed as ''The Zen Differential'' with director [[Michael Mann (film director)|Michael Mann]] attached, and the third novel in the Sprawl trilogy, ''[[Mona Lisa Overdrive]]'', has also been optioned and bought.&lt;ref name=&quot;mtv&quot;/&gt; An [[anime]] adaptation of ''[[Idoru]]'' was announced as in development in 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://cyberpunkreview.com/movie/upcoming-movies/william-gibsons-idoru-coming-to-anime | date=2006-04-21|title=William Gibson’s Idoru Coming to Anime |publisher=cyberpunkreview.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Pattern Recognition'' was in the process of development by director [[Peter Weir]], although according to Gibson the latter is no longer attached to the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.williamgibsonbooks.com/blog/2007_05_01_archive.asp#2514436070772070825 |title=I've Forgotten More Neuromancer Film Deals Than You've Ever Heard Of |accessdate=2007-11-04 |last=Gibson |first=William |date=2007-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Television is another arena in which Gibson has collaborated; he co-wrote with friend [[Tom Maddox]], ''The X-Files'' episodes &quot;[[Kill Switch (The X-Files)|Kill Switch]]&quot; and &quot;[[First Person Shooter (The X-Files)|First Person Shooter]]&quot;, broadcast in the U.S. on [[20th Century Fox Television]] in 1998 and 2000.&lt;ref name=&quot;spike&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=newsbytes&gt;{{cite news |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0HDN/is_2000_Feb_24/ai_59615707 |title=&quot;X-Files&quot; Writer Fights For Online Privacy |accessdate=2007-07-13 |last=Fridman |first=Sherman |date=2000-02-24 |work=News Briefs |publisher=Newsbytes PM |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20040922035743/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0HDN/is_2000_Feb_24/ai_59615707 |archivedate=2004-09-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998 he contributed the introduction to the spin-off publication ''Art of the X-Files''. Gibson made a cameo appearance in the television miniseries ''[[Wild Palms]]'' at the behest of creator [[Bruce Wagner]].&lt;ref name=&quot;holograms&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.williamgibsonbooks.com/blog/2006_07_01_archive.asp#115361118165031237 |title=Where The Holograms Go |first=William |last=Gibson |date=2006-07-22 |accessdate=2007-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Director [[Oliver Stone]] had borrowed heavily from Gibson's novels to make the series,&lt;ref name=&quot;cyberhero&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Adam |last=Platt |title=Cyberhero |url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/1993/08/16/1993_08_16_024_TNY_CARDS_000364256 |work=The Talk of the Town |publisher=[[The New Yorker]] |date=1993-09-16 |page=24 |accessdate=2007-11-06 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/19990223224043/http://multiweb.evolution.com/clients/mindvox/newyorker.html |archivedate=1999-02-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the aftermath of its cancellation Gibson contributed an article, &quot;Where The Holograms Go&quot;, to the ''Wild Palms Reader''.&lt;ref name=&quot;holograms&quot;/&gt; He accepted another acting role in 2002, appearing alongside [[Douglas Coupland]] in the short film ''Mon Amour Mon Parapluie'' in which the pair played philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://64.207.169.13/mamp/cast/cast.htm |title=Cast |accessdate=2007-10-26 |work=Mon Amour Mon Parapluie |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20040621004844/http://64.207.169.13/mamp/cast/cast.htm |archivedate = June 21, 2004|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Appearances in fiction aside, Gibson was the focus of a biographical documentary by Mark Neale in 2000 called ''[[No Maps for These Territories]]''. The film follows Gibson over the course of a drive across North America discussing various aspects of his life, literary career and cultural interpretations. It features interviews with Jack Womack and Bruce Sterling, as well as recitations from ''Neuromancer'' by [[Bono]] and [[The Edge]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nomaps&quot;/&gt;

=== Exhibitions, poetry, and performance art ===
[[File:La Fura Dels Baus Dreams In Flight.jpg|thumb|upright|Gibson has often collaborated with [[performance art]]ists such as theatre group [[La Fura dels Baus]], here performing at the [[Singapore Arts Festival]] in May 2007.]]
Gibson has contributed text to be integrated into a number of [[performance art]] pieces. In October 1989, Gibson wrote text for such a collaboration with acclaimed sculptor and future ''[[Johnny Mnemonic (film)|Johnny Mnemonic]]'' director [[Robert Longo]]&lt;ref name=&quot;remembering&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/3.06/gibson.html |title=Remembering Johnny |accessdate=2008-01-10 |last=van Bakel |first=Rogier |journal=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |year=1995 |month=June | issue=3.06}}&lt;/ref&gt; titled ''Dream Jumbo: Working the Absolutes'', which was displayed in Royce Hall, University of California Los Angeles. Three years later, Gibson contributed original text to &quot;Memory Palace&quot;, a performance show featuring the theater group [[La Fura dels Baus]] at Art Futura '92, Barcelona, which featured images by [[Karl Sims]], [[Rebecca Allen]], [[Mark Pellington]] with music by [[Peter Gabriel]] and others.&lt;ref name=&quot;skier&quot;/&gt; It was at Art Futura '92 that Gibson met Charlie Athanas, who would later act as dramaturg and &quot;cyberprops&quot; designer on Steve Pickering and Charley Sherman's adaptation of &quot;Burning Chrome&quot; for the Chicago stage. Gibson's latest contribution was in 1997, a collaboration with critically acclaimed Vancouver-based contemporary dance company [[Holy Body Tattoo]] and Gibson's friend and future webmaster Christopher Halcrow.&lt;ref name=&quot;holybody&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.williamgibsonbooks.com/blog/2003_05_01_archive.asp#200367789 |title=Holy Body Tattoo |last=Gibson |first=William |date=2003-05-31 |accessdate=2007-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, Gibson contributed to &quot;Visionary San Francisco&quot;, an exhibition at the [[San Francisco Museum of Modern Art]] shown from June 14 to August 26.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Polledri | first = Paolo | title = Visionary San Francisco | publisher = Prestal | location = Munich | year = 1990 |oclc=22115872 | isbn = 3-7913-1060-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote a short story, &quot;[[Skinner's Room]]&quot;, set in a decaying San Francisco in which the [[San Francisco – Oakland Bay Bridge]] was closed and taken over by the homeless – a setting Gibson then detailed in the [[Bridge trilogy]]. The story inspired a contribution to the exhibition by architects Ming Fung and Craig Hodgetts that envisioned a San Francisco in which the rich live in high-tech, solar-powered towers, above the decrepit city and its crumbling bridge.&lt;ref name=&quot;architecture&quot;/&gt; The architects exhibit featured Gibson on a monitor discussing the future and reading from &quot;Skinner's Room&quot;.&lt;ref name=skier&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.skierpage.com/gibson/biblio.htm |title=William Gibson Bibliography / Mediagraphy |accessdate = 2008-02-09 |author = S. Page}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The New York Times'' hailed the exhibition as &quot;one of the most ambitious, and admirable, efforts to address the realm of architecture and cities that any museum in the country has mounted in the last decade&quot;, despite calling Ming and Hodgetts's reaction to Gibson's contribution &quot;a powerful, but sad and not a little cynical, work&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;architecture&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Paul |last=Goldberger |title=In San Francisco, A Good Idea Falls With a Thud |url= http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE1DB103CF931A2575BC0A966958260 |publisher=[[The New York Times Company]] |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=1990-08-12 |accessdate=2007-11-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A slightly different version of the short story was featured a year later in ''[[Omni (magazine)|Omni]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gibson |first=William |year=1991 |month=November |title=[[Skinner's Room]] |journal=[[Omni (magazine)|Omni]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A particularly well-received work by Gibson was ''[[Agrippa (a book of the dead)]]'' (1992), a 300-line semi-autobiographical electronic poem that was his contribution to a collaborative project with artist [[Dennis Ashbaugh]] and publisher Kevin Begos, Jr.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Gibson commented that Ashbaugh's design &quot;eventually included a supposedly self-devouring floppy-disk intended to display the text only once, then eat itself.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.williamgibsonbooks.com/source/source.asp |title=Introduction to Agrippa: A Book of the Dead |last=Gibson |first=William |year=1992 |accessdate=2007-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to numerous colorful reports, the diskettes were never actually &quot;[[Hacker (computer security)|hacked]]&quot;; instead the poem was manually transcribed from a surreptitious videotape of a public showing in Manhattan in December 1992, and released on the [[MindVox]] bulletin board the next day; this is the text that circulated widely on the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

=== Essays and short-form nonfiction ===
Gibson is a sporadic contributor of non-fiction articles to newspapers and journals. He has been a sporadic contributor of longer-form articles to ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' and of [[op-ed]]s to ''[[The New York Times]]'', and has written for ''[[The Observer]]'', ''[[Addicted to Noise]]'', ''[[New York Times Magazine]]'', ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', and ''[[Details Magazine]]''.

In ''Neuromancer'', Gibson first used the term &quot;[[wikt:matrix|matrix]]&quot; to refer to the visualised Internet, two years after the nascent Internet was formed in the early 1980s from the computer networks of the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Postel, J., Network Working Group|month=November | year=1981|url=http://www.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc801.txt|publisher=[[Information Sciences Institute]] of the [[University of Southern California]]|title=RFC 801 - NCP/TCP Transition Plan|accessdate=2007-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Zakon, Robert H|title=Hobbes' Internet Timeline v8.2|url=http://www.zakon.org/robert/internet/timeline/|publisher=Zakon Group LLC|date=2006-11-01|accessdate=2007-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.netlingo.com/lookup.cfm?term=matrix |title=Matrix |accessdate=2007-09-09 |work=Netlingo }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gibson thereby imagined a worldwide [[Telecommunications network|communications network]] years before the origin of the [[World Wide Web]],&lt;ref name=&quot;spike&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

For his part, Gibson rejects any notion of prophecy, never having had a special relationship with computers; until 1996 he had neither an email address nor a [[modem]], a lack he explained at the time to have been motivated by a desire to avoid correspondence that would distract him from writing.&lt;ref name=&quot;josefsson&quot;/&gt; His first exposure to a website came while writing ''[[Idoru]]'' when he was persuaded to let a web developer, Chris Halcrow, build one for him.&lt;ref name=&quot;salon interview&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.salon.com/weekly/gibson961014.html |title=William Gibson Webmaster |accessdate=2007-11-06 |last=Rosenberg |first=Scott |work=The Salon Interview |publisher=[[Salon.com]] |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070907144823/http://www.salon.com/weekly/gibson961014.html &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt; |archivedate=2007-09-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An anecdote often recited in cybercultural enclaves and English departments holds that ''Neuromancer'' was written on a manual [[typewriter]];&lt;ref name=&quot;typewriter&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Bukatman | first = Scott | title = Matters of Gravity |chapter=Gibson's Typewriter |publisher = Duke University Press | location = Durham | year = 2003 | isbn = 978-0-8223-3119-3 |oclc = 51058973}}&lt;/ref&gt; the author has confirmed that the novel was written on a 1927 model of an olive-green Hermes portable typewriter, which looked to him as &quot;the kind of thing [[Ernest Hemingway|Hemingway]] would have used in the field&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;mail&amp;guardian&quot;/&gt;{{Ref_label|H|VIII|none}} In 2007, he said:{{bquote|I have a 2005 [[PowerBook G4]], a [[gigabyte|gig]] of memory, [[wireless router]].

'''&lt;small&gt;VIII&lt;/small&gt;.''' {{Note_label|H|VIII|none}} In the &quot;Author's Afterword&quot; to ''Mona Lisa Overdrive'', dated July 16, 1992, Gibson wrote the following:{{bquote|''Neuromancer'' was written on a &quot;clockwork typewriter,&quot; the very one you may recall glimpsing in Julie Deane's office in Chiba City. This machine, a Hermes 2000 manual portable, dates from somewhere in the 1930's. It's a very tough and elegant piece of work, from the factory of E. PAILLARD &amp; Cie S.A. YVERDON (SUISSE). Cased, it weighs slightly less than the [[Macintosh SE/30]] I now write on, and is finished in a curious green- and-black &quot;crackle&quot; paint-job, perhaps meant to suggest the covers of an accountant's ledger. Its keys are green as well, of celluloid, and the letters and symbols on them are canary yellow. (I once happened to brush the shift-key with the tip of a lit cigarette, dramatically confirming the extreme flammability of this early plastic.) In its day, the Hermes 2000 was one of the best portable writing-machines in the world, and one of the most expensive. This one belonged to my wife's step-grandfather, who had been a journalist of sorts and had used it to compose laudatory essays on the poetry of Robert Burns. I used it first to write undergraduate Eng. lit. papers, then my early attempts at short stories, then Neuromancer, all without so much as ever having touched an actual computer.
