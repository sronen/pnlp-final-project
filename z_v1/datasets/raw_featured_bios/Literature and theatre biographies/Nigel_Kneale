'''Nigel Kneale''' (18 April 1922&amp;nbsp;– 29 October 2006) was a British [[screenwriter]], active in [[television]], [[film]], [[radio drama]], and [[prose|prose fiction]]. He wrote professionally for more than 50 years, was a winner of the [[Somerset Maugham Award]], and was twice nominated for the [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|British Film Award]] for Best Screenplay. In 2000, he received the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Horror Writers Association.

Predominantly a writer of [[Thriller (genre)|thrillers]] that used [[science-fiction]] and [[Horror fiction|horror]] elements, he was best known for the creation of the character [[Bernard Quatermass|Professor Bernard Quatermass]]. Quatermass was a heroic scientist who appeared in various television, film and radio productions written by Kneale for the [[BBC]], [[Hammer Film Productions]] and [[Thames Television]] between 1953 and 1996. Kneale wrote original scripts and successfully adapted works by writers such as [[George Orwell]], [[John Osborne]], [[H. G. Wells]] and [[Susan Hill]].

He was most active in television, joining [[BBC Television]] in 1951 as one of its first staff writers; his final script was transmitted on [[ITV]] in 1997. Kneale wrote well-received television dramas such as ''[[The Year of the Sex Olympics]]'' (1968) and ''[[The Stone Tape]]'' (1972) in addition to the ''Quatermass'' serials. He has been described as &quot;one of the most influential writers of the 20th century,&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;hammer&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hammerfilms.com/features/tributes/nigel_kneale.html|title=A Tribute to Nigel Kneale|first=Robert|last=Simpson|publisher=[[Hammer Film Productions]]|accessdate=10 February 2007|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071017215654/http://www.hammerfilms.com/features/tributes/nigel_kneale.html |archivedate = 17 October 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as &quot;having invented popular TV.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;gatiss1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/features/story/0,,1937220,00.html|title=The man who saw tomorrow|first=Mark|last=Gatiss|authorlink=Mark Gatiss|publisher=The Guardian|date=2 November 2006|accessdate=10 February 2007 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 March 1946 Kneale made his first broadcast on [[BBC Radio]], performing a [[Live radio|live]] reading of his own [[short story]] &quot;Tomato Cain&quot; in a strand entitled ''Stories by Northern Authors'' on the [[BBC]]'s [[Northern England|North of England]] [[BBC Home Service|Home Service]] region.&lt;ref name=&quot;pixley2&quot;&gt;Pixley, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year he left the Isle of Man and moved to London, where he began studying acting at the [[Royal Academy of Dramatic Art]] (RADA).&lt;ref name=&quot;screenonline&quot;/&gt; He made further radio broadcasts in the 1940s, including a reading of his story ''Zachary Crebbin's Angel'' on the [[BBC Light Programme]], broadcast nationally on 19 May 1948.&lt;ref name=&quot;times1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Broadcasting—The Light Programme|publisher=The Times|date=19 May 1948|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also had further short stories published in magazines such as ''[[Argosy (UK Magazine)|Argosy]]'' and ''[[Strand Magazine|The Strand]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;indyobit&quot;/&gt; He began using the name &quot;Nigel Kneale&quot; for these professional credits, but continued to be known as &quot;Tom&quot; to his family and friends up until his death.&lt;ref name=&quot;indy2&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.independent.co.uk/media/article1945772.ece|title=Nigel Kneale, creator of cult TV figure Quatermass, dies aged 84|first=Louise|last=Jury|publisher=[[The Independent]]|date=1 November 2006|accessdate=8 February 2007|page=12 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduating from RADA, Kneale worked for a short time as a professional actor performing in small roles at the Stratford Memorial Theatre in [[Stratford-upon-Avon]].&lt;ref name=&quot;telegraphobit&quot;/&gt; He continued to write in his spare time and in 1949 a collection of his work, entitled ''Tomato Cain and Other Stories'', was published.&lt;ref name=&quot;indyobit&quot;/&gt; The book sufficiently impressed the writer [[Elizabeth Bowen]] that she wrote a [[foreword]] for it,&lt;ref name=&quot;indyobit&quot;/&gt; and in 1950 the collection won the [[Somerset Maugham Award]].&lt;ref name=&quot;guardianobit&quot;/&gt; (His son, [[Matthew Kneale]], would later win the same award in 1988 for his novel ''Whore Banquets''.&lt;ref name=&quot;sonmaugham&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Between the lines|publisher=[[The Sunday Times]]|date=5 June 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

Following this success, Kneale gave up acting to write full-time.&lt;ref name=&quot;screenonline&quot;/&gt; He did take small [[voice-over]] roles in some of his 1950s [[television]] productions, such as the voice heard on the factory [[loudspeaker]] system in ''[[Quatermass II]]'' (1955), for which he also [[Narrator|narrated]] most of the [[recap]]s shown at the beginning of each episode.&lt;ref name=&quot;pixley23&quot;&gt;Pixley, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Kneale's publisher was keen for him to write a novel,&lt;ref name=&quot;timesobit&quot;/&gt; but Kneale himself was more interested in writing for television.&lt;ref name=&quot;timesobit&quot;/&gt; A keen cinema-goer, he believed that the audience being able to see human faces was an important factor in storytelling.&lt;ref name=&quot;murray26&quot;&gt;Murray, ''Into the Unknown'', p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

His first professional [[Playwright|script writing]] credit came when he wrote the [[radio drama]] ''The Long Stairs'', broadcast by the BBC on 1 March 1950 and based on a historical [[mining]] disaster on the Isle of Man.&lt;ref name=&quot;screenonline&quot;/&gt; In 1951 he was recruited as one of the first staff writers to be employed by [[BBC Television]];&lt;ref name=&quot;jacobs111&quot;&gt;Jacobs, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; before he started working for the BBC, Kneale had never seen any television.&lt;ref name=&quot;offthetelly&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.offthetelly.co.uk/interviews/nigelkneale.htm|title=The Magic Word Here is Paradox|first=Jack|last=Kibble-White|publisher=offthetelly.co.uk|month=November | year=2003|accessdate=8 February 2007|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070929084048/http://www.offthetelly.co.uk/interviews/nigelkneale.htm |archivedate = 29 September 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kneale was initially a general-purpose writer, working on adaptations of books and stage plays and even writing material for [[light entertainment]] and [[children's television series|children's programmes]]. The following year, [[Michael Barry (television producer)|Michael Barry]] became the Head of Drama at BBC Television, and spent his entire first year's script budget of £250 to hire Kneale as a full-time writer for the drama department.&lt;ref name=&quot;pixley2&quot;/&gt; Kneale's first credited role in adult television drama was providing &quot;additional dialogue&quot; for the play ''[[Arrow to the Heart]]'', broadcast on 20 July 1952.&lt;ref name=&quot;credits&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/458926/credits.html|title=Kneale, Nigel (1922–2006)—Film &amp; TV credits|publisher=[[Screenonline]]|accessdate=8 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; This play was adapted and directed by the Austrian [[television director]] [[Rudolph Cartier]], who had also joined the staff of the BBC drama department in 1952.&lt;ref name=&quot;jacobs134&quot;&gt;Jacobs, p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; It was the beginning of a successful working relationship between the pair, that would lead to some of Kneale's best known work.

==BBC staff screenwriter==
Neither Kneale nor Cartier were impressed with the state in which they found BBC television drama. At his initial job interview with Michael Barry, Cartier had criticised the department's output as being too sedate and theatrical,&lt;ref name=&quot;cartier1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/1181098/index.html|title=Cartier, Rudolph (1904–1994)|first=Oliver|last=Wake|publisher=[[Screenonline]]|accessdate=8 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Kneale was frustrated at what he saw as the slow and boring styles of television drama production then employed, which he felt wasted the potential of the medium.&lt;ref name=&quot;jacobs135&quot;&gt;Jacobs, p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt; Together they would help to revolutionise British television drama and establish it as an entity separate from its theatre and radio equivalents; the television historian Lez Cooke wrote in 2003 that &quot;Between them, Kneale and Cartier were responsible for introducing a completely new dimension to television drama in the early to mid-1950s.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;cooke20&quot;&gt;Cooke, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Jason Jacobs, a lecturer in [[Film studies|film]] and [[television studies]] at the [[University of Warwick]], wrote in his 2000 history of early British television drama that &quot;It was the arrival of Nigel Kneale&amp;nbsp;... and Rudolph Cartier&amp;nbsp;... that challenged the intimate drama directly&amp;nbsp;... Kneale and Cartier shared a common desire to invigorate television with a faster tempo and a broader thematic and spatial canvas, and it was no coincidence that they turned to science-fiction in order to get out of the dominant stylistic trend of television intimacy.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;jacobs130134&quot;&gt;Jacobs, pp. 130–134&lt;/ref&gt;

The science-fiction production to which Jacobs referred was ''[[The Quatermass Experiment]]'', broadcast in six half-hour episodes in July and August 1953.&lt;ref name=&quot;pixley4344&quot;&gt;Pixley, pp. 43–44.&lt;/ref&gt; The serial told the story of Professor [[Bernard Quatermass]] of the British Experimental Rocket Group, and the consequences of his sending the first manned mission into space when a terrible fate befalls the crew and only one returns. ''The Quatermass Experiment'' was the first adult television science-fiction production,&lt;ref name=&quot;pixley3&quot;&gt;Pixley, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; held a large television audience gripped across its six weeks,&lt;ref name=&quot;timesobit&quot;/&gt; and has been described by the [[Museum of Broadcast Communications]] as dramatising &quot;a new range of gendered fears about Britain's postwar and post-colonial security.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;mobc&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/Q/htmlQ/quartermass/quartermass.htm|title=Quatermass|first=Robert|last=Dickinson|publisher=[[Museum of Broadcast Communications]]|accessdate=9 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kneale was inspired in choosing the character's unusual surname by the fact that many Manx surnames began with &quot;Qu&quot;;&lt;ref name=&quot;pixley6&quot;&gt;Pixley, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; the actual name itself was picked from a London [[telephone directory]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pixley6&quot;/&gt; The Professor's first name was chosen in honour of the [[astronomer]] [[Bernard Lovell]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pixley6&quot;/&gt;

The BBC recognised the success of the serial, particularly in the context of the impending arrival of [[commercial television]] to the UK. Controller of Programmes [[Cecil McGivern]] wrote in a memo that: &quot;Had competitive television been in existence then, we would have killed it every Saturday night while [''The Quatermass Experiment''] lasted. We are going to need ''many'' more 'Quatermass Experiment' programmes.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;mcgivern&quot;&gt;Quoted in Johnson, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Like all of Kneale's television work for the BBC in the 1950s, ''The Quatermass Experiment'' was transmitted [[live television|live]].&lt;ref name=&quot;screen1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/471469/index.html|title=Quatermass Experiment, The (1953)|first=Gavin|last=Collinson|publisher=[[Screenonline]]|accessdate=9 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only the first two episodes were [[Telerecording|telerecorded]] and survive in the BBC's archives.&lt;ref name=&quot;screen1&quot;/&gt;

Kneale and Cartier next collaborated on an adaptation of ''[[Wuthering Heights]]'' (broadcast 6 December 1953) and then on a version of [[George Orwell]]'s novel ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four (TV programme)|Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' (12 December 1954).&lt;ref name=&quot;pixley16&quot;&gt;Pixley, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' was a particularly notable production; many found it shocking, and questions were asked in [[British House of Commons|Parliament]] about whether some of the scenes had been suitable for television.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbcobit&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6105578.stm|title=Quatermass creator dies, aged 84|publisher=[[BBC News Online]]|date=1 November 2006|accessdate=9 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was also prominent support for the play; the [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Duke of Edinburgh]] made it known that he and [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|the Queen]] had watched and enjoyed the programme,&lt;ref name=&quot;screen2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/438460/index.html|title=Nineteen Eighty-Four (1954)|first=Mark|last=Dugoid|publisher=[[Screenonline]]|accessdate=9 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the second live performance on 16 December gained the largest television audience since her [[Coronation of the British monarch|coronation]] the previous year.&lt;ref name=&quot;screen2&quot;/&gt; ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper's obituary of Kneale in 2006 claimed that the adaptation had &quot;permanently revived Orwell's reputation,&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;guardianobit&quot;/&gt; while the [[British Film Institute]] included it in their list of the [[100 Greatest British Television Programmes]] of the 20th century in 2000.&lt;ref name=&quot;tv100&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/features/tv/100/list/prog.php?id=73|title=73: Nineteen Eighty-Four|first=Mark|last=Dugoid|publisher=[[British Film Institute]]|year=2000|accessdate=9 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Creature''—an original script by Kneale concerning the legend of the [[abominable snowman]]—was his next collaboration with Cartier, broadcast on 30 January 1955,&lt;ref name=&quot;pixley16&quot;/&gt; followed by an adaptation of [[Peter Ustinov]]'s play ''The Moment of Truth'' (10 March 1955),&lt;ref name=&quot;pixley16&quot;/&gt; before Kneale was commissioned to write ''[[Quatermass II]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;screen3&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/441212/index.html|title=Quatermass II (1955)|first=Mark|last=Dugoid|publisher=[[Screenonline]]|accessdate=9 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically designed by the BBC to combat the threat of the new [[ITV]] network,&lt;ref name=&quot;mobc&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pixley16&quot;/&gt; which launched just a month before ''Quatermass II'' was shown,&lt;ref name=&quot;onthisday&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/september/22/newsid_3131000/3131477.stm|title=1955: New TV channel ends BBC monopoly|publisher=[[BBC News Online]]|accessdate=4 February 2007 | date=22 September 1955}}&lt;/ref&gt; the serial was even more successful than the first, drawing audiences of up to nine million viewers.&lt;ref name=&quot;pixley45&quot;&gt;Pixley, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; Kneale was inspired in writing the serial by contemporary fears over secret [[UK Ministry of Defence]] research establishments such as [[Porton Down]], as well the fact that as a BBC staff writer he had been required to sign the [[Official Secrets Act]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pixley16&quot;/&gt;

Almost simultaneously with the transmission of ''Quatermass II'' in the autumn of 1955, [[Hammer Film Productions]] released ''[[The Quatermass Xperiment]]'', their film adaptation of the first serial.&lt;ref name=&quot;pixley21&quot;&gt;Pixley, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Kneale was not pleased with the film,&lt;ref name=&quot;screenonline&quot;/&gt; and particularly disliked the casting of [[Brian Donlevy]] as Quatermass, as he explained in a 1986 interview. &quot;[Donlevy] was then really on the skids and didn't care what he was doing. He took very little interest in the making of the films or in playing the part. It was a case of take the money and run. Or in the case of Mr Donlevy, waddle.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;door&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/TelevisionCity/8504/kneal.htm|title=Nigel Kneale—Behind the Dark Door|publisher=The Quatermass Home Page|first=Andrew|last=Pixley|coauthors=Nigel Kneale|year=1986|accessdate=9 February 2007|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20050817034159/http://www.geocities.com/TelevisionCity/8504/kneal.htm|archivedate=17 August 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Quatermass II'' was Kneale's final original script for the BBC as a staff writer.&lt;ref name=&quot;credits&quot;/&gt; He left the corporation when his contract expired at the end of 1956;&lt;ref name=&quot;pixley27&quot;&gt;Pixley, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Five years in that hut was as much as any sane person could stand,&quot; he later told an interviewer.&lt;ref name=&quot;hearn7&quot;&gt;Hearn &amp; Rigby, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; But he continued to write for the BBC on a [[freelance]] basis.

==Freelance film and television work==
The same year that he left the BBC, Kneale wrote his first feature film [[screenplay]], adapting ''[[Quatermass II]]'' for Hammer Film Productions along with [[film producer|producer]] [[Anthony Hinds]] and [[film director|director]] [[Val Guest]].&lt;ref name=&quot;hearn7&quot;/&gt; Hinds and Guest had overseen the first ''Quatermass'' film, upon which Kneale had been unable to work due to his BBC staff contract.&lt;ref name=&quot;hearn7&quot;/&gt; Kneale was disappointed that Brian Donlevy also returned in the role of Quatermass.&lt;ref name=&quot;hearn7&quot;/&gt; The film premiered at the end of May 1957,&lt;ref name=&quot;hearn14&quot;&gt;Hearn &amp; Rigby, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; and was reviewed positively in ''[[The Times]]'': &quot;The writer of the original story, Mr. Nigel Kneale, and the director, Mr. Val Guest, between them keep things moving at the right speed, without digressions. The film has an air of respect for the issues touched on, and this impression is confirmed by the acting generally.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;quat2&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=London Pavilion—Quatermass II|publisher=The Times|date=27 May 1957|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1957 also saw the release of another cinematic collaboration between Kneale and Guest, when Kneale adapted his 1955 BBC play ''The Creature'' into ''[[The Abominable Snowman (film)|The Abominable Snowman]]'';&lt;ref name=&quot;snowman&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0050095/|title=The Abominable Snowman (1957)|publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]]|accessdate=9 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; in this case, Hammer retained the star of the BBC version, [[Peter Cushing]].&lt;ref name=&quot;door&quot;/&gt;

In May 1957, Kneale was contracted by the BBC to write a third ''Quatermass'' serial,&lt;ref name=&quot;pixley27&quot;/&gt; and this was eventually transmitted as ''[[Quatermass and the Pit]]'' across six weeks in December 1958 and January 1959.&lt;ref name=&quot;pixley47&quot;&gt;Pixley, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; On this occasion Kneale was inspired by the racial tensions that had recently been seen in the United Kingdom, and which came to a head while the serial was in [[pre-production]] when the [[Notting Hill race riots]] occurred in August and September 1958.&lt;ref name=&quot;tapes&quot;&gt;Kneale, Nigel in {{cite episode|title=The Kneale Tapes|series=Timsehift|credits=Producer&amp;nbsp;– Tom Ware; Executive Producer&amp;nbsp;– Michael Poole|network=[[BBC Four]]|airdate=2003-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drawing audiences of up to 11 million,&lt;ref name=&quot;pixley47&quot;/&gt; ''Quatermass and the Pit'' has been referred to by the [[bbc.co.uk|BBC's own website]] as &quot;simply the first finest thing the BBC ever made.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;bbcdvd&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/news/cult/2005/03/31/18177.shtml|title=Quatermass DVD|publisher=[[bbc.co.uk]]|date=31 March 2005|accessdate=29 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also included in the British Film Institute's &quot;TV 100&quot; list in 2000, where it was praised for the themes and subtexts it explored. &quot;In a story which mined mythology and folklore&amp;nbsp;... under the guise of genre it tackled serious themes of man's hostile nature and the military's perversion of science for its own ends.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;bfi100&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/features/tv/100/list/prog.php?id=75|title=75: Quatermass and the Pit|first=Mark|last=Dugoid|publisher=[[British Film Institute]]|year=2000|accessdate=29 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the success of the serial, Kneale felt that he had now taken the character of Quatermass as far as he could. &quot;I didn't want to go on repeating because Professor Quatermass had already saved the world from ultimate destruction three times, and that seemed to me to be quite enough,&quot; he said in 1986.&lt;ref name=&quot;door&quot;/&gt; It was also his final new collaboration with Rudolph Cartier, although the director did later handle a new version of Kneale's 1953 adaptation of ''Wuthering Heights'' for the BBC in 1962.&lt;ref name=&quot;wuthering&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/1203222/index.html|title=Wuthering Heights (1962)|first=Oliver|last=Wake|publisher=[[Screenonline]]|accessdate=9 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958, Kneale's play ''Mrs Wickens in the Fall'', transmitted by the BBC the previous year, was remade by the [[CBS]] network in the United States, retitled ''The Littlest Enemy''.&lt;ref name = &quot;murray6566&quot;/&gt; Broadcast on 18 June as part of ''[[The United States Steel Hour]]'' anthology series, the script was severely cut back in length.&lt;ref name = &quot;murray6566&quot;/&gt; It was Kneale's only involvement with American television, and he was not pleased with the result. &quot;I made up my mind I would never ever again have anything done on a television network in America,&quot; he later commented.&lt;ref name=&quot;murray6566&quot;&gt;Murray, ''Into the Unknown'', pp. 65–66.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the next few years, Kneale concentrated mostly on film screenplays, adapting plays and novels for the cinema. Described by ''[[The Independent]]'' as &quot;one of the few writers not to fall out with [[John Osborne]],&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;indyobit&quot;/&gt; Kneale adapted Osborne's plays ''[[Look Back in Anger]]'' and ''[[The Entertainer (film)|The Entertainer]]'' in 1958 and 1960 respectively, both for director [[Tony Richardson]].&lt;ref name=&quot;screenonline&quot;/&gt; Kneale knew Richardson through having previously adapted a [[Anton Chekhov|Chekhov]] short story for the BBC, which Richardson had directed.&lt;ref name=&quot;murray62&quot;&gt;Murray, ''Into the Unknown'', p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; Kneale was nominated for the [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|British Film Award]] (later known as a BAFTA) for Best Screenplay for both films.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbcobit&quot;/&gt; [[Film producer]] [[Harry Saltzman]], who had produced the two Osborne adaptations, approached Kneale about scripting a project he was working on to adapt [[Ian Fleming]]'s [[James Bond]] novels for the cinema; Kneale was not a fan of Fleming's work and turned the offer down.&lt;ref name=&quot;murray76&quot;&gt;Murray, ''Into the Unknown'', p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; Further adaptations Kneale did work on were ''[[H.M.S. Defiant]]'' (1962, from the novel ''Mutiny'' by [[Frank Tilsley]])&lt;ref name=&quot;defiant&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0055884/|title=H.M.S. Defiant (1962)|publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]]|accessdate=9 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[First Men in the Moon (1964 film)|First Men in the Moon]]'' (1964, from [[The First Men in the Moon|the novel]] by [[H. G. Wells]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;moonmen&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058100/|title=First Men in the Moon (1964)|publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]]|accessdate=9 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Less successfully during this period, Kneale completed screenplays for adaptations of the novels ''[[Lord of the Flies]]'' by [[William Golding]] and ''[[Brave New World]]'' by [[Aldous Huxley]].&lt;ref name=&quot;offthetelly&quot;/&gt; Neither of these scripts ever saw production, as the companies making them went out of business—Kneale commented in a 2003 interview that &quot;I reckon I closed down at least two film companies.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;offthetelly&quot;/&gt; Another screenplay that went unproduced was a Kneale original, a drama involving a wave of [[teenage suicide]]s called ''The Big Giggle'',&lt;ref name=&quot;offthetelly&quot;/&gt; or ''The Big, Big Giggle''.&lt;ref name=&quot;door&quot;/&gt; Written in 1965 while Kneale was suffering from a mystery illness and forced to stay in bed for a long period, the concept started life as a drama serial for the BBC, before the corporation had second thoughts about the nature of the storyline and the possibility of [[copycat suicide]]s;&lt;ref name=&quot;offthetelly&quot;/&gt; Kneale later agreed that they were probably right not to make it for television.&lt;ref name=&quot;door&quot;/&gt; The production was nearly made as a film by [[20th Century Fox]], but [[John Trevelyan (censor)|John Trevelyan]], Chief Executive of the [[British Board of Film Classification|British Board of Film Censors]], forbade the script's production.&lt;ref name=&quot;offthetelly&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;door&quot;/&gt;

In 1966 Kneale worked again for Hammer Film Productions when he adapted [[Norah Lofts]]'s 1960 novel ''The Devil's Own'' into the [[horror film]] ''[[The Witches (1966 film)|The Witches]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;witches&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/1063814/index.html|title=Witches, The (1966)|first=Paul|last=Moody|publisher=[[Screenonline]]|accessdate=9 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kneale had first worked on the screenplay for the adaptation in 1961,&lt;ref name=&quot;witches&quot;/&gt; the same year in which he had begun to adapt ''Quatermass and the Pit'' for Hammer.&lt;ref name=&quot;pixley3839&quot;&gt;Pixley, pp. 38–39.&lt;/ref&gt; Like ''The Witches'', the [[Quatermass and the Pit (film)|film version of ''Quatermass and the Pit'']] took several years to reach the screen, eventually being released in 1967.&lt;ref name=&quot;thepit&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062168/|title=Quatermass and the Pit (1967)|publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]]|accessdate=9 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roy Ward Baker]] directed, with [[Andrew Keir]] starring as Quatermass.&lt;ref name=&quot;thepit&quot;/&gt; Kneale was much happier with this version than the previous Hammer Quatermass adaptations,&lt;ref name=&quot;pixley39&quot;&gt;Pixley, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; and the film was described by ''The Independent'' in 2006 as &quot;one of the best ever Hammer productions.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;indyobit&quot;/&gt; ''Quatermass and the Pit'' was Kneale's final credited film work; 1979's ''[[Quatermass (TV serial)|The Quatermass Conclusion]]'' was only released to cinemas in overseas markets after having been made for television in the UK,&lt;ref name=&quot;quat4&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/442672/index.html|title=Quatermass (1979)|first=Mark|last=Dugoid|publisher=[[Screenonline]]|accessdate=9 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he had his name removed from the credits of ''[[Halloween III: Season of the Witch]]'' (1982).&lt;ref name=&quot;screenonline&quot;/&gt;

Kneale had returned to writing for television with the BBC for the first time since ''Quatermass and the Pit'' when his play ''The Road'' was broadcast in September 1963.&lt;ref name=&quot;screenonline&quot;/&gt; The play concerned the population of an 18th-century village who become haunted by visions of a future [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]],&lt;ref name=&quot;timesobit&quot;/&gt; and was followed by several further one-off dramas for the BBC over the following decade, including two entries into [[BBC One|BBC1]]'s ''[[The Wednesday Play]]'' anthology strand.&lt;ref name=&quot;credits&quot;/&gt; During this period he was regarded as one of the finest writers working for the BBC.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sutton&quot;&gt;Sutton, p. 20 and p. 54. Sutton was the Head of Drama at the BBC during this period, and twice lists Kneale while citing examples of the finest single plays made during his tenure.&lt;/ref&gt; Kneale did his first work for the [[ITV]] network during this time, writing one-off play ''The Crunch'' for the ATV company in 1964.&lt;ref name=&quot;murray82&quot;&gt;Murray, ''Into the Unknown'', p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt;

A particular critical success was ''[[The Year of the Sex Olympics]]'', broadcast as part of [[BBC Two|BBC2]]'s ''[[Theatre 625]]'' series in July 1968.&lt;ref name=&quot;olympics&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/560006/index.html|title=The Year of the Sex Olympics|first=Gavin|last=Collinson|publisher=[[Screenonline]]|accessdate=9 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kneale's first television work to be made in colour—although only a [[black-and-white]] copy now survives—the story was based in a future where the majority of the population are kept in a docile state by constant broadcasts of [[pornography]] and other low-brow [[reality television]] programming. ''The Live Life Show'', in which a family are watched twenty-four hours a day as they struggle to live on an isolated [[rural]] island, becomes a massive success, especially when a murderer is introduced into the set-up.

''The Year of the Sex Olympics'' has been praised for its foreshadowing of the rise of reality television programmes such as ''[[Big Brother (TV series)|Big Brother]]'' (1999–present) and ''[[Celebrity Love Island]]'' (2005–2006).&lt;ref name=&quot;olympics&quot;/&gt; The critic [[Nancy Banks-Smith]] wrote in 2003 that: &quot;In ''The Year of the Sex Olympics'' [Kneale] foretold the reality show and, in the scramble for greater sensation, its logical outcome&amp;nbsp;... This is satire from a TV insider, but it mutates into something far more desolate and disorientating.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;olympics2&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/features/story/0,11710,942190,00.html|title=Big Brother with knives|first=Nancy|last=Banks-Smith|authorlink=Nancy Banks-Smith|publisher=The Guardian|date=28 April 2003|accessdate=9 February 2007 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The island locations scenes for the production were filmed on the Isle of Man, Kneale's homeland.&lt;ref name=&quot;olympics2&quot;/&gt;

In 1965 Kneale had been approached by the producer of the BBC2 science-fiction anthology series ''[[Out of the Unknown]]'' to write a new one-off 75-minute ''Quatermass'' story for the programme.&lt;ref name=&quot;pixley39&quot;/&gt; Nothing came of this, but seven years later he was commissioned by the BBC to write a new four-part ''Quatermass'' serial, based in a [[dystopia]]n near future world overrun with crime, apathy, [[martial law]] and youth [[cult]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;pixley39&quot;/&gt; The serial was announced as a forthcoming production by the BBC in November 1972,&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc4&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Quatermass and Quixote in BBC drama plans|first=Chris|last=Dunkley|publisher=The Times|date=15 November 1972|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some model filming was even begun in June 1973,&lt;ref name=&quot;pixley39&quot;/&gt; but eventually budgetary problems and the unavailability of [[Stonehenge]]—a central location in the scripts—led to the project's cancellation.&lt;ref name=&quot;pixley39&quot;/&gt; &quot;It lingered through the summer and slowly died as a project,&quot; he later commented.&lt;ref name=&quot;door&quot;/&gt;

Kneale's next script for the BBC was ''[[The Stone Tape]]'', a scientific [[ghost story]] broadcast on Christmas Day 1972.&lt;ref name=&quot;stonetape&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/898626/index.html|title=Stone Tape, The (1972)|first=Sergio|last=Angelini|publisher=[[Screenonline]]|accessdate=9 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lez Cooke praised the production, when writing in 2003, describing it as &quot;one of the most imaginative and intelligent examples of the horror genre to appear on British television, a single play to rank alongside the best of ''[[Play for Today]]''.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;cooke26&quot;&gt;Cooke, p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt; His final BBC work was an entry into a series called ''Bedtime Stories'', adapting traditional [[fairy tale]]s into adult dramas. Kneale's script, ''Jack and the Beanstalk'', was transmitted on 24 March 1974, and marked the end of his BBC writing career.&lt;ref name=&quot;murray121122&quot;&gt;Murray, ''Into the Unknown'', pp. 121–122.&lt;/ref&gt;

==ITV and Hollywood==
[[File:Knealedvds.JPG|thumb|A selection of Kneale's material available on [[DVD]]]]
Kneale's remaining television work was written for ITV.&lt;ref name=&quot;screenonline&quot;/&gt; His first script for ITV was the one-off play ''[[Murrain]]'', made by the network's [[English Midlands|Midlands]] franchise holders [[Associated TeleVision]] (ATV) in 1975.&lt;ref name=&quot;beasts&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/1232046/index.html|title=Beasts (1976)|first=Mark|last=Dugoid|publisher=[[Screenonline]]|accessdate=9 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The play, a horror piece based around [[witchcraft]], led the following year to a series called ''[[Beasts (TV series)|Beasts]]'', a six-part anthology where Kneale created six different character-based tales of horror and the macabre.&lt;ref name=&quot;beasts&quot;/&gt; It featured some well-known actors such as [[Martin Shaw]], [[Pauline Quirke]] and [[Bernard Horsfall]], but did not gain a full network run on ITV; different regions transmitted the episodes in different timeslots and some in different sequences.&lt;ref name=&quot;beasts1213&quot;&gt;Murray, ''Beasts—Programme Notes'', pp. 12–13.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-1970s, Kneale made his only attempt at writing a stage play. Called ''Crow'', it was based upon the memoirs of real-life Manx [[slave trade|slaver]] Captain Hugh Crow.&lt;ref name=&quot;offthetelly&quot;/&gt; Kneale was unable to find backing to produce the play for the stage, but sold the script to ATV who put it into pre-production for television.&lt;ref name=&quot;offthetelly&quot;/&gt; However, shortly before filming it was cancelled by order of ATV's managing director, [[Lew Grade]]—Kneale was never told why.&lt;ref name=&quot;offthetelly&quot;/&gt;

Following the cancellation of ''Crow'', Kneale moved to work for another of the ITV companies, [[Thames Television]], who in 1977 commissioned the production of the scripts of Kneale's previously abandoned fourth ''Quatermass'' serial, to be produced by their [[Euston Films]] subsidiary film company.&lt;ref name=&quot;pixley39&quot;/&gt; The production was structured to work both as a four-episode serial for transmission in the UK, and a 100-minute film version for cinema release overseas—something Kneale later regretted agreeing to.&lt;ref name=&quot;door&quot;/&gt; Starring [[John Mills]] as Quatermass and with a budget of over £1 million&lt;ref name=&quot;pixley39&quot;/&gt;—more than fifty times the budget of ''Quatermass and the Pit'' in 1958&lt;ref name=&quot;pixley36&quot;&gt;Pixley, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;—the serial was not as critically successful as its predecessors. &quot;Thematically no less awesome than Mr Kneale's earlier science-fiction essays for BBC Television, his ITV debut has proved only a so-so affair,&quot; was the verdict of ''The Times'' when previewing the final episode.&lt;ref name=&quot;quat4times&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Personal Choice|publisher=The Times|date=14 November 1979|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tying in with the series, Kneale returned to prose fiction when he wrote his only full-length novel, ''Quatermass'', a [[novelisation]] of the serial.&lt;ref name=&quot;door&quot;/&gt;

Kneale's next television series was a departure from his usual style—''[[Kinvig]]'', his sole attempt at writing a [[sitcom]], produced by [[London Weekend Television]] and broadcast on ITV in the autumn of 1981.&lt;ref name=&quot;screenonline&quot;/&gt; Although his first out-and-out comedy, Kneale was keen to stress that there had always been elements of humour present throughout his scripts,&lt;ref name=&quot;door&quot;/&gt; and some of the press reaction to ''[[Kinvig]]'' was positive. &quot;If you like the idea of the ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy|Hitch-Hiker's Guide]]'' but found its realization tiresomely hysterical you may well prefer Kneale's relaxed wit. Cast splendid, direction deft,&quot; was ''The Times'''s preview of the first episode.&lt;ref name=&quot;kinvig&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Pick of the week's television|publisher=The Times|date=4 September 1981|page=XII}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the series was not a success, although Kneale later remained personally pleased with it.&lt;ref name=&quot;door&quot;/&gt;

In 1982, Kneale made another one-off diversion from his usual work when he wrote his only produced [[Hollywood]] movie script, ''[[Halloween III: Season of the Witch]]''. Kneale had initially been approached by the director [[John Landis]] to work on the screenplay for a [[remake]] of ''[[Creature from the Black Lagoon]]'',&lt;ref name=&quot;starburst&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|title=Nigel Kneale interview|journal=[[Starburst (magazine)|Starburst]]|volume=4|issue=11|month=July | year=1983|pages=pp. 31–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he and his wife spent some time living at the [[Sheraton Hotel]] in Hollywood while Kneale worked on the project.&lt;ref name=&quot;starburst&quot;/&gt; The ''Black Lagoon'' script never went into production, but while in America Kneale met the director [[Joe Dante]], who invited him to script the third film in the [[Halloween (franchise)|''Halloween'' series]], on which Dante was working.&lt;ref name=&quot;starburst&quot;/&gt; Kneale agreed, on the proviso that it would be a totally new concept unrelated to the first two films, which he had not seen and did not like what he had heard of.&lt;ref name=&quot;starburst&quot;/&gt;

Kneale's [[Film treatment|treatment]] for the film met with the approval of [[John Carpenter]], the producer of the ''Halloween'' series, although Kneale was required to write the script in only six weeks.&lt;ref name=&quot;starburst&quot;/&gt; Kneale got on well with the director assigned to the film, [[Tommy Lee Wallace]],&lt;ref name=&quot;starburst&quot;/&gt; but when one of the film's backers, [[Dino De Laurentiis]], insisted upon the inclusion of more graphic violence and a rewrite of the script from Wallace, Kneale became displeased with the results and had his name removed from the film.&lt;ref name=&quot;starburst&quot;/&gt;

He returned to writing scripts for British television, including ''Gentry'' with [[Roger Daltrey]] for ITV in 1987, and the 1989 adaptation of [[Susan Hill]]'s novel ''[[The Woman in Black]]'' for transmission on ITV on Christmas Eve.&lt;ref name=&quot;black&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/1156541/index.html|title=Woman in Black, The (1989)|first=Sergio|last=Angelini|publisher=[[Screenonline]]|accessdate=9 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lynne Truss]], reviewing a [[Rerun|repeat]] broadcast of the production on [[Channel 4]] for ''The Times'' in 1994, wrote that: &quot;Clip-clop is not usually a noise to get upset about. But it will be an interesting test, today, to go up behind people and whisper 'clip-clop', to find out whether they saw ''The Woman in Black'' last night. People who made the bold decision to watch this excellent drama will respond to any 'clip-clop' by gratifyingly leaping in the air and grabbing the backs of their necks.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;truss&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=In the midst of excess, a short, sharp shock|first=Lynne|last=Truss|authorlink=Lynne Truss|publisher=The Times|date=26 December 1994|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The adaptation nearly went unmade; Kneale had written the script in ten days but been advised by his agent to wait before submitting it to the producers [[Central Independent Television]] so that they would not think he had rushed it.&lt;ref name=&quot;giant&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6107564.stm|title=Quatermass creator was 'TV giant'|first=Mark|last=Gatiss|authorlink=Mark Gatiss|publisher=[[BBC News Online]]|date=1 November 2006|accessdate=9 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he did submit the script three weeks later, he discovered that Central had been about to cancel the production as they had assumed that Kneale, then 67, had not been able to complete the work due to his age.&lt;ref name=&quot;giant&quot;/&gt;

Susan Hill herself did not like some of the changes that Kneale had made to ''The Woman in Black''.&lt;ref name=&quot;black&quot;/&gt; It has been observed that Kneale on some occasions operated a double-standard with adaptations; being unhappy when others made changes to his stories, but willing to make changes to stories he was adapting into script form. Referring to ''The Woman in Black'' adaptation, the writer and critic [[Kim Newman]] noted that: &quot;He was very offended at the notion of Susan Hill using the name of Kipps from HG Wells as the hero of ''The Woman in Black'', and so he decided not to use it and to change the hero's name to Kidd. I'm sure if somebody thought that Quatermass was a silly name and changed it, he'd be furious!&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;murray169&quot;&gt;Murray, ''Into the Unknown'', p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt; However, an adaptation he wrote in 1991, a four-part version of [[Kingsley Amis]]'s novel ''Stanley and the Women'', met with approval from the original author, with Amis regarding it as the most successful adaptation of any of his work.&lt;ref name=&quot;murray172&quot;&gt;Murray, ''Into the Unknown'', p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kneale also adapted ''[[Sharpe's Gold (TV programme)|Sharpe's Gold]]'' for ITV in 1995, as part of their series of adaptations of [[Bernard Cornwell]]'s ''[[Sharpe (TV series)|Sharpe]]'' novels.&lt;ref name=&quot;screenonline&quot;/&gt; This was an assignment that surprised his agent; &quot;We didn't think he'd want to bother with them but he did. That was probably because he liked the producer.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;guardianobit&quot;/&gt; He returned to writing for radio for the first time since the 1950s in 1996, when he wrote the drama-documentary ''[[The Quatermass Memoirs]]'' for [[BBC Radio 3]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pixley40&quot;&gt;Pixley, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; Partly composed of Kneale looking back at the events that led to the writing of the original three ''Quatermass'' serials and using some archive material, there was also a dramatised strand to the series, set just before the ITV ''Quatermass'' serial and featuring [[Andrew Keir]], star of the Hammer version of ''Quatermass and the Pit'', as the Professor.&lt;ref name=&quot;pixley40&quot;/&gt;

While recording an [[audio commentary]] for that film in 1997, Kneale speculated about a possible ''Quatermass'' prequel set in 1930s [[Germany]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pixley40&quot;/&gt; According to ''The Independent'', Kneale conceived a storyline involving the young Quatermass becoming involved in German rocketry experiments in the 1930s, and helping a young [[Jewish]] woman to escape the country during the [[1936 Summer Olympics|1936 Berlin Olympics]].&lt;ref name=&quot;indyobit&quot;/&gt;

Kneale was invited to write for the successful American science-fiction series ''[[The X-Files]]'' (1993–2002), but declined the offer.&lt;ref name=&quot;timesobit&quot;/&gt; His final professional work was an episode of the ITV legal drama ''[[Kavanagh QC]]'', starring [[John Thaw]].&lt;ref name=&quot;screenonline&quot;/&gt; Kneale's episode, &quot;Ancient History&quot;, was about a Jewish woman who during the Second World War had been subjected to horrific experiments in a [[concentration camp]].&lt;ref name=&quot;screenonline&quot;/&gt; Transmitted on 17 January 1997 and cited as one of the programme's finest episodes,&lt;ref name=&quot;kavanagh&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/1201633/index.html|title=Kavanagh Q.C. (1995–2001)|first=Sergio|last=Angelini|publisher=[[Screenonline]]|accessdate=10 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; it brought Kneale's writing career to a close after more than fifty years.

He continued to appear as an interview subject in various television documentaries,&lt;ref name=&quot;credits&quot;/&gt; and also recorded further audio commentaries for the release of some of his productions on [[DVD]]. In 2005, he acted as a consultant when the [[digital television]] channel [[BBC Four]] produced a live remake of ''The Quatermass Experiment''.&lt;ref name=&quot;remake&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2005/03_march/03/quatermass.shtml|title=BBC FOUR to produce a live broadcast of the sci-fi classic, The Quatermass Experiment|publisher=[[bbc.co.uk|BBC Press Office]]|date=3 March 2005|accessdate=10 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He lived in [[Barnes, London]], until his death on 29 October 2006 at the age of 84, following a series of small [[stroke]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;indy2&quot;/&gt;

==Legacy==
The writer and actor [[Mark Gatiss]], paying tribute to Kneale on the [[BBC News Online]] website shortly after his death, indicated that he was among the first rank of British television writers, but that this had been overlooked. &quot;He is amongst the greats—he is absolutely as important as [[Dennis Potter]], as [[David Mercer (playwright)|David Mercer]], as [[Alan Bleasdale]], as [[Alan Bennett]], but I think because of a strange snobbery about fantasy or sci-fi it's never quite been that way.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;giant&quot;/&gt; Similarly, his obituary in ''The Guardian'' commented that: &lt;blockquote&gt;Kneale was by no means the only author to have been largely wasted by television, and to have seen his status overtaken by [[soap opera]] hacks. But his place is secure, alongside Wells, [[Arthur C. Clarke]], [[John Wyndham]] and [[Brian Aldiss]], as one of the best, most exciting and most compassionate English science fiction writers of his century.&lt;ref name=&quot;guardianobit&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Writing about ''The Year of the Sex Olympics'' in 2003, Nancy Banks-Smith felt that Kneale was one of the few television writers whose work was particularly memorable. &lt;blockquote&gt;Once upon a time, [[Viscount Hailsham|Lord Hailsham]], proceeding to the chamber of the [[House of Lords|House]] in black stockings and full-bottomed wig as [[Lord Chancellor|Lord High Chancellor]], spotted a friend and cried lustily, &quot;Neil!&quot; They say a whole party of American tourists fell to their knees. At the name of Kneale, I feel, every knee should bow. How much TV do you remember from last night&amp;nbsp;... last year&amp;nbsp;... last century? Quite. Curiously, I can remember clearly the first time I saw ''The Year of the Sex Olympics'' by Nigel Kneale. It was 35 years ago.&lt;ref name=&quot;olympics2&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Kneale was admired by the film director [[John Carpenter]],&lt;ref name=&quot;timesobit&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bbcobit&quot;/&gt; who hired Kneale to write the screenplay ''Halloween III''. Carpenter also wrote the screenplay for his 1987 film ''[[Prince of Darkness (film)|Prince of Darkness]]'' under the [[pseudonym]] &quot;Martin Quatermass&quot; (a reference to Kneale's work).&lt;ref name=&quot;darkness&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093777/fullcredits|title=Prince of Darkness (1987)|publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]]|accessdate=10 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[horror fiction]] writer [[Stephen King]] has also cited Kneale as an influence,&lt;ref name=&quot;timesobit&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bbcobit&quot;/&gt; with Kim Newman suggesting in 2003 that King had &quot;more or less rewritten ''Quatermass and the Pit'' in ''[[The Tommyknockers]]''.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;tapes2&quot;&gt;[[Kim Newman|Newman, Kim]] in {{cite episode|title=The Kneale Tapes|series=Timsehift|credits=Producer&amp;nbsp;– Tom Ware; Executive Producer&amp;nbsp;– Michael Poole|network=[[BBC Four]]|airdate=2003-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other writers to have acclaimed Kneale as an influence on their work have included [[comic book|comics]] writer [[Grant Morrison]]&lt;ref name=&quot;murray182&quot;&gt;Murray, ''Into the Unknown'', p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt; and television [[screenwriter]] [[Russell T Davies]],&lt;ref name=&quot;beasts6&quot;&gt;Murray, ''Beasts—Programme Notes'', p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; who described the ''Beasts'' episode &quot;Baby&quot; as &quot;the most frightening thing I've ever seen&amp;nbsp;... Powerful stuff.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;beasts6&quot;/&gt; Film screenwriter and director [[Dan O'Bannon]] was also an admirer of Kneale's writing,&lt;ref name=&quot;murray182&quot;/&gt; and in 1993 wrote a potential remake of ''The Quatermass Experiment'',&lt;ref name=&quot;murray183&quot;&gt;Murray, ''Into the Unknown'', p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt; of which Kneale approved,&lt;ref name=&quot;murray184&quot;&gt;Murray, ''Into the Unknown'', p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt; but the film was never made.&lt;ref name=&quot;murray183&quot;/&gt;

High-profile entertainment industry figures have publicly expressed admiration for Kneale's work, including [[The Beatles]]' drummer [[Ringo Starr]],&lt;ref name=&quot;murray9899&quot;&gt;Murray, ''Into the Unknown'', pp. 98–99&lt;/ref&gt; members of the rock group [[Pink Floyd]]&lt;ref name=&quot;murray9899&quot;/&gt; and ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'' writer/performer [[Michael Palin]].&lt;ref name=&quot;murray9899&quot;/&gt;

Kneale never saw himself as a science-fiction writer,&lt;ref name=&quot;offthetelly&quot;/&gt; and was often critical of the genre. He particularly disliked the BBC series ''[[Doctor Who]]'' (1963–89; 1996; 2005–present), for which he had once turned down an offer to write.&lt;ref name=&quot;stageobit&quot;/&gt; &quot;It sounded a terrible idea and I still think it was,&quot; he commented in 1986. &quot;The fact that it's lasted a long time and has a steady audience doesn't mean much. So has ''[[Crossroads (soap opera)|Crossroads]]'' and that's a stinker&quot;. He also slammed ''[[Blake's 7]]'', which he described as the lowest point of British television science-fiction: &quot;I think the low point for me would be the very few bits I've seen of a thing called ''[[Blake's 7]]'' which I found paralytically awful. The dialogue/characterisation seemed to consist of a kind of childish squabbling&quot; and ''[[Doomwatch]]'': &quot;I was approached to write ''Doomwatch''. That didn't seem to be much good either.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;door&quot;/&gt; ''Doctor Who'' was heavily influenced by Kneale's ''Quatermass'' serials,&lt;ref name=&quot;sixties&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Howe |first=David J. |authorlink=David J.

==Family==
In the early 1950s Kneale met fellow BBC screenwriter [[Judith Kerr]], a Jewish [[refugee]], in the BBC canteen.&lt;ref name=&quot;indy2&quot;/&gt; They married on 8 May 1954&lt;ref name=&quot;murray36&quot;&gt;Murray, ''Into the Unknown'', p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; and had two children; [[Matthew Kneale|Matthew]], who later became a successful novelist,&lt;ref name=&quot;bbcobit&quot;/&gt; and Tacy, an actress and later a special effects designer who worked on the popular ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series of films.&lt;ref name=&quot;guardianobit&quot;/&gt; Kerr became a successful children's writer, with the ''[[Mog (Judith Kerr)|Mog]]'' series of books&lt;ref name=&quot;bbcobit&quot;/&gt; and ''[[When Hitler Stole Pink Rabbit]]'', which was based on her own experiences of fleeing [[Nazi]] Germany in her youth.&lt;ref name=&quot;telegraphobit&quot;/&gt; Kneale worked with Kerr on an adaptation of ''When Hitler Stole Pink Rabbit'' in the 1970s, but the eventual makers of the film version disregarded their script.&lt;ref name=&quot;murray134&quot;&gt;Murray, ''Into the Unknown'', p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in 1995 Kneale scripted a four-part adaptation of one of Kerr's sequels to the book, ''A Small Person Far Away'', but this also went unproduced.&lt;ref name=&quot;murray176&quot;&gt;Murray, ''Into the Unknown'', p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kneale was proud of his son's success as a writer. When his novel ''[[English Passengers]]'' won the [[Costa Book Awards|Whitbread Book of the Year]] award in 2001, his father commented that: &quot;Matthew's much better than I am. I just wrote screenplays.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;whitbread&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Matthew Kneale|first=Giles|last=Coren|authorlink=Giles Coren|publisher=The Times|date=25 January 2001|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kneale's younger brother is the renowned [[artist]] and [[sculpture|sculptor]] [[Bryan Kneale]], who was Master and then Professor of Sculpture at the [[Royal Academy]] from 1982 to 1990.&lt;ref name=&quot;bryan1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rwa.org.uk/kneale.htm|title=Bryan Kneale|publisher=[[Royal West of England Academy]]|accessdate=10 February 2007|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20061229134835/http://www.rwa.org.uk/kneale.htm &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt;|archivedate=29 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bryan Kneale painted the covers for the ''Quatermass'' script books released by [[Penguin Books]] in 1959 and 1960.&lt;ref name=&quot;pixley38&quot;&gt;Pixley, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; He was also responsible for a painting of a [[lobster]] from which [[special effect]]s designers Bernard Wilkie and Jack Kine drew their inspiration for the [[Martian]] creatures they constructed for the original television version of ''Quatermass and the Pit''.&lt;ref name=&quot;demons&quot;&gt;{{cite video|people=Jack Kine and Bernard Wilkie|date=2005|title=Making Demons|format=Documentary using archive interview material.
