She came from [[Utopia, Northern Territory]] (''Unupurna'' in native language), a cattle station in the Sandover area of [[Central Australia]] {{convert|300|km}} northeast of [[Alice Springs]].

Minnie began painting in 2000 at about the age of 80, and her pictures soon became popular and sought-after works of [[contemporary Indigenous Australian art]]. In the years after she took up [[acrylic paint|painting on canvas]], until she died in 2006, Minnie's works were exhibited around Australia and collected by major galleries, including the [[Art Gallery of New South Wales]], the [[National Gallery of Victoria]] and the [[Queensland Art Gallery]]. With popularity came pressure from those keen to acquire her work. She was allegedly &quot;kidnapped&quot; by people who wanted her to paint for them, and there have been media reports of her work being forged. Minnie's work is often compared with that of her sister-in-law [[Emily Kame Kngwarreye]], who also came from the Sandover and took up acrylic painting late in life. Minnie's daughter, [[Barbara Weir]], is a respected artist in her own right.

==Personal life==
[[Image:Utopia location.jpg|thumb|300px|The location of Utopia station, north-east of Alice Springs]]
Minnie was born in the early 20th century near [[Utopia, Northern Territory]], {{convert|300|km}} north-east of [[Alice Springs, Northern Territory]].&lt;ref name=&quot;McCulloch139&quot;/&gt; Utopia was a [[cattle station]] that was returned to Indigenous ownership in the late 1970s.&lt;ref name=&quot;EAAUtopia&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=De Brabander|first=Dallas|title=[[Encyclopaedia of Aboriginal Australia]]|editor=David Horton|publisher=Aboriginal Studies Press for the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies|location=Canberra|year=1994|volume=2|pages=1122–1123|chapter=Utopia|isbn=978-0-85575-234-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is part of a broader region known as the Sandover, containing about 20&amp;nbsp;Indigenous [[outstation]]s and centred on the Sandover River.&lt;ref name=&quot;Green07&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Green|first=Jenny|title=One Sun One Moon: Aboriginal Art in Australia|editor=Hetti Perkins, Margaret West|publisher=Art Gallery of New South Wales|location=Sydney|year=2007|pages=203–209|chapter=Holding the country: Art from Utopia and the Sandover|isbn=9780734763600}}&lt;/ref&gt; Minnie was one of the traditional owners of Utopia station recognised in the 1980 Indigenous [[native title|land claim]] made over the property;&lt;ref name=&quot;Toohey&quot;/&gt; her particular country was known as Atnwengerrp.&lt;ref name=&quot;McCulloch139&quot;/&gt;

''Pwerle'' (in the [[Anmatyerre]] language) or ''Apwerle'' (in [[Alyawarr]]) is a [[Australian Aboriginal kinship|skin name]], one of 16 used to denote the subsections or subgroups in the [[kinship system]] of central Australian [[Indigenous Australians|Indigenous]] people. These names define kinship relationships that influence preferred marriage partners, and may be associated with particular totems. Although they may be used as terms of address, they are not surnames in the sense used by Europeans.&lt;ref name=&quot;CLC&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clc.org.au/People_Culture/kinship/kinship.html|title=Kinship and skin names|work=People and culture|publisher=Central Land Council|accessdate=23 October 2009|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.clc.org.au%2FPeople_Culture%2Fkinship%2Fkinship.html&amp;date=2010-10-11|archivedate=12 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;de Brabander&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=De Brabander|first=Dallas|title=[[Encyclopaedia of Aboriginal Australia]]|editor=David Horton|publisher=Aboriginal Studies Press for the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies|location=Canberra|year=1994|volume=2|page=977|chapter=Sections|isbn=978-0-85575-234-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus &quot;Minnie&quot; is the element of the artist's name that is specifically hers.

Minnie began painting in late 1999&lt;ref name=&quot;Fortescue6&quot;/&gt; or 2000,&lt;ref name=&quot;McCulloch139&quot;/&gt; when she was almost 80.

==Career==
In the 1970s and 1980s Utopia became well known for the design and production of [[batik]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Morphy&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Morphy|first=Howard|title=Aboriginal Art|publisher=Phaidon Press|location=London|year=1998|pages=261–316|chapter=The contemporary art of Central Australia|isbn=0714837520}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1981 there were 50&amp;nbsp;artists at Utopia creating batik works;&lt;ref name=&quot;Green&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Green|first=Jenny|title=Utopia: Women Country and Batik|publisher=Utopia Women's Batik Group|location=Utopia, Northern Territory|year=1981|isbn=0959240608}}&lt;/ref&gt; 88 artists participated in a major design project supported by the [[Central Australian Aboriginal Media Association]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EAAUtopia&quot;/&gt; Although several sources comment that artistic activity at Utopia began with batik and only later moved to painting, they do not state whether or not Minnie was a textile artist before she took up the brush. The National Gallery of Victoria's brief biography suggests that she did not participate in the making of batik, but she was aware of it.&lt;ref name=&quot;NGVMinnie&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ngv.vic.gov.au/ngvschools/TraditionAndTransformation/artists/Minnie-Motorcar-Apwerl/|title=Minnie Motorcar Apwerl|work=Tradition and Transformation: Indigenous art in the NGV collection|publisher=National Gallery of Victoria|accessdate=5 July 2010 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ngv.vic.gov.au%2Fngvschools%2FTraditionAndTransformation%2Fartists%2FMinnie-Motorcar-Apwerl%2F&amp;date=2010-11-10 |archivedate=10 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Minnie decided to take up painting in 2000, the reception was immediately positive: she had her first solo exhibition that same year at Melbourne's Flinders Lane Gallery.&lt;ref name=&quot;McCulloch139&quot;/&gt; She was first selected to exhibit in the [[National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Art Award]] in 2002.&lt;ref name=&quot;DacouBio&quot;/&gt; One of her pieces, ''Awelye Atnwengerrp'', was exhibited in the 2003 Award, in which her name was given as Minnie Motorcar Apwerl (Pwerle).

Minnie (like Emily) was often placed under considerable pressure to produce works.&lt;ref name=&quot;McCulloch139&quot;/&gt; She was reportedly &quot;kidnapped&quot; by people &quot;keen to go to often quite bizarre lengths to acquire&quot; her work.&lt;ref name=&quot;McCulloch139&quot;/&gt; Minnie's experience reflected broader issues in the industry surrounding artists, who were often older, had limited education or English language ability, and faced serious poverty both themselves and amongst their families.&lt;ref name=&quot;Senate&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last= Senate Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Committee|first=|title=Indigenous Art – Securing the Future: Australia’s Indigenous visual arts and craft sector|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/senate/committee/ecita_ctte/completed_inquiries/2004-07/indigenous_arts/report/index.htm|accessdate=14 July 2010|date=20 June 2007|publisher=Department of the Senate|location=Canberra|isbn=9780642717887|pages=100–103}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to being pressured to paint by others, there were media reports suggesting that some of the vast number of paintings traded under Minnie's name were not created by her at all.&lt;ref name=&quot;Marks&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/australasia/aboriginal-artists-are-conned-into-selling-works-worth-thousands-for-wine-and-viagra-453579.html|title=Aboriginal artists are conned into selling works worth thousands for wine and Viagra|last=Marks|first=Kathy|date=18 June 2007|work=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=2 July 2010 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5uAnRy096 |archivedate=11 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lacey|first=Stephen|title=High-tech battle against fakes|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=16 April 2007|accessdate=2 July 2010|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/arts/hightech-battle-against-fakes/2007/04/15/1176575681460.html |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5uAnkKQch |archivedate=11 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style of painting==
Minnie's style was spontaneous, and typified by &quot;bold&quot; and &quot;vibrant&quot; colour executed with great freedom.&lt;ref name=&quot;Birnberg331&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;McC&quot;/&gt; As with other contemporary artists of the central and western deserts, her paintings included depictions of stories or features for which she had responsibility within her family or clan, such as the Awelye Atnwengerrp [[Dreaming (spirituality)|dreaming]] (or ''Women's Dreaming''). Indigenous art expert Jenny Green believes Minnie's work continues the tradition of &quot;[[Action painting|gestural abstractionism]]&quot; established by Emily Kngwarreye, which contrasted with the use of recognisable traditional motifs—such as animal tracks—in the works of [[Western Desert cultural bloc|Western Desert]] artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Green|first=Jenny|editor=Hetti Perkins &amp; Margie West|title=One Sun One Moon: Aboriginal Art in Australia|year=2007|publisher=Art Gallery of New South Wales|location=Sydney|page=206|isbn=9780734763600|chapter=Holding the country: art from Utopia and the Sandover}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brisbane artist and gallerist [[Michael Eather]] has likened her work not only to that of Emily, but also to Australian [[abstract impressionism|abstract impressionist]] artist [[Tony Tuckson]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Late&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=McCulloch|first=Susan|year=2005|title=Late bloomer [Profile of artist Minnie Pwerle]|journal=Australian Art Collector|volume=32|issue=Apr–Jun 2005|pages=84–88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Minnie's paintings include two main design themes. The first is free-flowing and parallel lines in a pendulous outline, depicting the [[body painting]] designs used in women's ceremonies, or ''awelye''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Birnberg331&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Fortescue6&quot;/&gt; The second theme involves circular shapes, used to symbolise [[bush tomato]] (''[[Solanum chippendalei]]''), bush melon, and northern wild orange (''[[Capparis]] umbonata''), among a number of forms of [[bushfood]] represented in her works.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fortescue6&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;McC&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=McCulloch|first=Susan|title=Contemporary Aboriginal Art: A guide to the rebirth of an ancient culture|publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin|edition=2nd|location=St Leonards, NSW|year=2001|pages=86–87|isbn=1865083054}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together, the designs were characterised by one reviewer as &quot;broad, luminescent flowing lines and circles&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beck&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/arts-reviews/the-pwerle-sisters/2006/02/17/1140151801265.html|title=The Pwerle Sisters|last=Beck|first=Chris|date=18 February 2006|work=The Age|accessdate=15 December 2009 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theage.com.au%2Fnews%2Farts-reviews%2Fthe-pwerle-sisters%2F2006%2F02%2F17%2F1140151801265.html%3Fpage%3Dfullpage%23contentSwap1&amp;date=2010-11-10 |archivedate=10 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Minnie's art was quickly added to major public collections such as the [[Art Gallery of NSW]], [[Art Gallery of South Australia]], [[National Gallery of Victoria]] and [[Queensland Art Gallery]].&lt;ref name=&quot;McCulloch139&quot;/&gt; It was also included in a 2009 exhibition of Indigenous Australian painting at the [[New York Metropolitan Museum of Art]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Eccles09&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aboriginalartnews.com.au/2009/12/the-met-admits-aboriginal-art.php|title=The Met admits Aboriginal art|last=Eccles|first=Jeremy|date=20 December 2009|work=Aboriginal Art News|accessdate=5 July 2010 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.aboriginalartnews.com.au%2F2009%2F12%2Fthe-met-admits-aboriginal-art.php&amp;date=2010-11-11 |archivedate=11 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her works later formed the basis of a series of designer rugs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.designerrugs.com.au/minnie-pwerle-atnwengerrp-land-of-dreamings/|title=Minnie Pwerle: Atnwengerrp 'Land of Dreamings'|work=Collections|publisher=Designer Rugs|accessdate=14 December 2009|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.designerrugs.com.au%2Fminnie-pwerle-atnwengerrp-land-of-dreamings%2F&amp;date=2010-09-28|archivedate=29 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and, together with paintings by her sisters, illustrated the cover of art critic Benjamin Genocchio's book, ''Dollar Dreaming''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Genocchio&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Genocchio|first=Benjamin|title=Dollar Dreaming|year=2008|publisher=Hardie Grant Books|location=Prahran, VIC|isbn=9781740666091}}&lt;/ref&gt; Described by art dealer Hank Ebes as the works of &quot;a genius&quot;, Minnie's paintings were typically selling for $5,000 in 2005; the highest price fetched on the secondary market at that time was $43,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;Late&quot;/&gt;

Regarded as one of Australia's leading contemporary women artists, Minnie ranks alongside other notable Indigenous female painters [[Dorothy Napangardi]], [[Gloria Petyarre]] and [[Kathleen Petyarre]].&lt;ref name=&quot;McCulloch2&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=McCulloch|first=Alan|coauthors=Susan McCulloch, Emily McCulloch Childs|title=The new McCulloch's encyclopedia of Australian art|chapter=Australian Aboriginal Art and Artists|pages=2–15|publisher=Aus Art Editions in association with The Miegunyah Press|location=Fitzroy, VIC|year=2006|isbn=0-522-85317-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Burke|first=Janine|title=Source: Nature's Healing Role in Art and Writing|publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin|location=St Leonards, NSW|year=2009|page=329|isbn=1741758173}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of a number of women such as Emily Kngwarreye who dominated central and western desert painting in the first decade of the 21st century,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Biddle|first=Jennifer Loureide|title=Breasts, bodies, canvas: central desert art as experience|publisher=University of New South Wales Press|location=NSW|year=2007|page=24|isbn=0868409944}}&lt;/ref&gt; Minnie is considered to be one of Australia's best-known Indigenous artists,&lt;ref name=&quot;Fortescue6&quot;/&gt; whose work &quot;the market couldn't get enough [of]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;McCulloch139&quot;/&gt;
