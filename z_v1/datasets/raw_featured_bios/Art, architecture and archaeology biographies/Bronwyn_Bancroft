Born in [[Tenterfield]], New South Wales, and trained in [[Canberra]] and [[Sydney]], Bancroft worked as a fashion designer, and is an artist, illustrator, and arts administrator.

In 1985, Bancroft established a shop called Designer Aboriginals, selling fabrics made by Indigenous artists including herself. She was a founding member of Boomalli Aboriginal Artists Co-operative. Art work by Bancroft is held by the [[National Gallery of Australia]], the [[Art Gallery of New South Wales]] and the [[Art Gallery of Western Australia]]. She has provided art work for more than 20&amp;nbsp;children's books, including ''Stradbroke Dreaming'' by writer and activist [[Oodgeroo Noonuccal]], and books by artist and writer [[Sally Morgan (artist)|Sally Morgan]]. She has received design commissions, including one for the exterior of a sports centre in Sydney.

Bancroft has a long history of involvement in community activism and arts administration, and has served as a board member for the National Gallery of Australia. Her painting ''Prevention of AIDS'' (1992) was used in a campaign to raise awareness of [[HIV/AIDS]] in Australia. As of 2010, Bancroft sits on the boards of copyright collection agency Viscopy and Tranby Aboriginal College, and the Artists Board at the [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Sydney]].

Following her father's advice on the importance of getting an education or a trade, Bancroft completed high school in Tenterfield before moving to Canberra in 1976 with her husband-to-be [[Ned Manning]], who had also been her teacher.&lt;ref name=&quot;NMApanel&quot;/&gt; There Bancroft completed a Diploma of Visual Communications through the Canberra School of Art, followed by a Master of Studio Practice and a Master of Visual Arts (Paintings) at the [[University of Sydney]].&lt;ref name=&quot;McCulloch&quot;/&gt; She never returned to live in Tenterfield,&lt;ref name=&quot;NMApanel&quot;/&gt; although her three sisters were living there in 2004.

Although initially known as a fabric and textile designer, Bancroft has worked with many artistic media, including &quot;jewellery design, painting, collage, illustration, sculpture and interior decoration&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;McCulloch&quot;/&gt; Art works by Bancroft are held by the [[National Gallery of Australia]], the [[Art Gallery of New South Wales]], the [[Art Gallery of Western Australia]] and the [[Queensland Art Gallery]].&lt;ref name=&quot;McCulloch&quot;/&gt; The National Gallery holds one of her screenprints, ''Entrapped'', created in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://artsearch.nga.gov.au/Detail.cfm?IRN=121601|title=Entrapped|last=Bancroft|first=Bronwyn|work=Australasian Art Collection|publisher=National Gallery of Australia|accessdate=8 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1989 and 2006, Bancroft held eight solo exhibitions and participated in at least 53&amp;nbsp;group exhibitions, including shows at the [[Australian Museum]] in Sydney, the [[National Gallery of Australia]] in Canberra, and the [[National Gallery of Victoria]].&lt;ref name=&quot;McCulloch&quot;/&gt; Her art has been exhibited in Indonesia, New Zealand, the USA, France, and Germany.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilson2&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=anonymous|first=|title=Bronwyn Bancroft: Time: 15 May to 6 June|journal=Wilson Street Art Quarterly |volume=Autumn/Winter|year=2010|page=17|url=http://www.wilsonstreetgallery.com.au/images/4056.pdf|accessdate=30 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Bancroft was commissioned to design a large mural covering the exterior of a sports centre housing two basketball courts at Tempe Reserve in [[Marrickville]], New South Wales. The mural depicts a snake, a man, and a woman, representing both biblical and Indigenous Australian creation stories. It also includes the [[goanna]], the&lt;!--or &quot;an&quot;?--&gt; ancestral totem of the Marrickville area's original inhabitants, the [[Wangal people]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Sweeney&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sweeney|first=Therese|date=Dec–Jan 2005|title=A cultural gateway|journal=Real Time Arts Magazine|issue=70|page=54|url=http://www.realtimearts.net/article/70/8009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bancroft ventured into illustrating children's books in 1993, when she provided the artwork for ''Fat and Juicy Place'' written by Dianna Kidd. The book was shortlisted for the [[Children's Book Council of Australia]]'s Book of the Year and won the Australian Multicultural Children's Book Award.&lt;ref name=&quot;bookillus&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bronwynbancroft.com/5.html|title=Book illustrations|last=Bancroft|first=Bronwyn|work=Designer Aboriginals|accessdate=13 November 2009 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080718234944/http://www.bronwynbancroft.com/5.html |archivedate=18 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, she illustrated ''Stradbroke Dreamtime'' by Indigenous activist and writer [[Oodgeroo Noonuccal]].

As well as working with established writers, Bancroft has created a number of children's books in her own right, including ''An Australian 1 2 3 of Animals'' and ''An Australian ABC of Animals'', which have been favourably reviewed as imaginative and well-illustrated.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coughlan&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.papertigers.org/reviews/USA/papertigers/AnAustralian123OfAnimalsANDAnAustralianABCOfAnimals.html|last=Coughlan|first=Marjorie|date=October 2009|title=Review: An Australian 123 Of Animals, and An Australian ABC Of Animals |work=PaperTigers|accessdate=12 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her style of illustration has been described as &quot;bold and mysterious&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/08/books/review/08BKSHELF.html|title=Bookshelf: Children's Books in Brief|date=8 August 2004|work=New York Times Sunday Book Review|accessdate=31 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as &quot;traditional Australian Aboriginal representation rendered in bright, eye-catching colors.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Coughlan&quot;/&gt; In 2009 Bancroft received an Australian literary award—the Dromkeen Medal—for her contribution to children’s literature.&lt;ref name=&quot;dromkeen&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scholastic.com.au/common/dromkeen/pdf/medal_recipient_09.pdf|title=Bronwyn Bancroft Dromkeen Medal Citation 2009|year=2009|work=Dromkeen National Centre for Picture Book Art|publisher=Scholastic Australia|accessdate=30 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2010, the Governor-General of Australia [[Quentin Bryce]] launched Bancroft’s latest book, ''Why I Love Australia''. A long-time supporter of Bancroft's work, Ms Bryce said: &quot;''Why I love Australia'' is a work and title that, again, speaks volumes of its author and illustrator. It simply and exquisitely rejoices in telling a story of this magnificent, sacred land we share: the mountains, rivers and gorges; seas and coral reefs; grasslands and bushlands; saltpans and snow; houses and streets; the jewelled night sky, and so much more.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gg.gov.au/pdf/speeches/2010/s20100524728.pdf|format=pdf|title=Speech|last=Bryce AO|first=Her Excellency Ms Quentin|date=24 May 2010|publisher=Governor General of the Commonwealth of Australia|accessdate=30 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Administration and activism==
Bancroft has been active in arts organisations, and served two terms on the board of the National Gallery of Australia during the 1990s.

Within and beyond her artistic works, Bancroft has demonstrated concern for a range of social issues, particularly those affecting Indigenous Australians.
