'''William III &amp; II''' ({{lang-nl|Willem III}}; 4 November 1650&amp;nbsp;– 8 March 1702)&lt;ref name=OSNS/&gt; was a sovereign [[Prince of Orange]] of the [[House of Orange-Nassau]] by birth. From 1672 he governed as [[List of stadtholders for the Low Countries provinces|Stadtholder]] '''William III of Orange''' ({{lang-nl|Willem III van Oranje}}) over [[Holland]], [[Zeeland]], [[Utrecht (province)|Utrecht]], [[Guelders]], and [[Overijssel]] of the [[Dutch Republic]]. From 1689 he reigned as '''William III''' over [[List of English monarchs|England]] and [[Monarchy of Ireland|Ireland]]. By coincidence, his regnal number (III) was the same for both Orange and England. As King of [[List of Scottish monarchs|Scotland]], he is known as '''William II'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/actofunion/01_03_revolution.html|title=Act of Union 1707, the Revolution in Scotland|publisher=UK Parliament|accessdate=8 August 2008| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080615023245/http://www.parliament.uk/actofunion/01_03_revolution.html| archivedate = 15 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is informally known in [[Northern Ireland]] and Scotland as &quot;'''King Billy'''&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Varieties of Cultural History |author=Peter Burke |publisher=Cornell University Press |year=1997 |page=51 |isbn=0-8014-8492-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In what became known as the &quot;[[Glorious Revolution]]&quot;, on 5 November 1688 William invaded England in an action that ultimately deposed King [[James II of England|James II &amp; VII]] and won him the crowns of England, Scotland and Ireland. In the [[British Isles]], William ruled jointly with his wife, [[Mary II of England|Mary II]], until her death on 28 December 1694. The period of their joint reign is often referred to as &quot;[[William and Mary]]&quot;.

A [[Protestantism|Protestant]], William participated in several wars against the powerful Catholic king of France, [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], in coalition with Protestant and Catholic powers in Europe. Many Protestants heralded him as a champion of their faith. Largely because of that reputation, William was able to take the British crowns when many were fearful of a revival of Catholicism under James. William's victory over James at the [[Battle of the Boyne]] in 1690 is [[The Twelfth|commemorated]] by the [[Orange Institution]] in Northern Ireland and parts of Scotland to this day. His reign marked the beginning of the transition from the personal rule of the [[House of Stuart|Stuarts]] to the more Parliament-centred rule of the [[House of Hanover]].

==Early life==

===Birth and family===

William Henry of Orange was born in [[The Hague]] in the [[Dutch Republic]] on 4 November 1650.&lt;ref&gt;Claydon, 9&lt;/ref&gt; He was the only child of [[stadtholder]] [[William II of Orange|William II, Prince of Orange]], and [[Mary, Princess Royal and Princess of Orange|Mary, Princess Royal]]. Mary was the eldest daughter of [[Charles I of England|King Charles I of England, Scotland and Ireland]], and sister of [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]] and [[James II of England|King James II &amp; VII]].

Eight days before William's birth, his father died from [[smallpox]]; thus William was the Sovereign [[Principality of Orange|Prince of Orange]] from the moment of his birth.&lt;ref&gt;Claydon, 14&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately, a conflict ensued between the [[Princess Royal]] and William II's mother, [[Amalia of Solms-Braunfels]], over the name to be given to the infant. Mary wanted to name him Charles after her brother, but her mother-in-law insisted on giving him the name William or ''Willem'' to bolster his prospects of becoming stadtholder.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 26; van der Zee, 6–7&lt;/ref&gt; William II had appointed his wife as his son's guardian in his will; however the document remained unsigned at William II's death and was void.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 26&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 August 1651 the Dutch ''[[Hoge Raad]]'' (Supreme Council) ruled that guardianship would be shared between his mother, his paternal grandmother and [[Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg|Frederick William]], the [[Elector of Brandenburg]], whose wife, [[Louise Henriette of Nassau|Louise Henriette]], was his father's eldest sister.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 26–27. The Prussian prince was chosen because he could act as a neutral party mediating between the two women, but also because as a possible heir he was interested in protecting the Orange family fortune, which Amalia feared Mary would squander.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Childhood and education===
William's mother showed little personal interest in her son, sometimes being absent for years, and had always deliberately kept herself apart from Dutch society.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, 5–6; Troost, 27&lt;/ref&gt; William's education was first laid in the hands of several Dutch governesses, and some of English descent, including Walburg Howard. From April 1656, the prince received daily instruction in the [[Reformed churches|Reformed religion]] from the [[Calvinist]] preacher [[Cornelis Trigland]], a follower of the [[Franciscus Gomarus|Contra-Remonstrant]] theologian [[Gisbertus Voetius]].&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 34–37&lt;/ref&gt; The ideal education for William was described in ''Discours sur la nourriture de S. H. Monseigneur le Prince d'Orange'', a short treatise, perhaps by one of William's tutors, [[Constantijn Huygens]].&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 27. The author may also have been [[Johan van den Kerckhoven]]. ''Ibid.''&lt;/ref&gt; In these lessons, the prince was taught that he was [[Predestination (Calvinism)|predestined]] to become an instrument of [[Divine Providence]], fulfilling the historical destiny of the [[House of Orange]].&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 36–37&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Jan davids de heem-fleurs avec portrait guillaume III d'Orange.jpg|thumb|right|The young prince portrayed in a flower garland painting by [[Jan Davidsz de Heem]] filled with symbols of the [[House of Orange]].]]
From early 1659, William spent seven years at the [[University of Leiden]] for a formal education, under the guidance of ethics professor Hendrik Bornius (though never officially enrolling as a student).&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 37–40&lt;/ref&gt; While residing in the ''Prinsenhof'' at [[Delft]], William had a small personal retinue including [[William Bentinck, 1st Earl of Portland|Hans Willem Bentinck]], and a new governor: [[Frederick Nassau de Zuylenstein]], the illegitimate son of stadtholder [[Frederick Henry of Orange]]. He was taught French by [[Samuel Chappuzeau]] (who was dismissed by William's grandmother after the death of his mother).&lt;ref&gt;Meinel&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Grand Pensionary]] [[Johan de Witt]] and his uncle [[Cornelis de Graeff]] pushed the [[States of Holland]] to take charge of William's education. This was to ensure he would acquire the skills to serve in a future—though undetermined—state function; the States acted on 25 September 1660.&lt;ref name=troost43&gt;Troost, 43&lt;/ref&gt; This first involvement of the authorities did not last long. On 23 December 1660, when William was ten years old, his mother died of [[smallpox]] at [[Whitehall Palace]], London while visiting her brother [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]].&lt;ref name=troost43/&gt; In her will, Mary requested that Charles look after William's interests, and Charles now demanded the States of Holland end their interference.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 43–44&lt;/ref&gt; To appease Charles, they complied on 30 September 1661.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 44&lt;/ref&gt; In 1661, Zuylenstein began to work for Charles. He induced William to write letters to Charles asking him to help William become stadtholder someday.&lt;ref name=troost49&gt;Troost, 49&lt;/ref&gt; After his mother's death, William's education and guardianship became a point of contention between [[Orangism (Netherlands)|his dynasty's supporters]] and the advocates of a more republican Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, 12–17&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dutch authorities did their best at first to ignore these intrigues, but in the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]] one of Charles's peace conditions was the improvement of the position of his nephew.&lt;ref name=troost49/&gt; As a countermeasure in 1666, when William was sixteen, the States of Holland officially made him a ward of the government, or a &quot;Child of State&quot;.&lt;ref name=troost49/&gt; All pro-English courtiers, including Zuylenstein, were removed from William's company.&lt;ref name=troost49/&gt; William begged De Witt to allow Zuylenstein to stay, but he refused.&lt;ref name=vdk14&gt;Van der Kiste, 14–15&lt;/ref&gt; De Witt, the leading politician of the Republic, took William's education into his own hands, instructing him weekly in state matters—and joining him in a regular game of [[real tennis]].&lt;ref name=vdk14/&gt;

==Early offices==

===Exclusion from stadtholdership===
{{Main|First Stadtholderless Period}}
At William's father's death, the provinces had suspended the office of stadtholder. The [[Treaty of Westminster (1654)|Treaty of Westminster]], which ended the [[First Anglo-Dutch War]], had a secret annexe attached on demand of [[Oliver Cromwell]]: the [[Act of Seclusion]], which forbade the province of Holland to appoint a member of the House of Orange as stadtholder.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 29–30&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[English Restoration]], the Act of Seclusion, which had not remained a secret for very long, was declared void as the [[English Commonwealth]] (with which the treaty had been concluded) no longer existed.&lt;ref name=troost41&gt;Troost, 41&lt;/ref&gt; In 1660, Mary and Amalia tried to convince several provincial States to designate William as their future stadtholder, but they all initially refused.&lt;ref name=troost41/&gt;

In 1667, as William III approached the age of eighteen, the Orangist party again attempted to bring him to power by securing for him the offices of stadtholder and [[Captain-General]]. To prevent the restoration of the influence of the House of Orange, De Witt allowed the pensionary of [[Haarlem]], [[Gaspar Fagel]], to induce the States of Holland to issue the [[Perpetual Edict (1667)]].&lt;ref name=troost52&gt;Troost, 52–53&lt;/ref&gt; The Edict declared that the Captain-General or Admiral-General of the Netherlands could not serve as stadtholder in any province.&lt;ref name=troost52/&gt; Even so, William's supporters sought ways to enhance his prestige, and on 19 September 1668, the States of Zeeland received him as ''First Noble''.&lt;ref name=vdk16&gt;Van der Kiste, 16–17&lt;/ref&gt; To receive this honour, William had to escape the attention of his state tutors and travel secretly to [[Middelburg]].&lt;ref name=vdk16/&gt; A month later, Amalia allowed William to manage his own household and declared him to be of majority age.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 57&lt;/ref&gt;

The province of Holland, the center of anti-Orangism, abolished the office of stadtholder and four other provinces followed suit in March 1670, establishing the so-called &quot;Harmony&quot;.&lt;ref name=troost52/&gt; De Witt demanded an oath from each Holland [[regenten|regent]] (city council member) to uphold the Edict; all but one complied.&lt;ref name=troost52/&gt; William saw all this as a defeat, but in fact this arrangement was a compromise: De Witt would have preferred to ignore the prince completely, but now his eventual rise to the office of supreme army commander was implicit.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 53–54&lt;/ref&gt; De Witt further conceded that William would be admitted as a member of the ''[[Raad van State]]'', the Council of State, then the [[States-General of the Netherlands#History|generality]] organ administering the defence budget.&lt;ref name=troost59&gt;Troost, 59&lt;/ref&gt; William was introduced to the council on 31 May 1670 with full voting powers, despite De Witt's attempts to limit his role to that of an advisor.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 60&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conflict with republicans===
In November 1670, William obtained permission to travel to England to urge Charles to pay back at least a part of the 2,797,859&amp;nbsp;[[Dutch gulden|guilder]] debt the House of Stuart owed the House of Orange.&lt;ref name=troost62&gt;Troost, 62–64&lt;/ref&gt; Charles was unable to pay, but William agreed to reduce the amount owed to 1,800,000 guilder.&lt;ref name=troost62/&gt; Charles found his nephew to be a dedicated [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] and patriotic Dutchman, and reconsidered his desire to show him the [[Secret treaty of Dover]] with France, directed at destroying the Dutch Republic and installing William as &quot;sovereign&quot; of a Dutch [[rump state]].&lt;ref name=troost62/&gt; In addition to differing political outlooks, William found that Charles's and James's lifestyles differed from his own, being more concerned with drinking, gambling, and cavorting with mistresses.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, 18–20&lt;/ref&gt;

The following year, the Republic's security deteriorated quickly as an Anglo-French attack became imminent.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 64&lt;/ref&gt; In view of the threat, the States of [[Gelderland]] wanted William to be appointed Captain-General of the [[Dutch States Army]] as soon as possible, despite his youth and inexperience.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 65&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 December 1671 the States of [[Utrecht (province)|Utrecht]] made this their official policy.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 66&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 January 1672 the States of [[Holland]] made a counterproposal: to appoint William for just a single campaign.&lt;ref name=troost67&gt;Troost, 67&lt;/ref&gt; The prince refused this and on 25 February a compromise was reached: an appointment by the [[States-General of the Netherlands]] for one summer, followed by a permanent appointment on his twenty-second birthday.&lt;ref name=troost67/&gt; Meanwhile, William had written a secret letter to Charles in January 1672 asking his uncle to exploit the situation by exerting pressure on the States-General to appoint William stadtholder.&lt;ref name=troost65&gt;Troost, 65–66&lt;/ref&gt; In return, William would ally the Republic with England and serve Charles's interests as much as his &quot;honour and the loyalty due to this state&quot; allowed.&lt;ref name=troost65/&gt; Charles took no action on the proposal, and continued his war plans with his French ally.

==Becoming stadtholder==
===&quot;Disaster year&quot;: 1672===
{{Main|Rampjaar}}

For the Dutch Republic, 1672 proved calamitous, becoming known as the [[rampjaar|&quot;disaster year&quot;]] (''Dutch: rampjaar'') because of the [[Franco-Dutch War]] and the [[Third Anglo-Dutch War]] in which the Netherlands were invaded by France under [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], England, [[Münster]], and [[Cologne]]. Although the Anglo-French fleet was disabled by the [[Battle of Solebay]], in June the French army quickly overran the provinces of Gelderland and Utrecht. William on 14 June withdrew with the remnants of his field army into Holland, where the States had ordered the flooding of [[the Dutch Water Line]] on 8 June.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 74&lt;/ref&gt; Louis XIV, believing the war was over, began negotiations to extract as large a sum of money from the Dutch as possible.&lt;ref name=troost78&gt;Troost, 78–83&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of a large French army in the heart of the Republic caused a general panic, and the people turned against de Witt and his allies.&lt;ref name=troost78/&gt;

On 4 July the States of Holland appointed William stadtholder, and he took the oath five days later.&lt;ref name=troost76&gt;Troost, 76&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, a special envoy from Charles, [[Henry Bennet, 1st Earl of Arlington|Lord Arlington]], met with William in [[Nieuwerbrug]]. He offered to make William Sovereign Prince of Holland in exchange for his capitulation—whereas a stadtholder was a mere civil servant.&lt;ref name=troost80&gt;Troost, 80–81&lt;/ref&gt; When William refused, Arlington threatened that William would witness the end of the republic's existence.&lt;ref name=troost80/&gt; William made his famous answer: &quot;There is one way to avoid this: to die defending it in the last ditch&quot;. On 7 July, the inundations were complete and the further advance of the French army was effectively blocked. On 16 July Zeeland offered the stadtholderate to William.&lt;ref name=troost76/&gt;

Johan de Witt had been unable to function as [[Grand Pensionary]] after having been wounded by an attempt on his life on 21 June.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 75&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 August William published a letter from Charles, in which the English King stated that he had made war because of the aggression of the de Witt faction.&lt;ref name=troost85&gt;Troost, 85–86&lt;/ref&gt; The people thus incited, de Witt and his brother, [[Cornelis de Witt|Cornelis]], were murdered by an Orangist [[civil militia]] in The Hague on 20 August.&lt;ref name=troost85/&gt; After this William replaced many of the Dutch regents with his followers.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 89–90&lt;/ref&gt;

Though William's complicity in the lynching has never been proved (and some 19th century Dutch historians have made an effort to disprove that he was an accessory before the fact) he thwarted attempts to prosecute the ringleaders, and even rewarded some, like [[Hendrik Verhoeff]], with money, and others, like [[Johan van Banchem]] and [[Johan Kievit]], with high offices.&lt;ref&gt;{{aut|Rowen, H.H.}} (1986) ''John de Witt: Statesman of the &quot;true Freedom&quot;'', Cambridge University Press, ISBN 0-521-52708-2, p. 222; {{aut|Nijhoff, D.C.}} (1893) ''Staatkundige Geschiedenis van Nederland. Tweede Deel'', pp. 92–93, and fn.4 p. 92; [[Robert Fruin]], &quot;De schuld van Willem III en zijn vrienden aan den moord der gebroeders de Witt&quot;, in ''De Gids'' (1867), pp. 201–218 [http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/_gid001186601_01/_gid001186701_01_0008.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; This damaged his reputation in the same fashion as his later [[Massacre of Glencoe|actions at Glencoe]].

William III continued to fight against the invaders from England and France, allying himself with Spain and [[Brandenburg]]. In November 1672 he took his army to [[Maastricht]] to threaten the French supply lines.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 122&lt;/ref&gt; By 1673, the situation further improved. Although Louis took Maastricht and William's attack against [[Charleroi]] failed, [[Lieutenant-Admiral]] [[Michiel de Ruyter]] defeated the Anglo-French fleet three times, forcing Charles to end England's involvement by the [[Treaty of Westminster (1674)|Treaty of Westminster]]; after 1673, France slowly withdrew from Dutch territory (with the exception of Maastricht), while making gains elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 128–129&lt;/ref&gt;

Fagel now proposed to treat the liberated provinces of Utrecht, Gelderland and [[Overijssel]] as conquered territory ([[Generality Lands]]), as punishment for their quick surrender to the enemy.&lt;ref name=troost106&gt;Troost, 106–110&lt;/ref&gt; William refused but obtained a special mandate from the States-General to newly appoint all delegates in the States of these provinces.&lt;ref name=troost106/&gt; William's followers in the States of Utrecht on 26 April 1674 appointed him hereditary stadtholder.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 109&lt;/ref&gt; The States of Gelderland on 30 January 1675 offered the titles of Duke of Guelders and Count of [[Zutphen]].&lt;ref name=troost109&gt;Troost, 109–112&lt;/ref&gt; The negative reactions to this from Zeeland and the city of Amsterdam, where the [[stock market]] collapsed, made William ultimately decide to decline these honours; he was instead appointed stadtholder of Gelderland and Overijssel.&lt;ref name=troost109/&gt;

===Marriage to Mary Stuart===
[[Image:Queen Mary II.jpg|thumb|alt=portrait of a woman with brown hair in a blue-and-gray dress|William married his first cousin, the future [[Mary II of England|Queen Mary II]], in 1677.]]
During the war with France, William tried to improve his position by marrying [[Mary II of England|Mary Stuart]], his first-cousin and daughter of [[James II of England|James, Duke of York]] and eleven years his junior. Although he anticipated resistance to a Stuart match from the Amsterdam merchants who had disliked his mother (another Mary Stuart), William believed that marrying Mary would increase his chances of succeeding to Charles's kingdoms, and would draw England's monarch away from his pro-French policies.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, 38–39&lt;/ref&gt; James was not inclined to consent, but Charles pressured his brother to go along.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, 42–43&lt;/ref&gt; Charles wanted to use the possibility of marriage to gain leverage in negotiations relating to the war, but William insisted that the two issues be decided separately.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, 44–46&lt;/ref&gt; Charles relented, and Bishop [[Henry Compton (bishop)|Henry Compton]] married the couple on 4 November 1677.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, 47&lt;/ref&gt; Mary became pregnant soon after the marriage, but [[miscarriage|miscarried]]. After a further illness later in 1678, she never conceived again.&lt;ref&gt;Chapman, 86–93&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout William and Mary's marriage, William had only one acknowledged mistress, [[Elizabeth Hamilton, Countess of Orkney|Elizabeth Villiers]], in contrast to the many mistresses his uncles openly kept.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Zee, 202–206&lt;/ref&gt;

===Peace with France, intrigue with England===
By 1678, Louis sought peace with the Dutch Republic.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 141–145&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, tensions remained: William remained very suspicious of Louis, thinking the French king desired &quot;Universal Kingship&quot; over Europe; Louis described William as &quot;my mortal enemy&quot; and saw him as an obnoxious warmonger. France's small annexations in Germany (the ''[[Chambers of Reunion|Réunion]]'' policy) and the revocation of the [[Edict of Nantes]] in 1685, caused a surge of [[Huguenot]] refugees to the Republic.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 153–156&lt;/ref&gt; This led William III to join various anti-French alliances, such as the Association League, and ultimately the [[Grand Alliance (League of Augsburg)|League of Augsburg]] (an anti-French coalition that also included the [[Holy Roman Empire]], Sweden, Spain and several German states) in 1686.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 156–163&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:William III of England.jpg|thumb|left|alt=portrait of a man clad in armour, looking right|upright|Portrait of William, aged 27, by [[Peter Lely]]]]
After his marriage in November 1677, William became a possible candidate for the English throne if his father-in-law (and uncle) James were excluded because of his Catholicism. During the crisis concerning the [[Exclusion Bill]] in 1680, Charles at first invited William to come to England to bolster the king's position against the ''exclusionists'', then withdrew his invitation—after which [[Robert Spencer, 2nd Earl of Sunderland|Lord Sunderland]] also tried unsuccessfully to bring William over but now to put pressure on Charles.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 150–151&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, William secretly induced the States-General to send the ''Insinuation'' to Charles, beseeching the king to prevent any Catholics from succeeding him, without explicitly naming James.&lt;ref name=troost152&gt;Troost, 152–153&lt;/ref&gt; After receiving indignant reactions from Charles and James, William denied any involvement.&lt;ref name=troost152/&gt;

In 1685, when James II succeeded Charles, William at first attempted a conciliatory approach, at the same time trying not to offend the Protestants in England.&lt;ref name=troost173&gt;Troost, 173–175&lt;/ref&gt; William, ever looking for ways to diminish the power of France, hoped James would join the League of Augsburg, but by 1687 it became clear that James would not join the anti-French alliance.&lt;ref name=troost173/&gt; Relations worsened between William and James thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 180–183&lt;/ref&gt; In November, James's wife [[Mary of Modena]] was announced to be pregnant.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 189&lt;/ref&gt; That month, to gain the favour of English Protestants, William wrote an [[open letter]] to the English people in which he disapproved of James's religious policies. Seeing him as a friend, and often having maintained secret contacts with him for years, many English politicians began to negotiate an armed invasion of England.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 186&lt;/ref&gt;

William at first opposed the prospect of invasion, but most historians now agree that he began to assemble an expeditionary force in April 1688, as it became increasingly clear that France would remain occupied by campaigns in Germany and Italy, and thus unable to mount an attack while William's troops would be occupied in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Troost, 190&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Claydon, Tony|date=September 2004; rev. May 2008|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/29450|title=William III and II (1650–1702)|work=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=8 August 2008}} (Subscription required)&lt;/ref&gt; Believing that the English people would not react well to a foreign invader, he demanded in a letter to Rear-Admiral [[Arthur Herbert, 1st Earl of Torrington|Arthur Herbert]] that the most eminent English Protestants first invite him to invade.&lt;ref name=troost191&gt;Troost, 191&lt;/ref&gt; In June, James's wife, [[Mary of Modena]], bore a son ([[James Francis Edward Stuart]]), who displaced William's wife to become first in the line of succession.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 191; van der Kiste, 91–92&lt;/ref&gt; Public anger also increased because of the trial of [[seven bishops]] who had publicly opposed James's religious policies and had petitioned him to reform them.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, 91&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 June 1688—the same day the bishops were acquitted—a group of political figures known afterward as the &quot;[[Immortal Seven]]&quot;, sent William a [[invitation to William|formal invitation]].&lt;ref name=troost191/&gt; William's intentions to invade were public knowledge by September 1688.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 193–196&lt;/ref&gt; With a Dutch army, William landed at [[Brixham]] in southwest England on 5 November 1688.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 200–203; van der Kiste, 102–103&lt;/ref&gt; He came ashore from the ship ''[[Den Briel|Brill]]'', proclaiming &quot;the liberties of England and the Protestant religion I will maintain&quot;. William had come ashore with approximately 11,000-foot and 4,000 horse soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, 105&lt;/ref&gt; James's support began to dissolve almost immediately upon William's arrival; [[List of James II deserters to William of Orange|Protestant officers defected from the English army]] (the most notable of whom was [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|Lord Churchill of Eyemouth]], James's most able commander), and influential noblemen across the country declared their support for the invader.&lt;ref name=troost204&gt;Troost, 204–205&lt;/ref&gt;

James at first attempted to resist William, but saw that his efforts would prove futile.&lt;ref name=troost204/&gt; He sent representatives to negotiate with William, but secretly attempted to flee on 11 December.&lt;ref name=troost205&gt;Troost, 205–207&lt;/ref&gt; A group of fishermen caught him and brought him back to London.&lt;ref name=troost205/&gt; He successfully escaped to France in a second attempt on 23 December.&lt;ref name=troost205/&gt; William permitted James to leave the country, not wanting to make him a [[martyr]] for the Roman Catholic cause.&lt;ref&gt;Baxter, 242–246; Miller, 208&lt;/ref&gt;

===Proclaimed King===
[[Image:William III Silver Coin.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A silver coin picturing William III and his coat of arms|Silver crown coin of William III, dated 1695. The Latin inscription is (obverse) ''GVLIELMVS III DEI GRA[TIA]'' (reverse) ''MAG[NAE] BR[ITANNIAE], FRA[NCIAE], ET HIB[ERNIAE] REX 1695''. English: &quot;William III, By the grace of God, King of Great Britain, France, and Ireland, 1695.&quot; The reverse shows the arms, clockwise from top, of England, Scotland, France, and Ireland, centred on William's personal arms of the [[House of Orange-Nassau]].]]

William summoned a [[Convention Parliament (1689)|Convention Parliament]] in England, which met on 22 January 1689,&lt;ref name=legit&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jacobite.ca/essays/ruvigny.htm |title=Legitimism in England |accessdate=10 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; to discuss the appropriate course of action following James's flight.&lt;ref name=davies614&gt;Davies, 614–615&lt;/ref&gt; William felt insecure about his position; though his wife ranked higher in the line of succession to the throne, he wished to reign as King in his own right, rather than as a mere [[King consort|consort]].&lt;ref name=troost207&gt;Troost, 207–210&lt;/ref&gt; The only precedent for a joint monarchy in England dated from the sixteenth century, when Queen [[Mary I of England|Mary I]] married the Spanish Prince [[Philip II of Spain|Philip]].&lt;ref&gt;Davies, 469; Israel, 136&lt;/ref&gt; Philip remained King only during his wife's lifetime, and restrictions were placed on his power. William, on the other hand, demanded that he remain as King even after his wife's death.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, 107–108&lt;/ref&gt; Although the majority of [[Tories (political faction)|Tory]] Lords proposed to acclaim her as sole ruler, Mary, remaining loyal to her husband, refused.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 209&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[House of Commons of England|House of Commons]], with a [[Whig (British political party)|Whig]] majority, quickly resolved that the throne was vacant, and that it was safer if the ruler was Protestant. There were more Tories in the [[House of Lords]] which would not initially agree, but after William refused to be a [[regent]] or to agree to remaining King only in his wife's lifetime, there were negotiations between the two houses and the Lords agreed by a narrow majority that the throne was vacant. The Commons made William accept a Bill of Rights,&lt;ref name=legit/&gt; and on 13 February 1689, Parliament passed the [[Bill of Rights 1689|Declaration of Right]], in which it deemed that James, by attempting to flee, had abdicated the government of the realm, thereby leaving the Throne vacant.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 210–212&lt;/ref&gt; The Crown was not offered to James's eldest son, James Francis Edward (who would have been the heir-apparent under normal circumstances), but to William and Mary as joint Sovereigns.&lt;ref name=troost207/&gt; It was, however, provided that &quot;the sole and full exercise of the regal power be only in and executed by the said Prince of Orange in the names of the said Prince and Princess during their joint lives&quot;.&lt;ref name=troost207/&gt;

William and Mary were crowned together at [[Westminster Abbey]] on 11 April 1689 by the [[Bishop of London]], [[Henry Compton (bishop)|Henry Compton]].&lt;ref name=troost219&gt;Troost, 219–220&lt;/ref&gt; Normally, the coronation is performed by the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], but the Archbishop at the time, [[William Sancroft]], refused to recognise James's removal.&lt;ref name=troost219/&gt;

William also summoned a Convention of the [[Estates of Scotland]] which met on 14 March 1689, and sent a conciliatory letter while James sent haughty uncompromising orders, swaying a majority in favour of William. On 11 April, the day of the English coronation, the Convention finally declared that James was no longer King of Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 266–268&lt;/ref&gt; William and Mary were offered the Scottish Crown; they accepted on 11 May.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, 614–615. William was &quot;William II&quot; of Scotland, for there was only one previous Scottish King named [[William I of Scotland|William]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revolution settlement===

William III of England encouraged the passage of the [[Act of Toleration (1689)]], which guaranteed religious toleration to certain Protestant [[nonconformists]].&lt;ref name=davies614/&gt; It did not, however, extend toleration as far as William wished, still restricting the religious liberty of Roman Catholics, [[Nontrinitarianism|non-trinitarians]], and those of non-Christian faiths.&lt;ref name=troost219/&gt;  In December 1689, one of the most important constitutional documents in English history, the [[Bill of Rights 1689|Bill of Rights]], was passed.&lt;ref name=vdk114&gt;Van der Kiste, 114–115&lt;/ref&gt;  The Act, which restated and confirmed many provisions of the earlier Declaration of Right, established restrictions on the [[royal prerogative]]. It provided, amongst other things, that the Sovereign could not suspend laws passed by Parliament, levy taxes without parliamentary consent, infringe the right to petition, raise a standing army during peacetime without parliamentary consent, deny the right to bear arms to Protestant subjects, unduly interfere with parliamentary elections, punish members of either House of Parliament for anything said during debates, require excessive bail or inflict cruel and unusual punishments.&lt;ref name=davies614/&gt;  William was opposed to the imposition of such constraints, but he chose not to engage in a conflict with Parliament and agreed to abide by the statute.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 212–214&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bill of Rights also settled the question of succession to the Crown. After the death of either William or Mary, the other would continue to reign. Next in the line of succession was Mary II's sister, [[Anne of Great Britain|Princess Anne]], and her issue.&lt;ref name=vdk114/&gt;  Finally, any children William might have had by a subsequent marriage were included in the line of succession. Roman Catholics, as well as those who married Catholics, were excluded.&lt;ref name=vdk114/&gt;

==Rule with Mary II==
===Resistance to validity of rule===
Although most in Britain accepted William and Mary as sovereigns, a significant minority refused to accept the validity of their claim to the throne, holding that the [[divine right of kings]] was authority directly from God, not delegated to the monarch by Parliament. Over the next 57 years [[Jacobitism|Jacobites]] pressed for restoration of James and his heirs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jacobite.ca/ |title=The Jacobite Heritage |accessdate=9 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nonjuring schism|Nonjuror]]s in England and Scotland, including over 400 clergy and several bishops of the [[Church of England]] and [[Scottish Episcopal Church]] as well as numerous laymen, refused to take oaths of allegiance to William.&lt;ref name=Nonjurors&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jacobite.ca/essays/nonjurors.htm |title=Nonjurors |accessdate=9 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Jan van Huchtenburg - De slag aan de Boyne.jpg|thumb|left|200px|alt=Painting of a battle scene|''[[Battle of the Boyne]] between James II and William III, 12 July 1690'', [[Jan van Huchtenburg]]]]
Ireland was controlled by Roman Catholics loyal to James, and [[Jacobitism|Franco-Irish Jacobites]] arrived from France with French forces in March 1689 to join the [[Williamite war in Ireland|war in Ireland]] and contest Protestant resistance at the [[Siege of Derry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.libraryireland.com/JoyceHistory/Derry.php |title=The Siege of Derry (1688–1689) |accessdate=10 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; William sent his navy to the city in July, and his army landed in August. After progress stalled, William personally intervened to lead his armies to victory over James at the [[Battle of the Boyne]] on 1 July 1690,&lt;ref&gt;Due to the change to the [[Gregorian calendar]], William's victory is commemorated annually by Northern Irish and Scottish Protestants on [[The Twelfth]] of July  –  cf. Troost, 278–280&lt;/ref&gt; after which James II fled back to France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.libraryireland.com/JoyceHistory/Boyne.php |title=The Battle of the Boyne (1689–1690) |accessdate=10 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon King William's return to England, his close friend [[Godert de Ginkell, 1st Earl of Athlone|Dutch General Godert de Ginkell]], who had accompanied William to Ireland and had commanded a body of Dutch cavalry at the [[Battle of the Boyne]], was named Commander in Chief of William's forces in Ireland and entrusted with further conduct of the war there. Ginkell took command in Ireland in the spring of 1691, and following several ensuing battles, succeeded in capturing both [[Galway]] and [[Limerick]], thereby effectively suppressing the Jacobite forces in Ireland within a few more months. After difficult negotiations a [[capitulation (surrender)|capitulation]] was signed on 3 October 1691—the [[Treaty of Limerick]]. Thus concluded the Williamite pacification of Ireland, and for his services the Dutch general received the formal thanks of the [[House of Commons of England|House of Commons]], and was awarded the title of [[Earl of Athlone]] by the King.

A series of [[Jacobite rising]]s also took place in Scotland, where [[John Graham, 1st Viscount of Dundee|Viscount Dundee]] raised Highland forces and won a victory on 27 July 1689 at the [[Battle of Killiecrankie]], but he died in the fight and a month later Scottish [[26th (Cameronian) Regiment of Foot|Cameronian]] forces subdued the rising at the [[Battle of Dunkeld]].&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 270–273&lt;/ref&gt; William offered [[Scottish clan]]s that had taken part in the rising a pardon provided they signed allegiance by a deadline, and his government in Scotland punished a delay with the [[Massacre of Glencoe]] of 1692, which became infamous in Jacobite propaganda as William had countersigned the orders.&lt;ref name=troost274&gt;Troost, 274–275&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=beebunion&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/scottishhistory/union/features_union_restoration2.shtml |title=BBC – History – Scottish History – Restoration and Revolution (II) |work=The Making of the Union |accessdate=9 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bowing to public opinion, William dismissed those responsible for the massacre, though they still remained in his favour; in the words of the historian [[John Dalberg-Acton, 1st Baron Acton|John Dalberg-Acton]], &quot;one became a colonel, another a knight, a third a peer, and a fourth an [[John Dalrymple, 1st Earl of Stair|earl]].&quot;&lt;ref name=troost274/&gt;

William's reputation in Scotland was further damaged when he refused English assistance to the [[Darien scheme]], a colony which then failed disastrously.&lt;ref name=beebjac&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/civil_war_revolution/scotland_jacobites_01.shtml |title=BBC – History – British History in depth: The Jacobite Cause |accessdate=9 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parliament and faction===
[[Image:William&amp;MaryEngraving1703.jpg|thumb|alt=Engraving depicting a king, queen, throne, and arms|right|150px|A 1703 engraving of King William III and Queen Mary II]]
Although the [[Whig (British political faction)|Whigs]] were William's strongest supporters, he initially favoured a policy of balance between the Whigs and Tories.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 220–223&lt;/ref&gt; The [[George Savile, 1st Marquess of Halifax|Marquess of Halifax]], a man known for his ability to chart a moderate political course, gained William's confidence early in his reign.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 221&lt;/ref&gt; The Whigs, a majority in Parliament, had expected to dominate the government, and were disappointed that William denied them this chance.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Zee, 296–297&lt;/ref&gt; This &quot;balanced&quot; approach to governance did not last beyond 1690, as the conflicting factions made it impossible for the government to pursue effective policy, and William called for new elections early that year.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 222; van der Zee, 301–302&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Parliamentary elections of 1690, William began to favour the Tories, led by [[Thomas Osborne, 1st Duke of Leeds|Danby]] and [[Daniel Finch, 2nd Earl of Nottingham|Nottingham]].&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 223–227&lt;/ref&gt; While the Tories favoured preserving the king's prerogatives, William found them unaccommodating when he asked Parliament to support his continuing war with France.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 226&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, William began to prefer the Whig faction known as the [[Whig Junto|Junto]].&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 228–232&lt;/ref&gt; The Whig government was responsible for the creation of the [[Bank of England]]. William's decision to grant the [[Royal Charter]] in 1694 to the Bank, a private institution owned by bankers, is his most relevant economic legacy.&lt;ref&gt;Claydon, 129–131&lt;/ref&gt; It laid the financial foundation of the English take-over of the central role of the [[Dutch Republic]] and [[Bank of Amsterdam]] in global commerce in the 18th century.

William dissolved Parliament in 1695, and the new Parliament that assembled that year was led by the Whigs. There was a considerable surge in support for William following the exposure of a [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] plan to assassinate him in 1696.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Zee, 402–403&lt;/ref&gt; Parliament passed a [[bill of attainder]] against the ringleader, [[Sir John Fenwick, 3rd Baronet|John Fenwick]], and he was beheaded in 1697.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Zee, 414&lt;/ref&gt;

===War in Europe===
William continued to be absent from the realm for extended periods during his war with France, leaving each spring and returning to England each autumn.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 239–241; van der Zee, 368–369&lt;/ref&gt; England joined the League of Augsburg, which then became known as the [[Grand Alliance (League of Augsburg)|Grand Alliance]].&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 241–246&lt;/ref&gt;  Whilst William was away fighting, his wife, Mary II, governed the realm, but acted on his advice. Each time he returned to England, Mary gave up her power to him without reservation, an arrangement that lasted for the rest of Mary's life.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, 150–158&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Anglo-Dutch fleet defeated a French fleet at [[Battle of La Hougue|La Hogue]] in 1692, the allies for a short period controlled the seas, and Ireland was pacified thereafter by the [[Treaty of Limerick]].&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 281–283&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the Grand Alliance fared poorly in Europe, as William lost [[Namur (city)|Namur]] in the [[Spanish Netherlands]] in 1692, and was badly beaten at the [[Battle of Landen]] in 1693.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 244–246&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later years==
===Death of wife, Queen Mary II===
Mary II died of smallpox in 1694, leaving William III to rule alone.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, 179–180&lt;/ref&gt; William deeply mourned his wife's death.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, 180–184&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his conversion to [[Anglicanism]], William's popularity plummeted during his reign as a sole Sovereign.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, 186–192; Troost, 226–237&lt;/ref&gt;

===Allegations of homosexual relations===
During the 1690s rumours grew of William's alleged homosexual inclinations and led to the publication of many satirical pamphlets by his Jacobite detractors.&lt;ref&gt;Culture and Society In Britain, J. Black (ed.), Manchester, 1997. p97&lt;/ref&gt; He did have several close, male associates, including two Dutch courtiers to whom he granted English titles: [[William Bentinck, 1st Earl of Portland|Hans Willem Bentinck]] became [[Earl of Portland]], and [[Arnold Joost van Keppel, 1st Earl of Albemarle|Arnold Joost van Keppel]] was created [[Earl of Albemarle]]. These relationships with male friends, and his apparent lack of more than one female mistress, led William's enemies to suggest that he might prefer homosexual relationships. William's modern biographers, however, still disagree on the veracity of these allegations, with many contending that they were just figments of his enemies' imaginations,&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, 204–205; Baxter, 352; James Falkner, ‘Keppel, Arnold Joost van, first earl of Albemarle (1669/70–1718)’, ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; and others suggesting there may have been some truth to the rumours.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 25–26; Van der Zee, 421–423&lt;/ref&gt;

Bentinck's closeness to William did arouse jealousies in the Royal Court at the time, but most modern historians doubt that there was a homosexual element in their relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, 205&lt;/ref&gt; But William's young protege, [[Arnold van Keppel, 1st Earl of Albemarle|Keppel]], aroused more gossip and suspicion, being 20 years William's junior and strikingly handsome, and having risen from being a royal page to an earldom with some ease.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, 201&lt;/ref&gt; Portland wrote to William in 1697 that &quot;the kindness which your Majesty has for a young man, and the way in which you seem to authorise his liberties&amp;nbsp;... make the world say things I am ashamed to hear&quot;.&lt;ref name=vdk202&gt;Van der Kiste, 202–203&lt;/ref&gt; This, he said, was &quot;tarnishing a reputation which has never before been subject to such accusations&quot;. William tersely dismissed these suggestions, however, saying, &quot;It seems to me very extraordinary that it should be impossible to have esteem and regard for a young man without it being criminal.&quot;&lt;ref name=vdk202/&gt;

===Peace with France===
[[Image:Lord Justices of England.jpg|alt=Black and white depiction of six small portraits arrayed in a circle around a larger portrait|thumb|Engraving from 1695 showing the [[Lord Justices]] who administered the kingdom while William was on campaign. (Queen Mary had performed this function prior to her death in 1694.)]]
In 1696, the Dutch territory of [[Drenthe]] made William its Stadtholder. In the same year, Jacobites plotted to assassinate William III in an attempt to restore James to the English throne, but failed. In accordance with the [[Treaty of Rijswijk]] (20 September 1697), which ended the [[Nine Years' War]], Louis recognised William III as King of England, and undertook to give no further assistance to James II.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 251&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus deprived of French dynastic backing after 1697, Jacobites posed no further serious threats during William's reign.

As his life drew towards its conclusion, William, like many other European rulers, felt concern over the question of succession to the throne of Spain, which brought with it vast territories in Italy, the [[Low Countries]] and the [[New World]]. The King of Spain, [[Charles II of Spain|Charles II]], was an invalid with no prospect of having children; amongst his closest relatives were Louis XIV (the King of France) and [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor]]. William sought to prevent the Spanish inheritance from going to either monarch, for he feared that such a calamity would upset the [[balance of power in international relations|balance of power]]. William and Louis XIV agreed to the [[First Partition Treaty]], which provided for the division of the Spanish Empire:  [[Duke Joseph Ferdinand of Bavaria]] would obtain Spain, while France and the Holy Roman Emperor would divide the remaining territories between them.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 253–255&lt;/ref&gt;  Charles II accepted the nomination of Joseph Ferdinand as his heir, and war appeared to be averted.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 255&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Louis XIV of France.jpg|thumb|alt=Portrait of a man, standing, wearing an ermine robed faced with fleur-de-lis|left|[[Louis XIV of France]] was William's life-long enemy; an uneasy peace agreed in 1697 was soon broken]]
When, however, Joseph Ferdinand died of smallpox, the issue re-opened. In 1700, the two rulers agreed to the [[Treaty of London, 1700|Second Partition Treaty]] (also called the Treaty of London), under which the territories in Italy would pass to a son of the King of France, and the other Spanish territories would be inherited by a son of the Holy Roman Emperor.&lt;ref name=troost256&gt;Troost, 256–257&lt;/ref&gt;  This arrangement infuriated both the Spanish, who still sought to prevent the dissolution of their empire, and the Holy Roman Emperor, to whom the Italian territories were much more useful than the other lands.&lt;ref name=troost256/&gt;  Unexpectedly, the invalid King of Spain, Charles II, interfered as he lay dying in late 1700.&lt;ref name=troost258&gt;Troost, 258–260&lt;/ref&gt;  Unilaterally, he willed all Spanish territories to [[Philip V of Spain|Philip]], a grandson of Louis XIV. The French conveniently ignored the Second Partition Treaty and claimed the entire Spanish inheritance.&lt;ref name=troost258/&gt;  Furthermore, Louis XIV alienated William III by recognising [[James Francis Edward Stuart]], the son of the former King James II who had died in 1701, as King of England.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 260&lt;/ref&gt;  The subsequent conflict, known as the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], continued until 1713.

===English succession===
The Spanish inheritance was not the only one which concerned William. His marriage with Mary II had not yielded any children, and he did not seem likely to remarry. Mary's sister, the [[Anne of Great Britain|Princess Anne]], had borne numerous children, all of whom died during childhood. The death of [[Prince William, Duke of Gloucester]], in 1700 left the Princess Anne as the only individual left in the line of succession established by the Bill of Rights.&lt;ref&gt;Troost, 234&lt;/ref&gt;  As the complete exhaustion of the line of succession would have encouraged a restoration of James II's line, Parliament saw fit to pass the [[Act of Settlement 1701]], in which it was provided that the Crown would be inherited by a distant relative, [[Sophia of Hanover|Sophia, Electress of Hanover]], and her Protestant heirs if Princess Anne died without surviving issue, and if William III failed to have surviving issue by any subsequent marriage.&lt;ref name=troost235&gt;Troost, 235&lt;/ref&gt;  (Several Catholics with genealogically senior claims to Sophia were omitted.) The Act extended to England and Ireland, but not to Scotland, whose Estates had not been consulted before the selection of Sophia.&lt;ref name=troost235/&gt;

==Death==
{{Main|Second Stadtholderless Period}}
In 1702, William died of [[pneumonia]], a complication from a broken collarbone following a fall from his horse, Sorrel.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, 251–254&lt;/ref&gt; Because his horse had stumbled into a [[mole (animal)|mole's]] burrow, many Jacobites toasted &quot;the little gentleman in the black velvet waistcoat.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, 255&lt;/ref&gt; Years later, Sir [[Winston Churchill]], in his epic ''[[A History of the English-Speaking Peoples]]'', put it more poetically when he said that the fall &quot;opened the door to a troop of lurking foes&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Churchill, 30–31&lt;/ref&gt; William was buried in [[Westminster Abbey]] alongside his wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.westminster-abbey.org/history-research/monuments-gravestones/royalty/12322|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080106223703/http://www.westminster-abbey.org/history-research/monuments-gravestones/royalty/12322|archivedate=6 January 2008|title=William III|publisher=Westminster Abbey Official site|accessdate=8 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; His sister-in-law Anne became [[Queen regnant]] of England, Scotland and Ireland.

William's death brought an end to the Dutch [[House of Orange-Nassau|House of Orange]], members of which had served as stadtholder of Holland and the majority of the other provinces of the Dutch Republic since the time of [[William the Silent]] (William I). The five provinces of which William III was stadtholder—Holland, Zeeland, Utrecht, Gelderland and Overijssel—all suspended the office after his death. Thus, he was the last [[patrilineal|agnatic]] descendant of William I to be named stadtholder for the majority of the provinces. Under William III's will, [[John William Friso, Prince of Orange|John William Friso]] stood to inherit the Principality of Orange as well as several lordships in the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;Israel, 959–960&lt;/ref&gt; He was an agnatic relative of the Princes of Orange, as well as a descendant of William the Silent through a female line. However, King [[Frederick I of Prussia]] also claimed the Principality as the senior [[Primogeniture|cognatic]] heir, stadtholder [[Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange]] having been his maternal grandfather and William III his first cousin.&lt;ref&gt;Israel, 962, 968&lt;/ref&gt; Under the [[Treaty of Utrecht]], which was agreed to in 1713, [[Frederick William I of Prussia]] (who kept the title as part of his titulary) ceded the Principality of Orange to the King of France, Louis XIV; Friso's son, [[William IV, Prince of Orange|William IV]], shared the title of &quot;Prince of Orange&quot;, which had accumulated high prestige in the Netherlands as well as in the entire Protestant world, with Frederick William after the Treaty of Partition (1732).&lt;ref&gt;Israel, 991–992&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldica.org/topics/royalty/berlin1732.htm|title=Text of the Treaty of Partition|language=French|publisher=Heraldica|accessdate=8 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

William's primary achievement was to contain France when it was in a position to impose its will across much of Europe. His life was largely opposed to the will of [[Louis XIV of France]]. This effort continued after his death during the [[War of the Spanish Succession]]. Another important consequence of William's reign in England involved the ending of a bitter conflict between Crown and Parliament that had lasted since the accession of the first English monarch of the [[House of Stuart]], [[James I of England|James I]], in 1603. The conflict over royal and parliamentary power had led to the [[English Civil War]] during the 1640s and the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688.&lt;ref name=claydon3&gt;Claydon, 3–4&lt;/ref&gt; During William's reign, however, the conflict was settled in Parliament's favour by the [[Bill of Rights 1689]], the [[Triennial Act 1694]] and the [[Act of Settlement 1701]].&lt;ref name=claydon3/&gt;

William endowed the [[College of William and Mary]] (in present day [[Williamsburg, Virginia]]) in 1693.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wm.edu/vitalfacts/seventeenth.php  |title=Historical Chronology, 1618–1699|accessdate=30 July 2008 |publisher=College of William and Mary |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080715225541/http://www.wm.edu/vitalfacts/seventeenth.php |archivedate = 15 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]], the capital of The Bahamas, is named after Fort Nassau, which was renamed in 1695 in his honour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Islanders in the Stream: A History of the Bahamian People |last=Craton |first=Michael |coauthors=Saunders-Smith, Gail |year=1992 |publisher=University of Georgia Press |isbn=0-8203-2122-2 |page=101 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly [[Nassau County, New York]] a county on [[Long Island]], is a namesake.&lt;ref name=nassaucounty&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nassaucountyny.gov/website/EN/facts_stats_maps/history_of_NC.html |title=History of Nassau County |accessdate=30 July 2008 |publisher=Nassau County website}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Long Island]] itself was also known as Nassau during early Dutch rule.&lt;ref name=nassaucounty/&gt; Though many alumni of [[Princeton University]] think that the town of Princeton, N.J.

The modern day [[Orange Institution]] is named after William III, and makes a point of celebrating his victory at the Boyne. New York City was briefly renamed New Orange for him in 1673 after the Dutch recaptured the city, which had been renamed New York by the British in 1665. His name was applied to the [[Fort Amsterdam|fort]] and administrative center for the city on two separate occasions reflecting his different sovereign status—first as Fort Willem Hendrick in 1673, and then as Fort William in 1691 when the English evicted Colonists who had seized the fort and city.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?vid=OCLC03046437&amp;id=Jvy84lE_tHoC&amp;dq=%22Willem+Hendrick%22 &quot;The Dutch Under English Rule&quot;] ''The History of North America'' by Guy Carleton Lee Francis and Francis Newton Thorpe.
