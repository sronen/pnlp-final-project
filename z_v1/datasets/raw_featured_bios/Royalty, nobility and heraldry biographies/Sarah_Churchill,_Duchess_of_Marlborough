Sarah's friendship and influence with Princess Anne was widely known, and leading public figures often turned their attentions to her in the hope that she would influence Anne to comply with requests. As a result, by the time Anne became queen, Sarah’s knowledge of government, and intimacy with the Queen, allowed her to become a powerful friend and a dangerous enemy, the last in the long line of [[House of Stuart|Stuart]] [[favourite]]s.

In an age when marriage was principally for money, not love, Sarah enjoyed an unusually close relationship with her husband, [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough]], whom she married in 1677. Sarah acted as Anne's agent after the latter's father, [[James II of England|James II]], was deposed during the [[Glorious Revolution]]; and she promoted her interests during the rule of James's successors, [[William III of England|William III]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary II]]. When Anne came to the throne after William's death in 1702, the Duke of Marlborough, together with [[Sidney Godolphin, 1st Earl of Godolphin|Sidney Godolphin]], the first [[Earl of Godolphin]], rose to head the government, partly as a result of his wife's friendship with the queen. While the Duke was out of the country commanding troops in the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], Sarah kept him informed of court intrigue, while he sent her requests and political advice which she would then convey to the Queen.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, p. 12, 13 vol 1&lt;/ref&gt; Sarah tirelessly campaigned on behalf of the [[British Whig Party|Whigs]], while also devoting much of her time to building projects such as [[Blenheim Palace]]. She died in 1744 at the age of eighty-four.&lt;ref&gt;Field, p. 453.&lt;/ref&gt;

A strong-willed woman who liked to get her own way, Sarah tried the Queen's patience whenever she disagreed with her on political, court or church appointments. After her final break with Anne in 1711, she was dismissed from the court with her husband, but she returned to favour under the [[House of Hanover|Hanoverians]] after Anne's death. She had famous subsequent disagreements with many important people, including her daughter the [[Henrietta Godolphin, 2nd Duchess of Marlborough|second Duchess of Marlborough]]; the architect of Blenheim Palace, [[John Vanbrugh]]; prime minister [[Robert Walpole]]; [[George II of Great Britain|King George II]]; and his wife, [[Caroline of Ansbach|Queen Caroline]]. The money she inherited from the Marlborough [[Trust law|trust]] left her as one of the richest women in Europe.&lt;ref name=Falkner&gt;Falkner, [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/5405 Churchill , Sarah, duchess of Marlborough (1660–1744)].

== Early life ==
Sarah Jennings was born on 5 June 1660, probably at [[Holywell House, Hertfordshire|Holywell House]], [[St Albans]],

Her uncle ([[Martin Lister]]) was a prominent naturalist. Richard Jennings came into contact with James, [[Duke of York]] (the future [[James II of England|James II]], brother of King [[Charles II of England|Charles II]]) in 1663, during negotiations for the recovery of an estate in Kent ([[The manor of Agney, Kent|Agney Court]]) that had been the property of his mother-in-law, Susan Lister (nee Temple). James's first impressions were favourable, and in 1664 Sarah’s sister, [[Frances Talbot, Countess of Tyrconnel|Frances]], was appointed [[maid of honour]] to the [[Duchess of York]], [[Anne Hyde]].&lt;ref name=Field8&gt;Field, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Frances was forced to give up the post because of her marriage to a Catholic, James did not forget the family, and in 1673 Sarah entered court as maid of honour to James’s second wife, [[Mary of Modena]].&lt;ref name=Field8&gt;Field, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sarah became close to the young [[Anne of Great Britain|Princess Anne]] in about 1675, and the friendship grew stronger as the two grew older. In late 1675, when she was still only fifteen, she and  [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|John Churchill]], began courting after having danced together at parties and balls.&lt;ref&gt;Churchill, pp. 108–109 vol 1&lt;/ref&gt; Churchill, who had previously been a lover of Charles II’s mistress, [[Barbara Palmer, 1st Duchess of Cleveland|Barbara Palmer, Duchess of Cleveland]], had little to offer financially, as his estates were deeply in debt. Sarah had a rival for Churchill in [[Catherine Sedley, Countess of Dorchester|Catherine Sedley]], a wealthy mistress of James II and the choice of Churchill's father, [[Winston Churchill (1620-1688)|Sir Winston Churchill]], who was anxious to restore the family's fortune. John may have hoped to take Sarah as a mistress in place of the Duchess of Cleveland, who had recently departed for [[France]], but surviving letters from Sarah to John show her unwillingness to assume that role.&lt;ref&gt;Field, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Churchill, p. 128 vol 1&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Marriage ===

In 1677, Sarah's brother Ralph died, and she and her sister, [[Frances Talbot, Countess of Tyrconnel|Frances]], became co-heirs of the Jennings estates in Hertfordshire and Kent. John chose Sarah over Catherine Sedley, and they were [[secret marriage|secretly married]] in the winter of 1677.

They were both Protestants in a court that was predominantly Catholic, a belief which would later influence their political allegiances. Although no date was recorded, the marriage was announced only to the Duchess of York, and a small circle of friends, so that Sarah could keep her court position as Maid of Honour.&lt;ref&gt;Field, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

When she became pregnant, her marriage was announced publicly (on 1 October 1678), and Sarah retired from the court to give birth to her first child, Harriet, who [[infant mortality|died in infancy]]. When the Duke of York went into self-imposed exile to [[Scotland]] as a result of the furore surrounding the [[Popish Plot]], John and Sarah accompanied him, and Charles II rewarded John's loyalty by creating him Baron Churchill of [[Eyemouth]] in Scotland, Sarah thus becoming Lady Churchill. The Duke of York returned to [[England]] after the religious tension had eased, and Sarah was appointed a [[Lady of the Bedchamber]] to Anne after the latter's marriage in 1683.

=== Reign of James II (1685–1688)===
The early reign of [[James II of England|James II]] was relatively successful; it was not expected that a Catholic king could assert control in a fiercely Protestant, anti-Catholic country.&lt;ref name=Speck&gt;Speck, [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/14593 James II and VII (1633–1701)]. Retrieved on 8 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; However, when James attempted to reform the national religion, popular discontent against him and his government became widespread. In 1688, a group of politicians known as the [[Immortal Seven]] invited [[William III of England|Prince William of Orange]], husband of James's Protestant daughter [[Mary II of England|Mary]], to invade England and remove James from power, though the plan became public knowledge very quickly. James still retained some influence, and he ordered that both Lady Churchill and Princess Anne be placed under [[house arrest]] at Anne's residence (the [[Cockpit-in-Court|Cockpit]]&lt;ref&gt;The Cockpit was the old Tudor [[Cock fight]]ing area. It was converted into a residence and given to Anne by Charles II, after her marriage to Prince George. It later became John and Sarah's private residence after Anne's accession, before becoming what is now the [[Cabinet Office]] at 70 [[Whitehall]].&lt;/ref&gt;) in the [[Palace of Whitehall]]; both their husbands, though previously loyal to James, had switched their allegiances to William of Orange. Sarah, however, describes in her memoirs how the two easily escaped and fled to [[Nottingham]]:

:{{quote|The Princess went to Bed at the usual time to prevent suspicion. I came to her soon after; and by the backstairs which went down from her closet, her Royal Highness [Princess Anne], my Lady Fitzharding :[one of Sarah's closest friends] and I, with one servant, walked to the coach where we found the [[Bishop of London|Bishop [of London]]], and the [[Charles Sackville, 6th Earl of Dorset|Earl of Dorset]]. They :conducted us that night to the Bishop's house in the city, and the next day to my Lord Dorset's at Copt-Hall. From there we went to the [[George Compton, 4th Earl of Northampton|Earl of Northampton's]], and :thence to Nottingham, where the country gathered about the Princess; nor did she think herself safe till she saw that she was surrounded by the Prince of Orange's friends.&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Hooke, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

After this further disappointment, James fled the country.&lt;ref name=Speck&gt;Speck, ‘[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/14593 James II and VII (1633–1701)]’. Retrieved on 8 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Sarah implied that she had encouraged the escape for the safety of Princess Anne, it is more likely that she was protecting herself and her husband.&lt;ref name=Field&gt;Field, p. 54, 55.&lt;/ref&gt; If James had defeated [[William III of England|Prince William of Orange's]] army, he could have imprisoned and even [[Execution|executed]] Lord and Lady Churchill for [[treason]]. It is not likely that he would have subjected his daughter to such a fate.&lt;ref name=Field&gt;Field, p. 54, 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Unwanted servant: William III and Mary II ===
[[Image:SidneyGodolphinEarlGodolphin.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Sidney Godolphin, 1st Earl of Godolphin]], Sarah's life-long friend and adviser; by Sir [[Godfrey Kneller]], c. 1704–10&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Although the new King and Queen had awarded Sarah’s husband the title [[Duke of Marlborough (title)|Earl of Marlborough]], Sarah and John enjoyed considerably less favour than they had during the reign of James II.&lt;ref name=Hattendorf&gt;Hattendorf, ‘[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/5401 Churchill, John, first duke of Marlborough (1650–1722)]’. Retrieved on 6 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The new Earl of Marlborough had supported the now exiled James; and by this time Sarah’s influence on Anne, and her cultivation of high members of the government to promote Anne’s interests, was widely known. Mary II responded to this by demanding that Anne dismiss Sarah. However, Anne refused. This created a rift between Mary and Anne that never healed.&lt;ref&gt;Field, pp. 69, 70, 80–81, 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other problems also emerged. In 1689, Anne's supporters (including the Marlboroughs and [[Charles Seymour, 6th Duke of Somerset|the Duke of Somerset]]) demanded that she be granted a parliamentary [[Life annuity|annuity]] of £50 000, a sum that would end her dependence on William and Mary.&lt;ref name=Field&gt;Field, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; Sarah was seen as the driving force behind this bill, creating further ill-feeling towards her at court. William responded to the demand by offering the same sum from the [[Privy Purse]], to keep Anne dependent on his generosity. However, Anne, through Sarah, refused, pointing out that a parliamentary grant would be more secure than charity from the Privy Purse.&lt;ref name=Field&gt;Field, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually Anne received the grant from parliament, and felt she owed this to Sarah's efforts.&lt;ref name=Field&gt;Field, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;

Sarah's success as a leader of the opposition only intensified the Queen's animosity towards the Marlboroughs. Although she could not dismiss Sarah from Anne's service, Mary responded by evicting Sarah from her court lodgings at the [[Palace of Whitehall]]. Anne responded by leaving the court as well, and Sarah and she went to stay with their friends [[Charles Seymour, 6th Duke of Somerset|Charles Seymour]], the sixth [[Duke of Somerset]], and [[Elizabeth Seymour, Duchess of Somerset|Elizabeth, the Duchess of Somerset]] at [[Syon House]]. Anne continued to defy the Queen’s demand for Sarah’s dismissal, even though an incriminating document signed by the Earl of Marlborough supporting the recently exiled James II and [[Jacobitism|his supporters]] had been discovered. This document is likely to have been forged by Robert Young, a known forger and disciple of [[Titus Oates]]; Oates was famous for stirring a strongly anti-Catholic atmosphere in England between 1679 and the early 1680s.&lt;ref name=Field&gt;Field, pp. 79–80.&lt;/ref&gt; The Earl was imprisoned in the [[Tower of London]].&lt;ref name=Field&gt;Field, p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; The loneliness Sarah suffered during these events drew her and Anne closer together.&lt;ref name=Field&gt;Field, pp. 79, 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the death of Mary II from [[smallpox]] in 1694, William III restored Anne’s honours, in an effort to increase his popularity with the English, and provided her with apartments at [[St. James's Palace]]. He also restored the Earl of Marlborough to all his offices and honours, and exonerated him from any past accusations. However, fearing Sarah’s powerful influence, William kept Anne out of government affairs, and he did not make her [[regent]] in his absences though she was now his [[heir apparent]].&lt;ref name=Gregg&gt;Gregg, Anne (1665–1714); ''William alone, 1694–1702''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1702, [[William III of England|King William III]] died, and Anne became Queen. Anne immediately offered John Churchill a dukedom, which Sarah initially refused. Sarah was concerned that a dukedom would strain the family's finances; a ducal family at the time was expected to show off its rank through lavish entertainments.&lt;ref&gt;Field, pp. 106–107.&lt;/ref&gt; Anne countered by offering the Marlboroughs a [[pension]] of £5000 a year, for life, from Parliament, as well as an extra £2000 a year from the [[Privy Purse]], and they accepted the Dukedom. Sarah was promptly created [[Mistress of the Robes]] (the highest office in the royal court that could be held by a woman), [[Groom of the Stole]], [[Keeper of the Privy Purse]], and [[Ranger of Windsor Great Park]]. The Duke accepted the [[Order of the Garter]], as well as the office of [[Captain-General]] of the army.&lt;ref&gt;Field, pp. 99 (Captain General and Order of the Garter); 107 (dukedom).&lt;/ref&gt;

During much of Anne’s reign, the Duke of Marlborough was abroad fighting the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], while Sarah remained in England. Despite being the most powerful woman in England besides the Queen, she appeared at court only rarely, preferring to oversee the construction of her new estate, [[Woodstock, Oxfordshire|Woodstock]] [[Woodstock Palace|Manor]] (the site of the later [[Blenheim Palace]]), a gift from Queen Anne after the duke's victory at the [[Battle of Blenheim]].&lt;ref&gt;Field, p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Anne sent her news of political developments in letters and consulted Sarah's advice in most matters.&lt;ref name=Gregg&gt;Gregg, ‘[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/560 Anne (1665–1714)]’. Retrieved 6 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sarah was famous for telling the Queen exactly what she thought, and did not offer her flattery.&lt;ref&gt;Hooke, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Anne and Sarah had invented petnames for themselves during their youths which they continued to use after Anne became queen: ''Mrs Freeman'' (Sarah) and ''Mrs Morley'' (Anne).&lt;ref&gt;Hooke, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Effectively a business manager, Sarah had control over the Queen's position, from her finances to people admitted to the royal presence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Wavering influence===
Anne, however, expected kindness and compassion from her closest friend. Sarah was not forthcoming in this regard and frequently overpowered and dominated Anne. One major political disagreement occurred when Sarah insisted that her son-in-law, [[Charles Spencer, 3rd Earl of Sunderland|Charles Spencer]], the third [[Earl of Sunderland]], be admitted into the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]].  Sarah allied herself more strongly with the Whigs, who supported the Duke of Marlborough in the war; and the Whigs hoped to utilise Sarah's position as royal favourite.&lt;ref&gt;Field, p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; Anne refused to appoint Sunderland: she disliked the radical Whigs, whom she saw as a threat to her [[royal prerogative]].&lt;ref name=Field&gt;Field, pp. 111–112.&lt;/ref&gt; Sarah used her close friendship with the Earl of Godolphin, whom Anne trusted, to eventually secure such appointments, but continued to lobby Anne herself. She sent Whig reading materials to Anne in an attempt to win her over to her own preferred political party.&lt;ref&gt;Field, p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1704, Anne confided to [[Sidney Godolphin, 1st Earl of Godolphin|Lord Godolphin]] that she did not think that she and Sarah could ever be true friends again.

===Clash of personalities===
[[Image:Sarah Churchill and Lady Fitzharding.jpg|thumb|right|The Duchess of Marlborough (right) playing cards with her closest friend, Barbara, Lady Fitzharding, by Sir [[Godfrey Kneller]], c. 1702&lt;ref&gt;Field, p. ix.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Sarah's frankness and indifference for rank, so admired by Anne earlier in their friendship, was now seen to be intrusive. Unlike most women of the time–many of whom did not have influence with their own husbands–Sarah had a powerful intimacy with the two most powerful men in the country, [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|Marlborough]] and [[Sidney Godolphin, 1st Earl of Godolphin|Godolphin]]. Godolphin, though a great friend of Sarah's, had even considered refusing high office after Anne's accession, preferring to live quietly and away from the political side of Sarah, who was bossy, interfering, and presumed to tell him what to do when Marlborough was away.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt; Sarah, although a woman in a man's world of national and international politics, was always ready to give her advice; express her opinions; antagonize with outspoken censure; and insist on having her say on every possible occasion.&lt;ref name=Hibbert312&gt;Hibbert, p. 312&lt;/ref&gt; However, she had a charm and vivaciousness which was admired by many; and she could easily delight those she met with her wit.&lt;ref name=Hibbert312&gt;Hibbert, p. 312&lt;/ref&gt;

Anne's apparent withdrawal of genuine affection occurred for a number of reasons. She was frustrated by Sarah's long absences from Court, and despite numerous letters from Anne to Sarah on this subject, Sarah rarely attended, and wrote her excuses in letters to Anne. There was also a political difference between them: Anne was a [[Tory]] (the party known as the &quot;Church party&quot;, religion being one of Anne's chief concerns), and Sarah was a [[British Whig Party|Whig]] (the party known to support Marlborough's wars). The Queen did not want this difference to come between them; but Sarah, always thinking of her husband, wanted Anne to give more support to the Whigs, which she was not prepared to do.&lt;ref name=Field&gt;Field, pp. 111, 112.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sarah was called to [[Cambridge]] in 1703, where her only surviving son, John, Marquess of Blandford, was taken ill with [[Smallpox]]. The Duke of Marlborough was recalled from the war and was at his bedside when he died on 20 February 1703.&lt;ref name=Hattendorf&gt;Hattendorf, [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/5401 Churchill, John, first duke of Marlborough (1650–1722)]. Retrieved on 8 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Sarah was heartbroken over the loss of her son and became reclusive for a period, expressing her grief by closing herself off from Anne and either not answering her letters or doing so in a cold and formal manner.&lt;ref&gt;Field, pp. 122–123.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Sarah did not allow Anne to shut her out when Anne suffered bereavement. After the death of Anne's husband, [[Prince George of Denmark]] in 1708, Sarah arrived uninvited at [[Kensington Palace]] to find Anne with the prince's body. She pressed the heartbroken Queen to move from Kensington to [[St James's Palace]] in [[London]], which Anne bluntly refused, and instead commanded Sarah to call [[Abigail Masham, Baroness Masham|Abigail Masham]] to attend her. Aware that Abigail was gaining more influence with Anne, Sarah disobeyed her, and instead scolded her for grieving over Prince George's death. Although Anne eventually submitted and allowed herself to be taken to St James's Palace, Sarah's insensitivity greatly offended her and added to the already significant strain on the relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Field, pp. 218, 219.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sarah had previously introduced her impoverished cousin, then known as [[Abigail Masham, Baroness Masham|Abigail Hill]], to court, with the intention of finding a role for her. Abigail, the eldest daughter of Sarah's aunt, Elizabeth Hill (Jennings), was working as a servant to [[Sir John Rivers]] of Kent. Sarah gave her employment within her own household at [[St Albans]], and after a tenure of satisfactory service, Abigail was made a [[Lady of the Bedchamber]] to Queen Anne in 1704. Sarah later claimed in her memoirs that she had raised Abigail &quot;in all regards as a sister&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Field, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

Abigail was also the [[second cousin]] of the [[Tory]] leader, [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Mortimer|Robert Harley]], later first [[Earl of Oxford|Earl of Oxford and Mortimer]]. Flattering, subtle and retiring, Abigail was the complete opposite of Sarah, who was dominating, blunt and scathing.&lt;ref name=Falkner/&gt; During Sarah’s frequent absences from court, Abigail and Anne grew close; Abigail was not only happy to give the Queen the kindness and compassion that Anne had longed for from Sarah, but she also never pressured the Queen about politics; Anne responded with pathos to her flattery and charm.&lt;ref&gt;Gregg, ''Marlborough in Exile 1712–14'', p. 234.&lt;/ref&gt; She was present at Abigail’s [[secret marriage|secret wedding]] to [[Samuel Masham, 1st Baron Masham|Samuel Masham]], groom of the bedchamber to [[Prince George of Denmark|Prince George]], in 1707, without Sarah’s knowledge.&lt;ref name=Field&gt;Field, p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sarah was completely oblivious to any friendship between Anne and Abigail, and was therefore surprised when she discovered that Abigail frequently saw the Queen in private.&lt;ref name=Field&gt;Field, p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt; Sarah found out about Abigail's marriage several months after it had occurred, and immediately went to see Anne – with the intention of informing her of the event. It was at this interview that Anne let slip that she had begged Abigail to tell Sarah of the marriage; Sarah became suspicious about what had really happened.&lt;ref name=Field&gt;Field, p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt; After questioning servants and [[Royal Household]] for a week about Abigail's marriage, Sarah discovered that Anne had been present and had given Abigail a [[dowry]] of £2000 from the [[Privy Purse]]. This proved Anne's duplicity to Sarah: as [[Keeper of the Privy Purse]], Sarah had been unaware of any such payment.&lt;ref&gt;Bucholz, p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1708, [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|the Duke of Marlborough]], with his ally [[Prince Eugene of Savoy]], won a great victory at the [[Battle of Oudenarde]]. On the way to the [[thanksgiving service]] at [[St Paul's Cathedral]], Sarah engaged in a furious argument with Anne about the jewels Anne wore to the service, and showed her a letter from the Duke of Marlborough which expressed hope that the Queen would make good political use of the victory. The implication that she should publicly express her support for the Whigs offended her; and at the service, Sarah told the Queen to &quot;be quiet&quot; after Anne continued the argument, thus offending the Queen still further.&lt;ref&gt;Field, p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt; Anne wrote to Marlborough encouraging him not to let her rift with Sarah become public knowledge; but he could not prevent his wife's indiscretion. Sarah continued vehemently supporting the Whigs in writing and speaking to Anne, with the support of Godolphin and the other Whig ministers. The news of the public's support for the Whigs reached Marlborough in letters from Sarah and Godolphin, which influenced his political advice to the Queen. Anne, already in ill health, felt used and harassed and was desperate for escape.&lt;ref name=Falkner/&gt; She found refuge in the gentle and quiet comfort of Abigail Masham.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Frances. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/18261 Masham, Abigail, Lady Masham (1670?–1734)] Retrieved 8 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Anne had explained before that she did not wish the public to know that her relationship with Sarah was failing, because any sign that Sarah was out of favour would have a damaging impact on the duke of Marlborough's authority as [[Captain-General]]. Sarah was kept in all of her offices–purely for the sake of her husband's position as [[Captain-General]] of the army–and the tension between the two women lingered on until early in 1711.&lt;ref&gt;Field, p. 229, 251–5, 265, 344.&lt;/ref&gt; This year was to see the end of their relationship for good.

Sarah had always been jealous of Anne's affection for [[Abigail Masham, Baroness Masham|Abigail Masham]]. Together with the Duke of Marlborough and most of the Whig party, she had tried to force Anne to dismiss her. All these attempts failed, even when Anne was threatened with an official parliamentary demand from the Whigs, who were suspicious of Abigail's Tory influence with Anne, for Abigail's dismissal.&lt;ref&gt;Field, p. 238.&lt;/ref&gt; The whole scenario echoed Anne's refusal to give up Sarah during the reign of William and Mary; but the threat of Parliamentary interference exceeded anything tried against Anne in the 1690s.&lt;ref name=Gregg&gt;Gregg, [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/560 Anne (1665–1714)]. Retrieved 6 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Anne was ultimately triumphant; she conducted interviews with high ranking politicians of both political parties and begged them &quot;with tears in her eyes&quot; to oppose the motion.&lt;ref name=Gregg/&gt;

The passion she showed for Abigail, and the stubborn refusal to dismiss her, angered Sarah to the point that she implied that a [[lesbian]] affair was taking place between the two women.&lt;ref&gt;Field, 191–192.&lt;/ref&gt; During the mourning period for Anne's husband, Sarah was the only one who refused to wear suitable [[mourning clothes]]. This gave the impression that she did not consider Anne's grief over his death to be genuine.&lt;ref&gt;Field, pp. 219–220.&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, as a result of mass support for peace in the [[War of the Spanish Succession]],&lt;ref&gt;See [[Treaty of Utrecht]].&lt;/ref&gt; Anne decided she no longer needed the Duke of Marlborough and took the opportunity to dismiss him on trumped-up charges of [[embezzlement]].&lt;ref&gt;Field, pp. 308, 311–14, 317, 322–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Final dismissal===
[[Image:Kensington.Palace.by.Kip.1724.jpg|right|thumb|350px|[[Kensington Palace]], where Sarah and Anne met for the last time, as it looked at the time of Queen Anne]]
Sarah's last attempt to re-establish her friendship with Anne came in 1710, when they had their final meeting. An account written by  Sarah shortly afterwards shows that she pleaded to be given an explanation of why their friendship was at an end, but Anne was unmoved. After hearing this, the Duke of Marlborough, realising that Anne intended to dismiss them, begged her to keep them in their offices for nine months, until the campaign was over, so that they could retire honourably. However, Anne told Marlborough that &quot;for her [Anne's] honour&quot; Sarah was to resign immediately and return her gold key – the symbol of her authority within the Royal household – within two days.&lt;ref name=Field287&gt;Field, p. 287.&lt;/ref&gt; Years of trying the Queen's patience had finally resulted in her dismissal. When told the news, Sarah, in a fit of pride, told Marlborough to return the key to the Queen immediately.&lt;ref name=Field287&gt;Field, p. 287.&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1711, Sarah was stripped of the offices of [[Mistress of the Robes]] and [[Groom of the Stole]] and replaced by [[Elizabeth Seymour, Duchess of Somerset]]. Abigail was made [[Keeper of the Privy Purse]]. This broke a promise Anne had made to distribute these court offices to Sarah's children.&lt;ref&gt;Add MS 61422 ''An Account of a Conversation with Her Majesty when it appear'd plainly that she did not intend to keep her promise to the Duchess of Marlborough in letting her resign her employments to her children''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Marlboroughs also lost state funding for [[Blenheim Palace]], and the building came to a halt for the first time since it was begun in 1705. Now in disgrace, they left England and travelled Europe. As a result of his success in the War of the Spanish Succession, the Duke of Marlborough was a favourite among the German courts and with the Holy Roman Empire, and the family was received in those places with full honours.

Sarah, however, did not like being away from England, and often complained that they were received with full honours in Europe, but were in disgrace at home. Sarah found life travelling the royal courts difficult, remarking that they were full of dull company.&lt;ref&gt;Field, p. 327.&lt;/ref&gt; She took the waters at [[Aix-la-Chapelle]] in [[Germany]] on account of her ill health, corresponded with those in England who could supply her with political gossip, and indulged in her fascination with [[Catholicism]].&lt;ref&gt;Field, p. 328.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sarah and the Queen never made up their differences, although one eyewitness claimed to have heard Anne asking whether the Marlboroughs had reached the shore, leading to rumours that she had called them home herself.&lt;ref&gt;Gregg, ''Marlborough in Exile 1712–14'', p. 615.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anne of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] died on 1 August 1714 at [[Kensington Palace]]; the Protestant Whig Privy Councillors had insisted on their right to be present, preventing [[Henry St. John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke|Henry St. John]], the first [[Viscount Bolingbroke]] from declaring for the Pretender, [[James Francis Edward Stuart]].

Retrieved on 4 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Sarah approved of his choice of Whig ministers.&lt;ref&gt;Field, p.341.&lt;/ref&gt;

King George also had a personal friendship with the Marlboroughs; the [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|Duke of Marlborough]] had fought with him in the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], and John and Sarah made frequent visits to the [[Hanoverian court]] during their effective exile from England.&lt;ref name=Hattendorf&gt;Hattendorf, [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/5401 Churchill, John, first duke of Marlborough (1650–1722)].

[[Image:John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough (1650-1722).jpg|right|thumb|200px|The Duke of Marlborough, painted after his stroke c. 1719/20 ([[Enoch Seeman]])]]
Sarah was relieved to move back to England. The Duke of Marlborough became one of the king's close advisers, and Sarah moved back into [[Marlborough House]], where she flaunted her eldest granddaughter, [[Lady Henrietta Godolphin]], in the hope of [[arranged marriage|finding a suitable marriage partner]]. Henrietta eventually married [[Thomas Pelham-Holles, 1st Duke of Newcastle-upon-Tyne|Thomas Pelham-Holles]], first [[Duke of Newcastle|Duke of Newcastle-upon-Tyne]], in April 1717, and the rest of Sarah's grandchildren went on to make successful marriages.

However, Sarah's concern for her grandchildren briefly came to a halt when her husband had two strokes in 1716, the second of which left him speechless. Sarah spent much of her time with him, accompanying him to [[Royal Tunbridge Wells|Tunbridge Wells]] and [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], and he recovered shortly afterwards. Even after his recovery, Sarah opened his correspondence and filtered the letters Marlborough received, lest their contents precipitate another stroke.&lt;ref name=Falkner/&gt;

Sarah's relationship with her children was strained. Although she had a good relationship with her daughter, [[Anne Spencer, Countess of Sunderland (1683-1716)|Anne Spencer]], she became estranged from her daughters Henrietta, Elizabeth and Mary.&lt;ref name=&quot;Field, p. 382.&quot;&gt;Field, p. 382.&lt;/ref&gt; After Elizabeth's death from smallpox in 1714, Sarah wrote to Robert Jennings (a friend and distant relation): &quot;All the arguments I can possibly think of can't hinder me from lamenting as long as I live of what I had so much reason to love.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Field, p. 336.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly heartbroken when her favourite daughter [[Anne Spencer, Countess of Sunderland (1683-1716)|Anne Spencer]] died in 1716, Sarah kept her favourite cup, a lock of her hair, and adopted the Sunderlands' youngest child, [[Diana Spencer (1710-1735)|Lady Diana]], who would later become her favourite granddaughter.&lt;ref&gt;Field, p. 355.&lt;/ref&gt; Sarah's youngest daughter [[Mary Montagu, Duchess of Montagu|Mary, Duchess of Montagu]], outlived her mother; the two never reconciled.&lt;ref&gt;Field, p. 381-382.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Later years ==
[[Image:Marlborough House - superior version.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Marlborough House]] in its original form: Sarah's favourite home in [[Pall Mall, London|Pall Mall]], [[London]]]]
[[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|John Churchill]] died at Windsor in 1722, and Sarah arranged a large funeral for him.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, pp. 318, 319.&lt;/ref&gt; Their daughter, [[Henrietta Godolphin, 2nd Duchess of Marlborough|Henrietta]], became duchess in her own right. Sarah became one of the trustees of the Marlborough estate, and she used her business sense to distribute the family fortune, including the income for her daughter Henrietta.&lt;ref&gt;Will of John, Duke of Marlborough, National Archives at Kew, Catalogue Ref. PROB 11/583.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sarah’s personal income was now considerable, and she used the money to invest in land; she believed this would protect her from [[currency devaluation]]. The [[Dowager|dowager duchess]] purchased [[Wimbledon, London|Wimbledon]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Hibbert334&quot;/&gt; in 1723, and rebuilt the [[manor house]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hibbert336&quot;/&gt; Her wealth was so considerable that Sarah hoped to marry her granddaughter, [[Diana Spencer (1710-1735)|Lady Diana Spencer]], to [[Frederick, Prince of Wales]], for which she would pay a massive [[dowry]] of £100,000.&lt;ref name=Hibbert331&gt;Hibbert, p. 331.&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Robert Walpole]], the [[First Lord of the Treasury]] (effectively the same as today's [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]]) vetoed the plan.&lt;ref name=Hibbert331&gt;Hibbert, p. 331.&lt;/ref&gt; Walpole, although a Whig, had alienated Sarah by supporting peace in Europe; she was also suspicious of his financial probity;&lt;ref&gt;Field, p. 376.&lt;/ref&gt; and Walpole, in turn, mistrusted Sarah. Despite this, good relations with the royal family continued, and Sarah was occasionally invited to court by [[Caroline of Ansbach|Queen Caroline]], who attempted to cultivate her friendship.&lt;ref name=Falkner/&gt;

The Duchess of Marlborough was a capable business manager, unusual in a period when women were excluded from most things outside the management of their household. Her friend [[Arthur Maynwaring]] wrote that she was more capable of business than any man.&lt;ref name=Hibbert336&gt;Hibbert, p. 336.&lt;/ref&gt; Although she never came to like [[Blenheim Palace]] – describing it as &quot;that great heap of stones&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, p. 337.&lt;/ref&gt; – she became more enthusiastic about its construction and wrote to the [[Duke of Somerset]] about the new waterworks: &quot;I believe it will be beautiful. The Canal and Bason (which is already don[e]) look very fine. There is to be a lake &amp; a cascade&amp;nbsp;... which I think will bee[''sic''] a great addition to the place&quot;.&lt;ref name=Hibbert342&gt;Hibbert, p. 342.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Blenheim Palace IMG 3676.JPG|thumb|left|230px|The Duke and Duchess of Marlborough's tomb in the chapel at [[Blenheim Palace]], designed by [[William Kent]]]]
The Duchess of Marlborough fought against anything she thought was undue extravagance. She wrote to the Duke of Somerset, &quot;I have reduced the stables to one third of what was intended by Sir John [Vanbrugh] yet I have room for {{sic|fourty}} fine horses.&quot;&lt;ref name=Hibbert342&gt;Hibbert, p. 342.&lt;/ref&gt; She allowed only two features of extravagance: the Marlboroughs' tomb in the Blenheim chapel, designed by [[William Kent]];&lt;ref&gt;Reid, p. 445.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Doric Column]] of Victory in the park designed by [[Henry Herbert, 9th Earl of Pembroke]], and finished by Roger Morris. The latter rose to a height of {{convert|130|ft|m}}, complete with fine embellishments.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, p. 340.&lt;/ref&gt; The Duchess carefully monitored the construction of all Blenheim's features, and she fell out with anyone who did not do exactly what she wanted.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, p. 339.&lt;/ref&gt;

These detailed inspections extended to her smaller land purchases. After buying the Wimbledon estate (which she described as &quot;upon clay, an ill sod, very damp and...an unhealthy place&quot;),&lt;ref&gt;Rowse, ''The Early Churchills'', p. 394&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Holdenby House]] near [[Althorp]], she kept detailed accounts of her finances and expenditure, as well as a sharp look-out for any dishonesty in her agents.&lt;ref name=Hibbert336&gt;Hibbert, p. 336.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:SarahMarlborough1737.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Autograph letter from the Duchess of Marlborough to [[Charles Fane, 1st Viscount Fane|Lady Fane]], Wimbledon, 15 August 1737. It is a good example of Sarah's typically jagged cursive handwriting.]]
Her friendship with Queen Caroline ended when Sarah refused the Queen access through her [[Wimbledon, London|Wimbledon]] estate,&lt;ref&gt;Field, p. 398.&lt;/ref&gt; which resulted in the loss of her £500 income as [[Ranger of Windsor Great Park]].&lt;ref name=Hibbert334&gt;Hibbert, p. 334.&lt;/ref&gt; Sarah was also rude to [[George II of Great Britain|King George II]]–making it clear that he was &quot;too much of a German&quot;&lt;ref name=Hibbert334&gt;Hibbert, p. 334.&lt;/ref&gt;–which further alienated her from the court. Her ''persona non grata'' status at the Walpole-controlled court prevented her from suppressing the rise of the [[Tory|Tories]]; Walpole's taxes and peace with Spain were deeply unpopular with ruling class English society, and the Tories were gaining much more support as a result.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Stephen. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/28601 Walpole, Robert, first earl of Orford (1676–1745)]. Retrieved 4 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sarah never lost her good looks and, despite failing popularity, received many offers of marriage after the death of her husband, including one from her old enemy, [[Charles Seymour, 6th Duke of Somerset|Charles Seymour]], the sixth [[Duke of Somerset]].&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, pp. 320, 321.&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, she decided against remarriage, preferring to keep her independence.

Sarah continued to appeal against court decisions which ruled that funding for Blenheim should come from the Marlboroughs' personal estate, and not the government. This made her unpopular; she could easily afford the payments herself. She was surprised by the grief she felt following the death of her [[Henrietta Godolphin, 2nd Duchess of Marlborough|eldest daughter]] in 1733, but continued to quarrel with her youngest daughter [[Mary Montagu, Duchess of Montagu|Mary, Duchess of Montagu]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Field, p. 382.&quot;/&gt; Sarah lived to see her enemy [[Robert Walpole]] fall in 1742, and in the same year attempted to improve her reputation by approving a biographical publication titled ''An Account of the Dowager Duchess of Marlborough from her first coming to Court to the year 1710''. She died of old age, at the age of eighty-four, on 18 October 1744, at [[Marlborough House]]; she was buried at [[Blenheim Palace|Blenheim]]. Her husband’s body was exhumed from [[Westminster Abbey]] and buried beside her.&lt;ref name=&quot;Field, p. 454.&quot;&gt;Field, p. 454.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Assessment ==
[[Image:Sarah Churchill Duchess.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Duchess of Marlborough, attributed to Sir Godfrey Kneller]]
Although the Duchess of Marlborough’s downfall is chiefly attributed to her selfish and self-serving relationship with [[Anne of Great Britain|Queen Anne]], she was a vibrant and intelligent woman, who loyally promoted Anne's interests when she was princess.&lt;ref&gt;Field, pp. 52–60.&lt;/ref&gt; Anne was a dull conversationalist and Sarah did not find her company stimulating. Sarah believed that she had a right to enforce her political advice, whether Anne personally liked it or not, and became angry if she stubbornly refused to take it.&lt;ref&gt;Field, p. 281.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Abigail Masham, Baroness Masham|Abigail Masham]] also played a key role in Sarah’s downfall. Modest and retiring, she actively promoted the [[Tory]] policies of her cousin [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford|Robert Harley]]. Despite owing her position at court to the Duchess of Marlborough, Abigail soon became Sarah’s enemy, and supplanted her in Anne’s affections.&lt;ref&gt;Field, pp. 177, 180, 181, 183.&lt;/ref&gt;

During her lifetime, Sarah drafted twenty-six [[Will (law)|wills]], the last of which was only written a few months before her death; and had purchased twenty-seven [[Landed estate|estates]]. With a wealth of over £4 million in land; £17,000 in rent rolls; and a further £12,500 in annuities, she made financial bequests to rising [[British Whig Party|Whig]] ministers such as [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham|William Pitt]], later the first [[Earl of Chatham]], and [[Philip Stanhope, 4th Earl of Chesterfield|Philip Stanhope]], the fourth [[Earl of Chesterfield]]. Although she left little to the poor and even less to charity, she left her servants annuities far above the average for the time: her favourite, Grace Ridley, received £16,000, equivalent to approximately £1.32&amp;nbsp;million in today's money.&lt;ref name=Field457&gt;Field, p. 457&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the money left after Sarah's numerous bequests was inherited by her grandson, [[John Spencer (British politician)|John Spencer]], with the condition that he could not accept a political office under the government. He also inherited the remainder of Sarah's numerous estates, including [[Wimbledon Park|Wimbledon]]. [[Marlborough House]] remained empty for fourteen years, with the exception of James Stephens, one of her executors, before it became the property of the Dukes of Marlborough upon Stephens's death. In 1817, it became a royal residence, and passed through members of the [[British Royal Family|British royal family]] until it became the [[Commonwealth Secretariat]] in 1959. Wimbledon Park House succumbed to fire in 1785; and [[Holywell House, Hertfordshire|Holywell House]], Sarah's birthplace in [[St Albans]], was demolished in 1827. Today, much of St Albans is named after the Marlboroughs as a result of Sarah's influence.&lt;ref name=Field457&gt;Field, p. 457&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Blenheim Palace IMG 3657.JPG|right|thumb|200px|The main front of Blenheim Palace. Sarah was heavily involved in the palace's construction.]]
Sarah died, in the words of [[Tobias Smollett]], &quot;immensely rich and very little regretted, either by her own family or the world in general&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Field, p. 454.&quot;/&gt; but her efforts to continue the Marlborough legacy cannot be ignored. Because of her influence, Sarah managed to marry off members of her family to England’s greatest aristocratic dynasties. Among the more famous descendants of the Marlboroughs are [[Winston Churchill]]&lt;ref&gt;Winston Churchill is descended from Sarah's daughter Anne; Anne's son, the 5th Earl of Sunderland, became 3rd Duke of Marlborough; subsequent dukes descend from him. Winston was the son of the seventh duke's son, [[Lord Randolph Churchill]].&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Diana, Princess of Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;Diana, Princess of Wales was descended from Sarah's daughter Anne; Anne's son, [[John Spencer (British politician)|John]] is the ancestor of the Earls Spencer. Diana was the daughter of the eighth Earl Spencer.&lt;/ref&gt;
