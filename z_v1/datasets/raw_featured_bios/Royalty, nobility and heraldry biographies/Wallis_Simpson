'''Wallis Simpson''', later the '''Duchess of Windsor''' (born '''Bessie Wallis Warfield'''; 19 June 1896&lt;ref name=&quot;birth&quot;/&gt; – 24 April 1986), was an American [[socialite]] whose third husband, [[Edward VIII |Prince Edward, Duke of Windsor]], formerly King Edward VIII of the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[Dominion]]s, [[Edward VIII abdication crisis|abdicated his throne]] to marry her.

Wallis's father died shortly after her birth, and she and her widowed mother were partly supported by their wealthier relatives. Her first marriage, to [[United States Navy|U.S. naval]] officer [[Earl Winfield Spencer, Jr.|Win Spencer]], was punctuated with periods of separation and eventually ended in divorce. In 1934, during her second marriage, to [[Ernest Aldrich Simpson|Ernest Simpson]], she allegedly became the mistress of Edward, [[Prince of Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;Edward sued one author, Geoffrey Dennis, who claimed that Wallis and Edward were lovers before their marriage, and won (King, p. 119).&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, after Edward's accession as [[British monarch|King]], Wallis divorced her second husband and Edward proposed to her.

The King's desire to marry a woman with two living ex-husbands threatened to cause a [[constitutional crisis]] in the United Kingdom and the Dominions, and ultimately led to the King's [[Edward VIII abdication crisis|abdication]] in December 1936 to marry &quot;the woman I love&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Duke of Windsor, p. 413&lt;/ref&gt; After the abdication, the former king was created [[Duke of Windsor]] by his brother [[George VI of the United Kingdom|George VI]]. Edward married Wallis six months later, after which she was formally known as the Duchess of Windsor, without the [[Style (manner of address)|style]] &quot;Her Royal Highness&quot;.

Before, during and after [[World War II]], the Duke and Duchess of Windsor were suspected by many in government and society of being [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] sympathisers. In the 1950s and 1960s, she and the Duke shuttled between Europe and the United States, living a life of leisure as society celebrities. After the Duke's death in 1972, the Duchess lived in seclusion and was rarely seen in public. Her private life has been a source of much speculation, and she remains a controversial figure in British history.

==Early life==
[[File:Wallis Warfield circa 1915.jpg|left|thumb|150px|Wallis Warfield in about 1915 when she lived in Baltimore]]
An only child, Bessie Wallis (sometimes written &quot;Bessiewallis&quot;) Warfield was born in Square Cottage at Monterey Inn, a hotel directly across the road from the [[Monterey Country Club]], in [[Blue Ridge Summit, Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref name=&quot;weir&quot;&gt;Weir, p. 328&lt;/ref&gt; A summer resort close to the Maryland–Pennsylvania border, Blue Ridge Summit was popular with Baltimoreans escaping the season's heat, and Monterey Inn, which had a central building as well as individual wooden cottages, was the town's largest hotel.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Baltimore in Her Centennial Year&quot;, ''[[Frank Leslie's Popular Monthly]]'', Volume 43 (Frank Leslie Publishing House, 1897), p. 702&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blue Ridge Summit referred to as &quot;a fashionable summer resort&amp;nbsp;... then greatly patronized by Baltimoreans&quot; in Francis F. Bierne (1984), ''The Amiable Baltimoreans'', Johns Hopkins University Press, p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; Her father was Teackle Wallis Warfield, fifth and youngest son of Henry Mactier Warfield, a flour merchant described as &quot;one of the best known and personally one of the most popular citizens of Baltimore&quot; who ran for mayor in 1875.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=David H.|last=Carroll|authorlink=|title=Men of Mark in Maryland, Volume 3 |publisher=B. F. Johnson Inc.|year=1911|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother was Alice Montague, a daughter of insurance salesman William Montague. Wallis was named in honour of her father and her mother's elder sister, Bessie (Mrs D. Buchanan Merryman), and was called Bessie Wallis until at some time during her youth the name Bessie was dropped.&lt;ref&gt;King, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

The dates of her parents' marriage and her birth are unclear.&lt;ref name=&quot;birth&quot;&gt;On a 1924 passenger manifest for the [[SS France (1910)|SS ''France'']], accessible on ellisisland.org, her birthdate is given as 19 February 1892, though her age was listed as 28. According to 1900 census returns quoted by author [[Charles Higham (biographer)|Charles Higham]], she was born in June 1895, before her parents' marriage (Higham, p. 4). Author [[Greg King (author)|Greg King]], noted that, though Higham's &quot;scandalous assertion of illegitimacy enlivens the telling of the Duchess's life&quot;, &quot;the evidence to support it is slim indeed&quot;, and that it &quot;strains credulity&quot; (King, p. 11).&lt;/ref&gt; Neither event appears to have been registered, but the dates are usually given as 19 November 1895 and 19 June 1896, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Higham, p. 4; King, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; Wallis herself claimed her parents were married in June 1895.&lt;ref&gt;Duchess of Windsor, p. 17; Sebba, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Her father died of [[tuberculosis]] on 15 November 1896.&lt;ref&gt;Tombstone in [[Green Mount Cemetery]], Baltimore; King p. 13; Sebba, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; For her first few years, she and her mother were dependent upon the charity of her father's wealthy bachelor brother Solomon Davies Warfield, president of the Continental Trust Company. Initially, they lived with him at the four-story row house, 34 East Preston Street, that he shared with his mother.&lt;ref&gt;Carroll, vol. 3, pp. 24–43; Higham, p. 5; King, pp. 14–15; Duchess of Windsor, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1901, Wallis's aunt Bessie Merryman was widowed, and the following year Alice and Wallis moved into her four-bedroom house at 9 West Chase Street, Baltimore, where they lived for at least a year until they settled in an apartment, and then a house, of their own. In 1908, Wallis's mother married her second husband, John Freeman Rasin, son of a prominent Democratic party boss.&lt;ref&gt;King, p. 24; Vickers, p. 252&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 April 1910, Wallis was confirmed at Christ Episcopal Church, Baltimore, and between 1912 and 1914 her uncle Warfield paid for her to attend [[Oldfields School]], the most expensive girls' school in Maryland.&lt;ref&gt;Higham, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; There she made friends with heiress Renée du Pont, a daughter of Senator [[T. Coleman du Pont]], of the [[du Pont family]], and Mary Kirk, whose family founded [[Stieff Silver|Kirk Silverware]].&lt;ref&gt;Higham, pp. 12–13; King, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; A fellow pupil at one of Wallis's schools recalled, &quot;She was bright, brighter than all of us. She made up her mind to go to the head of the class, and she ''did''.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Higham, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; Wallis was always immaculately dressed and pushed herself hard to do well.&lt;ref&gt;Higham, p. 8; King, pp. 21–22&lt;/ref&gt;

==First marriage==
In April 1916, Wallis met [[Earl Winfield Spencer, Jr.]], a [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] aviator, at [[Pensacola, Florida]], while visiting her cousin Corinne Mustin.&lt;ref&gt;Higham, p. 18; King, p. 38; Sebba, pp. 20–21; Vickers, p. 257; Duchess of Windsor, pp. 59–60&lt;/ref&gt; It was at this time that Wallis witnessed two airplane crashes about two weeks apart, resulting in a life-long fear of flying.&lt;ref&gt;Higham, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 November 1916, the couple married at Christ Episcopal Church in Baltimore which had been Wallis's parish. Win, as her husband was known, was an alcoholic. He drank even before flying and once crashed into the sea, but escaped almost unharmed.&lt;ref&gt;Higham, pp. 23–24; Duchess of Windsor, pp. 76–77&lt;/ref&gt; After the United States entered [[World War I]] in 1917, Spencer was posted to [[San Diego]] as the first commanding officer of a training base in [[Coronado, California|Coronado]], known as [[Naval Air Station North Island]]. They remained there until 1921.&lt;ref&gt;Higham, pp. 26–28; King, pp. 47–52; Vickers, pp. 258, 261; Duchess of Windsor, pp. 79–85&lt;/ref&gt; In 1920, Edward, the Prince of Wales, visited San Diego, but he and Wallis did not meet.&lt;ref&gt;Higham, p. 29; King, pp. 51–52; Sebba, p. 36; Vickers, p. 260; Duchess of Windsor, p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, Spencer left his wife for a period of four months, but in the spring of 1921 they were reunited in [[Washington, D.C.]], where Spencer had been posted. They soon separated again, and in 1922, when Spencer was posted to the [[Far East]] as commander of the {{USS|Pampanga|PG-39|2}}, Wallis remained behind, continuing an affair with an Argentine diplomat, Felipe de Espil.&lt;ref name=&quot;dnb&quot;&gt;[[Philip Ziegler|Ziegler, Philip]] (2004) [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/38277 &quot;Windsor, (Bessie) Wallis, duchess of Windsor (1896–1986)&quot;], ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', [[Oxford University Press]], {{doi|10.1093/ref:odnb/38277}}, retrieved 2 May 2010 (subscription required)&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1924, she visited Paris with her recently widowed cousin Corinne Mustin,&lt;ref&gt;Bloch, ''The Duchess of Windsor'', p. 22; King, p. 57; Sebba, pp. 41–43; Duchess of Windsor, pp. 100–101&lt;/ref&gt; before sailing to the Far East aboard a troop carrier, {{USS|Chaumont|AP-5}}. The Spencers were briefly reunited until she fell ill, after which she returned to [[Hong Kong]].&lt;ref&gt;Higham, p. 38; King, p. 60; Duchess of Windsor, pp. 104–106&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:USS Chaumont AP-5 off Shanghai 1937.jpg|thumb|right|Wallis travelled to China on the {{USS|Chaumont|AP-5}} in 1924.]]
An [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Italian]] diplomat remembered Wallis from her time in [[Warlord era]] China: &quot;Her conversation was brilliant and she had the habit of bringing up the right subject of conversation with anyone she came in contact with and entertaining them on that subject.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Higham, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; According to Hui-lan Koo, the second wife of Chinese diplomat and politician [[Wellington Koo]], the only Mandarin phrase that Wallis learned during her sojourn in Asia was &quot;Boy, pass me the champagne&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Koo|first=Madame Wellington|title=Hui-Lan Koo: An Autobiography as told to Mary van Rensselaer Thayer|location=New York|publisher=Dial Press|year=1943}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Catherine|last=Maher|title=Madame Wellington Koo's Life Story|journal=[[The New York Times]]|date=31 October 1943|page=BR7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wallis toured China, and stayed with Katherine and Herman Rogers, who were to remain long-term friends, while in [[Beijing]].&lt;ref&gt;Higham, p. 47; King, pp. 62–64; Sebba, pp. 45–53; Vickers, p. 263; Duchess of Windsor, pp. 112–113&lt;/ref&gt; According to the wife of one of Win's fellow officers, Mrs [[Milton E. Miles]], in Beijing Wallis met Count [[Galeazzo Ciano]], later [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini's]] son-in-law and [[Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs|Foreign Minister]], had an affair with him, and became pregnant, leading to a botched abortion that left her unable to conceive.&lt;ref&gt;Higham, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; The rumour was later widespread but never substantiated and Ciano's wife, [[Edda Mussolini]], denied it.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Moseley, Ray|year=1999|title=Mussolini's Shadow: The Double Life of Count Galeazzo Ciano|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|isbn=0-300-07917-6|pages=9–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wallis spent over a year in China. By September 1925, she and her husband were back in the United States, though living apart.&lt;ref&gt;Higham, pp. 50–51; King, p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; Their divorce was finalised on 10 December 1927.&lt;ref&gt;Sebba, p. 60; Weir, p. 328&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second marriage==
By the time her marriage to Spencer was dissolved, Wallis had already become involved with [[Ernest Aldrich Simpson]], an Anglo-American shipping executive and former officer in the [[Coldstream Guards]].&lt;ref&gt;Higham, pp. 53–54; King, pp. 68–70; Sebba, pp. 62–64; Vickers, pp. 267–269; Duchess of Windsor, pp. 125, 131&lt;/ref&gt; He divorced his first wife, Dorothea (by whom he had a daughter, Audrey), to marry Wallis on 21 July 1928 at the [[Register Office]] in [[Chelsea, London]].&lt;ref&gt;Sebba, pp. 62–67; Weir, p. 328&lt;/ref&gt; Wallis had telegraphed her acceptance of his proposal from [[Cannes]] where she was staying with her friends, Mr and Mrs Rogers.&lt;ref&gt;Higham, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt;

The Simpsons temporarily set up home in a furnished house with four servants in [[Mayfair]].&lt;ref&gt;Higham, p. 64; Duchess of Windsor, p. 140&lt;/ref&gt; In 1929, Wallis sailed back to the United States to visit her sick mother, who had married legal clerk Charles Gordon Allen after the death of Rasin. During the trip, Wallis's investments were wiped out in the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|Wall Street Crash]], and her mother died penniless on 2 November 1929. Wallis returned to England and with the shipping business still buoyant,&lt;!--Pun intended!--&gt; the Simpsons moved into a large flat with a staff of servants.&lt;ref&gt;Higham, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;

Through a friend, Consuelo Thaw, Wallis met Consuelo's sister [[Thelma Furness, Viscountess Furness|Thelma, Lady Furness]], the then-mistress of Edward, Prince of Wales.&lt;ref&gt;Bloch, ''The Duchess of Windsor'', p. 33; Higham, p. 68; Sebba, p. 84; Vickers, p. 272&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 January 1931, Lady Furness introduced Wallis to the Prince at [[Burrough Court]], near [[Melton Mowbray]].&lt;ref&gt;Bloch, ''The Duchess of Windsor'', p. 37; King, p. 98; Vickers, p. 272&lt;/ref&gt; The Prince was the eldest son of [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]] and [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]], and [[heir apparent]] to the throne. Between 1931 and 1934, he met the Simpsons at various house parties, and Wallis was presented at court. Ernest was beginning to encounter financial difficulties, as the Simpsons were living beyond their means, and they had to fire a succession of staff.&lt;ref&gt;Bloch, ''The Duchess of Windsor'', pp. 37–41; Higham, pp. 73–80&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship with Edward, Prince of Wales==
In January 1934, while Lady Furness was away in [[New York City|New York]], Wallis allegedly became the Prince's mistress. Edward denied this to his father, despite his staff seeing them in bed together as well as &quot;evidence of a physical sexual act&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Diary of [[Clive Wigram, 1st Baron Wigram]] quoted in Bradford, pp. 145–147&lt;/ref&gt; Wallis soon ousted Lady Furness, and the Prince distanced himself from a former lover and confidante, the Anglo-American textile heiress [[Freda Dudley Ward]].&lt;ref&gt;Sebba, p. 98; Vickers, p. 287; Ziegler, pp. 227–228&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Wallis Simpson and Prince 1935.jpg|left|thumb|250px|The Prince of Wales and Wallis in Kitzbühel, Austria, February 1935]]

By the end of 1934, Edward was irretrievably besotted with Wallis, finding her domineering manner and abrasive irreverence toward his position appealing; in the words of his official biographer, he became &quot;slavishly dependent&quot; on her.&lt;ref name=&quot;dnb&quot; /&gt; According to Wallis, it was during a cruise on [[Walter Guinness, 1st Baron Moyne|Lord Moyne's]] private yacht [[MY Rosaura|''Rosaura'']] in August 1934 that she fell in love with Edward.&lt;ref&gt;King, p. 113; Duchess of Windsor, pp. 195–197, 200&lt;/ref&gt; At an evening party in [[Buckingham Palace]], he introduced her to his mother—his father was outraged,&lt;ref&gt;Ziegler, p. 231&lt;/ref&gt; primarily on account of her marital history, as divorced people were generally excluded from court.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Beaverbrook|first=Lord|authorlink=Max Aitken, 1st Baron Beaverbrook|title=The Abdication of King Edward VIII|coauthors=Edited by [[A. J. P. Taylor]]|publisher=Hamish Hamilton |location=London|year=1966|page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edward showered Wallis with money and jewels,&lt;ref&gt;King, pp. 126, 155; Sebba, pp. 103–104; Ziegler, p. 238&lt;/ref&gt; and in February 1935, and again later in the year, he holidayed with her in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Higham, pp. 113, 125 ff; King, pp. 117, 134&lt;/ref&gt; His courtiers became increasingly alarmed as the affair began to interfere with his official duties.&lt;ref&gt;Bloch, ''The Duchess of Windsor'', pp. 58 and 71&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1935, the head of the [[Metropolitan Police Service|Metropolitan Police]] [[Special Branch]] told the [[Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis|Metropolitan Police Commissioner]] that Wallis was also having an affair with Guy Marcus Trundle, who was &quot;said to be employed by the [[Ford Motor Company]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Report from Superintendent A. Canning to Sir [[Philip Game]], 3 July 1935, [[National Archives]], PRO MEPO 10/35, quoted in Williams, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; The reports were released to the public for the first time in 2003. Claims of an affair were doubted, however, by Captain Val Bailey, who knew Trundle well and whose mother had an affair with Trundle for nearly two decades,&lt;ref name=&quot;fox&quot;&gt;{{citation|first=James|last=Fox|title=The Oddest Couple|journal=[[Vanity Fair magazine|Vanity Fair]]|issue=517|pages=276–291|date=1 September 2003|issn=07338899}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by historian Susan Williams.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abdication crisis==
{{Main|Edward VIII abdication crisis}}

On 20 January 1936, George V died at [[Sandringham House|Sandringham]] and Edward ascended the throne as King Edward VIII. The next day, he broke royal protocol by watching the proclamation of his accession from a window of [[St James's Palace]], in the company of the still-married Wallis.&lt;ref&gt;Sebba, p. 119; Duke of Windsor, p. 265&lt;/ref&gt; It was becoming apparent to Court and Government circles that the new [[King-Emperor]] meant to marry her.&lt;ref&gt;Ziegler, pp. 277–278&lt;/ref&gt; The King's behaviour and his relationship with Wallis made him unpopular with the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]]-led [[UK National Government|British government]], as well as distressing his [[Mary of Teck|mother]] and [[George VI|brother]].&lt;ref&gt;Ziegler, pp. 289–292&lt;/ref&gt; The pre-war British media remained deferential to the monarchy, and no stories of the affair were reported in the domestic press, but foreign media widely reported their relationship.&lt;ref&gt;King, p. 173; Sebba, pp. 136, 141; Duchess of Windsor, pp. 237, 242&lt;/ref&gt;

The monarch of the United Kingdom is [[Supreme Governor of the Church of England]]—at the time of the proposed marriage, and until 2002, the [[Church of England]] did not permit the re-marriage of divorced people who had living ex-spouses.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.cofe.anglican.org/info/papers/mcad/|title=Marriage in Church After a Divorce|publisher=The Church of England|accessdate=2 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Constitutionally, the King was required to be in communion with the Church of England, but his proposed marriage conflicted with the Church's teachings.&lt;ref&gt;Beaverbrook, pp. 39–44 and p. 122&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the British and Dominion governments felt that Wallis, as a two-time divorcée, was politically, socially and morally unsuitable as a prospective consort.&lt;ref name=&quot;ziegler&quot;&gt;Ziegler, pp. 305–307&lt;/ref&gt; She was perceived by many in the [[British Empire]] as a woman of &quot;limitless ambition&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Sir [[Horace Wilson (civil servant)|Horace Wilson]] writing to [[Neville Chamberlain]], 10 December 1936, National Archives PREM 1/453, quoted in Higham, p. 191 and Sebba, p. 250&lt;/ref&gt; who was pursuing the King because of his wealth and position.&lt;ref&gt;Ziegler, p. 234 and p. 312&lt;/ref&gt;

Wallis had already filed for divorce from her second husband on the grounds that he had committed adultery with her childhood friend Mary Kirk and the [[decree nisi]] was granted on 27 October 1936.&lt;ref&gt;Bloch, ''The Duchess of Windsor'', pp. 82, 92&lt;/ref&gt; In November, the King consulted with the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]], [[Stanley Baldwin]], on a way to marry Wallis and keep the throne. The King suggested a [[morganatic marriage]], where the King would remain King but Wallis would not be Queen, but this was rejected by Baldwin and the Prime Ministers of Australia and South Africa.&lt;ref name=&quot;ziegler&quot; /&gt; If the King were to marry Wallis against Baldwin's advice, the Government would be required to resign, causing a constitutional crisis.&lt;ref&gt;Beaverbrook, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt;

Wallis's relationship with the King had become public knowledge in the United Kingdom by early December. Wallis decided to flee the country as the scandal broke, and was driven to the south of France in a dramatic race to outrun the press.&lt;ref&gt;King, pp. 213–218; Duchess of Windsor, pp. 255–269&lt;/ref&gt; For the next three months, she was under siege by the media at the Villa Lou Viei, near [[Cannes]], the home of her close friends Herman and Katherine Rogers.&lt;ref&gt;Duke of Windsor, p. 359&lt;/ref&gt; At her hideaway, Wallis was pressured by the King's [[Lord-in-Waiting]], [[Peregrine Cust, 6th Baron Brownlow|Lord Brownlow]], to renounce the King. On 7 December 1936, Lord Brownlow read to the press her statement, which he had helped her draft, indicating Wallis's readiness to give up the King.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Adrian|last=Tinniswood|authorlink=Adrian Tinniswood|title=[[Belton House]]|publisher=[[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|The National Trust]]|year=1992|page=34|isbn=0-7078-0113-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Edward was determined to marry Wallis. [[John Theodore Goddard]], Wallis's [[solicitor]], stated: &quot;[his] client was ready to do anything to ease the situation but the other end of the wicket [Edward VIII] was determined.&quot; This seemingly indicated that the King had decided he had no option but to abdicate if he wished to marry Wallis.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/monarchy/story/0,2763,191136,00.html |title=Edward and Mrs Simpson cast in new light|last=Norton-Taylor|first=Richard|coauthors=Evans, Rob|date=2 March 2000|journal=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=2 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Wikisource|Edward VIII of the United Kingdom's Abdication}}
The King signed the [[Instrument of Abdication]] on 10 December 1936, in the presence of his three surviving brothers, [[George VI of the United Kingdom|the Duke of York]] (who would ascend the throne the following day as George VI), [[Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester|the Duke of Gloucester]] and [[Prince George, Duke of Kent|the Duke of Kent]]. Special laws passed by the Parliaments of the [[Dominion]]s finalised Edward's abdication the following day, or in Ireland's case one day later. On 11 December 1936, Edward said in a radio broadcast, &quot;I have found it impossible to carry the heavy burden of responsibility, and to discharge my duties as King as I would wish to do, without the help and support of the woman I love.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Duke of Windsor, p. 413&lt;/ref&gt;

Edward left Britain for Austria, where he stayed at Schloss [[Enzesfeld-Lindabrunn|Enzesfeld]], the home of Baron Eugen and Baroness Kitty de [[Rothschild family|Rothschild]]. Edward had to remain apart from Wallis until there was no danger of compromising the granting of a decree absolute in her divorce proceedings.&lt;ref name=BHK/&gt; Upon her divorce being made final in May 1937, she changed her name by [[deed poll]] to Mrs Wallis Warfield, resuming her maiden name.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=McMillan, Richard D.|title=Duke Awaiting His Wedding Day|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=koNaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ME0NAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2457,4252801&amp;dq=wallis+simpson+deed+poll&amp;hl=en|journal=Waycross Journal-Herald|date=11 May 1937|accessdate=6 September 2011|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple were reunited at the [[Château de Candé]], Monts, France, on 4 May 1937.&lt;ref name=BHK&gt;Bloch, ''The Duchess of Windsor'', pp. 106–118; Higham, p. 224; King, pp. 253–254, 260&lt;/ref&gt;

==Third marriage: Duchess of Windsor==
[[File:Candé Castle.jpg|thumb|right|[[Château de Candé]], Monts, France]]
Wallis and Edward married one month later on 3 June 1937 at the Château de Candé, lent to them by French millionaire [[Charles Bedaux]].&lt;ref&gt;Howarth, p. 73; Sebba, pp. 198, 205–209&lt;/ref&gt; The date would have been King [[George V of England|George V]]'s 72nd birthday; Queen [[Mary of Teck|Mary]] thought the wedding had been scheduled for then as a deliberate slight.&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Queen Mary to Queen Elizabeth, 21 May 1937, Royal Archives, QEQM/PRIV/RF, quoted in {{citation|last=Shawcross|first=William|authorlink=William Shawcross|title=Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother: The Official Biography|publisher=Macmillan|year=2009|isbn=978-1-4050-4859-0|page=422}}&lt;/ref&gt; No member of the [[British Royal Family]] attended. Wallis wore a &quot;Wallis blue&quot; [[Mainbocher]] [[wedding dress of Wallis Warfield|wedding dress]].&lt;ref&gt;Sebba, p. 207&lt;/ref&gt; The marriage produced no children. In November, Ernest Simpson married Mary Kirk.&lt;ref&gt;Sebba, p. 213&lt;/ref&gt;

Edward was created [[Duke of Windsor]] by his brother, the new George VI. However, [[letters patent]], passed by the new King and unanimously supported by the Dominion governments,&lt;ref&gt;Diary of [[Neville Chamberlain]] quoted in Bradford, p. 243&lt;/ref&gt; prevented Wallis, now the Duchess of Windsor, from sharing her husband's [[Style (manner of address)|style]] of &quot;[[Royal Highness]]&quot;. The new King's firm view, that the Duchess should not be given a royal title, was shared by Queen Mary and George's wife, [[Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon|Queen Elizabeth (later the Queen Mother)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/releases/2003/january30/edward_duke.htm|title=Home Office memo on the Duke and Duchess's title|publisher=National Archives|accessdate=2 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; At first, the Royal Family did not accept the Duchess and would not receive her formally, although the former king sometimes met his mother and siblings after his abdication. Some biographers have suggested that Queen Elizabeth, Edward's sister-in-law, remained bitter towards Wallis for her role in bringing George VI to the throne (which she may have seen as a factor in George VI's early death),&lt;ref&gt;Higham, p. 437; King, p. 399&lt;/ref&gt; and for prematurely behaving as Edward's consort when she was his mistress.&lt;ref&gt;Bradford, p. 172; King, pp. 171–172&lt;/ref&gt; But these claims were denied by Queen Elizabeth's close friends; for example, the [[Hugh FitzRoy, 11th Duke of Grafton|Duke of Grafton]] wrote that she &quot;never said anything nasty about the Duchess of Windsor, except to say she really hadn't got a clue what she was dealing with.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Hogg|first=James|coauthors=Mortimer, Michael|title=The Queen Mother Remembered|publisher=BBC Books|year=2002|isbn=0-563-36214-6|pages=84–85}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the Duchess of Windsor referred to Queen Elizabeth as &quot;Mrs Temple&quot; and &quot;Cookie&quot;, alluding to her solid figure and fondness for food, and to her daughter, [[Elizabeth II|Princess Elizabeth (later Queen Elizabeth II)]], as &quot;Shirley&quot;, as in [[Shirley Temple]].&lt;ref&gt;Bloch, ''The Secret File of the Duke of Windsor'', p. 259&lt;/ref&gt; The Duchess bitterly resented the denial of the royal title and the refusal of the Duke's relatives to accept her as part of the family.&lt;ref name=&quot;dnb&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also, Bloch, ''Wallis and Edward: Letters 1931–1937'', pp. 231, 233 cited in Bradford, p. 232&lt;/ref&gt; Within the household of the Duke and Duchess, the style &quot;Her Royal Highness&quot; was used by those who were close to the couple.&lt;ref&gt;Higham, p. 232; Sebba, p. 208&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the wife of former [[British Union of Fascists]] leader [[Oswald Mosley]], [[Diana Mitford]], who knew both Queen Elizabeth and the Duchess of Windsor but was only friendly with the latter, the Queen's antipathy toward her sister-in-law may have resulted from jealousy. Lady Mosley wrote to her sister, the [[Deborah Mitford|Duchess of Devonshire]], after the death of the Duke of Windsor, &quot;probably the theory of their [the Windsors'] contemporaries that Cake [a Mitford nickname for the Queen Mother, derived from her delighted exclamation at the party at which Deborah Devonshire first met her] was rather in love with him [the Duke] (as a girl) &amp; took second best, may account for much.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Lady Mosley to the [[Deborah Mitford|Duchess of Devonshire]], 5 June 1972, in Mosley, Charlotte (ed.) (2007). ''The Mitfords: Letters Between Six Sisters''. London: Fourth Estate, p. 582&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Duke and Duchess of Windsor meet Adolf Hitler 1937.jpg|left|thumb|The Duke and Duchess of Windsor with [[Adolf Hitler]]]]
The Duke and Duchess lived in France in the pre-war years. In 1937, they made a high profile visit to Germany and met [[Nazi Party|Nazi]] leader [[Adolf Hitler]] at his [[Berchtesgaden]] retreat. After the visit, Hitler said of Wallis, &quot;she would have made a good Queen&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Memoirs of Hitler's interpreter [[Paul Schmidt (interpreter)|Paul Schmidt]], quoted in King, p. 295&lt;/ref&gt; The visit tended to corroborate the strong suspicions of many in government and society that the Duchess was a German agent,&lt;ref name=&quot;dnb&quot; /&gt; a claim that she ridiculed in her letters to the Duke.&lt;ref&gt;Higham, p. 203&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) files compiled in the 1930s also portray her as a possible [[Nazism|Nazi]] sympathiser. The ex–[[Duke Carl Alexander of Württemberg|Duke of Württemberg]] told the FBI that she and leading Nazi [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]] had been lovers in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4451107,00.html|first=Rob|last=Evans|coauthors=Hencke, David|title=Wallis Simpson, the Nazi minister, the telltale monk and an FBI plot|journal=The Guardian|date=29 June 2002|accessdate=2 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were even rather improbable reports during World War II that she kept a signed photograph of Ribbentrop on her bedside table,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Michael|last=Bloch|title=The Duke of Windsor's War|publisher=Weidenfeld and Nicolson|location=London|year=1982|page=355|isbn=0-297-77947-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and had continued to pass details to him even during the invasion of France.&lt;ref&gt;Higham, p. 317&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War II==
Following the outbreak of war in 1939, the Duke was given a military post in the British Army stationed in France. According to the son of [[William Edmund Ironside, 1st Baron Ironside]], the Duchess continued to entertain friends associated with the fascist movement, and leaked details of the French and Belgian defences gleaned from the Duke.&lt;ref&gt;Higham, p. 305&lt;/ref&gt; When the Germans invaded the north of France and bombed Britain in May 1940, the Duchess told an American journalist, &quot;I can't say I feel sorry for them.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Higham, p. 313&lt;/ref&gt; As the German troops advanced, the Duke and Duchess fled south from their Paris home, first to [[Biarritz]], then in June to Spain. There, she told the [[United States Ambassador to Spain|United States ambassador]], [[Alexander W. Weddell]], that France had lost because it was &quot;internally diseased&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Telegram from Wedell to Secretary of State [[Cordell Hull]], FRUS 740.0011 1939/4357 European War, National Archives, Washington, D.C., quoted in Higham, p. 323 and King, p. 343&lt;/ref&gt; In July, the pair moved to [[Lisbon]], Portugal, where they stayed at the home of Ricardo de Espirito Santo e Silva, a banker who was suspected of being a German agent.&lt;ref&gt;Bloch, ''The Duke of Windsor's War'', p. 102&lt;/ref&gt; In August, the Duke and Duchess travelled by commercial liner to [[the Bahamas]], where the Duke was installed as [[Governor of the Bahamas|Governor]].&lt;ref&gt;King, pp. 350–352; Duchess of Windsor, pp. 344–345&lt;/ref&gt;

Wallis performed her role as the Governor's lady competently for five years; she worked actively for the Red Cross and in the improvement of infant welfare.&lt;ref&gt;King, pp. 368–376; Vickers, p. 331&lt;/ref&gt; However, she hated [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]], calling it &quot;our [[Saint Helena|St Helena]]&quot;, in a reference to [[Napoleon]]'s final place of exile.&lt;ref&gt;Bloch, ''The Duchess of Windsor'', pp. 153, 159; Higham, p. 330&lt;/ref&gt; She was heavily criticised in the British press for her extravagant shopping in the United States, undertaken when Britain was enduring privations such as [[Rationing in the United Kingdom|rationing]] and the [[Blackout (wartime)|blackout]].&lt;ref name=&quot;dnb&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sebba, p. 244&lt;/ref&gt; Her racist attitudes towards the local population (she called them &quot;lazy, thriving [[nigger]]s&quot; in letters to her aunt) reflected her upbringing.&lt;ref&gt;Bloch, ''The Duchess of Windsor'', p. 165&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;When telling a story of how Wallis complained about blacks being allowed on [[Park Avenue (Manhattan)]], Joanne Cummings, the wife of [[Nathan Cummings]], said of Wallis, &quot;She grew up in the South, at a certain time, with certain prejudices.&quot; Source: Menkes, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; In 1941, Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] strenuously objected when she and her husband planned to tour the Caribbean aboard a yacht belonging to a Swedish magnate, [[Axel Wenner-Gren]], whom Churchill stated to be &quot;pro-German&quot;. Churchill felt compelled to complain again when the Duke gave a &quot;defeatist&quot; interview.&lt;ref&gt;Howarth, p. 130; King, pp. 377–378&lt;/ref&gt; Another of their acquaintances, [[Charles Bedaux]], was arrested on charges of treason in 1943, and committed suicide in jail in Miami before the case was brought to trial.&lt;ref&gt;King, p. 378&lt;/ref&gt; The British [[The Establishment|establishment]] distrusted the Duchess; Sir [[Alexander Hardinge, 2nd Baron Hardinge of Penshurst|Alexander Hardinge]] wrote that her suspected anti-British activities were motivated by a desire for revenge against a country that rejected her as its queen.&lt;ref&gt;Howarth, p. 113&lt;/ref&gt; After the defeat of Nazi Germany, the couple returned to France and retirement.

==Later life and death==
[[File:The Duchess of Windsor (1970).jpg|thumb|right|The Duchess of Windsor in a [[Givenchy]] silk evening dress, 1970&lt;ref&gt;King, p. 465; Vickers, p. 367&lt;/ref&gt;]]&lt;!--White House dinner with Nixons, 4 April 1970--&gt;
In 1946, when the Duchess was staying at Ednam Lodge, the home of the [[William Ward, 3rd Earl of Dudley|Earl of Dudley]], some of her jewels were stolen. There were rumours that the theft had been masterminded by the [[British Royal Family]] as an attempt to regain jewels taken from the [[Royal Collection]] by the Duke, or by the Windsors themselves as part of an insurance fraud—they made a large deposit of loose stones at [[Cartier SA|Cartier]] the following year. However, in 1960, Richard Dunphie confessed to the crime. The stolen pieces were only a small portion of the Windsor jewels, which were either bought privately, inherited by the Duke, or given to the Duke when he was Prince of Wales.&lt;ref&gt;Menkes, pp. 192–193&lt;/ref&gt;

On George VI's death in 1952, the Duke returned to England for the funeral. The Duchess did not attend; the previous October whilst staying in London she had told her husband, &quot;I hate this country. I shall hate it to my grave.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Higham, p. 443&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, they were offered the use of a house by the Paris municipal authorities. The couple lived at 4 route du Champ d'Entraînement in [[Neuilly-sur-Seine]] near Paris for most of the remainder of their lives, essentially living a life of easy retirement.&lt;ref&gt;Menkes, pp. 11–48&lt;/ref&gt; They bought a second house in the country, ''Moulin de la Tuilerie'' or &quot;The Mill&quot; in [[Gif-sur-Yvette]], where they soon became close friends with their neighbours, [[Oswald Mosley|Oswald]] and [[Diana Mosley]].&lt;ref&gt;Higham, p. 449; Ziegler, p. 545&lt;/ref&gt; Years later, Diana Mosley claimed that the Duke and Duchess shared her and her husband's views that Hitler should have been given a free hand to destroy [[Communism]].&lt;ref&gt;Higham, p. 450&lt;/ref&gt; As the Duke himself wrote in the New York ''[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]'' of 13 December 1966: &quot;...&amp;nbsp;it was in Britain's interest and in Europe's too, that Germany be encouraged to strike east and smash Communism forever&amp;nbsp;... I thought the rest of us could be fence-sitters while the Nazis and the Reds slogged it out.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Higham, pp. 259–260; King, pp. 294–296&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, the Duke and Duchess visited London as the Duke required eye surgery for a detached retina; [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] and [[Princess Marina of Greece and Denmark|Princess Marina, Duchess of Kent]], visited them. The Duke's sister, the [[Mary, Princess Royal and Countess of Harewood|Princess Royal]], also visited just 10 days before her death. They attended her memorial service in [[Westminster Abbey]].&lt;ref&gt;Vickers, p. 360&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in 1967, the Duke and Duchess joined the Royal Family in London for the unveiling of a plaque by Elizabeth II to commemorate the centenary of [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]]'s birth.&lt;ref&gt;Higham, pp. 466–469; King, pp. 455–459; Vickers, p. 362&lt;/ref&gt; Both Queen Elizabeth II and [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]] visited the Windsors in Paris in the Duke's later years, the Queen's visit coming only shortly before the Duke died.&lt;ref&gt;Bloch, ''The Secret File of the Duke of Windsor'', p. 299; Higham, p. 473; Vickers; pp. 15–16, 367&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon the Duke's death from cancer in 1972, the Duchess travelled to England to attend his funeral,&lt;ref&gt;Conducted by [[Launcelot Fleming]], [[Dean of Windsor]] (''[[The Times]]'', Monday, 5 June 1972; p. 2; Issue 58496; col. E)&lt;/ref&gt; staying at [[Buckingham Palace]] during her visit.&lt;ref&gt;Bloch, ''The Duchess of Windsor'', p. 216; Higham, pp. 477–479; Sebba, p. 272; Vickers, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; The Duchess, increasingly frail and suffering from dementia, lived the remainder of her life as a recluse, supported by both her husband's estate and an allowance from the Queen.&lt;ref&gt;Sebba, pp. 274–277; Vickers, pp. 99–120; Ziegler, p. 555&lt;/ref&gt; She suffered several falls, and broke her hip twice.&lt;ref&gt;King, pp. 492–493&lt;/ref&gt; After her husband's death, the Duchess's French lawyer, Suzanne Blum, assumed power of attorney.&lt;ref&gt;Bloch, ''The Duchess of Windsor'', p. 221; Higham, p. 490; King, p. 505; Menkes, p. 199; Vickers, pp. 137–138&lt;/ref&gt; Blum sold items belonging to the Duchess to her friends at lower than market value,&lt;ref&gt;Vickers, pp. 124–127, 165&lt;/ref&gt; and was accused of exploiting her client in [[Caroline Blackwood]]'s ''The Last of the Duchess'', written in 1980, but not published until after Blum's death in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;Vickers, pp. 178–179&lt;/ref&gt; Later royal biographer Hugo Vickers called Blum a &quot;Satanic figure&amp;nbsp;… wearing the mantle of good intention to disguise her inner malevolence&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Vickers, p. 370&lt;/ref&gt; In 1980, the Duchess lost the power of speech.&lt;ref&gt;Bloch, ''The Duchess of Windsor'', p. 222&lt;/ref&gt; Toward the end, she was bedridden and did not receive any visitors, apart from her doctor and nurses.&lt;ref&gt;Vickers, pp. 158–168&lt;/ref&gt;

The Duchess of Windsor died on 24 April 1986 at her home in the [[Bois de Boulogne]], Paris.&lt;ref name=&quot;weir&quot;/&gt; Her funeral was held at [[St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle|St George's Chapel]], [[Windsor Castle]], attended by her two surviving sisters-in-law: the Queen Mother and [[Princess Alice, Duchess of Gloucester]], and other members of the royal family.&lt;ref&gt;Vickers, pp. 191–198&lt;/ref&gt; The Queen, [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Prince Philip]], and the [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince]] and [[Diana, Princess of Wales|Princess of Wales]] attended both the funeral ceremony and the burial. She was buried next to Edward in the [[Royal Burial Ground]] near Windsor Castle, as &quot;Wallis, Duchess of Windsor&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc&quot;&gt;{{citation|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/april/29/newsid_2500000/2500427.stm| publisher =BBC| title=Simple funeral rites for Duchess|date=29 April 1998|accessdate=2 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until an agreement with Queen Elizabeth II in the 1960s, the Duke and Duchess had previously planned for a burial in a purchased cemetery plot at [[Green Mount Cemetery]] in [[Baltimore]], where the father of the Duchess was interred.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Windsors had a plot at Green Mount|last=Rasmussen|first=Frederick|publisher=The Baltimore Sun|location=Baltimore|date=29 April 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vickers, p. 245&lt;/ref&gt;

In recognition of the help France gave to the Duke and Duchess in providing them with a home, and in lieu of death duties, the Duchess's collection of [[Louis XVI style]] furniture, some porcelain and paintings were made over to the French state.&lt;ref&gt;King, p. 506; Menkes, pp. 198, 206 and 207&lt;/ref&gt; The British Royal Family received no major bequests. Most of her estate went to the [[Pasteur Institute]] medical research foundation, on the instructions of Suzanne Blum. The decision took the Royal Family and the Duchess's friends by surprise, as she had shown little interest in charity during her life.&lt;ref&gt;Menkes, p. 200&lt;/ref&gt; In a [[Sotheby's]] auction in Geneva in April 1987 the Duchess's remarkable jewellery collection raised $45 million for the Institute, approximately seven times its pre-sale estimate.&lt;ref&gt;Culme, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; Blum later claimed that Egyptian entrepreneur [[Mohamed Al-Fayed]] tried to purchase the jewels for a &quot;rock bottom price&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |date=1 January 1990|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20116503,00.html|title=Egypt's Al Fayed Restores the House Fit for a Former King |work=[[People (magazine)|People]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Fayed bought much of the non-financial estate, including the lease of the Paris mansion. An auction of his collection was announced in July 1997 for later that year in New York.&lt;ref&gt;Vickers, pp. 234–235&lt;/ref&gt; Delayed by [[Dodi Al-Fayed|his son]]'s death in [[Death of Diana, Princess of Wales|the car accident]] that also claimed the life of [[Diana, Princess of Wales]], the sale raised more than £14 million for charity in 1998.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc&quot; /&gt;

==Legacy==
[[Image:Royal Monogram of The Duke and Duchess of Windsor.svg|left|thumb|120px|Cypher of Wallis and Edward]]
Wallis was plagued by rumours of other lovers. The gay American playboy [[James Paul Donahue, Jr.|Jimmy Donahue]], an heir to the [[F.W. Woolworth Company|Woolworth]] fortune, claimed to have had a liaison with the Duchess in the 1950s, but Donahue was notorious for his inventive pranks and rumour-mongering.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Christopher |last=Wilson|title=Dancing With the Devil: the Windsors and Jimmy Donahue|publisher=HarperCollins|location=London|year=2001|isbn=0-00-653159-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;King, p. 442&lt;/ref&gt; The existence of a so-called &quot;China dossier&quot; (detailing the supposed sexual and criminal exploits of Wallis in China) is denied by virtually all historians and biographers.&lt;ref&gt;Higham, p. 119; King, p. 61; Vickers, p. 263; Ziegler, p. 224&lt;/ref&gt;

Simpson had no children. Although there have been rumours of pregnancy and abortion, most notably involving [[Count Ciano]] in China, there is no hard evidence that the Duchess became pregnant by any of her lovers or her three husbands. Claims that she suffered from [[androgen insensitivity syndrome]], also known as testicular feminisation,&lt;ref name=&quot;fox&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bloch, ''The Duchess of Windsor'', pp. 10, 13, 230&lt;/ref&gt; seem improbable, if not impossible, given her operation for [[uterine fibroids]] in 1951.&lt;ref&gt;Higham, p. 496; Ziegler, p. 533&lt;/ref&gt; Her doctor, Jean Thin, claimed she had normal genitalia.&lt;ref&gt;King, p. 12; Vickers, p. 229&lt;/ref&gt;

The Duchess published her ghost-written memoirs, ''The Heart Has Its Reasons'', in 1956. Author [[Charles Higham (biographer)|Charles Higham]] says of the book, &quot;facts were remorselessly rearranged in what amounted to a self-performed face-lift&amp;nbsp;... reflecting in abundance its author's politically misguided but winning and desirable personality.&quot; He describes the Duchess as &quot;charismatic, electric and compulsively ambitious&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Higham, pp. 452–453&lt;/ref&gt; Hearsay, conjecture and politically motivated propaganda have clouded assessment of the Duchess of Windsor's life, not helped by her own manipulation of the truth. But there is no document which proves directly that she was anything other than a victim of her own ambition, who lived out a great romance that became a great tragedy. In the opinion of her biographers, &quot;she experienced the ultimate fairy tale, becoming the adored favourite of the most glamorous bachelor of his time. The idyll went wrong when, ignoring her pleas, he threw up his position to spend the rest of his life with her.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Bloch, ''The Duchess of Windsor'', p. 231&lt;/ref&gt; Academics agree that she ascended a precipice that &quot;left her with fewer alternatives than she had anticipated. Somehow she thought that the Establishment could be overcome once [Edward] was king, and she confessed frankly to Aunt Bessie about her 'insatiable ambitions'&amp;nbsp;... Trapped by his flight from responsibility into exactly the role she had sought, suddenly she warned him, in a letter, 'You and I can only create disaster together'&amp;nbsp;... she predicted to society hostess [[Sybil Colefax]], 'two people will suffer' because of 'the workings of a system'&amp;nbsp;... Denied dignity, and without anything useful to do, the new Duke of Windsor and his Duchess would be international society's most notorious parasites for a generation, while they thoroughly bored each other&amp;nbsp;... She had thought of him as emotionally a [[Peter Pan]], and of herself an [[Alice in Wonderland]]. The book they had written together, however, was a [[Paradise Lost]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Weintraub|first=Stanley|authorlink=Stanley Weintraub|journal=[[Washington Post]] |date=8 June 1986|page=X05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Duchess herself is reported to have summed up her life in a sentence: &quot;You have no idea how hard it is to live out a great romance.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;King, p. 388; Wilson, p. 179&lt;/ref&gt;

===In popular culture===
Wallis was portrayed by [[Faye Dunaway]] in ''The Woman I Love'' (1972, TV drama), [[Cynthia Harris]] in ''[[Edward &amp; Mrs. Simpson]]'' (1978, TV miniseries), [[Barbara Parkins]] in ''To Catch a King'' (1983, TV movie), [[Jane Seymour (actress)|Jane Seymour]] in ''The Woman He Loved'' (1988, made-for-TV movie), Jane Hartley in ''Always'' (1997, [[West End theatre|West End]] musical), Amber Sealey in ''[[Bertie and Elizabeth]]'' (2002, made-for-TV movie), [[Joely Richardson]] in ''[[Wallis &amp; Edward]]'' (2005, made-for-TV movie), [[Gillian Anderson]] in ''[[Any Human Heart]]'' (2010, TV mini-series), Emma Clifford in ''[[Upstairs, Downstairs]]'' (2010, TV mini-series), and [[Eve Best]] in ''[[The King's Speech]]'' (2010). [[Gwyneth Paltrow]] played Wallis in [[A Night of Neglect|an episode]] of ''[[Glee (TV Series)|Glee]]'' for a brief scene. [[Andrea Riseborough]] portrayed the Duchess in the 2011 film ''[[W.E (film)|W.E.]]''

In his 1981 novel ''[[Famous Last Words (novel)|Famous Last Words]]'', Canadian author [[Timothy Findley]] depicts the Duchess as a manipulative conspirator.&lt;ref&gt;Sebba, pp. 280–281&lt;/ref&gt; A 2006 short story by [[Rose Tremain]], called &quot;The Darkness of Wallis Simpson&quot;, depicts Wallis more sympathetically in her final years of ill health.&lt;ref&gt;Sebba, p. 282&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anne Edwards]] wrote another sympathetic account, of Wallis's early life, culminating with the marriage to Edward in her 1991 book ''Wallis: The Novel''. Kate Auspitz's 2010 novel, ''The War Memoirs of HRH Wallis, Duchess of Windsor'', portrays Wallis as a tool of the Allies who employ her to knock fascist-sympathising King Edward VIII off the throne.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The War Memoirs of HRH Wallis, Duchess of Windsor|url=http://www.penguin.ca/nf/Book/BookDisplay/0,,9780670069286,00.html|publisher=Penguin Canada|accessdate=2 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other works in which she features include a play called ''The Duchess'' by [[Linda Griffiths]]; the 1992 [[alternate history]] crime thriller ''[[Fatherland (novel)|Fatherland]]'' by [[Robert Harris (novelist)|Robert Harris]]; the 2005 novel ''Gone With the Windsors'' by [[Laurie Graham (novelist)|Laurie Graham]]; and the Young Bond book by [[Charlie Higson]], ''[[By Royal Command]]''.
