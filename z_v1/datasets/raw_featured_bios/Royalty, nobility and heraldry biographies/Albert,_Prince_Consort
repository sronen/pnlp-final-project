'''Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha''' (Francis Albert Augustus Charles Emmanuel;&lt;ref name=&quot;London Gazette 7 February 1840&quot; /&gt; later The Prince Consort; 26 August 1819 – 14 December 1861) was the husband of [[Queen Victoria]] of [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain and Ireland]].

He was born in the [[Ernestine duchies|Saxon duchy]] of [[Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld]] to a family connected to many of Europe's ruling monarchs. At the age of 20 he married his first cousin, Queen Victoria, with whom he would ultimately have nine children. At first, Albert felt constrained by his position as [[Prince Consort|consort]], which did not confer any power or duties upon him. Over time he adopted many public causes, such as educational reform and a worldwide [[Abolitionism|abolition of slavery]], and took on the responsibilities of running the Queen's household, estates and office. He was heavily involved with the organisation of the [[Great Exhibition of 1851]]. Albert aided in the development of Britain's [[constitutional monarchy]] by persuading his wife to show less partisanship in her dealings with [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]]—although he actively disagreed with the interventionist foreign policy pursued during [[Henry Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Lord Palmerston]]'s tenure as Foreign Secretary.

He died at the early age of 42, plunging the Queen into a deep mourning that lasted for the rest of her life. Upon Queen Victoria's death in 1901, their eldest son, [[Edward VII]], succeeded as the first [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British monarch]] of the [[House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]], named after the ducal house to which Albert belonged.

==Early life==
Albert was born at [[Schloss Rosenau, Coburg|Schloss Rosenau]], near [[Coburg]], Germany, the second son of [[Ernest I, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Ernest III, Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld]], and his first wife, [[Louise of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hobhouse|1983|p=2}}; {{harvnb|Weintraub|1997|p=20}} and {{harvnb|Weir|1996|p=305}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Albert's future wife, Queen Victoria, was born in the same year with the assistance of the same midwife.{{sfn|Weintraub|1997|p=20}} Albert was baptised into the [[Evangelical Church in Germany|Lutheran Evangelical Church]] on 19 September 1819 in the Marble Hall at Schloss Rosenau with water taken from the local river, the [[Itz]].{{sfn|Weintraub|1997|p=21}} His godparents were his paternal grandmother, [[Augusta Reuss-Ebersdorf|the Dowager Duchess of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld]]; his maternal grandfather, [[Augustus, Duke of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg|the Duke of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg]]; [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|the Emperor of Austria]]; [[Prince Albert of Saxony, Duke of Teschen|the Duke of Teschen]]; and [[Emmanuel von Mensdorff-Pouilly|Emanuel, Count von Mensdorff-Pouilly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ames|1968|p=1}} and {{harvnb|Hobhouse|1983|p=2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1825, Albert's great-uncle, [[Frederick IV, Duke of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg]], died. The death led to a re-arrangement of the Saxon duchies the following year and Albert's father became reigning duke of [[Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]].&lt;ref&gt;e.g. {{harvnb|Montgomery-Massingberd|1977|pp=259–273}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Albert and his elder brother, [[Ernest II, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Ernest]], spent their youth in a close companionship scarred by their parents' turbulent marriage and eventual separation and divorce.{{sfn|Weintraub|1997|pp=25–28}} After their mother was exiled from court in 1824, she married her lover, [[Alexander von Hanstein, Count of Polzig and Beiersdorf]]. She probably never saw her children again and died of cancer at the age of 30 in 1831.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hobhouse|1983|p=4}} and {{harvnb|Weintraub|1997|pp=25–28}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, their father married his own niece, his sons' cousin Princess Antoinette [[Marie of Württemberg]], but the marriage was not close, and Antoinette Marie made little, if any, contribution to her stepchildren's lives.{{sfn|Weintraub|1997|pp=40–41}}

The brothers were educated privately at home by Christoph Florschütz and later in Brussels, where [[Adolphe Quetelet]] was one of their tutors.{{sfn|Hobhouse|1983|p=16}} Like many other German princes, Albert studied at the [[University of Bonn]] as a young adult. He studied law, political economy, philosophy, and art history. He played music and excelled in gymnastics, especially [[fencing (sport)|fencing]] and riding.{{sfn|Weintraub|1997|pp=60–62}} His teachers in Bonn included the philosopher [[Immanuel Hermann Fichte|Fichte]] and the poet [[August Wilhelm Schlegel|Schlegel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ames|1968|p=15}} and {{harvnb|Weintraub|1997|pp=56–60}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage==
[[File:Prince Albert 1842.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Early hand-coloured [[daguerreotype]] of Prince Albert, 1848]]
By 1836, the idea of marriage between Albert and his cousin, Victoria, had arisen in the mind of their ambitious uncle, [[Leopold I of Belgium|Leopold]], who had been [[King of the Belgians]] since 1831.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hobhouse|1983|pp=15–16}} and {{harvnb|Weintraub|1997|pp=43–49}}.&lt;/ref&gt; At this time, Victoria was the [[heir presumptive|heiress presumptive]] to the British throne. Her father, [[Edward Augustus, Duke of Kent]], the fourth son of King [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]], had died when she was a baby, and her childless elderly uncle, [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV]], was king. Her mother, the Duchess of Kent, [[Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld]], was the sister of both Albert's father—the Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha—and Leopold, King of the Belgians. Leopold arranged for his sister, Victoria's mother, to invite the Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha and his two sons to visit her in May 1836, with the purpose of meeting Victoria.&lt;!--Weintraub, pp. 43–49--&gt; King William IV, however, disapproved of any match with the Coburgs, and instead favoured the suit of [[Prince Alexander of the Netherlands|Prince Alexander]], second son of the [[William II of the Netherlands|Prince of Orange]].&lt;!--Weintraub, pp. 43–49--&gt; Victoria was well aware of the various matrimonial plans and critically appraised a parade of eligible princes.{{sfn|Weintraub|1997|pp=43–49}} She wrote, &quot;[Albert] is extremely handsome; his hair is about the same colour as mine; his eyes are large and blue, and he has a beautiful nose and a very sweet mouth with fine teeth; but the charm of his countenance is his expression, which is most delightful.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;vic&quot;&gt;Victoria quoted in {{harvnb|Weintraub|1997|p=49}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander, on the other hand, was &quot;very plain&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;vic&quot; /&gt;

Victoria wrote to her uncle Leopold to thank him &quot;for the prospect of ''great'' happiness you have contributed to give me, in the person of dear Albert&amp;nbsp;... He possesses every quality that could be desired to render me perfectly happy.&quot;{{sfn|Weintraub|1997|p=51}} Although the parties did not undertake a formal engagement, both the family and their retainers widely assumed that the match would take place.{{sfn|Weintraub|1997|pp=53, 58, 64, and 65}}

Victoria came to the throne aged just eighteen on 20 June 1837. Her letters of the time show interest in Albert's education for the role he would have to play, although she resisted attempts to rush her into marriage.{{sfn|Weintraub|1997|p=62}} In the winter of 1838–39, the prince visited Italy, accompanied by the Coburg family's confidential adviser, [[Christian Friedrich Freiherr von Stockmar|Baron Stockmar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hobhouse|1983|pp=17–18}} and {{harvnb|Weintraub|1997|p=67}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Albert returned to England with Ernest in October 1839 to visit the Queen, with the object of settling the marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fulford|1949|p=42}} and {{harvnb|Weintraub|1997|pp=77–81}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Albert and Victoria felt mutual affection and the Queen proposed to him on 15 October 1839.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fulford|1949|pp=42–43}}; {{harvnb|Hobhouse|1983|p=20}} and {{harvnb|Weintraub|1997|pp=77–81}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Victoria's intention to marry was declared formally to the [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|Privy Council]] on 23 November,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fulford|1949|p=45}}; {{harvnb|Hobhouse|1983|p=21}} and {{harvnb|Weintraub|1997|p=86}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the couple married on 10 February 1840 at the [[Chapel Royal]], [[St. James's Palace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fulford|1949|p=52}} and {{harvnb|Hobhouse|1983|p=24}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Just before the marriage, Albert was naturalised by Act of Parliament,&lt;ref name=&quot;London Gazette 14 February 1840&quot;&gt;{{London Gazette | issue = 19826 | date = 14 February 1840 | startpage = 302 | accessdate =20 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and granted the style of ''Royal Highness'' by an [[Order in Council]].&lt;ref name=&quot;London Gazette 7 February 1840&quot;&gt;{{London Gazette | issue = 19821 | date = 7 February 1840 | startpage = 241 | accessdate =20 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At first, he was not popular with the British public. He was perceived to be from an impoverished and undistinguished minor state, barely larger than a small English county.{{sfn|Fulford|1949|p=45}} The [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]], [[William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne|Lord Melbourne]], advised the Queen against granting her husband the title of &quot;[[King Consort]]&quot;. Parliament even refused to make Albert a [[British peerage|peer]]—partly because of anti-German feeling and a desire to exclude Albert from any political role.{{sfn|Weintraub|1997|p=88}} Melbourne led a minority government and the opposition took advantage of the marriage to weaken his position further.&lt;!--Weintraub, p. 89--&gt; They opposed the ennoblement of Albert and granted him a smaller annuity than previous consorts,{{sfn|Weintraub|1997|pp=8–9 and 89}} £30,000 instead of the usual £50,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fulford|1949|p=47}} and {{harvnb|Hobhouse|1983|pp=23–24}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Albert claimed that he had no need of a British peerage; he wrote, &quot;It would almost be a step downwards, for as a Duke of Saxony, I feel myself much higher than a Duke of York or Kent&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in {{harvnb|Jagow|1938|p=37}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For the next seventeen years, Albert was formally titled &quot;HRH Prince Albert&quot; until, on 25 June 1857, Victoria formally granted him the title [[Prince Consort]].&lt;ref name=&quot;London Gazette 26 June 1857&quot;&gt;{{London Gazette | issue = 22015 | date = 26 June 1857 | startpage = 2195| accessdate =20 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consort of the Queen==
{{House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (UK)|albert}}
The position in which the prince was placed by his marriage, while one of distinction, also offered considerable difficulties; in Albert's own words, &quot;I am very happy and contented; but the difficulty in filling my place with the proper dignity is that I am only the husband, not the master in the house.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Albert to William von Lowenstein, May 1840, quoted in {{harvnb|Hobhouse|1983|p=26}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Queen's household was run by her former governess,&lt;ref&gt;Or more properly &quot;Lady Attendant&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Baroness Louise Lehzen|Baroness Lehzen]]. Albert referred to her as the &quot;House Dragon&quot;, and manoeuvred to dislodge the Baroness from her position.{{sfn|Fulford|1949|pp=59–74}}

Within two months of the marriage, Victoria was pregnant. Albert started to take on public roles; he became President of the Society for the Extinction of Slavery (slavery had already been abolished throughout the British Empire, but was still lawful in places such as the United States and the colonies of France); and helped Victoria privately with her government paperwork.{{sfn|Weintraub|1997|pp=102–105}} In June 1840, while on a public carriage ride, Albert and the pregnant Victoria were shot at by [[Edward Oxford]], who was later judged insane. Neither was hurt and Albert was praised in the newspapers for his courage and coolness during the attack.{{sfn|Weintraub|1997|pp=106–107}} Albert was gaining public support as well as political influence, which showed itself practically when, in August, Parliament passed the [[Regency Acts#Regency Act 1840|Regency Act 1840]] to designate him [[Regent]] in the event of Victoria's death before their child reached the age of majority.{{sfn|Weintraub|1997|p=107}} Their first child, [[Victoria, Princess Royal|Victoria]], named after her mother, was born in November. Eight other children would follow over the next seventeen years. All nine children survived to adulthood, a fact which biographer Hermione Hobhouse credited to Albert's &quot;enlightened influence&quot; on the healthy running of the nursery.{{sfn|Hobhouse|1983|p=28}} In early 1841, he successfully removed the nursery from Lehzen's pervasive control, and in September 1842, Lehzen left England permanently—much to Albert's relief.{{sfn|Fulford|1949|pp=73–74}}

After the [[United Kingdom general election, 1841|1841 general election]], Melbourne was replaced as Prime Minister by [[Sir Robert Peel]], who appointed Albert as chairman of the [[Royal Commission]] in charge of redecorating the new [[Palace of Westminster]]. The Palace had [[Burning of Parliament|burnt down seven years before]], and was being rebuilt. As a patron and purchaser of pictures and sculpture, the commission was set up to promote the fine arts in Britain. The commission's work was slow, and the architect, [[Charles Barry]], took many decisions out of the commissioners' hands by decorating rooms with ornate furnishings which were treated as part of the architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ames|1968|pp=48–55}}; {{harvnb|Fulford|1949|pp=212–213}} and {{harvnb|Hobhouse|1983|pp=82–88}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Albert was more successful as a private patron and collector.&lt;!--Ames, pp. 132–146, 200–222 and Hobhouse, pp. 70–78--&gt; Among his notable purchases were early German and Italian paintings—such as [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]]'s ''Apollo and Diana'' and [[Fra Angelico]]'s ''St. Peter Martyr''—and contemporary pieces from [[Franz Xaver Winterhalter]] and [[Edwin Landseer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ames|1968|pp=132–146, 200–222}} and {{harvnb|Hobhouse|1983|pp=70–78}}. The [[National Gallery, London]], received 25 paintings in 1863 [http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/collectors/prince-albert-and-the-gallery presented by Queen Victoria at the Prince Consort's wish]. See [[#External links|external links]] for works in the [[Royal Collection]].&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Ludwig Gruner, of Dresden, assisted Albert in buying pictures of the highest quality.{{sfn|Cust|1907|pp=162–170}}

Albert and Victoria were shot at again on both 29 and 30 May 1842, but were unhurt. The culprit, John Francis, was detained and condemned to death, although he was later reprieved.{{sfn|Weintraub|1997|pp=134–135}} Some of their early unpopularity came about because of their stiffness and adherence to protocol in public, though in private the couple were more easy-going.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ames|1968|p=172}}; {{harvnb|Fulford|1949|pp=95–104}} and {{harvnb|Weintraub|1997|p=141}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In early 1844, Victoria and Albert were apart for the first time since their marriage when he returned to Coburg on the death of his father.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ames|1968|p=60}} and {{harvnb|Weintraub|1997|p=154}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Osborne House c1910 - Project Gutenberg eText 17296.jpg|thumb|left|[[Osborne House]], Isle of Wight]]
By 1844, Albert had managed to modernise the royal finances and, through various economies, had sufficient capital to purchase [[Osborne House]] on the [[Isle of Wight]] as a private residence for their growing family.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fulford|1949|p=79}}; {{harvnb|Hobhouse|1983|p=131}} and {{harvnb|Weintraub|1997|p=158}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next few years a house modelled in the style of an Italianate villa was built to the designs of Albert and [[Thomas Cubitt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ames|1968|pp=61–71}}; {{harvnb|Fulford|1949|p=79}}; {{harvnb|Hobhouse|1983|p=121}} and {{harvnb|Weintraub|1997|p=181}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Albert laid out the grounds, and improved the estate and farm.{{sfn|Hobhouse|1983|pp=127, 131}} Albert managed and improved the other royal estates; his model farm at [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]] was admired by his biographers,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fulford|1949|pp=88–89}} and {{harvnb|Hobhouse|1983|pp=121–127}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and under his stewardship the revenues of the [[Duchy of Cornwall]]—the hereditary property of the Prince of Wales—steadily increased.{{sfn|Weintraub 2004}}

Unlike many landowners who approved of child labour and opposed Peel's repeal of the [[Corn Laws]], Albert supported moves to raise working ages and free up trade.{{sfn|Fulford|1949|p=116}} In 1846, Albert was rebuked by [[Lord George Bentinck]] when he attended the debate on the Corn Laws in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] to give tacit support to Peel.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fulford|1949|p=116}} and {{harvnb|Hobhouse|1983|pp=39–40}}.&lt;/ref&gt; During Peel's premiership, Albert's authority behind, or beside, the throne became more apparent. He had access to all the Queen's papers, was drafting her correspondence{{sfn|Hobhouse|1983|pp=36–37}} and was present when she met her ministers, or even saw them alone in her absence.{{sfn|Fulford|1949|p=118}} The clerk of the Privy Council, [[Charles Greville (diarist)|Charles Greville]], wrote of him: &quot;He is King to all intents and purposes.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Greville's diary volume V, p. 257 quoted in {{harvnb|Fulford|1949|p=117}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reformer and innovator==
In 1847, he was elected [[Chancellor (education)|Chancellor]] of the [[University of Cambridge]], but only after a [[University of Cambridge Chancellor election, 1847|close contest]] with [[Edward Herbert, 2nd Earl of Powis|the Earl of Powis]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fulford|1949|pp=195–196}}; {{harvnb|Hobhouse|1983|p=65}} and {{harvnb|Weintraub|1997|pp=182–184}}.&lt;/ref&gt; who was killed accidentally by his own son during a pheasant shoot the following year.{{sfn|Weintraub|1997|p=186}} Albert used his position as Chancellor to campaign successfully for reformed and more modern university curricula, expanding the subjects taught beyond the traditional mathematics and classics to include modern history and the natural sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fulford|1949|pp=198–199}}; {{harvnb|Hobhouse|1983|p=65}} and {{harvnb|Weintraub|1997|pp=187 and 207}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

That summer, Victoria and Albert spent a rainy holiday in the west of Scotland at [[Loch Laggan]], but heard from their doctor, Sir James Clark, that his son had enjoyed dry, sunny days further east at [[Balmoral Castle]].&lt;!--Weintraub, pp. 189–191--&gt; The tenant of Balmoral, [[Robert Gordon (diplomat)|Sir Robert Gordon]], died suddenly in early October, and Albert began negotiations to take over the lease of the castle from the owner, [[James Duff, 4th Earl Fife|the Earl Fife]].{{sfn|Weintraub|1997|pp=189–191}} In May the following year, Albert leased Balmoral, which he had never visited, and in September 1848 he, his wife and the older children went there for the first time.{{sfn|Weintraub|1997|pp=193, 212, 214 and 203 and 206}} They came to relish the privacy it afforded.&lt;ref&gt;Extracts from the Queen's journal of the holidays were published in 1868 as ''Leaves from the Journal of Our Life in the Highlands''.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Crystal Palace from the northeast from Dickinson's Comprehensive Pictures of the Great Exhibition of 1851. 1854.jpg|thumb|The [[Great Exhibition of 1851]] was housed in [[the Crystal Palace]] in [[Hyde Park, London]].]]

[[Revolutions of 1848|Revolutions spread throughout Europe in 1848]] as the result of a widespread economic crisis.&lt;!--Weintraub, pp. 192 ff.--&gt; Throughout the year, Victoria and Albert complained about [[Henry Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Foreign Secretary Palmerston's]] independent foreign policy, which they believed destabilised foreign European powers further.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fulford|1949|pp=119–128}} and {{harvnb|Weintraub|1997|pp=193, 212, 214 and 264–265}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Albert was concerned for many of his royal relatives, a number of whom were deposed.&lt;!--Weintraub, pp. 192–201--&gt; He and Victoria, who gave birth to their daughter [[Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll|Louise]] during that year, spent some time away from London in the relative safety of Osborne.&lt;!--Weintraub, pp. 192–201--&gt; Although there were sporadic demonstrations in England, no effective revolutionary action took place, and Albert even gained public acclaim when he expressed paternalistic, yet well-meaning and philanthropic, views.{{sfn|Weintraub|1997|pp=192–201}} In a speech to the Society for the Improvement of the Condition of the Labouring Classes, of which he was President, he expressed his &quot;sympathy and interest for that class of our community who have most of the toil and fewest of the enjoyments of this world&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;spe&quot;&gt;The text of the speech was widely reproduced, e.g. &quot;The Condition of the Labouring Classes&quot;. ''[[The Times]]'', 19 May 1848, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; It was the &quot;duty of those who, under the blessings of Divine Providence, enjoy station, wealth, and education&quot; to assist those less fortunate than themselves.&lt;ref name=&quot;spe&quot; /&gt;

A man of progressive and relatively liberal ideas,&lt;!--shown by his support for emancipation, technological progress, science education, Charles Darwin, and the welfare of the working class--&gt; Albert not only led reforms in university education, welfare, the royal finances and slavery, he had a special interest in applying science and art to the manufacturing industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fulford|1949|pp=216–217}} and {{harvnb|Hobhouse|1983|pp=89–108}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Great Exhibition of 1851]] arose from the annual exhibitions of the [[Society of Arts]], of which Albert was President from 1843, and owed most of its success to his efforts to promote it.{{sfn|Weintraub 2004}}{{sfn|Fulford|1949|pp=219–220}} Albert served as president of the [[Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851]], and had to fight for every stage of the project.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. {{harvnb|Fulford|1949|p=221}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[House of Lords]], [[Henry Brougham, 1st Baron Brougham and Vaux|Lord Brougham]] fulminated against the proposal to hold the exhibition in [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]].{{sfn|Fulford|1949|p=220}} Opponents of the exhibition prophesied that foreign rogues and revolutionists would overrun England, subvert the morals of the people, and destroy their faith.{{sfn|Fulford|1949|pp=217–222}} Albert thought such talk absurd and quietly persevered, trusting always that British manufacturing would benefit from exposure to the best products of foreign countries.{{sfn|Weintraub 2004}}

The Queen opened the exhibition in a specially designed and built glass building known as [[the Crystal Palace]] on 1 May 1851. It proved a colossal success.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fulford|1949|p=222}} and {{harvnb|Hobhouse|1983|p=110}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A surplus of £180,000 was used to purchase land in [[South Kensington]] on which to establish educational and cultural institutions—including what would later be named the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]].{{sfn|Hobhouse|1983|p=110}} The area was referred to as &quot;[[Albertopolis]]&quot; by sceptics.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ames|1968|p=120}}; {{harvnb|Hobhouse|1983|p=x}} and {{harvnb|Weintraub|1997|p=263}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1852, a timely legacy to the Royal Family made it possible&lt;!--odnb--&gt; for Albert to obtain the [[Freehold (Scots law)|freehold]] of Balmoral, and as usual he embarked on an extensive program of improvements.{{sfn|Hobhouse|1983|p=145}} The same year, he was appointed to several of the offices left vacant by the death of [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|the Duke of Wellington]], including the mastership of [[Trinity House]] and [[Grenadier Guards#Colonels-in-Chief|the colonelcy of the Grenadier Guards]].{{sfn|Weintraub|1997|pp=270–274 and 281–282}} With Wellington out of the picture, Albert was able to propose and campaign for modernisation of the army, which was long overdue.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hobhouse|1983|pp=42–43, 47–50}} and {{harvnb|Weintraub|1997|pp=274–276}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Thinking that the military was unready for war, and that Christian rule was preferable to Islamic rule, Albert counselled a diplomatic solution to conflict between the [[Russian Empire|Russian]] and [[Ottoman empire]]s.&lt;!--Weintraub, pp. 288–293--&gt; Palmerston was more bellicose, and favoured a policy which would prevent further Russian expansion.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. {{harvnb|Fulford|1949|pp=128, 153–157}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Palmerston was manoeuvred out of the cabinet in December 1853, but at about the same time a Russian fleet attacked the Ottoman fleet at anchor at [[Battle of Sinop|Sinop]].&lt;!--Weintraub, pp. 288–293--&gt; The London press depicted the attack as a criminal massacre, and Palmerston's popularity surged as Albert's fell.{{sfn|Weintraub|1997|pp=288–293}} Within two weeks, Palmerston was re-appointed as a minister. As public outrage at the Russian action continued, absurd rumours circulated that Albert had been arrested for treason.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fulford|1949|pp=156–157}} and {{harvnb|Weintraub|1997|pp=294–302}}.&lt;/ref&gt; By March 1854, Britain and Russia were embroiled in the [[Crimean War]]. Albert devised a masterplan for winning the war by laying siege to Sevastopol while starving Russia economically, which became the Allied strategy after the Tsar decided to fight a purely defensive war.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, Jules ''Albert: A Life'' (2012) p. 153-154&lt;/ref&gt; Early British optimism soon faded as the press reported that British troops were ill-equipped and mismanaged by aged generals using out-of-date tactics and strategy.&lt;!--Weintraub, pp. 303–322--&gt; The conflict dragged on as the Russians were as poorly prepared as their opponents.&lt;!--Weintraub, pp. 303–322--&gt; The Prime Minister, [[George Gordon, 4th Earl of Aberdeen|Lord Aberdeen]], resigned and Palmerston succeeded him.{{sfn|Weintraub|1997|pp=303–322, 328}} A negotiated settlement eventually put an end to the war with the [[Treaty of Paris (1856)|Treaty of Paris]].&lt;!--Weintraub, pp. 326 ff.--&gt; During the war, Albert arranged to marry his fourteen-year-old daughter, Victoria, to [[Frederick III, German Emperor|Prince Frederick William of Prussia]], though Albert delayed the marriage until Victoria was seventeen.&lt;!--Weintraub, pp. 326 ff.--&gt; Albert hoped that his daughter and son-in-law would be a liberalising influence in the enlarging [[Prussia]]n state.{{sfn|Weintraub|1997|pp=326 and 330}}

Albert involved himself in promoting many public educational institutions. Chiefly at meetings in connection with these he spoke of the need for better schooling.{{sfn|Hobhouse|1983|p=63}} A collection of his speeches was published in 1857. Recognised as a supporter of education and technological progress, he was invited to speak at scientific meetings, such as the memorable address he delivered as president of the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]] when it met at [[Aberdeen, Scotland|Aberdeen]] in 1859.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darby|Smith|1983|p=84}}; {{harvnb|Hobhouse|1983|pp=61–62}} and {{harvnb|Weintraub|1997|p=232}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His espousal of science spawned opposition from the Church.&lt;!--Weintraub, p. 232--&gt; His proposal of a knighthood for [[Charles Darwin]], after the publication of ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', was rejected.{{sfn|Weintraub|1997|p=232}}

Albert continued to devote himself to the education of his family and the management of the royal household.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fulford|1949|pp=71–105}} and {{harvnb|Hobhouse|1983|pp=26–43}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His children's governess, [[Sarah Lyttelton, Baroness Lyttelton|Lady Lyttelton]], thought him unusually kind and patient, and described him joining in family games with enthusiasm.&lt;ref&gt;Lady Lyttelton's journal quoted in {{harvnb|Fulford|1949|p=95}} and her correspondence quoted in {{harvnb|Hobhouse|1983|p=29}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He felt keenly the departure of his eldest daughter for Prussia when she married her fiancé at the beginning of 1858,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fulford|1949|p=252}} and {{harvnb|Weintraub|1997|p=355}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and was disappointed that his eldest son, [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|the Prince of Wales]], did not respond well to the intense educational programme that Albert had designed for him.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fulford|1949|pp=253–257}} and {{harvnb|Weintraub|1997|p=367}}.&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of seven, the Prince of Wales was expected to take six hours of instruction, including an hour of German and an hour of French every day.{{sfn|Fulford|1949|p=255}} When the Prince of Wales failed at his lessons, Albert caned him.&lt;ref&gt;Diary of Sir James Clark quoted in {{harvnb|Fulford|1949|p=256}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Corporal punishment was common at the time, and was not thought unduly harsh.{{sfn|Fulford|1949|p=260}} Albert's biographer [[Roger Fulford]] wrote that the relationships between the family members were &quot;friendly, affectionate and normal&amp;nbsp;... there is no evidence either in the Royal Archives or in the printed authorities to justify the belief that the relations between the Prince and his eldest son were other than deeply affectionate.&quot;{{sfn|Fulford|1949|pp=261–262}} [[Sir Philip Magnus-Allcroft, 2nd Baronet|Philip Magnus]] wrote in his biography of Albert's eldest son that Albert &quot;tried to treat his children as equals; and they were able to penetrate his stiffness and reserve because they realised instinctively not only that he loved them but that he enjoyed and needed their company.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Sir Philip Magnus-Allcroft, 2nd Baronet|Magnus, Philip]] (1964) ''King Edward VII'', pp. 19–20, quoted in {{harvnb|Hobhouse|1983|pp=28–29}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Final year==
[[File:Albert, Prince Consort by JJE Mayall, 1860 crop.png|thumb|left|upright|Albert in 1860]]
Albert was seriously ill with stomach cramps in August 1859.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, Jules ''Albert: A Life'' (2012) p. 182&lt;/ref&gt; During a trip to Coburg in the autumn of 1860, Albert was driving alone in a carriage drawn by four horses that suddenly bolted. As the horses continued to gallop toward a stationary wagon waiting at a railway crossing, Albert jumped for his life from the carriage.&lt;!--Weintraub, pp. 392–393--&gt; One of the horses was killed in the collision, and Albert was badly shaken, though his only physical injuries were cuts and bruises.&lt;!--Weintraub, pp. 392–393--&gt; He told his brother and eldest daughter that he sensed his time had come.{{sfn|Weintraub|1997|pp=392–393}}

In 1861, Victoria's mother and Albert's aunt, [[Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld|the Duchess of Kent]], died and Victoria was grief-stricken; Albert took on most of the Queen's duties, despite being ill himself with chronic stomach trouble.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hobhouse|1983|pp=150–151}} and {{harvnb|Weintraub|1997|p=401}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The last public event he presided over was the opening of the Royal Horticultural Gardens on 5 June 1861.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, Jules ''Albert: A Life'' (2012) p. 198&lt;/ref&gt; In August, Victoria and Albert visited the [[Curragh Camp]], Ireland, where the Prince of Wales was doing army service. At Curragh, the Prince of Wales was introduced, by his fellow officers, to [[Nellie Clifden]], an Irish actress.{{sfn|Weintraub|1997|p=404}}

By November, Victoria and Albert had returned to Windsor, and the Prince of Wales had returned to Cambridge, where he was a student. Two of Albert's cousins, [[Pedro V of Portugal|King Pedro V]] and [[Prince Ferdinand of Portugal]], died of [[typhoid fever]].{{sfn|Weintraub|1997|p=405}} On top of this news, Albert was informed that gossip was spreading in [[gentlemen's club]]s and the foreign press that the Prince of Wales was still involved with Nellie Clifden.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hobhouse|1983|p=152}} and {{harvnb|Weintraub|1997|p=406}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Albert and Victoria were horrified by their son's indiscretion, and feared blackmail, scandal or pregnancy.{{sfn|Weintraub|1997|p=406}} Although Albert was ill and at a low ebb, he travelled to Cambridge to see the Prince of Wales&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hobhouse|1983|p=154}} and {{harvnb|Fulford|1949|p=266}}.&lt;/ref&gt; to discuss his son's indiscreet affair.{{sfn|Weintraub 2004}}&lt;!--This is a presumption not made by Fulford or Hobhouse. No one knows what the Prince and Albert discussed because there are no records of the conversations they had. However, it is reasonable to assume that they did discuss it, and Weintraub does make this assumption.--&gt; In his final weeks Albert suffered from pains in his back and legs.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, Jules ''Albert: A Life'' (2012) p. 203&lt;/ref&gt;

When the [[Trent Affair]]—the forcible removal of [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] envoys from a British ship by [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] forces during the [[American Civil War]]—threatened war between the United States and Britain, Albert was gravely ill, but intervened to soften the British diplomatic response.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hobhouse|1983|pp=154–155}}; {{harvnb|Martin|1874–80|pp=418–426, vol. V}} and {{harvnb|Weintraub|1997|pp=408–424}}.&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 December, one of Albert's doctors, [[Sir William Jenner, 1st Baronet|William Jenner]], diagnosed typhoid fever. Congestion of the lungs supervened, and Albert died at 10:50&amp;nbsp;p.m. on 14 December 1861 in the Blue Room at [[Windsor Castle]], in the presence of the Queen and five&lt;!--Edward, Alice, Louise, Helena and Arthur. Victoria was in Germany, Leopold in France, Alfred at sea, and Beatrice (the youngest) remained outside (Hobhouse, p. 156)--&gt; of their nine children.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darby|Smith|1983|p=3}}; {{harvnb|Hobhouse|1983|p=156}} and {{harvnb|Weintraub|1997|pp=425–431}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The contemporary diagnosis was typhoid fever, but modern writers have pointed out that Albert was ill for at least two years before his death, which may indicate that a chronic disease, such as [[Crohn's disease]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Paulley, J.W.|year=1993|title=The death of Albert Prince Consort: the case against typhoid fever|journal=QJM|volume=86|issue=12|pages=837–841|url=http://qjmed.oxfordjournals.org/content/86/12/837.short|pmid=8108541}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[renal failure]], or cancer, was the cause of death.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. {{harvnb|Hobhouse|1983|pp=150–151}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Albert Memorial, London - May 2008.jpg|thumb|[[Albert Memorial]], London]]
The Queen's grief was overwhelming, and the tepid feelings the public had felt previously for Albert were replaced by sympathy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darby|Smith|1983|p=1}}; {{harvnb|Hobhouse|1983|p=158}} and {{harvnb|Weintraub|1997|p=436}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Victoria wore black in mourning for the rest of her long life, and Albert's rooms in all his houses were kept as they had been, even with hot water brought in the morning, and linen and towels changed daily.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darby|Smith|1983|pp=1–4}} and {{harvnb|Weintraub|1997|p=436}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Such practices were not uncommon in the houses of the very rich.{{sfn|Weintraub|1997|p=438}} Victoria withdrew from public life and her seclusion eroded some of Albert's work in attempting to re-model the monarchy as a national institution setting a moral, if not political, example.{{sfn|Weintraub|1997|pp=441–443}} Albert is credited with introducing the principle that the [[British Royal Family]] should remain above politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fulford|1949|pp=57–58, 276}} and {{harvnb|Hobhouse|1983|pp=viii, 39}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Before his marriage to Victoria, she supported the [[British Whig Party|Whigs]]; for example, early in her reign Victoria managed to [[Bedchamber Crisis|thwart the formation of a Tory government]] by [[Sir Robert Peel]] by refusing to accept substitutions which Peel wanted to make among her ladies-in-waiting.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fulford|1949|p=67}} and {{harvnb|Hobhouse|1983|p=34}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Albert's body was temporarily entombed in [[St. George's Chapel, Windsor Castle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darby|Smith|1983|p=21}} and {{harvnb|Hobhouse|1983|p=158}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The mausoleum at [[Frogmore]], in which his remains were deposited a year after his death, was not fully completed until 1871.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darby|Smith|1983|p=28}} and {{harvnb|Hobhouse|1983|p=162}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The sarcophagus, in which both he and the Queen were eventually laid, was carved from the largest block of granite that had ever been quarried in Britain.{{sfn|Darby|Smith|1983|p=25}} Despite Albert's request that no effigies of him should be raised, many public monuments were erected all over the country, and across the British Empire.{{sfn|Darby|Smith|1983|pp=2, 6, 58–84}} The most notable are the [[Royal Albert Hall]] and the [[Albert Memorial]] in London. The plethora of memorials erected to Albert became so great that [[Charles Dickens]] told a friend that he sought an &quot;inaccessible cave&quot; to escape from them.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Dickens to [[John Leech (caricaturist)|John Leech]], quoted in {{harvnb|Darby|Smith|1983|p=102}} and {{harvnb|Hobhouse|1983|p=169}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

All manner of objects are named after Prince Albert, from [[Lake Albert (Africa)|Lake Albert]] in Africa to the city of [[Prince Albert, Saskatchewan]], to the [[Albert Medal (RSA)|Albert Medal]] presented by the [[Royal Society of Arts]]. Four regiments of the British Army were named after him: [[11th (Prince Albert's Own) Hussars]]; [[Prince Albert's Light Infantry]]; [[Prince Albert's Own Leicestershire Regiment of Yeomanry Cavalry]], and [[The Prince Consort's Own Rifle Brigade]]. He and Queen Victoria showed a keen interest in the establishment and development of [[Aldershot]] in [[Hampshire]] as a [[garrison|garrison town]] in the 1850s. They had a wooden Royal Pavilion built there in which they would often stay when attending reviews of the army.{{sfn|Hobhouse|1983|pp=48–49}} Albert established and endowed the [[Prince Consort's Library]] at [[Aldershot]], which still exists today.{{sfn|Hobhouse|1983|p=53}}

Biographies published after his death were typically heavy on eulogy. [[Theodore Martin]]'s five-volume ''magnum opus'' was authorised and supervised by Queen Victoria, and her influence shows in its pages. Nevertheless, it is an accurate and exhaustive account.{{sfn|Fulford|1949|pp=ix–x}} [[Lytton Strachey]]'s ''Queen Victoria'' (1921) was more critical, but it was discredited in part by mid-twentieth-century biographers such as [[Hector Bolitho]] and [[Roger Fulford]], who (unlike Strachey) had access to Victoria's journal and letters.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. {{harvnb|Fulford|1949|pp=22–23, 44, 104, 167, 209, 240}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Popular myths about Prince Albert—such as the claim that he introduced [[Christmas tree]]s to Britain—are dismissed by scholars.{{sfn|Armstrong|2008}} Recent biographers, such as [[Stanley Weintraub]], portray Albert as a figure in a tragic romance, who died too soon and was mourned by his lover for a lifetime.{{sfn|Weintraub 2004}} In the 2009 movie ''[[The Young Victoria]]'', Albert, played by [[Rupert Friend]], is made into an heroic character; in the fictionalised depiction of the 1840 shooting, he is struck by a bullet—something that did not happen in real life.{{sfn|Jurgensen 2009}}{{sfn|Knight 2009}}

===Arms===
On his marriage to Queen Victoria in 1840, Prince Albert was granted his own personal [[coat of arms]], which was the [[royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom]] [[Cadency|differenced]] with a three-point [[Label (heraldry)|label]] bearing a red cross in the centre, [[Quartering (heraldry)|quartered]] with the [[Coat of arms of Saxony|arms of Saxony]].&lt;ref name=&quot;London Gazette 7 February 1840&quot; /&gt;{{sfn|Louda|Maclagan|1999|p=30, 32}} The [[blazon]] is written as: &quot;Quarterly, 1st and 4th, the Royal Arms, with overall a label of three points [[Argent]] charged on the centre with cross [[Gules]]; 2nd and 3rd, [[Barry (heraldry)|Barry]] of ten [[Or (heraldry)|Or]] and [[Sable]], a crown of rue in [[Bend (heraldry)|bend]] [[Vert]]&quot;.{{sfn|Pinches|Pinches|1974|pp=329, 241, 309–310}} The Prince's peculiar arms was a &quot;singular example of quartering differenced arms, [which] is not in accordance with the rules of Heraldry, and is in itself an heraldic contradiction.&quot;{{sfn|Boutell|Aveling|2010|p=285}} Prior to his marriage he used the arms of his father, undifferenced.

On his stallplate as a Knight of the Garter his coat of arms is ensigned by a royal crown and shows the six crests of the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha; these are from left to right: 1. &quot;A bull's head caboshed Gules armed and ringed Argent, crowned Or, the rim [[chequy]] Gules and Argent&quot; for [[County of Mark|Mark]]. 2. &quot;Out of a coronet Or, two buffalo's horns Argent, attached to the outer edge of each five branches [[fess]]wise each with three linden leaves Vert&quot; for [[Thuringia]]. 3. &quot;Out of a coronet Or, a pyramidal chapeau charged with the arms of Saxony ensigned by a plume of peacock's feathers Proper out of a coronet also Or&quot; for [[Duchy of Saxony|Saxony]]. 4. &quot;A bearded man in profile couped below the shoulders clothed [[Variation of the field#Barry, Paly, Bendy|paly]] Argent and Gules, the pointed coronet similarly paly terminating in a plume of three peacock's feathers&quot; for [[Meissen]]. 5. &quot;A demi griffin displayed Or, winged Sable, collared and langued Gules&quot; for [[Jülich]]. 6. &quot;Out of a coronet Or, a panache of peacock's feathers Proper&quot; for [[Berg (state)|Berg]].{{sfn|Pinches|Pinches|1974|pp=329, 241, 309–310}}

The supporters were the crowned lion of England and the unicorn of Scotland (as in the Royal Arms) charged on the shoulder with a label as in the arms. Albert's personal motto is the German ''Treu und Fest'' (Loyal and Sure).{{sfn|Pinches|Pinches|1974|pp=329, 241, 309–310}} This motto was also used by [[11th Hussars|Prince Albert's Own or the 11th Hussars]].

All of Albert's male-line descendants were entitled to bear an [[inescutcheon]] of the arms of Saxony at the centre of their respective coat of arms. The inescutcheon was placed, as [[Charles Boutell]] writes, as an &quot;escutcheon of pretence&amp;nbsp;[that] does not appear to be in accordance with either the spirit or the practical usage of true historical Heraldry&quot;.{{sfn|Boutell|1863|p=256}} However in 1917, during the First World War, King [[George V]] abandoned heraldic references to the royal family's German heritage, and the Saxon shield was removed.
