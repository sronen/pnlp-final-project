'''Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan''' [[Order of St. Sylvester|KCSS]] ({{lang-ur|صدرالّدين آغا خان}}, {{transl|ar|Ṣadr ad-Dīn Āghā Khān}}, {{Nowrap|17 January}} 1933 – {{Nowrap|12 May}} 2003) served as [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] from 1966 to 1978, during which he reoriented the agency's focus beyond Europe and prepared it for an explosion of complex refugee issues. He was also a proponent of greater collaboration between [[non-governmental organizations]] (NGOs) and UN agencies. The Prince's interest in [[ecology|ecological]] issues led him to establish the [[Bellerive Foundation]] in the late 1970s, and he was a knowledgeable and respected collector of [[Islamic art]].

Born in [[Paris]], France, he was the son of [[Aga Khan III|Sir Sultan Mahomed Shah Aga Khan]] and Princess Andrée Aga Khan. He married twice, but had no children of his own. Prince Sadruddin died of [[cancer]] at the age of 70, and was buried in [[Switzerland]].

==Life and career==

===Childhood and education===
Born in [[Neuilly-sur-Seine]], France, he was the only child of [[Pakistan]]i [[Aga Khan III|Sir Sultan Mahomed Shah Aga Khan&amp;nbsp;III]] and his  [[French people|French]]-born second wife, the former Andrée Joséphine Carron. He received his early education in [[Lausanne]], [[Switzerland]], before graduating [[Phi Beta Kappa]] in 1954 from [[Harvard College]].&lt;ref name=&quot;SydneyHerald2003&quot;/&gt; At Harvard, he roomed with [[Paul Matisse]], grandson of French artist [[Henri Matisse]], with future [[Paris Review]] founders [[George Plimpton]] and [[John Train]], and with [[Stephen James Joyce|Stephen Joyce]], grandson of Irish writer [[James Joyce]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Reed | first = Christopher | title = Pure Fabrications | journal = [[Harvard Magazine]] | issue = May–June 2002 | date = May–June 2002 | url = http://www.harvardmagazine.com/on-line/050244.html | accessdate=13 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After three years of post-graduate research at the Harvard Center for Middle Eastern Studies, Prince Sadruddin began a lifelong career of international service.&lt;ref name=&quot;Times2003&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/printFriendly/0%2C%2C1-45-681660%2C00.html |title=Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan (Obituary) |work=[[The Times]] |date=16 May 2003 |accessdate=13 October 2010 |publisher=[[News Corporation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PRAgaKhan2003&quot;/&gt;

Although he was raised in Europe by his French mother, his father, who was the 48th hereditary [[Imam]] of the [[Nizari]] [[Ismaili|Ismaili Muslims]], had a strong influence on him. He recalled that his father &quot;insisted that I learnt the Koran and encouraged me to understand the basic traditions and beliefs of Islam but without imposing any particular views. He was an overwhelming personality but open-minded and liberal.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Telegraph1998&quot;/&gt;

Together with his father Prince Sadruddin traveled widely in [[Muslim world#Geographic spread|Muslim countries]], coming into contact with his Islamic roots from a young age. He described [[Iran]] as the cradle of his family, though he never lived there.&lt;ref name=&quot;UnescoCourier1991&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1310/is_1991_May/ai_10840009 |title=Sadruddin Aga Khan (interview) | work=UNESCO Courier |date = May 1991|accessdate=13 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When he was a child, his paternal grandmother used to recite to him the great epic poems of Persian history.&lt;ref name=&quot;Telegraph1998&quot;/&gt; He held [[French nationality law|French]], [[Iranian nationality law|Iranian]], and [[Swiss nationality law|Swiss]] [[citizenship]], and was fluent in [[French language|French]], [[English language|English]], [[German language|German]] and [[Italian language|Italian]], while also speaking some [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ahram2003&quot;/&gt;

===UNESCO===
Prince Sadruddin joined the [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO) in 1958, and became the Executive Secretary to its International Action Committee for the Preservation of [[Nubia]] in 1961. This initiative brought together archaeologists from Eastern Europe and the West at the height of the [[Cold War]]. The construction of the [[Aswan Dam]] threatened [[ancient Egypt]]ian treasures including [[Abu Simbel]], the temples of [[Philae]] and Kalabsha, and the Christian churches of Nubia.&lt;ref name=&quot;UnescoCourier1991&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian2003&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/obituaries/story/0,3604,956084,00.html |title=Obituary: Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan |work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]] |date=15 May 2003 |accessdate=13 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He would later describe it as &quot;one of UNESCO's great achievements&quot; because of the challenging historical context in which it took place—in particular the ongoing tensions in the [[Middle East]] and the Cold War.&lt;ref name=&quot;UnescoCourier1991&quot;/&gt;

===UN High Commissioner for Refugees===
Prince Sadruddin began as a Special Envoy to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in 1959 with a focus on World Refugee Year (1959–1960).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unhcr.org/4402ff2d2.html |title=Records of Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan – UNHCR Archives |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]] |accessdate=13 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initiative became known for its ''Stamp Plan'', a [[Philately|philatelic]] programme that raised funds through United Nations member countries, as well as the support of the [[Universal Postal Union]]. At the time, the UNHCR's resources were primarily focused on supporting [[refugee]]s crossing from [[Eastern Europe]].&lt;ref name=&quot;UnescoCourier1991&quot;/&gt;

In January 1966, Prince Sadruddin was appointed United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees after serving for three years as Deputy High Commissioner. At the age of 33 he became the youngest person ever to lead the UNHCR.&lt;ref name=&quot;UNNews2003&quot;/&gt; For the next twelve years he directed the UN refugee agency through one of its most difficult periods, coordinating the international response to the [[Bangladesh Liberation War|1971 Bangladesh crisis]] that uprooted {{Nowrap|10 million}} people, the [[Burundi genocide (1972)|1972 exodus]] of hundreds of thousands of [[Hutus]] from [[Burundi]] to [[Tanzania]], and the Indochinese [[boat people]] tragedy of the mid-1970s. In 1972, Prince Sadruddin played a key role in finding new homes for tens of thousands of [[Expulsion of Asians in Uganda in 1972|South Asians expelled]] from [[Uganda]] by [[Idi Amin]].&lt;ref name=&quot;UNNews2003&quot;/&gt;

Prince Sadruddin's determination not to discriminate between European and [[Third World]] refugees helped prepare the UNHCR for a change in the landscape of internationally displaced persons. During the 1950s, between 200,000 and 300,000 refugees of European origin required assistance. By the 1970s the European refugee problems were mostly solved, but had been replaced by millions of displaced persons in the Third World. He had widened the UNHCR mandate well beyond its original focus on Eastern Europe, extending the organisation's reach to refugees from [[Palestine]], [[Vietnam]], [[Angola]] and [[Algeria]].&lt;ref name=&quot;UNNews2003&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=7056&amp;Cr=refugees&amp;Cr1=&amp;Kw1=aga+khan&amp;Kw2=&amp;Kw3= |title=Former UN refugee agency chief Sadruddin Aga Khan dies |publisher=UN News Centre |date=13 May 2003 |accessdate=13 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the scale and complexity of refugee issues continued to increase, the UNHCR and the international community at large was better positioned to adapt.&lt;ref name=&quot;UnescoCourier1991&quot;/&gt; By the end of 1977 when he chose to step down from the position, he had become the longest-serving UN High Commissioner for Refugees.&lt;ref name=&quot;SydneyHerald2003&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/06/15/1055615679497.html |title=Genial diplomat shone under fire |work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=16 June 2003 |accessdate=13 October 2010 | publisher=[[Fairfax Media]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He continued to serve in various capacities dealing with humanitarian situations on behalf of the UN.

===United Nations diplomatic career===
Prince Sadruddin had, since 1978, been variously: Special Consultant and Chargé de Mission to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, [[Special Rapporteur (UN)|Special Rapporteur]] of the [[UN Human Rights Commission]] and Convenor and Co-Chairman of the Independent Commission on International Humanitarian Issues and of the Independent Working Group on the UN Financial Emergency. He was later Coordinator for United Nations Humanitarian and Economic Assistance Programmes Relating to the People of [[Afghanistan]] and Executive Delegate of the Secretary-General for a United Nations Inter-Agency Humanitarian Programme, which dealt with problems of Iraq's border areas.&lt;ref name=&quot;PRAgaKhan2003&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=SG appoints Sadruddin Aga Khan to coordinate humanitarian programme for Iraq, Kuwait, border areas (SG/A/455, IK/15) |publisher=United Nations |date=9 April 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His appointment in September 1990 as Personal Representative of the UN Secretary-General for Humanitarian Assistance Relating to the Crisis between [[Iraq]] and [[Kuwait]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=SG appoints Sadruddin Aga Khan as personal representative for humanitarian assistance relating to Iraq-Kuwait crisis (SG/A/442, IK/1) |publisher=United Nations |date=September 12, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; required diplomatic finesse. Iraq's President [[Saddam Hussein]] was deeply suspicious of the UN, and was loath to do anything that would benefit the country's [[Shia Muslims]]. Despite this, Prince Sadruddin was able to successfully negotiate with Foreign Minister [[Tariq Aziz]] for the establishment of a UN relief program for tens of thousands of Shia Muslims trapped in worsening conditions in the marshlands of southern Iraq.&lt;ref name=&quot;SydneyHerald2003&quot;/&gt;

Prince Sadruddin was nominated and passed over twice for the post of UN Secretary-General. Although he won the 1981 vote, the [[Soviet Union]] considered him too Western and vetoed his election.&lt;ref name=&quot;Times2003&quot;/&gt; When he was nominated again in 1991, the United States and Britain expressed their disagreement with his belief in a policy of boosting aid to Iraq.&lt;ref name=&quot;Times2003&quot;/&gt;

===Environmental protection and advocacy===
In 1977, Prince Sadruddin, together with [[Denis de Rougemont]] and a few other friends, established a Geneva-based think-tank, ''Groupe de Bellerive'' (named after [[Collonge-Bellerive|Bellerive]], the municipality where he lived in Geneva), and a non-profit organisation, the ''Bellerive Foundation''. The foundation collaborated with international institutions, British and Scandinavian bilateral aid organizations, and other NGOs such as the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] (WWF).&lt;ref name=&quot;UnescoCourier1991&quot;/&gt; It became a leading grassroots action group promoting [[Environmental movement|environmental protection]], [[Conservation movement|natural resource conservation]] and the safeguarding of life in all its forms.

Initially, Bellerive worked with [[UNICEF]] and the [[United Nations Children's Fund]] in the struggle against [[deforestation]]. Prince Sadruddin was motivated in part by what he called &quot;ecological refugees&quot;, who were forced to leave regions that could no longer sustain them due to [[desertification]] and other environmental changes. The foundation worked with Swiss specialists to develop low-cost, energy-efficient cooking stoves that relied on [[renewable energy]] sources such as [[methane]] and [[biogas]]. It distributed these among needy rural populations, primarily in Africa. Other areas of concern for Bellerive included the proliferation of [[nuclear weapons]], and the protection of threatened species.&lt;ref name=&quot;UnescoCourier1991&quot;/&gt;

As a resident of Switzerland, Prince Sadruddin was concerned about the impact of insensitive tourist development and deforestation on the [[Alps|European Alps]]. At the [[World Economic Forum]] in 1990, he launched ''Alp Action'' to protect the mountain ecosystem and preserve the Alps' cultural diversity and vitality. The Bellerive Foundation program encouraged eco-tourism, aiming to reduce the impact of outdoor adventure sports on the fragile alpine habitat. During its years of operation, Alp Action successfully launched over 140 projects in seven countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.greengold.on.ca/newsletter/nl2001_07.html#articles1 |title=High Minded Action | first=David (ed.)| last=Chernushenko |publisher=The Sustainable Sport Sourceline |date = July 2001|accessdate=13 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It found inspiration in the system of national parks of the [[Canadian Rockies]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ahram2003&quot;/&gt;

A long-standing trustee and former Vice-President of the World Wide Fund for Nature International, Prince Sadruddin led Bellerive's support for threatened species. Bellerive was also amongst the first organisations to warn of the potential human health hazards of modern intensive farming methods.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ahram2003&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2003/639/in3.htm |title=Obituary: Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan (1933–2003) |last=Elbendary |first=Amina |work=[[Al-Ahram Weekly]] |date=22–28&amp;nbsp;May 2003 (Issue No. 639) |accessdate=13 October 2010 | publisher=Al-Ahram Publishing House}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2006, the activities of the Bellerive Foundation were merged into the Geneva-based [[Aga Khan Foundation]] (founded in 1967 by Prince Sadruddin's nephew [[Aga Khan IV|Karim Aga Khan&amp;nbsp;IV]]) to form the ''Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan Fund for the Environment''.&lt;ref name=&quot;PRAKDN20060531&quot;/&gt; The [[USD|US$]]10 million fund is dedicated to finding practical solutions to environmental problems. The fund concentrates its activities in six areas that were important to Prince Sadruddin: environmental education; natural resource management in fragile zones; nature parks and wildlife reserves; environmentally and culturally appropriate tourism infrastructure; environmental health; and research.&lt;ref name=&quot;PRAKDN20060531&quot;&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.akdn.org/press_release/562/Bellerive-Foundation-Merges-with-the-Aga-Khan-Foundation |title=Bellerive Foundation Merges with the Aga Khan Foundation |publisher=[[Aga Khan Development Network]] |date=31 May 2006 |accessdate=13 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death and remembrance===
Prince Sadruddin died of cancer in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], on {{Nowrap|12 May}} 2003,&lt;ref name=&quot;Times2003&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ahram2003&quot;/&gt; coincidentally, the same day as his elder half-brother [[Prince Aly Khan]] had died 43 years earlier. His body was conveyed to Switzerland where members of the diplomatic corps, government officials and close friends were invited to pay their last respects at the Chateau de Bellerive, and sign books of condolence at various locations around the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;PRAgaKhanFuneral2003&quot;&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.amaana.org/agakhan/sadruddin3.htm |title=Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan's Funeral Ceremonies in Geneva |publisher=Secrétariat de Son Altesse l'Aga Khan, Aiglemont |date=14 May 2003 |accessdate=13 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ruud Lubbers]], then UNHCR High Commissioner, expressed the sadness of the UNHCR and the entire humanitarian community, commenting that &quot;he left an indelible print on UNHCR's history—leading the agency through some of the most challenging moments. Sadruddin's name became synonymous with UNHCR.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;UNNews2003&quot;/&gt;

In accordance with his wishes, Prince Sadruddin's burial took place at a private ceremony attended by members of his family.&lt;ref name=&quot;Times2003&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ahram2003&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PRAgaKhanFuneral2003&quot;/&gt; Traditional Muslim ceremonies were led by Sheikh Ahmed Ahmed Ibrahim, who leads the prayers at the mausoleum of the Prince's father, Aga Khan&amp;nbsp;III, in [[Aswan]], Egypt. Last respects were paid beneath the arches of the Château de Bellerive, before the bier was carried to the local cemetery of Collonge-Bellerive.&lt;ref name=&quot;PRAgaKhanBurial2003&quot;&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://ismaili.net/timeline/2003/20030516press1.html |title=Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan Laid to Rest in Collonge-Bellerive |publisher=Secrétariat de Son Altesse l'Aga Khan, Aiglemont |date=16 May 2003 |accessdate=13 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A tribute from the [[Canton of Geneva]] read: &quot;The destiny of this family of high Persian nobility, descended from the Prophet Muhammad, is inextricably linked to that of this small European town and to an ambitious project to improve the human condition.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;PRAgaKhanBurial2003&quot;/&gt;

The United Nations community celebrated Prince Sadruddin's life at a memorial ceremony held in his honour at its headquarters in [[New York City|New York]] on {{Nowrap|28 October}} 2003. He was remembered for representing the moral and compassionate side of the international community.&lt;ref name=&quot;PRUNMemorial2003&quot;&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.unis.unvienna.org/unis/pressrels/2003/sgsm8971.html |title=Secretary-General Hails Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan as True Statesman, in Remarks to Memorial Ceremony for Former Refugee Chief |publisher=United Nations Information Service |date=29 October 2003 |accessdate=13 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Then United Nations Secretary-General [[Kofi Annan]] commented that &quot;he combined respect for humankind with concern for our environment. He worked on behalf of the poor and dispossessed, while celebrating humanity through culture and art.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;PRUNMemorial2003&quot;/&gt;  He concluded his tribute by praising Prince Sadruddin as &quot;a role model to many of us&amp;nbsp;... his example will continue to inspire new world citizens for several generations to come.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;PRUNMemorial2003&quot;/&gt;

He was survived by his wife of 31 years, Princess Catherine; his three stepsons Alexandre, Marc and Nicholas; as well as his nephews and niece Prince Karim, Prince Amyn and Princess Yasmin; and his cousin Mme. Francoise Carron.&lt;ref name=&quot;PRAgaKhanFuneral2003&quot;/&gt; It was Prince Sadruddin's and Princess Catherine's wish that their remains be buried in Muslim soil in Egypt.&lt;ref name=&quot;PRAgaKhanBurial2003&quot;/&gt;

==Personal life==
Prince Sadruddin's life was deeply influenced by his family roots and cultural heritage. It is claimed that his paternal lineage goes back to [[Muhammad]], the [[Prophet]] of Islam, through the Prophet's daughter [[Fatima Zahra|Fatima]] and cousin [[Ali]]. Prince Sadruddin's grandmother was the granddaughter of the [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar]] Emperor [[Fat′h Ali Shah Qajar|Fath’Ali Shah]].&lt;ref name=&quot;PRAgaKhan2003&quot;&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.amaana.org/agakhan/sadruddin3.htm |title=Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan |publisher=Secrétariat de Son Altesse l'Aga Khan, Aiglemont |date=13 May 2003 |accessdate=13 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

International service was a family tradition, and throughout his life Prince Sadruddin was surrounded by it. His father held influential roles in [[British Raj|British India]]&lt;ref name=&quot;DawnFreedom2006&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dawn.com/events/pml/review53.htm |first=Sherali |last=Alidina |title=Freedom movement and the Aga Khan |work=Dawn: One Hundred Years of the Muslim League 1906–2006 |publisher=The DAWN Group of Newspapers, Pakistan |date=30 December 2006 |accessdate=13 October 2010 }} {{Dead link|date=November 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was instrumental in the formation of [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DawnPresident2006&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dawn.com/events/pml/review52.htm |first=Syed Munir |last=Wasti |title=Aga Khan&amp;nbsp;III – the first President of the Muslim League |work=Dawn: One Hundred Years of the Muslim League 1906–2006 |publisher=The DAWN Group of Newspapers, Pakistan |date=30 December 2006 |accessdate=13 October 2010 }} {{Dead link|date=November 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also served two terms as President of the [[League of Nations]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Times2003&quot;/&gt; Prince Sadruddin's older half-brother, [[Prince Aly Khan]], was Pakistan's Ambassador to the United Nations. Prince Karim Aga Khan&amp;nbsp;IV, the 49th Imam of the Ismaili Muslims and present [[Aga Khan]], was a nephew to Prince Sadruddin, and is the founder and Chairman of the [[Aga Khan Development Network]]. His brother, Prince Amyn, had previously worked with the United Nations before joining the Aga Khan's secretariat.&lt;ref name=&quot;AkdnWebHH&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.akdn.org/about_agakhan.asp |title=His Highness the Aga Khan | accessdate=13 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Prince Sadruddin's niece [[Yasmin Aga Khan|Princess Yasmin]], has devoted herself to the fight against [[Alzheimer's disease]].&lt;ref &quot;name=WICBioYasmin&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wic.org/bio/pkhan.htm |title=Princess Yasmin Aga Khan: Bringing the World Intelligent Awareness |accessdate=13 October 2010 |publisher=Women's International Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prince Sadruddin had a taste for [[culture]], including [[music]], [[art]] and [[literature]]. He was a familiar figure at music festivals and other cultural events, both in Europe and overseas. His concern for the [[Natural environment|environment]] was complemented by his enjoyment of the outdoors; he was a keen [[Skiing|skier]] and an accomplished [[Sailing|sailor]].&lt;ref name=&quot;PRAgaKhan2003&quot;/&gt; While still at Harvard in 1953, Prince Sadruddin became the founding publisher of the ''[[Paris Review]]'',&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimes1990&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE4DF173BF937A35750C0A966958260&amp;sec=&amp;pagewanted=print |title=Heavyweights and High Spirits (review - ''The Paris Review Anthology'') |last=Kirby |first=David |work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]] |date=4 March 1990 |accessdate=13 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [http://www.theparisreview.org/about/masthead] which was established with the aim of bringing original creative work to the fore. Every year the ''Review'' awards the [[Aga Khan Prize for Fiction]] (established by his father&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimes1990&quot;/&gt;) for the best short story that it published in the past year.

===Marriages===
On 27 August 1957, in [[Bellerive, Switzerland|Bellerive]], Switzerland, Prince Sadruddin married Nina Dyer (1930–1965). An [[Anglo-Indian]] fashion model, she was the former wife of [[Baron Hans Heinrich Thyssen-Bornemisza]]. She converted to Islam, taking the name &quot;Shirin&quot; (lit. &quot;sweetness&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimes1957&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB071EFB385A177B93CAAB1783D85F438585F9 |title=Aly Khan's Brother Weds Model |work=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company | author=Associated Press | date=28 August 1957 |page=9 | accessdate=13 October 2010 }} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had no children and divorced in 1962.

His second marriage took place in November 1972, in the [[British West Indies]]. He married Catherine Aleya Beriketti Sursock who was born in [[Alexandria]], Egypt in 1938. She was formerly the wife of [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] aristocrat Cyril [[Sursock family|Sursock]] (son of [[Nicolas Sursock]] and [[Don (honorific)|Donna]] Vittoria [[Palazzo Serra di Cassano|Serra of the Dukes di Cassano]]). She and Prince Sadruddin had no children, but from this marriage he gained three stepchildren : Alexandre Sursock (married to Thai Princess ''[[Mom Rajawongse]]'' Charuvan [[Rangsit Prayurasakdi|Rangsit of Chainat]]), Marc Sursock and Nicholas Sursock.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimes1972&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F20B14FF35591A7493CAAB178AD95F468785F9 |title=Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan, U.N.

===Art collection===
During his lifetime Prince Sadruddin assembled one of the finest private collections of [[Islamic art]] in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;ArtsOfAsia1984&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Safrani |first=Shehbaz H. |year=1984 |month=Nov–Dec |title=The Arts of the Islamic Book: The Collection of Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan |journal=Arts of Asia |volume=14 |issue=6 |pages=55–66 |id= |url=http://www.ismaili.net/sadruddin/islamic.html |accessdate=13 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He became a knowledgeable and respected collector, accumulating a priceless collection of [[painting]]s, [[drawing]]s, [[manuscript]]s and [[Miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniature]]s over 50 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Telegraph1998&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.amaana.org/ISWEB/sadruddin.htm |title=Hidden secrets of the universe |first=June |last=Ducas |publisher=''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'' |date=24 January 1998 |accessdate=13 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He had also gathered a collection of primitive and [[African art]] which he sold sometime prior to 1985.&lt;ref name=&quot;PRAgaKhan2003&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ArtsOfAsia1984&quot;/&gt;

Prince Sadruddin's interest in Islamic art was sparked in his youth by his paternal grandmother's library of Persian books, [[Mysticism|mystical texts]] and [[Astrology|astrological treatises]].&lt;ref name=&quot;SydneyHerald2003&quot;/&gt; While at Harvard in the 1950s, he would make purchases in [[New York City|New York]], and eventually began to acquire from dealers in Paris, Geneva and [[London]]. He would bid regularly at [[Sotheby's]] and [[Christie's]] auctions in Europe and North America. For advice, he looked to his friend [[Stuart Cary Welch]], a noted historian of Islamic art at Harvard University.&lt;ref name=&quot;ArtsOfAsia1984&quot;/&gt;

His collection is vast and diverse, and includes Arabic, Persian, Turkish, and Indian pieces dating from the 10th century. One example is a [[Quran]]ic page of [[North Africa]]n origin written with gold lettering in the [[Kufic|Kufic script]] – it is more than 1,000 years old.
