'''George II''' (George Augustus; {{lang-de|Georg II. August}}; 30 October / 9 November 1683{{ref|dates|O.S./N.S.}}&amp;nbsp;– 25 October 1760) was King of [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] and [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]], Duke of [[Brunswick-Lüneburg]] ([[Electorate of Hanover|Hanover]]) and [[Prince-elector#High offices|Archtreasurer]] and [[Prince-elector]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] from 11 June 1727 (O.S.) until his death.

George was the last [[List of British monarchs|British monarch]] born outside Great Britain. He was born and brought up in Northern Germany. In 1701, his grandmother, [[Sophia of Hanover]], became second-in-line to the British throne after about fifty Catholics higher in line were excluded by the [[Act of Settlement 1701|Act of Settlement]], which restricted the succession to Protestants. After the deaths of Sophia and [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain]], in 1714, his father [[George I of Great Britain|George I]], Elector of Hanover, inherited the British throne. In the first years of his father's reign as king, George was associated with opposition politicians, until they re-joined the governing party in 1720.

As king from 1727, George exercised little control over British domestic policy, which was largely controlled by [[Parliament of Great Britain|Great Britain's parliament]]. As elector, he spent 12 summers in Hanover, where he had more direct control over government policy. He had a difficult relationship with his eldest son, [[Frederick, Prince of Wales|Frederick]], who supported the parliamentary opposition. During the [[War of the Austrian Succession]], George participated at the [[Battle of Dettingen]] in 1743, and thus became the last British monarch to lead an army in battle. In 1745, supporters of the Catholic claimant to the British throne, [[James Francis Edward Stuart]] (&quot;The Old Pretender&quot;), led by James's son [[Charles Edward Stuart]] (&quot;Bonnie Prince Charlie&quot;) attempted and failed to depose George in the last of the [[Jacobite Risings|Jacobite rebellions]]. Frederick died unexpectedly in 1751, leaving George's grandson, [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]], as [[heir apparent]] and ultimately king.

For two centuries after his death, history tended to view George II with disdain, concentrating on his mistresses, short-temper, and boorishness. Since then, some scholars have re-assessed his legacy and conclude that he held and exercised influence in foreign policy and military appointments.

==Early life==
[[File:Sophie Dorothea Prinzessin von Ahlden.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Sophia Dorothea and her two children|George as a young boy, pictured with his mother, [[Sophia Dorothea of Celle]], and his sister, [[Sophia Dorothea of Hanover]].]]
George was born in the city of [[Hanover]] in Germany, and was the son of George Louis, Hereditary Prince of [[Electorate of Hanover|Brunswick-Lüneburg]] (later King [[George I of Great Britain]]), and his wife, [[Sophia Dorothea of Celle]]. Both of George's parents committed adultery, and in 1694&lt;!--28 December 1694 O.S.--&gt; their marriage was dissolved on the pretext that Sophia had abandoned her husband.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; She was confined to [[Ahlden House]] and denied access to her two children, George and his sister [[Sophia Dorothea of Hanover]], whom she probably never saw again.&lt;ref&gt;Black, ''George II'', pp. 35–36; Thompson, p. 19; Van der Kiste, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the age of four, George spoke only French, the language of diplomacy and the court, but he was thereafter taught German by one of his tutors, Johann Hilmar Holstein.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; He was also schooled in English and Italian, and studied genealogy, military history and battle tactics with particular diligence.&lt;ref&gt;Trench, p. 7; Van der Kiste, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

George's second cousin once removed, [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]], ascended the thrones of [[Kingdom of England|England]], [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]] and [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]] in 1702. She had no surviving children, and by the [[Act of Settlement 1701]] the [[Parliament of England|English Parliament]] designated Anne's closest [[Protestantism|Protestant]] blood relations, George's grandmother [[Sophia of Hanover|Sophia]] and her descendants, as Anne's heirs in England and Ireland. Consequently, after his grandmother and father, George was third in line to succeed Anne in two of her realms. He was naturalized as an English subject in 1705 by the [[Sophia Naturalization Act 1705|Sophia Naturalization Act]], and in 1706 he was made a [[Knight of the Garter]] and created [[Duke of Cambridge|Duke and Marquess of Cambridge]], Earl of Milford Haven, Viscount Northallerton and Baron Tewkesbury in the [[Peerage of England]].&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, pp. 35–36&lt;/ref&gt; England and Scotland [[Acts of Union 1707|united in 1707]] to form the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]], and jointly accepted the succession as laid down by the Act of Settlement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/aep/Ann/6/11/contents Union with Scotland Act 1706] and [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/aosp/1707/7/contents Union with England Act 1707], The National Archives, retrieved 20 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage==
George's father did not want his son to enter into a loveless arranged marriage as he had, and wanted his son to have the opportunity of meeting his bride before any formal arrangements were made.&lt;ref name=vdk17/&gt; Negotiations from 1702 for the hand of Princess [[Hedvig Sophia of Sweden]], Dowager Duchess and regent of [[Holstein-Gottorp]], came to nothing.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1705, under the false name of &quot;Monsieur de Busch&quot;, George visited the [[Principality of Ansbach|Ansbach]] court at their summer residence in Triesdorf to investigate ''incognito'' a marriage prospect: [[Caroline of Ansbach]], the former ward of his aunt [[Sophia Charlotte of Hanover|Queen Sophia Charlotte of Prussia]]. The English envoy to Hanover, Edmund Poley, reported that George was so taken by &quot;the good character he had of her that he would not think of anybody else&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; A marriage contract was concluded by the end of July.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, p. 30; Van der Kiste, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 August / 2 September 1705{{ref|dates|O.S./N.S.}} Caroline arrived in Hanover for her wedding, which was held the same evening in the chapel at [[Herrenhausen Gardens|Herrenhausen]].&lt;ref name=vdk17&gt;Van der Kiste, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

George was keen to participate in the [[War of the Spanish Succession|war against France]] in [[Flanders]], but his father refused permission for him to join the army in an active role until he had a son and heir.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, p. 31; Van der Kiste, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; In early 1707, George's hopes were fulfilled when Caroline gave birth to a son, [[Frederick, Prince of Wales|Frederick]].&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; In July, Caroline fell seriously ill with [[smallpox]], and George caught the infection himself after staying by her side devotedly during her illness.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; They both recovered. In 1708, George participated in the [[Battle of Oudenarde]] in the vanguard of the Hanoverian cavalry; his horse and a colonel&lt;!--Colonel Johann Albrecht von Lösecke--&gt; immediately beside him were killed, but George survived unharmed.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, p. 32; Trench, p. 18; Van der Kiste, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; The British commander, [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|Marlborough]], wrote that George &quot;distinguished himself extremely, charging at the head of and animating by his example [the Hanoverian] troops, who played a good part in this happy victory&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1709 and 1713 George and Caroline had three more children, all girls: [[Anne, Princess Royal and Princess of Orange|Anne]], [[Princess Amelia of Great Britain|Amelia]], and [[Princess Caroline of Great Britain|Caroline]].&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1714, Queen Anne's health had declined, and [[British Whig Party|British Whigs]], politicians who supported the Hanoverian succession, thought it prudent for one of the Hanoverians to live in England, to safeguard the Protestant succession on Anne's death. As George was a [[peer of the realm]] (as Duke of Cambridge), it was suggested that he be summoned to Parliament to sit in the [[House of Lords]]. Both Anne and George's father refused to support the plan, though George, Caroline and Sophia were all in favour.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; George did not go. Within the year both Sophia and Anne were dead, and George's father was king.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prince of Wales==
===Quarrel with the king===
[[File:The Thames at Horseferry1710.jpg|thumb|right|London, c. 1710]]
George and his father sailed for England from [[The Hague]] on 16/27 September and arrived at [[Greenwich]] two days later.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, they formally entered London in a ceremonial procession.&lt;ref&gt;Trench, p. 38; Van der Kiste, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; George was given the title of [[Prince of Wales]]. Caroline followed her husband to Britain in October with their daughters, while Frederick remained in Hanover to be brought up by private tutors.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, pp. 39–40; Trench, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; London was like nothing George had seen before: it was 50 times larger than Hanover,{{ref|Hanover|B}} and the crowd was estimated at up to one and a half million spectators.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; George courted popularity with voluble expressions of praise for the English, and claimed that he had no drop of blood that was not English.&lt;ref&gt;Trench, p. 55; Van der Kiste, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1716, the king returned to Hanover for six months, and George was given limited powers, as &quot;Guardian and Lieutenant of the Realm&quot;, to govern in his father's absence.&lt;ref&gt;Trench, pp. 63–65; Van der Kiste, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; He made a [[royal progress]] through [[Chichester]], [[Havant]], [[Portsmouth]] and [[Guildford]] in southern England.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; Spectators were allowed to see him dine in public at [[Hampton Court Palace]].&lt;ref&gt;Black, ''George II'', p. 45; Thompson, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; An attempt on his life at [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Drury Lane Theatre]], in which one person was shot dead before the assailant&lt;!--Mr Freeman--&gt; was brought under control, boosted his high public profile.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;

His father distrusted or was jealous of George's popularity, which contributed to the development of a poor relationship between them.&lt;ref&gt;Trench, p. 75; Van der Kiste, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; The birth in 1717 of George's second son, [[Prince George William of Great Britain|Prince George William]], proved to be a catalyst for a family quarrel; the king, supposedly following custom, appointed the [[Lord Chamberlain]], the [[Thomas Pelham-Holles, 1st Duke of Newcastle-upon-Tyne|Duke of Newcastle]], as one of the [[baptism]]al sponsors of the child. The king was angered when George, who disliked Newcastle, verbally insulted the duke at the christening, which the duke misunderstood as a challenge to a duel.{{ref|duel|C}} George and Caroline were temporarily confined to their apartments on the order of the king, who subsequently banished his son from [[St. James's Palace]], the king's residence.&lt;ref&gt;Trench, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; The Prince and Princess of Wales left court, but their children remained in the care of the king.&lt;ref&gt;Black, ''George II'', p. 46; Thompson, p. 53; Trench, p. 78&lt;/ref&gt;

George and Caroline missed their children, and were desperate to see them. On one occasion they secretly visited the palace without the approval of the king; Caroline fainted and George &quot;cried like a child&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; The king partially relented and permitted them to visit once a week, though he later allowed Caroline unconditional access.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, pp. 66–67&lt;/ref&gt; The following February, George William died, with his father by his side.&lt;ref&gt;Trench, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political opposition===
Banned from the palace and shunned by his own father, for the next several years the Prince of Wales was identified with opposition to [[George I of Great Britain|George I]]'s policies,&lt;ref&gt;Trench, pp. 67, 87&lt;/ref&gt; which included measures designed to increase religious freedom in Great Britain and expand Hanover's German territories at the expense of Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, pp. 48–50, 55&lt;/ref&gt; His new London residence, [[Leicester Square|Leicester House]], became a frequent meeting place for his father's political opponents, including [[Sir Robert Walpole]] and [[Charles Townshend, 2nd Viscount Townshend|Viscount Townshend]], who had left the government in 1717.&lt;ref&gt;Trench, pp. 79, 82&lt;/ref&gt;

The king visited Hanover again from May to November 1719. Instead of appointing George to the guardianship, he established a regency council.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; In 1720, Walpole encouraged the king and his son to reconcile, for the sake of public unity, which they did half-heartedly.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, p. 57; Trench, pp. 88–90; Van der Kiste, pp. 72–74&lt;/ref&gt; Walpole and Townshend returned to political office, and rejoined the ministry.&lt;ref&gt;Black, ''George II'', p. 52; Thompson, p. 58; Trench, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; George was soon disillusioned with the terms of the reconciliation; his three daughters who were in the care of the king were not returned and he was still barred from becoming regent during the king's absences.&lt;ref&gt;Trench, pp. 88–89&lt;/ref&gt; He came to believe that Walpole had tricked him into the rapprochement as part of a scheme to regain power. Over the next few years, he and Caroline lived quietly, avoiding overt political activity. They had three more children: [[Prince William, Duke of Cumberland|William]], [[Princess Mary of Great Britain|Mary]] and [[Louise of Great Britain|Louisa]], who were brought up at Leicester House and [[Richmond, London|Richmond Lodge]], George's summer residence.&lt;ref&gt;Black, ''George II'', p. 54; Thompson, pp. 58–59&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1721, the economic disaster of the [[South Sea Bubble]] allowed Walpole to rise to the pinnacle of government.&lt;ref&gt;Trench, pp. 104–105&lt;/ref&gt; Walpole and his [[British Whig Party|Whig]] Party were dominant in politics, as the king feared that the [[Tory|Tories]] would not support the succession laid down in the [[Act of Settlement 1701|Act of Settlement]].&lt;ref&gt;Trench, pp. 106–107&lt;/ref&gt; The power of the Whigs was so great that the Tories would not come to hold power for another half-century.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, p. 45; Trench, p. 107&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early reign==
[[File:King George II by Charles Jervas.jpg|thumb|left|alt=George holding a sceptre|Portrait by [[Charles Jervas]], circa 1727]]
George II succeeded as king and elector on his father's death on 11/22 June 1727 during one of George I's visits to Hanover. His father was buried at Hanover, but George II decided not to go to the funeral, which far from bringing criticism led to praise from the English who considered it proof of the new king's fondness for England.&lt;ref name=vdk97&gt;Van der Kiste, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; He suppressed his father's will because it attempted to split the Hanoverian succession between George II's grandsons rather than vest all the domains (both Britain and Hanover) in a single person. Both British and Hanoverian ministers considered the will unlawful, as George I did not have the legal power to determine the succession personally.&lt;ref&gt;Trench, pp. 130–131&lt;/ref&gt; Critics supposed that George hid the will to avoid paying out his father's legacies.&lt;ref&gt;Black, ''George II'', p. 88; Cannon; Trench, pp. 130–131&lt;/ref&gt;

George II was crowned at [[Westminster Abbey]] on 11/22 October 1727.&lt;ref name=vdk97/&gt; The composer [[George Frideric Handel]] was commissioned to write four new anthems for the coronation, including ''[[Zadok the Priest]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Black, ''George II'', p. 77&lt;/ref&gt;

It was widely believed that George would dismiss Walpole, who had distressed him by joining his father's government, and replace him with [[Spencer Compton, 1st Earl of Wilmington|Sir Spencer Compton]].&lt;ref&gt;Black, ''George II'', p. 80; Trench, p. 132&lt;/ref&gt; George asked Compton, rather than Walpole, to write his first speech for him, but Compton asked Walpole to draft it for him. Caroline advised George to retain Walpole, who continued to gain royal favour by securing a generous [[civil list]] (a fixed annual amount set by Parliament for the king's official expenditure) of £800,000.&lt;ref&gt;Trench, pp. 132–133&lt;/ref&gt; Walpole commanded a substantial majority in Parliament and George had little choice but to retain him or risk ministerial instability.&lt;ref&gt;Black, ''George II'', pp. 81–84; Black, ''Walpole in Power'', pp. 29–31, 53, 61&lt;/ref&gt; Compton was ennobled as Lord Wilmington the following year.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:George II.jpg|thumb|right|alt=George with his hand on an orb|Portrait by [[Enoch Seeman]], circa 1730]]
Walpole directed domestic policy, and after the resignation of his brother-in-law Townshend in 1730 also controlled George's foreign policy.&lt;ref&gt;Trench, p. 149&lt;/ref&gt; Historians generally believe that George played an honorific role in Britain, and closely followed the advice of Walpole and senior ministers who made the major decisions.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, p. 92&lt;/ref&gt; Although the king was eager for war in Europe, his ministers were more cautious.&lt;ref&gt;Black, ''George II'', p. 95&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Anglo-Spanish War (1727–1729)|Anglo-Spanish War]] was brought to an end, and George unsuccessfully pressed Walpole to join the [[War of the Polish Succession]] on the side of the German states.&lt;ref&gt;Trench, pp. 173–174; Van der Kiste, p. 138&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1733, Walpole withdrew an unpopular [[excise]] bill that had gathered strong opposition, including from within his own party. George lent support to Walpole by dismissing the bill's opponents from their [[Court (royal)#Court officials|court offices]].&lt;ref&gt;Black, ''George II'', pp. 141–143; Thompson, pp. 102–103; Trench, pp. 166–167&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family problems==
George II's relationship with his son and heir apparent, [[Frederick, Prince of Wales]], worsened during the 1730s. Frederick had been left behind in Germany when his parents came to England, and they had not met for 14 years. In 1728, he was brought to England, and swiftly became a figurehead of the political opposition.&lt;ref&gt;Trench, pp. 141–142; Van der Kiste, pp.115–116&lt;/ref&gt; When George visited Hanover in the summers of 1729, 1732 and 1735, he left his wife to chair the regency council in Britain rather than his son.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, pp. 85–86; Van der Kiste, pp. 118, 126, 139&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, rivalry between George II and his brother-in-law [[Frederick William I of Prussia]] led to tension along the Prussian–Hanoverian border, which eventually culminated in the mobilization of troops in the border zone and suggestions of a duel between the two kings. Negotiations for a marriage between the Prince of Wales and Frederick William's daughter [[Wilhelmine of Prussia, Margravine of Brandenburg-Bayreuth|Wilhelmine]] dragged on for years but neither side would make the concessions demanded of the other, and the idea was shelved.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, the prince married [[Princess Augusta of Saxe-Gotha]] in April 1736.&lt;ref&gt;Trench, p. 179&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1736, George returned to Hanover, which resulted in unpopularity in England; a satirical notice was even pinned to the gates of St James's Palace decrying his absence. &quot;Lost or strayed out of this house&quot;, it read, &quot;a man who has left a wife and six children [[Poor rate|on the parish]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Trench, pp. 182–184; Van der Kiste, pp. 149–150&lt;/ref&gt; The king made plans to return in the face of inclement December weather; when his ship was caught in a storm, gossip swept London that he had drowned. Eventually, in January 1737, he arrived back in England.&lt;ref&gt;Trench, p. 185–187; Van der Kiste, p. 152&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately he fell ill, with [[haemorrhoids|piles]] and a fever, and withdrew to his bed. The Prince of Wales put it about that the king was dying, with the result that George insisted on getting up and attending a social event to disprove the gossip-mongers.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, p. 153&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Prince of Wales applied to Parliament for an increase in his allowance, an open quarrel broke out. The king, who had a reputation for meanness,&lt;ref&gt;Black, ''George II'', p. 136; Thompson, pp. 7, 64; Trench, p. 150&lt;/ref&gt; offered a private settlement, which Frederick rejected. Parliament voted against the measure, but George reluctantly increased his son's allowance on the advice of Walpole.&lt;ref&gt;Trench, pp. 189–190; Van der Kiste, pp. 153–154&lt;/ref&gt; Further friction between them followed when Frederick excluded the king and queen from the birth of his daughter in July 1737 by bundling his wife, who was in labour, into a coach and driving off in the middle of the night.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, p. 120; Trench, p. 192; Van der Kiste, pp. 155–157&lt;/ref&gt; George banished him and his family from the royal court, much like the punishment his own father had brought upon him with the exception that he allowed Frederick to retain custody of his children.&lt;ref&gt;Trench, p. 196; Van der Kiste, p. 158&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after banishing his son, George's wife Caroline died on 20 November 1737 (O.S.). He was deeply affected by her death, and to the surprise of many displayed &quot;a tenderness of which the world thought him before utterly incapable&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Hervey's Memoirs, vol. III, p. 916 quoted in Thompson, p. 124 and Van der Kiste, p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; On her deathbed she told her sobbing husband to remarry, to which he replied, &quot;Non, j'aurai des maîtresses!&quot; (French for &quot;No, I shall have mistresses!&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, p. 124; Trench, p. 199&lt;/ref&gt; It was common knowledge that George had already had mistresses during his marriage, and he had kept Caroline informed about them.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, p. 92; Trench, pp. 175, 181&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henrietta Howard, Countess of Suffolk|Henrietta Howard]], later Countess of Suffolk, had moved to Hanover with her husband during the reign of Queen Anne,&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, pp. 25, 137&lt;/ref&gt; and she had been one of Caroline's [[Woman of the Bedchamber|women of the bedchamber]]. She was his mistress from before the accession of George I until November 1734. She was followed by [[Amalie von Wallmoden, Countess of Yarmouth|Amalie von Wallmoden]], later Countess of Yarmouth, with whom George had an illegitimate son, [[Johann Ludwig von Wallmoden]]. Johann Ludwig was born while Amalie was still married to her husband, and so George did not acknowledge him publicly as his own son.&lt;ref&gt;Black, ''George II'', p. 157&lt;/ref&gt;

==War and rebellion==
Against Walpole's wishes, but to George's delight, Britain once again entered into war, the [[War of Jenkins' Ear]], with Spain in 1739.&lt;ref&gt;Trench, pp. 205–206&lt;/ref&gt; Britain's war with Spain became part of the [[War of the Austrian Succession]] when a major European war broke out upon the death of the Holy Roman Emperor [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles VI]] in 1740. At dispute was the right of Charles's daughter, [[Maria Theresa of Austria|Maria Theresa]], to succeed to his Austrian dominions.&lt;ref&gt;Trench, p. 210&lt;/ref&gt; George spent the summers of 1740 and 1741 in Hanover, where he was more able to intervene directly in European diplomatic moves in his capacity as elector.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, pp. 133, 139&lt;/ref&gt;

Prince Frederick campaigned actively for the opposition in the [[British general election, 1741]], and Walpole was unable to secure a stable majority. Walpole attempted to buy off the prince with the promise of an increased allowance and offered to pay off his debts, but Frederick refused.&lt;ref&gt;Black, ''George II'', p. 174; Trench, p. 212&lt;/ref&gt; With his support eroded, Walpole retired in 1742 after over twenty years in office. He was replaced by [[Spencer Compton, 1st Earl of Wilmington|Spencer Compton, Lord Wilmington]], whom George had originally considered for the premiership in 1727. Lord Wilmington, however, was a figurehead;&lt;ref&gt;Black, ''George II'', p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; actual power was held by others, such as [[John Carteret, 2nd Earl Granville|Lord Carteret]], George's favourite minister after Walpole.&lt;ref name=cannon/&gt; When Wilmington died in 1743, [[Henry Pelham]] took his place at the head of the government.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, p. 150&lt;/ref&gt;

The word LIMA under the king's head signifies that the coin was struck from silver seized from the Spanish treasure fleet off [[Lima]], Peru, during the [[War of the Austrian Succession]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/cm/s/silver_lima_crown_5_shillings.aspx &quot;Silver 'Lima' crown (5 shillings) of George II&quot;], [[British Museum]], retrieved 26 August 2011&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The pro-war faction was led by Carteret, who claimed that French power would increase if Maria Theresa failed to succeed to the Austrian throne. George agreed to send 12,000 hired Hessian and Danish mercenaries to Europe, ostensibly to support Maria Theresa. Without conferring with his British ministers, George stationed them in Hanover to prevent enemy French troops from marching into the electorate.&lt;ref&gt;Trench, pp. 211–212&lt;/ref&gt; The British army had not fought in a major European war in over twenty years, and the government had badly neglected its upkeep.&lt;ref&gt;Trench, pp. 206–209&lt;/ref&gt; George had pushed for greater professionalism in the ranks, and promotion by merit rather than by [[sale of commissions]], but without much success.&lt;ref&gt;Black, ''George II'', p. 111; Trench, pp. 136, 208; Van der Kiste, p. 173&lt;/ref&gt; An allied force of Austrian, British, Dutch, Hanoverian and Hessian troops engaged the French at the [[Battle of Dettingen]] on 16/27 June 1743. George personally accompanied them, leading them to victory, thus becoming the last British monarch to lead troops into battle.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, p. 148; Trench, pp. 217–223&lt;/ref&gt; Though his actions in the battle were admired, the war became unpopular with the British public, who felt that the king and Carteret were subordinating British interests to Hanoverian ones.&lt;ref&gt;Black, ''George II'', pp. 181–184; Van der Kiste, pp. 179–180&lt;/ref&gt; Carteret lost support, and to George's dismay resigned in 1744.&lt;ref&gt;Black, ''George II'', pp. 185–186; Thompson, p. 160; Van der Kiste, p. 181&lt;/ref&gt;

Tension grew between the Pelham ministry and George, as George continued to take advice from Carteret and rejected pressure to include [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham|William Pitt the Elder]], who would have broadened the government's support base, in the Cabinet.&lt;ref&gt;Black, ''George II'', pp. 190–193; Thompson, pp. 162, 169; Trench, pp. 234–235&lt;/ref&gt; The king disliked Pitt because he had previously opposed government policy and attacked measures seen as pro-Hanoverian.&lt;ref&gt;Black, ''George II'', pp. 164, 184, 195&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1746, Pelham and his followers resigned. George asked [[William Pulteney, 1st Earl of Bath|Lord Bath]] and Carteret to form an administration, but after less than 48 hours they returned the seals of office, unable to secure sufficient parliamentary support. Pelham returned to office triumphant, and George was forced to appoint Pitt to the ministry.&lt;ref&gt;Black, ''George II'', pp. 190–193; Cannon; Trench, pp. 234–235&lt;/ref&gt;

George's French opponents encouraged [[Jacobite Risings|rebellion by the]] [[Jacobitism|Jacobites]], the supporters of the Roman Catholic claimant to the British throne, [[James Francis Edward Stuart]], often known as the Old Pretender. Stuart was the son of [[James II of England|James II]], who had been deposed in 1688 and replaced by his Protestant relations. Two prior rebellions in [[Jacobite Rising of 1715|1715]] and [[Battle of Glen Shiel|1719]] had failed. In July 1745, the Old Pretender's son, [[Charles Edward Stuart]], popularly known as Bonnie Prince Charlie or the Young Pretender, landed in Scotland, where support for his cause was highest. George, who was summering in Hanover, returned to London at the end of August.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, p. 184&lt;/ref&gt; The Jacobites defeated British forces in September at the [[Battle of Prestonpans]], and then moved south into England. The Jacobites failed to gain further support, and the French reneged on a promise of help. Losing morale, the Jacobites retreated back into Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;Black, ''George II'', pp. 190–191&lt;/ref&gt; On 16/27 April 1746, Charles faced George's military-minded son [[Prince William, Duke of Cumberland]], in the [[Battle of Culloden]], the last pitched battle fought on British soil. The ravaged Jacobite troops were routed by the government army. Charles escaped to France, but many of his supporters were caught and executed. Jacobitism was all but crushed; no further serious attempt was made at restoring the [[House of Stuart]].&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, pp. 186–187&lt;/ref&gt; The War of the Austrian Succession continued until 1748, when Maria Theresa was recognized as Archduchess of Austria. The peace was celebrated by a fête in [[Green Park, London]], for which Handel composed ''[[Music for the Royal Fireworks]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, pp. 187–189&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
[[File:George II 1755-1767.jpg|thumb|left|alt=George in his seventies|Portrait by [[John Shackleton]], in or after 1755]]
In the [[British general election, 1747|general election of 1747]] the Prince of Wales again actively campaigned for the opposition but Pelham's party won easily.&lt;ref&gt;Black, ''George II'', p. 199; Trench, p. 243; Van der Kiste, p. 188&lt;/ref&gt; Like his father before him, the Prince entertained opposition figures at his house in [[Leicester Square]].&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, p. 189&lt;/ref&gt; When the Prince of Wales died suddenly in 1751, his eldest son, [[George III of the United Kingdom|Prince George]], became heir apparent. The king commiserated with the [[Augusta of Saxe-Gotha|Dowager Princess of Wales]] and wept with her.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, p. 208; Trench, p. 247&lt;/ref&gt; As her son would not reach the age of majority until 1756, a new British Regency Act made her regent, assisted by a council led by the Duke of Cumberland, in case of George II's death.&lt;ref&gt;Black, ''George II'', pp. 207–211; Thompson, p. 209; Trench, p. 249; Van der Kiste, p. 195&lt;/ref&gt; The king also made a new will, which provided for Cumberland to be sole regent in Hanover.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, p. 211&lt;/ref&gt; After the death of his daughter Louisa at the end of the year, George lamented, &quot;This has been a fatal year for my family. I lost my eldest son&amp;nbsp;– but I am glad of it.&amp;nbsp;... Now [Louisa] is gone. I know I did not love my children when they were young: I hated to have them running into my room; but now I love them as well as most fathers.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Horace Walpole]]'s memoirs, vol. I, p. 152, quoted in Thompson, p. 213 and Trench, p. 250&lt;/ref&gt;

===Seven Years' War===
{{Further2|[[Great Britain in the Seven Years' War]]}}
In 1754, Pelham died, to be succeeded by his elder brother, the [[Thomas Pelham-Holles, 1st Duke of Newcastle|Duke of Newcastle]]. Hostility between France and Britain, particularly over the colonization of North America, continued.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, pp. 233–238&lt;/ref&gt; Fearing a French invasion of Hanover, George aligned himself with Prussia, the enemy of Austria. Russia and France allied with their former enemy Austria. A French [[Siege of Fort St Philip (1756)|invasion of the British-held island of Minorca]] lead to the outbreak of the [[Seven Years' War]] in 1756. Public disquiet over British failures at the start of the conflict led to the resignation of Newcastle and the appointment of the [[William Cavendish, 4th Duke of Devonshire|Duke of Devonshire]] as prime minister, and [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham|William Pitt the Elder]] as [[Secretary of State for the Southern Department]].&lt;ref&gt;Black, ''George II'', pp. 231–232; Thompson, p. 252; Trench, pp. 271–274&lt;/ref&gt; In April the following year, George dismissed Pitt, in an attempt to construct an administration more to his liking. Over the succeeding three months attempts to form another stable ministerial combination failed. In June, [[James Waldegrave, 2nd Earl Waldegrave]], held the seals of office for only four days. By the start of July, Pitt was recalled, and the Duke of Newcastle returned as prime minister. As Secretary of State, Pitt guided policy relating to the war. Great Britain, Hanover and Prussia and their allies [[Hesse-Kassel]] and [[Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel]] were pitted against other European powers, including France, Austria, Russia, Sweden and [[Saxony]]. The war involved multiple theatres from Europe to North America and India, where British dominance increased with the victories of [[Robert Clive, 1st Baron Clive|Robert Clive]] over French forces and their allies at the [[Battle of Arcot]] and the [[Battle of Plassey]].&lt;ref&gt;Ashley, p. 677&lt;/ref&gt;

George's son the Duke of Cumberland commanded the king's troops in Northern Germany. In 1757, [[Invasion of Hanover (1757)|Hanover was invaded]], and George gave Cumberland full powers to conclude a separate peace.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, pp. 265–266; Trench, p. 283&lt;/ref&gt; By September, however, he was furious at [[Convention of Klosterzeven|Cumberland's negotiated settlement]], which he felt greatly favoured the French.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, p. 268; Trench, p. 284&lt;/ref&gt; George said his son had &quot;ruined me and disgraced himself&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Horace Walpole's memoirs, vol. III, p. 61, quoted in Trench, p. 286&lt;/ref&gt; Cumberland, by his own choice, resigned his military offices,&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, p. 276; Trench, p. 286&lt;/ref&gt; and George revoked the peace deal on the grounds that the French had infringed it by disarming Hessian troops after the ceasefire.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, p. 270; Trench, p. 287&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[Annus Mirabilis of 1759|annus mirabilis]]'' of 1759 British forces [[Battle of the Plains of Abraham|captured Quebec]] and [[Invasion of Guadeloupe (1759)|Guadeloupe]]. A French [[Planned French Invasion of Britain (1759)|plan to invade Britain]] was defeated following naval battles at [[Battle of Lagos|Lagos]] and [[Battle of Quiberon Bay|Quiberon Bay]],&lt;ref&gt;Trench, pp. 293–296&lt;/ref&gt; and a resumed French advance on Hanover was halted by a joint British–Hanoverian force at the [[Battle of Minden]].&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, pp. 282–283&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===
By October 1760, King George II was blind in one eye, and hard of hearing.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, p. 275; Trench, p. 292; Van der Kiste, p. 212&lt;/ref&gt; On the morning of 25 October, he rose as usual at 6:00 a.m., drank a cup of hot chocolate, and went to his [[close stool]], alone. After a few minutes, his valet&lt;!--Schröder--&gt; heard a loud crash. He entered the room to find the king on the floor.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, pp. 289–290; Van der Kiste, p. 213&lt;/ref&gt; The king was lifted into his bed, and [[Princess Amelia of Great Britain|Princess Amelia]] was sent for, but before she reached him, he was dead. At the age of nearly 77, he had lived longer than any of his English predecessors.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, p. 213&lt;/ref&gt; An autopsy revealed that the right ventricle of the king's heart had ruptured as the result of an incipient [[aortic aneurysm]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Frank Nicholls|Nicholls, Frank]] (1761) [http://books.google.com/books?id=bYWNFD7xRXkC&amp;pg=PA265 &quot;Observations concerning the body of His Late Majesty&quot;], ''Philos Trans Lond'' '''52''': 265–274&lt;/ref&gt;

George II was succeeded by his grandson [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]], and was buried on 11 November in [[Westminster Abbey]]. He left instructions for the sides of his and his wife's coffins to be removed so that their remains could mingle.&lt;ref&gt;Black, ''George II'', p. 253; Thompson, p. 290&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
[[File:George II statue 1.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Weathered statue in Roman garb|Statue by [[John Van Nost]] erected in 1753 in [[Golden Square]], London&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, between pp. 150 and 151&lt;/ref&gt;]]
George donated the royal library to the [[British Museum]] in 1757, four years after the museum's foundation.&lt;ref&gt;Black, ''George II'', pp. 68, 127&lt;/ref&gt; He had no interest in reading,&lt;ref&gt;Black, ''George II'', p. 127; Thompson, pp. 97–98; Trench, p. 153&lt;/ref&gt; or in the arts and sciences, and preferred to spend his leisure hours stag-hunting on horseback or playing cards.&lt;ref&gt;Black, ''George II'', p. 128; Trench, pp. 140, 152&lt;/ref&gt; In 1737, he founded the [[Georg August University of Göttingen]], the first university in the [[Electorate of Hanover]], and visited it in 1748.&lt;ref&gt;Black, ''George II'', p. 128&lt;/ref&gt; The [[asteroid]] [[359 Georgia]] was named in his honour at the University in 1902. He served as the Chancellor of [[University of Dublin|Trinity College, Dublin]], between 1716 and 1727, and in 1754 issued the charter for King's College in New York City, which later become [[Columbia University]]. The [[province of Georgia]], founded by royal charter in 1732, was named after George.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, p. 96&lt;/ref&gt;

During George II's reign British interests expanded throughout the world, the Jacobite challenge to the Hanoverian dynasty was extinguished, and the power of ministers and Parliament in Britain became well-established. Nevertheless, in the memoirs of contemporaries such as [[John Hervey, 2nd Baron Hervey|Lord Hervey]] and [[Horace Walpole]], George is depicted as a weak buffoon, governed by his wife and ministers.&lt;ref&gt;Black, ''George II'', pp. 255–257&lt;/ref&gt; Biographies of George written during the nineteenth and first part of the twentieth century relied on these biased accounts.&lt;ref&gt;Black, ''George II'', pp. 257–258&lt;/ref&gt; Since the last quarter of the twentieth century, scholarly analysis of surviving correspondence has indicated that George was not as ineffective as previously thought.&lt;ref&gt;Black, ''George II'', pp. 258–259&lt;/ref&gt; Letters from ministers are annotated by George with pertinent remarks and demonstrate that he had a grasp of and interest in foreign policy in particular.&lt;ref&gt;Black, ''George II'', pp. 144–146; Cannon; Trench, pp. 135–136&lt;/ref&gt; He was often able to prevent the appointment of ministers or commanders he disliked, or sideline them into lesser offices.&lt;ref&gt;Black, ''George II'', p. 195&lt;/ref&gt; This academic re-assessment of George II, however, has not totally eliminated the popular perception of him as a &quot;faintly ludicrous king&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Best, p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; His parsimony, for example, may have opened him to ridicule, but his biographers observe that parsimony is preferable to extravagance.&lt;ref&gt;Black, ''George II'', p. 82; Trench, p. 300; ''Lord Waldegrave's Memoirs'' quoted in Trench, p. 270&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Caulfeild, 1st Earl of Charlemont|Lord Charlemont]] excused George's short-temper by explaining that sincerity of feeling is better than deception, &quot;His temper was warm and impetuous, but he was good-natured and sincere. Unskilled in the royal talent of dissimulation, he always was what he appeared to be. He might offend, but he never deceived.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Charlemont quoted in Cannon and Trench, p. 299&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Waldegrave, 2nd Earl Waldegrave|Lord Waldegrave]] wrote, &quot;I am thoroughly convinced that hereafter, when time shall have wore away those specks and blemishes which sully the brightest characters, and from which no man is totally exempt, he will be numbered amongst those patriot kings, under whose government the people have enjoyed the greatest happiness&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Trench, p. 270&lt;/ref&gt; George may not have played a strong role in history, but he was influential at times and he upheld constitutional government.&lt;ref&gt;Black, ''George II'', p. 138; Cannon; Trench, p. 300&lt;/ref&gt; [[Elizabeth Montagu]] said of him, &quot;With him our laws and liberties were safe, he possessed in a great degree the confidence of his people and the respect of foreign governments; and a certain steadiness of character made him of great consequence in these unsettled times&amp;nbsp;… His character would not afford subject for epic poetry, but will look well in the sober page of history.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Black, ''George II'', p. 254&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notes==
*{{note|dates|O.S./N.S.}}Over the course of George's life, two calendars were used: the [[Old Style and New Style dates|Old Style]] [[Julian calendar]] and the [[Old Style and New Style dates|New Style]] [[Gregorian calendar]]. Hanover switched from the Julian to the Gregorian calendar on 19 February (O.S.) / 1 March (N.S.) 1700. Great Britain switched on 3/14 September 1752. In this article, individual dates before September 1752 are indicated as either O.S. or N.S. or both. All dates after September 1752 are N.S. only. All years are assumed to start from 1 January and not 25 March, which was the English New Year.
*{{note|Hanover|B}}Hanover had about 1,800 houses, whereas London had 100,000.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;
