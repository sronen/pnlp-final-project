'''George III''' (George William Frederick; 4 June 1738&lt;ref name=&quot;date&quot;&gt;24 May in the [[Old Style and New Style dates|Old Style]] [[Julian calendar]] in use in Great Britain until 1752.&lt;/ref&gt;{{spaced ndash}}29 January 1820) was [[List of British monarchs|King]] of [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] and [[List of Irish monarchs|King]] of [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]] from 25 October 1760 until the union of these two countries on 1 January 1801, after which he was King of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] until his death. He was concurrently Duke and [[prince-elector]] of [[Electorate of Brunswick-Lüneburg|Brunswick-Lüneburg (&quot;Hanover&quot;)]] in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] until his promotion to [[King of Hanover]] on 12 October 1814. He was the third British monarch of the [[House of Hanover]], but unlike his two Hanoverian predecessors he was born in Britain, spoke English as his first language,&lt;ref name=&quot;rh&quot;&gt;{{citation|author=The Royal Household|accessdate=3 March 2009|title=George III|work=Official website of the British Monarchy|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/HistoryoftheMonarchy/KingsandQueensoftheUnitedKingdom/TheHanoverians/GeorgeIII.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; and never visited Hanover.&lt;ref&gt;Brooke, p. 314; Fraser, p. 277&lt;/ref&gt;

His life and reign, which were longer than those of any previous British monarch, were marked by a series of military conflicts involving his kingdoms, much of the rest of Europe, and places farther afield in Africa, the Americas and Asia. Early in his reign, Great Britain defeated France in the [[Seven Years' War]], becoming the dominant European power in North America and India. However, many of its American colonies were soon lost in the [[American War of Independence]]. Further wars against [[French Revolution|revolutionary]] and [[First French Empire|Napoleonic France]] from 1793 concluded in the defeat of [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] at the [[Battle of Waterloo]] in 1815. 

In the later part of his life, George III suffered from recurrent, and eventually permanent, [[mental illness]]. Medical practitioners were baffled by this at the time, although it has since been suggested that he suffered from the blood disease [[porphyria]]. After a final relapse in 1810, a [[British Regency|regency]] was established, and George III's eldest son, [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George, Prince of Wales]], ruled as [[Prince Regent]]. On George III's death, the Prince Regent succeeded his father as George IV. 

Historical analysis of George III's life has gone through a &quot;kaleidoscope of changing views&quot; that have depended heavily on the prejudices of his biographers and the sources available to them.&lt;ref&gt;Butterfield, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; Until re-assessment in the later half of the twentieth century, his reputation in America was one of a tyrant and in Britain he became &quot;the scapegoat for the failure of imperialism&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Brooke, p. 269&lt;/ref&gt; He is often remembered as &quot;The Mad King&quot; and &quot;The King Who Lost America&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Brooke, pp. xv, 163; Andrews, Allen (1976) ''The King who lost America: George III and independence''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
George was born in London at [[Norfolk House]]. He was the grandson of [[George II of Great Britain|King George II]], and the son of [[Frederick, Prince of Wales]], and [[Augusta of Saxe-Gotha]]. As Prince George was born two months premature and was thought unlikely to survive, he was baptised the same day by [[Thomas Secker]], who was both Rector of [[St James's Church, Piccadilly|St James's]] and the [[Bishop of Oxford]].&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; One month later, he was publicly baptised at Norfolk House, again by Secker. His godparents were the [[Frederick I of Sweden|King of Sweden]] (for whom [[Charles Calvert, 5th Baron Baltimore|Lord Baltimore]] stood proxy), his uncle the [[Frederick III, Duke of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg|Duke of Saxe-Gotha]] (for whom [[Henry Brydges, 2nd Duke of Chandos|Lord Carnarvon]] stood proxy) and his great aunt the [[Sophia Dorothea of Hanover|Queen-consort of Prussia]] (for whom [[James Douglas, 4th Duke of Hamilton#Marriage and issue|Lady Charlotte Edwin]] stood proxy).&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=7712|date=20 June 1738|startpage=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

George grew into a healthy, but also reserved and shy child. The family moved to [[Leicester Square]], where George and his younger brother [[Prince Edward, Duke of York and Albany]], were educated together by private tutors. Family letters show that he could read and write in both English and German, as well as comment on political events of the time, by the age of eight.&lt;ref&gt;Brooke, pp. 23–41&lt;/ref&gt; He was the first British monarch to study science systematically. Apart from chemistry and physics, his lessons included astronomy, mathematics, French, Latin, history, music, geography, commerce, agriculture and constitutional law, along with sporting and social accomplishments such as dancing, fencing, and riding. His religious education was wholly [[Church of England|Anglican]].&lt;ref&gt;Brooke, pp. 42–44, 55&lt;/ref&gt; At age 10 George took part in a family production of [[Joseph Addison]]'s play ''[[Cato (play)|Cato]]'' and said in the new prologue: &quot;What, tho' a boy! It may with truth be said, A boy in ''England'' born, in England bred&quot;.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; Historian [[Romney Sedgwick]] argued that these lines appear &quot;to be the source of the only historical phrase with which he is associated&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Sedgwick, Romney (ed.; 1903) ''Letters from George III to Lord Bute, 1756–1766'', Macmillan, pp. ix–x&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:AyscoughGeorgeEdwardAugustus.jpg|thumb|left|Painting, ca. 1749, showing George (right) with his brother [[Prince Edward, Duke of York and Albany]], and their tutor, [[Francis Ayscough]], later [[Dean (religion)|Dean]] of [[Bristol Cathedral|Bristol]].|alt=Conversation piece in oils: man dressed in black with a clerical collar stands beside two boys sitting on a settee, one wearing a grey suit the other a blue one.

George's grandfather, King George II, disliked the Prince of Wales and took little interest in his grandchildren. However, in 1751 the Prince of Wales died unexpectedly from a lung injury, and George became [[heir apparent]] to the throne. He inherited one of his father's titles and became the [[Duke of Edinburgh]]. Now more interested in his grandson, three weeks later the King created George [[Prince of Wales]]&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, pp. 3–15&lt;/ref&gt; (the title is not automatically acquired).

In the spring of 1756, as George approached his eighteenth birthday, the King offered him a grand establishment at [[St James's Palace]], but George refused the offer, guided by his mother and her confidant, [[John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute|Lord Bute]], who would later serve as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]].&lt;ref&gt;Brooke, pp. 51–52; Hibbert, pp. 24–25&lt;/ref&gt; George's mother, now the [[Dowager]] Princess of Wales, preferred to keep George at home where she could imbue him with her strict moral values.&lt;ref&gt;Bullion, John L. (2004) [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/46829 &quot;Augusta , princess of Wales (1719–1772)&quot;], ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, [[doi:10.1093/ref:odnb/46829]], retrieved 17 September 2008 (Subscription required)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ayling, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage==
In 1759, George was smitten with [[Lady Sarah Lennox]], sister of the [[Charles Lennox, 3rd Duke of Richmond|Duke of Richmond]], but Lord Bute advised against the match and George abandoned his thoughts of marriage. &quot;I am born for the happiness or misery of a great nation,&quot; he wrote, &quot;and consequently must often act contrary to my passions.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Ayling, p. 54; Brooke, pp. 71–72&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, attempts by the King to marry George to [[Duchess Sophie Caroline Marie of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel]] were resisted by him and his mother;&lt;ref&gt;Ayling, pp. 36–37; Brooke, p. 49; Hibbert, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; Sophie married the [[Frederick, Margrave of Brandenburg-Bayreuth|Margrave of Bayreuth]] instead.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin, Lewis Saul (1907), ''Farmer George'', Pitman and Sons, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;

The following year, at the age of 22, George succeeded to the crown when his grandfather, George II, died suddenly on 25 October 1760, two weeks before his 77th birthday. The search for a suitable wife intensified. On 8 September 1761 in the [[Chapel Royal]], [[St James's Palace]], the King married Princess [[Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz]], whom he met on their wedding day.&lt;ref&gt;George was falsely said to have married a [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakeress]] named [[Hannah Lightfoot]] on 17 April 1759, prior to his marriage to Charlotte, and to have had at least one child by her. However, Lightfoot had married Isaac Axford in 1753, and had died in or before 1759, so there could have been no legal marriage or children. The jury at the 1866 trial of [[Lavinia Ryves]], the daughter of imposter [[Olivia Serres]] who pretended to be &quot;Princess Olive of Cumberland&quot;, unanimously found that a supposed marriage certificate produced by Ryves was a forgery ([http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/catalogue/externalreferencerequest.asp?requestreference=TS18%2F48 Documents relating to the case]. [[The National Archives]]. Accessed 14 October 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; A fortnight later, both were crowned at [[Westminster Abbey]]. George remarkably never took a mistress (in contrast with his grandfather and his sons), and the couple enjoyed a genuinely happy marriage.&lt;ref name=&quot;rh&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=dnb&gt;{{citation|first=John|last=Cannon|title=George III (1738–1820)|journal=[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=September 2004|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/10540|accessdate=29 October 2008}} (Subscription required)&lt;/ref&gt; They had 15 children—nine sons and six daughters. In 1762, George purchased Buckingham House (on the site now occupied by [[Buckingham Palace]]) for use as a family retreat.&lt;ref&gt;Ayling, pp. 85–87&lt;/ref&gt; His other residences were [[Kew Palace|Kew]] and [[Windsor Castle]]. St. James's Palace was retained for official use. He did not travel extensively, and spent his entire life in southern England. In the 1790s, annual holidays were taken at [[Weymouth, Dorset]],&lt;ref&gt;Ayling, p. 378; Cannon and Griffiths, p. 518&lt;/ref&gt; which he popularised as one of the first seaside resorts in England.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, p. 549&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early reign==
{{Further2|[[Great Britain in the Seven Years' War]]}}
George, in his accession speech to Parliament, proclaimed: &quot;Born and educated in this country, I glory in the name of Britain&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Brooke, p. 612.&lt;/ref&gt; George inserted this phrase into the speech, written by [[Philip Yorke, 1st Earl of Hardwicke|Lord Hardwicke]], and it demonstrated George's desire to distance himself from his German forebears, who were perceived as caring more for Hanover than for Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Brooke, p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brendan Simms and Torsten Riotte, ''The Hanoverian Dimension in British History, 1714–1837'' (Cambridge University Press, 2007), p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although George's accession was at first welcomed by politicians of all parties,&lt;ref&gt;For example, the letters of [[Horace Walpole]] written at the time of the accession defended George but Walpole's later memoirs were hostile (Butterfield, pp. 22, 115–117 and 129–130).&lt;/ref&gt; the first years of George's reign were marked by political instability, largely generated as a result of disagreements over the [[Seven Years' War]].&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, p. 86; Watson, pp. 67–79&lt;/ref&gt; George was perceived as favouring [[Tory]] ministers, which led to his denunciation by the [[British Whig Party|Whigs]] as an autocrat.&lt;ref name=&quot;rh&quot; /&gt; On George's accession, the [[Crown land]]s produced relatively little income; most revenue was generated through taxes and excise duties. George surrendered the [[Crown Estate]] to Parliamentary control in return for a [[Civil List]] annuity for the support of his household and the expenses of Civil Government.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.thecrownestate.co.uk/about_us/our_history.htm|title=Our history|author=The Crown Estate|year=2004|accessdate=21 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Claims that George used the income to reward supporters with bribes and gifts&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Kelso, Paul|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/margaret/story/0,,420405,00.html|journal=[[The Guardian]]|title=The royal family and the public purse|date=6 March 2000|accessdate=21 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; are disputed by historians who say such claims &quot;rest on nothing but falsehoods put out by disgruntled opposition&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, p. 88; this view is also shared by Brooke (see for example p. 99).&lt;/ref&gt; Debts amounting to over £3&amp;nbsp;million over the course of George's reign were paid by Parliament, and the Civil List annuity was increased from time to time.&lt;ref&gt;Medley, Dudley Julius (1902), [http://books.google.com/books?id=xi4GAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA501&amp;lpg=PA501&amp;dq=george+iii+crown+estate+debts&amp;source=web&amp;ots=TlpsTqmua0&amp;sig=7iGsFpjmpQx7yykQd7Zd34e41sQ ''A Student's Manual of English Constitutional History''], p. 501&lt;/ref&gt; George aided the [[Royal Academy]] with large grants from his private funds,&lt;ref&gt;Ayling, p. 194; Brooke, pp. xv, 214 and 301&lt;/ref&gt; and may have donated more than half of his personal income to charity.&lt;ref&gt;Brooke, p. 215&lt;/ref&gt; Of George's art collection, the two most notable purchases are [[Vermeer]]'s ''[[The Music Lesson|Lady at the Virginals]]'' and a set of [[Canaletto]]s, but it is as a collector of books that he is best remembered.&lt;ref&gt;Ayling, p. 195&lt;/ref&gt; The [[King's Library]] was open and available to scholars and was the foundation of a new national library.&lt;ref&gt;Ayling, pp. 196–198&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:George III 1762.jpg|thumb|left|[[Mezzotint]] of George III in 1762, after a painting by [[Thomas Frye]].|alt=Head-and-shoulders monochrome portrait of a young clean-shaven man wearing a richly-patterned jacket, plain neckcloth, powdered wig, and the chain of office or livery collar of the Order of the Garter.]]
In May 1762, the incumbent Whig government of the [[Thomas Pelham-Holles, 1st Duke of Newcastle|Duke of Newcastle]] was replaced with one led by the Scottish Tory [[John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute|Lord Bute]]. Bute's opponents worked against him by spreading the calumny that he was having an affair with the King's mother, and by exploiting anti-Scottish prejudices amongst the English.&lt;ref&gt;Brooke, p. 145; Carretta, pp. 59 and 64 ff.; Watson, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Wilkes]], a Member of Parliament, published ''[[The North Briton]]'', which was both inflammatory and defamatory in its condemnation of Bute and the government. Wilkes was eventually arrested for [[seditious libel]] but he fled to France to escape punishment; he was expelled from the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]], and found guilty ''in absentia'' of blasphemy and libel.&lt;ref&gt;Brooke, pp. 146–147&lt;/ref&gt; In 1763, after concluding the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Peace of Paris]] which ended the war, Lord Bute resigned, allowing the Whigs under [[George Grenville]] to return to power.

Later that year, the [[Royal Proclamation of 1763]] placed a boundary upon the westward expansion of the American colonies. The Proclamation aimed to divert colonial expansion to the north (to Nova Scotia) and to the south (Florida). The Proclamation Line did not bother the majority of settled farmers, but it was unpopular with a vocal minority and ultimately contributed to conflict between the colonists and the British government.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, pp. 183–184&lt;/ref&gt; With the American colonists generally unburdened by British taxes, the government thought it appropriate for them to pay towards the defence of the colonies against native uprisings and the possibility of French incursions.&lt;ref&gt;An American taxpayer would pay a maximum of sixpence a year, compared to an average of twenty-five shillings (50 times as much) in England (Cannon and Griffiths, p. 505; Hibbert, p. 122). In 1763, the total revenue from America amounted to about £1&amp;nbsp;800, while the estimated annual cost of the military in America was put at £225&amp;nbsp;000. By 1767, it had risen to £400&amp;nbsp;000 (Cannon and Griffiths, p. 505).&lt;/ref&gt; The central issue for the colonists was not the amount of taxes but whether Parliament could levy a tax without American approval, for there were no American seats in Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;Black, p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; The Americans protested that like all Englishmen they had rights to &quot;[[no taxation without representation]]&quot;, an argument London dismissed in the name of virtual representation. In 1765, Grenville introduced the [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Act]], which levied a [[stamp duty]] on every document in the British colonies in North America. Since newspapers were printed on stamped paper, those most affected by the introduction of the duty were the most effective at producing propaganda opposing the tax.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, pp. 184–185&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the King had become exasperated at Grenville's attempts to reduce the King's prerogatives, and tried, unsuccessfully, to persuade [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham|William Pitt the Elder]] to accept the office of Prime Minister.&lt;ref&gt;Ayling, pp. 122–133; Hibbert, pp. 107–109; Watson, pp. 106–111&lt;/ref&gt; After a brief illness, which may have presaged his illnesses to come, George settled on [[Charles Watson-Wentworth, 2nd Marquess of Rockingham|Lord Rockingham]] to form a ministry, and dismissed Grenville.&lt;ref&gt;Ayling, pp. 122–133; Hibbert, pp. 111–113&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:George III (by Allan Ramsay).jpg|thumb|upright|George III by [[Allan Ramsay (artist)|Allan Ramsay]], 1762|alt=Quarter-length portrait in oils of a clean-shaven young man in profile wearing a red suit, the Garter star, a blue sash, and a powdered wig. He has a receding chin and his forehead slopes away from the bridge of his nose making his head look round in shape.]]
Lord Rockingham, with the support of Pitt and the King, repealed Grenville's unpopular Stamp Act, but his government was weak and he was replaced in 1766 by Pitt, whom George created [[Earl of Chatham]]. The actions of Lord Chatham and George III in repealing the Act were so popular in America that statues of them both were erected in [[History of New York City (1665-1783)|New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;Ayling, p. 137; Hibbert, p. 124&lt;/ref&gt; Lord Chatham fell ill in 1767, and the [[Augustus FitzRoy, 3rd Duke of Grafton|Duke of Grafton]] took over the government, although he did not formally become Prime Minister until 1768. That year, John Wilkes returned to England, stood as a candidate in the [[British general election, 1768|general election]], and came top of the poll in the [[Middlesex (UK Parliament constituency)|Middlesex constituency]]. Wilkes was again expelled from Parliament. Wilkes was re-elected and expelled twice more, before the House of Commons resolved that his candidature was invalid and declared [[Henry Luttrell, 2nd Earl of Carhampton|the runner-up]] as the victor.&lt;ref&gt;Ayling, pp. 154–160; Brooke, pp. 147–151&lt;/ref&gt; Grafton's government disintegrated in 1770, allowing the Tories led by [[Frederick North, Lord North|Lord North]] to return to power.&lt;ref&gt;Ayling, pp. 167–168; Hibbert, p. 140&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:George III Zoffany.jpg|thumb|left|Mezzotint of George III in 1771, after a painting by [[Johann Zoffany]].|alt=Monochrome portrait of a clean-shaven man with a fleshy face and white eyebrows wearing a powdered wig.]]
George was deeply devout and spent hours in prayer,&lt;ref&gt;Brooke, p. 260; Fraser, p. 277&lt;/ref&gt; but his piety was not shared by his brothers. George was appalled by what he saw as their loose morals. In 1770, his brother [[Prince Henry, Duke of Cumberland and Strathearn]], was exposed as an adulterer, and the following year Cumberland married a young widow, [[Anne Horton]]. The King considered her inappropriate as a royal bride: she was from a lower social class and German law barred any children of the couple from the Hanoverian succession. George insisted on a new law that essentially forbade members of the Royal Family from legally marrying without the consent of the Sovereign. The subsequent bill was unpopular in Parliament, including among George's own ministers, but passed as the [[Royal Marriages Act 1772]]. Shortly afterward, another of George's brothers, [[Prince William Henry, Duke of Gloucester and Edinburgh]], revealed he had been secretly married to [[Maria, Duchess of Gloucester and Edinburgh|Maria, Countess Waldegrave]], the illegitimate daughter of Sir [[Edward Walpole]]. The news confirmed George's opinion that he had been right to introduce the law: Maria was related to his political opponents. Neither lady was ever received at court.&lt;ref&gt;Brooke, pp. 272–282; Cannon and Griffiths, p. 498&lt;/ref&gt;

Lord North's government was chiefly concerned with discontent in America. To assuage American opinion most of the custom duties were withdrawn, except for the tea duty, which in George's words was &quot;one tax to keep up the right [to levy taxes]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; In 1773, the tea ships moored in [[Boston Harbor]] were boarded by colonists and the tea thrown overboard, an event that became known as the [[Boston Tea Party]]. In Britain, opinion hardened against the colonists, with Chatham now agreeing with North that the destruction of the tea was &quot;certainly criminal&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, p. 143&lt;/ref&gt; With the clear support of Parliament Lord North introduced measures, which were called the [[Intolerable Acts]] by the colonists: the [[Port of Boston]] was shut down and the [[Explanatory charter|charter]] of [[Province of Massachusetts Bay|Massachusetts]] was [[Massachusetts Government Act|altered]] so that the upper house of the legislature was appointed by [[the Crown]] instead of elected by the lower house.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, p. 197&lt;/ref&gt; Up to this point, in the words of Professor Peter Thomas, George's &quot;hopes were centred on a political solution, and he always bowed to his cabinet's opinions even when sceptical of their success. The detailed evidence of the years from 1763 to 1775 tends to exonerate George III from any real responsibility for the [[American Revolution]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Thomas|first=Peter D. G.|title=George III and the American Revolution|journal=History|volume=70|issue=228|page=31|year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the Americans characterised George as a tyrant, in these years he acted as a constitutional monarch supporting the initiatives of his ministers.&lt;ref&gt;Ayling, p. 121&lt;/ref&gt;

==American War of Independence==
The [[American Revolution]] began when armed conflict between British regulars and colonial militiamen broke out in [[New England]] in April 1775. After a year of fighting, the colonies [[United States Declaration of Independence|declared their independence]] from the Crown as &quot;free and independent States&quot; in July 1776, and listed grievances against the British king, legislature, and populace. Among George's other offences, the Declaration charged, &quot;He has abdicated Government here&amp;nbsp;... He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.&quot; The gilded equestrian statue of George III in New York was pulled down.&lt;ref&gt;Carretta, pp. 97, 98 and 367&lt;/ref&gt; The British captured the city in 1776, but lost Boston, and the [[Saratoga campaign|grand strategic plan]] of invading from Canada and cutting off New England failed with the surrender of the British Lieutenant-General [[John Burgoyne]] at the [[Battle of Saratoga]].

George III is often accused of obstinately trying to keep Great Britain at war with the revolutionaries in America, despite the opinions of his own ministers. In the words of the Victorian author [[Sir George Trevelyan, 2nd Baronet|George Trevelyan]], the King was determined &quot;never to acknowledge the independence of the Americans, and to punish their contumacy by the indefinite prolongation of a war which promised to be eternal.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Trevelyan, vol. 1 p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; The King wanted to &quot;keep the rebels harassed, anxious, and poor, until the day when, by a natural and inevitable process, discontent and disappointment were converted into penitence and remorse&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Trevelyan, vol. 1 p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; However, more recent historians defend George by saying in the context of the times no king would willingly surrender such a large territory,&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;&lt;ref name=cg&gt;Cannon and Griffiths, pp. 510–511&lt;/ref&gt; and his conduct was far less ruthless than contemporary monarchs in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Brooke, p. 183&lt;/ref&gt; After Saratoga, both Parliament and the British people were in favour of the war; recruitment ran at high levels and although political opponents were vocal, they remained a small minority.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brooke, pp. 180–182, 192, 223&lt;/ref&gt; With the setbacks in America, Prime Minister [[Frederick North, Lord North|Lord North]] asked to transfer power to [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham|Lord Chatham]], whom he thought more capable, but George refused to do so; he suggested instead that Chatham serve as a subordinate minister in Lord North's administration, but Chatham refused to cooperate. He died later in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, pp. 156–157&lt;/ref&gt; In early 1778, [[Early modern France|France]] (Britain's chief rival) signed a [[Treaty of Alliance (1778)|treaty of alliance]] with the United States and the conflict escalated. The United States and France were soon joined by [[Enlightenment in Spain|Spain]] and the [[Dutch Republic]], while Britain had no major allies of its own. [[Granville Leveson-Gower, 1st Marquess of Stafford|Lord Gower]] and [[Thomas Thynne, 1st Marquess of Bath|Lord Weymouth]] both resigned from the government. Lord North again requested that he also be allowed to resign, but he stayed in office at George III's insistence.&lt;ref&gt;Ayling, pp. 275–276&lt;/ref&gt; Opposition to the costly war was increasing, and in June 1780 contributed to disturbances in London known as the [[Gordon riots]].&lt;ref&gt;Ayling, p. 284&lt;/ref&gt;

As late as the [[Siege of Charleston]] in 1780, Loyalists could still believe in their eventual victory, as British troops inflicted heavy defeats on the Continental forces at the [[Battle of Camden]] and the [[Battle of Guildford Court House]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford Illustrated History of the British Army'' (1994) p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1781, the news of [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Lord Cornwallis's]] surrender at the [[Siege of Yorktown]] reached London; Lord North's parliamentary support ebbed away and he resigned the following year. The King drafted an abdication notice, which was never delivered,&lt;ref name=cg/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brooke, p. 221&lt;/ref&gt; finally accepted the defeat in North America, and authorised the negotiation of a peace. The [[Peace of Paris (1783)|Treaties of Paris]], by which Britain recognised the independence of the American states and [[Spanish Florida|returned Florida]] to Spain, were ratified in 1783.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of State, [http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ho/time/ar/14313.htm Treaty of Paris, 1783], retrieved 30 October 2008&lt;/ref&gt; When [[John Adams]] was appointed [[United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom|American Minister to London]] in 1785, George had become resigned to the new relationship between his country and the former colonies. He told Adams, &quot;I was the last to consent to the separation; but the separation having been made and having become inevitable, I have always said, as I say now, that I would be the first to meet the friendship of the United States as an independent power.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Adams, C.F. (editor) (1850–56), ''The works of John Adams, second president of the United States'', vol. VIII, pp. 255–257, quoted in Ayling, p. 323 and Hibbert, p. 165&lt;/ref&gt;

==Constitutional struggle==
With the collapse of Lord North's ministry in 1782, the Whig Lord Rockingham became Prime Minister for the second time, but died within months. The King then appointed [[William Petty, 2nd Earl of Shelburne|Lord Shelburne]] to replace him. [[Charles James Fox]], however, refused to serve under Shelburne, and demanded the appointment of the [[William Cavendish-Bentinck, 3rd Duke of Portland|Duke of Portland]]. In 1783, the House of Commons forced Lord Shelburne from office and his government was replaced by the [[Fox-North Coalition]]. The Duke of Portland became Prime Minister, with Fox and Lord North, as Foreign Secretary and Home Secretary respectively.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

The King disliked Fox intensely, for his politics as well as his character; he thought Fox was unprincipled and a bad influence on the Prince of Wales.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Ayling, p. 281&lt;/ref&gt; George III was distressed at having to appoint ministers not of his liking, but the Portland ministry quickly built up a majority in the House of Commons, and could not be displaced easily. He was further dismayed when the government introduced the India Bill, which proposed to reform the government of India by transferring political power from the [[Honourable East India Company]] to Parliamentary commissioners.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, p. 243; Pares, p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; Although the King actually favoured greater control over the Company, the proposed commissioners were all political allies of Fox.&lt;ref&gt;Brooke, pp. 250–251&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately after the House of Commons passed it, George authorised [[George Nugent-Temple-Grenville, 1st Marquess of Buckingham|Lord Temple]] to inform the [[House of Lords]] that he would regard any peer who voted for the bill as his enemy. The bill was rejected by the Lords; three days later, the Portland ministry was dismissed, and [[William Pitt the Younger]] was appointed Prime Minister, with Temple as his Secretary of State. On 17 December 1783, Parliament voted in favour of a motion condemning the influence of the monarch in parliamentary voting as a &quot;high crime&quot; and Temple was forced to resign. Temple's departure destabilised the government, and three months later the government lost its majority and Parliament was dissolved; the subsequent [[British general election, 1784|election]] gave Pitt a firm mandate.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

For George III, Pitt's appointment was a great victory. It proved that he was able to appoint Prime Ministers on the basis of his own interpretation of the public mood without having to follow the choice of the current majority in the House of Commons. Throughout Pitt's ministry, George supported many of Pitt's political aims and created new peers at an unprecedented rate to increase the number of Pitt's supporters in the House of Lords.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, pp. 272–279&lt;/ref&gt; During and after Pitt's ministry, George III was extremely popular in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Brooke, p. 316; Carretta, pp. 262 and 297&lt;/ref&gt; The British people admired him for his piety, and for remaining faithful to his wife.&lt;ref&gt;Brooke, p. 259&lt;/ref&gt; He was fond of his children, and was devastated at the death of two of his sons in infancy in 1782 and 1783 respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Ayling, p. 218&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, he set his children a strict regimen. They were expected to attend rigorous lessons from seven in the morning, and to lead lives of religious observance and virtue.&lt;ref&gt;Ayling, p. 220&lt;/ref&gt; When his children strayed from George's own principles of righteousness, as his sons did as young adults, he was dismayed and disappointed.&lt;ref&gt;Ayling, pp. 222–230, 366–376&lt;/ref&gt;

By this time George's health was deteriorating. He suffered from a mental illness, which was possibly a symptom of the genetic disease [[porphyria]],&lt;ref&gt;[[John C. G. Röhl|Röhl, John C. G.]]; Warren, Martin; Hunt, David (1998) ''Purple Secret: Genes, &quot;Madness&quot; and the Royal Houses of Europe'', London: Bantam Press, ISBN 0-593-04148-8&lt;/ref&gt; although this has been questioned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| author=Peters, Timothy J.; Wilkinson, D. | year = 2010 | title = King George III and porphyria: a clinical re-examination of the historical evidence | doi = 10.1177/0957154X09102616 | journal=History of Psychiatry | volume = 21 | issue = 1| pages = 3–19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A study of samples of the King's hair published in 2005 revealed high levels of [[arsenic]], a possible trigger for the disease.

At the end of the parliamentary session, he went to [[Cheltenham Spa]] to recuperate. It was the furthest he had ever been from London—just short of 100&amp;nbsp;miles (150&amp;nbsp;km)—but his condition worsened. In November he became seriously deranged, sometimes speaking for many hours without pause, causing him to foam at the mouth and making his voice hoarse.&lt;ref&gt;Farquhar, Michael (2001) ''A Treasure of Royal Scandals'', New York: Penguin Books, ISBN 0-7394-2025-9, p. 188&lt;/ref&gt; With his doctors largely at a loss to explain his illness, spurious stories about his condition spread, such as the claim that he shook hands with a tree in the mistaken belief that it was the King of Prussia.&lt;ref&gt;Ayling, pp. 329–335; Brooke, pp. 322–328; Fraser, pp. 281–282; Hibbert, pp. 262–267&lt;/ref&gt; Treatment for mental illness was primitive by modern standards, and the King's doctors, who included [[Francis Willis (physician)|Francis Willis]], treated the King by forcibly restraining him until he was calm, or applying caustic poultices to draw out &quot;evil humours&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Ayling, pp. 334–343; Brooke, p. 332; Fraser, p. 282&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:GeorgeIIIGuinea.jpg|left|thumb|Gold [[Guinea (British coin)|guinea]] of George III, dated 1789|alt=Gold coin bearing the profile of a round-headed man wearing a classical Roman-style haircut and laurel-wreath.]]

In the reconvened Parliament, Fox and Pitt wrangled over the terms of the regency. While both agreed that it would be most reasonable for George III's eldest son and [[heir apparent]], the Prince of Wales, to act as Regent, to Pitt’s consternation Fox suggested that it was the Prince of Wales's absolute right to act on his ill father's behalf with full powers. Pitt, fearing he would be removed from office if the Prince of Wales were empowered, argued that it was for Parliament to nominate a Regent, and wanted to restrict the Regent's authority.&lt;ref&gt;Ayling, pp. 338–342; Hibbert, p. 273&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1789, the Regency Bill, authorising the Prince of Wales to act as Prince Regent, was introduced and passed in the House of Commons, but before the House of Lords could pass the bill, George III recovered.&lt;ref&gt;Ayling, p. 345&lt;/ref&gt;

Behind him a groom holds a horse.]]

After George’s recovery, his popularity, and that of Pitt, continued to increase at the expense of Fox and the Prince of Wales.&lt;ref&gt;Ayling, pp. 349–350; Carretta, p. 285; Fraser, p. 282; Hibbert, pp. 301–302; Watson, p. 323&lt;/ref&gt; His humane and understanding treatment of two insane assailants, [[Margaret Nicholson]] in 1786 and [[John Frith (assailant)|John Frith]] in 1790, contributed to his popularity.&lt;ref&gt;Carretta, p. 275&lt;/ref&gt; A failed attempt to assassinate the King on 15 May 1800 was not political in origin but motivated by the delusions of [[James Hadfield]], who shot at the King in the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Drury Lane Theatre]]. George seemed unperturbed by the incident, so much so that he fell asleep in the interval.&lt;ref&gt;Ayling, pp. 181–182; Fraser, p. 282&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[French Revolution]] of 1789, in which the [[French monarchy]] had been overthrown, worried many British landowners. France declared war on Great Britain in 1793; in the war attempt, George allowed Pitt to increase taxes, raise armies, and suspend the right of ''[[habeas corpus]]''. The [[first coalition|First Coalition]] to oppose revolutionary France, which included Austria, Prussia, and Spain, broke up in 1795 when Prussia and Spain made separate peace with France.&lt;ref&gt;Ayling, pp. 395–396; Watson, pp. 360–377&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Second Coalition]], which included Austria, Russia, and the [[Ottoman Empire]], was defeated in 1800. Only Great Britain was left fighting [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]], the [[First Consul]] of the [[French First Republic|French Republic]].

A brief lull in hostilities allowed Pitt to concentrate effort on Ireland, where there had been an uprising and attempted French landing in 1798.&lt;ref&gt;Ayling, pp. 408–409&lt;/ref&gt; In 1800, the British and Irish Parliaments passed an [[Acts of Union 1800|Act of Union]] that took effect on 1 January 1801 and united Great Britain and Ireland into a single state, known as the &quot;United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland&quot;. George used the opportunity to drop the title &quot;king of France&quot;, which [[English claims to the French throne|English and British Sovereigns had maintained]] since the reign of [[Edward III of England|Edward III]].&lt;ref name=weir286&gt;Weir, p. 286&lt;/ref&gt; It was suggested that George adopt the title &quot;[[British Emperor|Emperor of the British Isles]]&quot;, but he refused.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; As part of his Irish policy, Pitt planned to remove certain [[Anti-Catholicism in the United Kingdom|legal disabilities]] that applied to [[Roman Catholicism in the United Kingdom|Roman Catholics]]. George III claimed that to emancipate Catholics would be to violate his coronation oath, in which Sovereigns promise to maintain Protestantism.&lt;ref&gt;Ayling, p. 411&lt;/ref&gt; Faced with opposition to his religious reform policies from both the King and the British public, Pitt threatened to resign.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, p. 313&lt;/ref&gt; At about the same time, the King suffered a relapse of his previous illness, which he blamed on worry over the Catholic question.&lt;ref&gt;Ayling, p. 414; Brooke, p. 374; Hibbert, p. 315&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 March 1801, Pitt was formally replaced by the [[Speaker of the British House of Commons|Speaker of the House of Commons]], [[Henry Addington, 1st Viscount Sidmouth|Henry Addington]]. Addington opposed emancipation, instituted annual accounts, abolished income tax and began a programme of disarmament. In October 1801, he made peace with the French, and in 1802 signed the [[Treaty of Amiens]].&lt;ref&gt;Watson, pp. 402–409&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:The king of Brobdingnag and Gulliver.jpg|thumb|right|Caricature of George holding Napoleon in the palm of his hand. [[James Gillray]], 1803.|alt=A span-high Napoleon stands on the outstretched hand of a full-size George III, who peers at him through a spy-glass.]]
George did not consider the peace with France as real; in his view it was an &quot;experiment&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Ayling, p. 423&lt;/ref&gt; In 1803, the war resumed but public opinion distrusted Addington to lead the nation in war, and instead favoured Pitt. An invasion of England by Napoleon seemed imminent, and a massive volunteer movement arose to defend England against the French. George's review of 27,000 volunteers in [[Hyde Park, London]], on 26 and 28 October 1803 and at the height of the invasion scare, attracted an estimated 500,000 spectators on each day.&lt;ref&gt;Colley, Linda (1994), ''Britons: Forging the Nation 1707–1837'', Yale University Press, p. 225&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Times]]'' said, &quot;The enthusiasm of the multitude was beyond all expression.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 27 October 1803, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; A courtier wrote on 13 November that, &quot;The King is really prepared to take the field in case of attack, his beds are ready and he can move at half an hour's warning&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Brooke, p. 597&lt;/ref&gt; George wrote to his friend [[Richard Hurd (clergyman)|Bishop Hurd]], &quot;We are here in daily expectation that Bonaparte will attempt his threatened invasion&amp;nbsp;... Should his troops effect a landing, I shall certainly put myself at the head of mine, and my other armed subjects, to repel them.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Letter of 30 November 1803, quoted in Wheeler, H. F. B.; Broadley, A. M. (1908), ''Napoleon and the Invasion of England. Volume I'', London: John Lane The Bodley Head, p. xiii&lt;/ref&gt; After [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Admiral Lord Nelson]]'s famous naval victory at the [[Battle of Trafalgar]], the possibility of invasion was extinguished.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/nelson/gallery8/default.htm|title=Nelson, Trafalgar, and those who served|publisher=[[The National Archives]]|accessdate=31 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1804, George was again affected by his recurrent illness; after his recovery, Addington resigned and Pitt regained power. Pitt sought to appoint Fox to his ministry, but George III refused. [[William Wyndham Grenville, 1st Baron Grenville|Lord Grenville]] perceived an injustice to Fox, and refused to join the new ministry.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; Pitt concentrated on forming a coalition with Austria, Russia, and Sweden. This [[Third Coalition]], however, met the same fate as the First and Second Coalitions, collapsing in 1805. The setbacks in Europe took a toll on Pitt's health and he died in 1806, reopening the question of who should serve in the ministry. Lord Grenville became Prime Minister, and his &quot;[[Ministry of All the Talents]]&quot; included Fox. The King was conciliatory towards Fox, after being forced to capitulate over his appointment. After Fox's death in September 1806, the King and ministry were in open conflict. To boost recruitment, the ministry proposed a measure in February 1807 whereby Roman Catholics would be allowed to serve in all ranks of the Armed Forces. George instructed them not only to drop the measure, but also to agree never to set up such a measure again. The ministers agreed to drop the measure then pending, but refused to bind themselves in the future.&lt;ref&gt;Pares, p. 139&lt;/ref&gt; They were dismissed and replaced by the [[William Cavendish-Bentinck, 3rd Duke of Portland|Duke of Portland]] as the nominal Prime Minister, with actual power being held by the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], [[Spencer Perceval]]. Parliament was dissolved, and the [[United Kingdom general election, 1807|subsequent election]] gave the ministry a strong majority in the House of Commons. George III made no further major political decisions during his reign; the replacement of the Duke of Portland by Perceval in 1809 was of little actual significance.&lt;ref&gt;Ayling, pp. 441–442&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
[[File:George III by Henry Meyer.jpg|thumb|right|Engraving by Henry Meyer of George III in later life|alt=Monochrome profile of elderly George with a long white beard]]

In late 1810, at the height of his popularity&lt;ref&gt;Brooke, p. 381; Carretta, p. 340&lt;/ref&gt; but already virtually blind with [[cataracts]] and in pain from [[rheumatism]], George III became dangerously ill. In his view the malady had been triggered by the stress he suffered at the death of his youngest and favourite daughter, [[Princess Amelia of the United Kingdom|Princess Amelia]].&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, p. 396&lt;/ref&gt; The Princess's nurse reported that &quot;the scenes of distress and crying every day&amp;nbsp;... were melancholy beyond description.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, p. 394&lt;/ref&gt; He accepted the need for the [[Care of King During his Illness, etc. Act 1811|Regency Act of 1811]],&lt;ref&gt;Brooke, p. 383; Hibbert, pp. 397–398&lt;/ref&gt; and the Prince of Wales acted as Regent for the remainder of George III's life. By the end of 1811, George III had become permanently insane and lived in seclusion at Windsor Castle until his death.&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, p. 285; Hibbert, pp. 399–402&lt;/ref&gt;

Prime Minister [[Spencer Perceval]] was assassinated in 1812 (the only British Prime Minister to have suffered such a fate) and was replaced by [[Robert Banks Jenkinson, 2nd Earl of Liverpool|Lord Liverpool]]. Liverpool oversaw British victory in the Napoleonic Wars. The subsequent [[Congress of Vienna]] led to significant territorial gains for Hanover, which was upgraded from an electorate to a [[Kingdom of Hanover|kingdom]].

Meanwhile, George's health deteriorated. He suffered from [[dementia]] and became completely blind and increasingly deaf. He was incapable of knowing or understanding either that he was declared King of Hanover in 1814, or that his wife died in 1818.&lt;ref&gt;Ayling, pp. 453–455; Brooke, pp. 384–385; Hibbert, p. 405&lt;/ref&gt; Over Christmas 1819, he spoke nonsense for 58 hours, and for the last few weeks of his life was unable to walk.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, p. 408&lt;/ref&gt; He died at [[Windsor Castle]] at 8:38&amp;nbsp;pm on 29 January 1820, six days after the death of his fourth son, the [[Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn|Duke of Kent]]. His favourite son, [[Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany|Frederick, Duke of York]], was with him.&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Duke of York to George IV, quoted in Brooke, p. 386&lt;/ref&gt; George III was buried on 16 February in [[St. George's Chapel, Windsor Castle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.stgeorges-windsor.org/about-st-georges/royal-connection/burial/burials-in-the-chapel-since-1805.html|publisher=Dean and Canons of Windsor|title=Royal Burials in the Chapel since 1805|work=St. George's Chapel, Windsor Castle|accessdate=9 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brooke, p. 387&lt;/ref&gt;

George was succeeded by two of his sons [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]] and [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV]], who both died without surviving legitimate children, leaving the throne to the only legitimate child of the Duke of Kent, [[Queen Victoria|Victoria]], the last monarch of the House of Hanover.

George III lived for 81 years and 239 days and reigned for 59 years and 96 days: both his life and his reign were longer than those of any of his predecessors. Only [[Queen Victoria]] and [[Elizabeth II]] [[List of British monarchs by longevity|lived]] and [[List of longest-reigning British monarchs|reigned longer]].

George III was dubbed &quot;Farmer George&quot; by satirists, at first mocking his interest in mundane matters rather than politics but later to contrast his homely thrift with his son's grandiosity and to portray him as a man of the people.&lt;ref&gt;Carretta, pp. 92–93, 267–273, 302–305 and 317&lt;/ref&gt; Under George III, who was passionately interested in agriculture,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.rbgkew.org.uk/heritage/timeline/1773to1820_farmer.html|title='Farmer' George and his 'ferme ornée'|publisher=[[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew]]|accessdate=21 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[British Agricultural Revolution]] reached its peak and great advances were made in fields such as science and industry. There was unprecedented growth in the rural population, which in turn provided much of the workforce for the concurrent [[Industrial Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Watson, pp. 10–11&lt;/ref&gt; George's collection of mathematical and scientific instruments is now housed in the [[Science Museum (London)]]; he funded the construction and maintenance of [[William Herschel]]'s forty-foot [[telescope]], which was the biggest ever built at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Ayling, p. 204&lt;/ref&gt; Herschel discovered the planet [[Uranus]], which he at first named ''Georgium Sidus'' (George's Star) after the King, in 1781.

George III hoped that &quot;the tongue of malice may not paint my intentions in those colours she admires, nor the sycophant extoll me beyond what I deserve&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Brooke, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt; but in the popular mind George III has been both demonised and praised. While very popular at the start of his reign, by the mid-1770s George had lost the loyalty of revolutionary American colonists,&lt;ref&gt;Carretta, pp. 99–101 and 123–126&lt;/ref&gt; though it has been estimated that as many as half of the colonists remained loyal.&lt;ref&gt;Ayling, p. 247&lt;/ref&gt; The grievances in the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] were presented as &quot;repeated injuries and usurpations&quot; that he had committed to establish an &quot;absolute Tyranny&quot; over the colonies. The Declaration's wording has contributed to the American public's perception of George as a tyrant. Contemporary accounts of George III's life fall into two camps: one demonstrating &quot;attitudes dominant in the latter part of the reign, when the King had become a revered symbol of national resistance to French ideas and French power&quot;, while the other &quot;derived their views of the King from the bitter partisan strife of the first two decades of the reign, and they expressed in their works the views of the opposition&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Reitan, E. A.|chapter=Introduction|page=viii|editor=Reitan, E. A.|title=George III, Tyrant Or Constitutional Monarch?|year=1964|publisher=D. C. Heath and Company|location=Boston}}&lt;/ref&gt; Building on the latter of these two assessments, British historians of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, such as [[Sir George Trevelyan, 2nd Baronet|Trevelyan]] and [[Erskine May, 1st Baron Farnborough|Erskine May]], promoted hostile interpretations of George III's life. However, in the mid-twentieth century the work of [[Lewis Namier]], who thought George was &quot;much maligned&quot;, kick-started a re-evaluation of the man and his reign.&lt;ref&gt;Reitan, pp. xii–xiii&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars of the later twentieth century, such as [[Herbert Butterfield|Butterfield]] and Pares, and Macalpine and Hunter, are inclined to treat George sympathetically, seeing him as a victim of circumstance and illness. Butterfield rejected the arguments of his Victorian predecessors with withering disdain: &quot;Erskine May must be a good example of the way in which an historian may fall into error through an excess of brilliance. His capacity for synthesis, and his ability to dovetail the various parts of the evidence&amp;nbsp;... carried him into a more profound and complicated elaboration of error than some of his more pedestrian predecessors&amp;nbsp;... he inserted a doctrinal element into his history which, granted his original aberrations, was calculated to project the lines of his error, carrying his work still further from centrality or truth.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Butterfield, p. 152&lt;/ref&gt; In pursuing war with the American colonists, George III believed he was defending the right of an elected Parliament to levy taxes, rather than seeking to expand his own power or prerogatives.&lt;ref&gt;Brooke, pp. 175–176&lt;/ref&gt; In the opinion of modern scholars, during the long reign of George III the monarchy continued to lose its political power, and grew as the embodiment of national morality.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

*'''31 March 1751 – 20 April 1751''': ''His Royal Highness'' The Duke of Edinburgh
*'''20 April 1751 – 25 October 1760''': ''His Royal Highness'' The Prince of Wales
*'''25 October 1760 – 29 January 1820''': ''His Majesty'' The King

In Great Britain, George III used the official [[Style (manner of address)|style]] &quot;George the Third, by the Grace of God, King of Great Britain, France, and Ireland, [[Fidei defensor|Defender of the Faith]], and so forth&quot;. In 1801, when [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] united with [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]], he dropped the title of king of France, which had been used for every English monarch since [[Edward III of England|Edward III's]] [[English claims to the French throne|claim to the French throne]] in the medieval period.&lt;ref name=weir286/&gt; His style became &quot;George the Third, by the Grace of God, of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland King, Defender of the Faith.&quot;&lt;ref name=p390&gt;Brooke, p. 390&lt;/ref&gt;

In Germany, he was &quot;Duke of [[Brunswick (city)|Brunswick]] and [[Lüneburg]], Archtreasurer and [[Prince-Elector]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]&quot; until the end of the empire in 1806. He then continued as Duke until the [[Congress of Vienna]] declared him &quot;King of Hanover&quot; in 1814.&lt;ref name=p390/&gt;

===Arms===
Before his succession, George was granted the [[Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom|royal arms]] differenced by a [[Label (heraldry)|label]] of five points [[Azure (heraldry)|Azure]], the centre point bearing a [[fleur-de-lys]] [[Or (heraldry)|Or]] on 27 July 1749. Upon his father's death, and along with the dukedom of Edinburgh and the position of heir-apparent, he inherited his difference of a plain label of three points [[Argent]]. In an additional difference, the crown of Charlemagne was not usually depicted on the arms of the heir, only on the Sovereign's.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.heraldica.org/topics/britain/cadency.htm|title=Marks of Cadency in the British Royal Family|author=Velde, François|date=19 April 2008|publisher=Heraldica|accessdate=9 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From his succession until 1800, George bore the royal arms: [[Quartering (heraldry)|Quarterly]], I [[Gules]] three lions [[Attitude (heraldry)#Passant|passant guardant]] in [[Pale (heraldry)|pale]] Or ([[Royal Arms of England|for England]])) [[Impalement (heraldry)|impaling]] Or a lion [[rampant]] within a [[tressure]] flory-counter-flory Gules ([[Royal coat of arms of Scotland|for Scotland]]); II Azure three fleurs-de-lys Or (for France); III Azure a harp Or stringed Argent ([[Coat of arms of Ireland|for Ireland]]); IV [[Division of the field|tierced per pale and per chevron]] (for Hanover), I Gules two lions passant guardant Or (for Brunswick), II Or a [[semy]] of hearts Gules a lion rampant Azure (for Lüneburg), III Gules a horse [[Attitude (heraldry)#Courant|courant]] Argent ([[Coat of arms of Lower Saxony|for Westphalia]]), overall an escutcheon Gules charged with the crown of [[Charlemagne]] Or (for the dignity of Archtreasurer of the Holy Roman Empire).&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, [[William Berry (genealogist)|Berry, William]] (1810), ''An introduction to heraldry containing the rudiments of the science'', pp. 110–111&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Pinches|first=John Harvey|coauthors=Pinches, Rosemary|title=The Royal Heraldry of England |series=Heraldry Today |year=1974|publisher=Hollen Street Press |location=Slough, Buckinghamshire |isbn=0-900455-25-X|pages=215–216}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[Acts of Union 1800]], the royal arms were amended, dropping the French quartering. They became: Quarterly, I and IV England; II Scotland; III Ireland; overall an escutcheon of Hanover surmounted by an electoral bonnet.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=15324|startpage=2|date=30 December 1800}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1816, after the [[Electorate of Hanover]] became a kingdom, the electoral bonnet was changed to a crown.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=17149|startpage=1|date=29 June 1816}}&lt;/ref&gt;
