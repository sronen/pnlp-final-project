'''Alice Ayres''' (12 September 1859&amp;nbsp;– {{Nowrap|26 April}} 1885) was an English [[nursemaid]] honoured for her bravery in rescuing the children in her care from a house fire. Ayres was a [[Domestic worker|household assistant]] and nursemaid to the family of her brother-in-law and sister, Henry and Mary Ann Chandler. The Chandlers owned an oil and paint shop in [[Union Street, London|Union Street]], [[Southwark]], then just south of London, and Ayres lived with the family above the shop. In 1885 fire broke out in the shop, and Ayres rescued three of her nieces from the burning building, before falling from a window and suffering fatal injury.

Britain, in the wake of the [[Industrial Revolution]], experienced a period of great social change in which the rapidly growing news media paid increasing attention to the activities of the poorer classes. The manner of Ayres' death caused great public interest, with large numbers of people attending her funeral and contributing to the funding of a memorial. Shortly after her death, she underwent what has been described as a &quot;secular [[Canonization|canonisation]]&quot;, being widely depicted in popular culture and, although very little was known about her life, widely cited as a role model. Various social and political movements promoted Ayres as an example of the values held by their particular movement. The circumstances of her death were distorted to give the impression that she was an employee willing to die for the sake of her employer's family, rather than for children to whom she was closely related. In 1902 her name was added to the [[Memorial to Heroic Self Sacrifice]] and in 1936 a street near the scene of the fire was renamed Ayres Street in her honour.

The case of Alice Ayres came to renewed public notice with the release of [[Patrick Marber]]'s 1997 play ''[[Closer (play)|Closer]]'', and the [[Closer (film)|2004 film]] based on it. An important element of the plot revolves around a central character who fabricates her identity based on the description of Ayres on the Memorial to Heroic Self Sacrifice, with some of the film's key scenes shot around the memorial.

==Work with the Chandler family==
Alice Ayres was born into a large family in 1859, the seventh of ten children of a labourer, John Ayres. In December 1877, her sister Mary Ann (older than Alice by eleven years) married an oil and paint dealer, Henry Chandler. Chandler owned a shop at 194 Union Street in Southwark, about {{convert|400|yd|m}} south of the present-day [[Tate Modern]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Price57&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Price|2008|p=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1881 Ayres worked as a [[Domestic worker|household assistant]] to Edward Woakes, a doctor specialising in ear and throat disorders.&lt;ref name=&quot;DNB&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/100744|title=Alice Ayres|last=Price|first=John|year=2010|work=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford}} (subscription or [http://www.oup.com/oxforddnb/info/freeodnb/libraries/ UK public library membership] required)&lt;/ref&gt; By 1885 she had become a household assistant and [[nursemaid]] to the Chandlers, living with the family.&lt;ref name=&quot;DNB&quot; /&gt; After her death, Ayres was described by a local resident as &quot;not one of your fast sort—gentle and quiet-spoke, and always busy about her work&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Price62&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Price|2008|p=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another neighbour told the press that &quot;no merry making, no excursion, no family festivity could tempt her from her self-imposed duties.

==Union  Street fire==

The Chandler's shop at Union Street, as depicted in a contemporary newspaper illustration, occupied the corner premises of a building of three storeys. The family lived above the shop, with Henry and Mary Ann Chandler sleeping in one bedroom with their six-year-old son Henry, and Ayres sharing a room on the second floor with her nieces, five-year-old Edith, four-year-old Ellen, and three-year-old Elizabeth.&lt;ref name=&quot;Price57&quot; /&gt; On the night of {{Nowrap|24 April}} 1885, fire broke out in the oil and paint shop, trapping the family upstairs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Price57&quot; /&gt; Gunpowder and casks of oil were stored in the lower floors of the building, causing the flames to spread rapidly.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cross13&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Cross|1894|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the shop was near the headquarters of the [[London Fire Brigade]] and the emergency services were quickly on scene, by the time the fire engine arrived intense flames were coming from the lower windows, making it impossible for the fire brigade to position ladders.&lt;ref name=&quot;Star&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;d=TS18850703.2.25|page=3|title=A Heroine in Humble Life|date=1885-07-03|work=The Star (Christchurch)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile Ayres, wearing only a nightdress, had tried to reach her sister but was unable to get to her through the smoke.&lt;ref name=&quot;Price58&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Price|2008|p=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crowd that had gathered outside the building were shouting to Ayres to jump.&lt;ref name=&quot;Star&quot; /&gt; Instead she returned to the room she shared with the three young girls and threw a mattress out of the window, carefully dropping Edith onto it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Price57&quot; /&gt; Despite further calls from below to jump and save herself,&lt;ref name=&quot;Cross13&quot; /&gt; she left the window and returned carrying Ellen.&lt;ref name=&quot;Price57&quot; /&gt; Ellen clung to Ayres and refused to be dropped, but Ayres threw her out of the building, and the child was caught by a member of the crowd.&lt;ref name=&quot;Price58&quot; /&gt; Ayres went back into the smoke a third time and returned carrying badly injured Elizabeth, whom she dropped safely onto the mattress.&lt;ref name=&quot;Price57&quot; /&gt;

After rescuing the three girls, Ayres tried to jump herself, but overcome by smoke inhalation, fell limply from the window, striking the projecting shop sign.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cross14&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Cross|1894|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; She missed the mattress and the crowd below and fell onto the pavement, suffering spinal injuries. Ayres was rushed to nearby [[Guy's Hospital]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Price57&quot; /&gt; where, because of the public interest that her story excited, hourly bulletins were issued about her health and [[Queen Victoria]] sent a [[lady-in-waiting]] to enquire after her condition.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sydney Mail&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=BgsUAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=cJUDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3561,1951233|title=Unsurpassable Bravery: A great deed recalled|date=1909-02-10|work=Sydney Mail|page=25|accessdate=2011-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The oil and paint stored in the shop caused the fire to burn out of control, and when the fire services were eventually able to enter the premises the rest of the family were found dead. The body of Henry Chandler was found on the staircase, still clutching a locked [[strongbox]] filled with the shop's takings,&lt;ref name=&quot;Star&quot; /&gt; while the badly burnt remains of Mary Ann Chandler were found lying next to a first floor window, the body of six-year-old Henry by her side.&lt;ref name=&quot;Price58&quot; /&gt; Ayres's condition deteriorated and she died in Guy's Hospital on {{Nowrap|26 April}} 1885.&lt;ref name=&quot;Price57&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cross14&quot; /&gt; Her last words were reported as &quot;I tried my best and could try no more&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Price60&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Price|2008|p=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|Although some press reports at the time stated that Ayres died without regaining consciousness, this is incorrect; she was conscious and lucid while in hospital and gave the authorities a full account of her actions during the fire.&lt;ref name=&quot;Price57&quot; /&gt;|group=n}} Elizabeth, the last of the children to be rescued, had suffered severe burns to her sand died shortly after Ayres.&lt;ref name=&quot;Price58&quot; /&gt;

===Funeral===
Ayres's body was not taken to Guy's Hospital's mortuary, but was laid in a room set aside for her. The estimated value of the floral tributes came to over £1,000 (about £{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|1000|1885|r=-3}}|0}} as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}).&lt;ref name=&quot;Sydney Mail&quot; /&gt;{{Inflation-fn|UK}} Ayres was posthumously recognised by the [[Metropolitan Board of Works]]-controlled [[Society for the Protection of Life from Fire|Royal Society for the Protection of Life from Fire]] (today the Society for the Protection of Life from Fire), who awarded her father John Ayres a sum of 10 [[Guinea (British coin)|guineas]] (about £{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|10.5|1885|r=-1}}|0}} as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}) in her honour.{{Inflation-fn|UK}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Price59&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Price|2008|p=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; A memorial service for Ayres at [[Southwark Cathedral|St Saviour's Church]] (now Southwark Cathedral) attracted such a large crowd that mourners were turned away due to lack of standing room, while a collection taken at the memorial service comprised 951 coins, totalling over £7.&lt;ref name=&quot;Price62&quot; /&gt; Ayres was given a large public funeral, attended by over 10,000 mourners.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sydney Mail&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;d=TS18991111.2.19|title=Servants Who Have Died For Their Employers|date=1899-11-11|work=The Star (Christchurch)|page=3|accessdate=2009-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her coffin was carried from her parents' house to her grave in [[Isleworth Cemetery]] by a team of 16 firemen, relieving each other in sets of four.&lt;ref name=&quot;Price59&quot; /&gt; The church service was attended by a group of 20 girls, dressed in white, from the village school that Ayres had attended.

===Memorial===
[[File:Alice Ayres grave.JPG|right|thumb|upright|Alice Ayres's grave|alt=A tall red four-sided obelisk, surrounded by much shorter gravestones]]
Shortly after the fire it was decided to erect a monument to Ayres, to be funded by public subscription, and by August 1885 the fund had raised over £100 (about £{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|100|1885|r=-3}}|0}} as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}).{{Inflation-fn|UK}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Price59&quot; /&gt; On {{Nowrap|15 August}} 1885 work began on the memorial.

Neither the British nor the Egyptian government was prepared to finance the cost of moving it, and it was not actually brought to London until [[William James Erasmus Wilson|Sir Erasmus Wilson]] privately financed its transport and installation on the [[Victoria Embankment]] in 1878.

W. P. Richards.

==&quot;A secular canonisation&quot;==
The British government had traditionally paid little attention to the poor, but in the wake of the [[Industrial Revolution]] attitudes towards the accomplishments of the lower classes were changing. The growth of the railways, the mechanisation of agriculture and the need for labour in the new inner-city factories had broken the traditional feudal economy and caused the rapid growth of cities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cunningham|first=William|title=The Growth of English Industry and Commerce in Modern Times|publisher=Routledge|location=Abingdon|year=1968|volume=2|page=613|isbn=0-7146-1296-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; while increasing literacy rates led to a greater interest in the media and current affairs among ordinary workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=West|first=E.

Painter and sculptor [[George Frederic Watts]] and his second wife, designer and artist [[Mary Fraser Tytler]], had long been advocates of the idea of art as a force for social change, and of the principle that narratives of great deeds would provide guidance to address the serious social problems of British cities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Price41&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Price|2008|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|The idea of inspirational examples as a force for social improvement, as advocated in [[Samuel Smiles]]'s 1859 ''[[Self-Help (book)|Self-Help]]'', was a key tenet of late 19th-century [[Liberalism]] and of the [[settlement movement]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Price42&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Price|2008|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most vocal advocate of this approach was probably the historian [[James Anthony Froude]], who in his ''Short Studies on Great Subjects'' had called for biographies that could be given to the lower classes with the injunction &quot;Read that; there is a man—such a man as you ought to be; read it; meditate on it; see who he was and how he made himself what he was, and try to be yourself like him&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Price41&quot; /&gt;|group=n}} Watts had recently painted a series of portraits of leading figures he considered to be a positive social influence, the &quot;Hall of Fame&quot;, which was donated to the [[National Portrait Gallery (London)|National Portrait Gallery]];&lt;ref name=&quot;Price7&quot;&gt;[[Sandy Nairne]], in {{harvnb|Price|2008|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|Owing to National Portrait Gallery acquisition rules, the portraits were not allowed to be exhibited in the NPG until ten years after the death of their subjects, and were housed in the [[Watts Gallery]] until the NPG was permitted to display them.

On 5 September 1887, a letter was published in ''The Times'' from Watts, proposing a scheme to commemorate the [[Golden Jubilee]] of Queen Victoria by means of collecting and commemorating &quot;a complete record of the stories of heroism in every-day life&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Another Jubilee Suggestion&quot;&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Another Jubilee Suggestion |author=George Frederic Watts |section=Letters to the Editor |day_of_week=Mon |date=1887-09-05 |page_number=14 |page_numbers= |issue= |column=B }}&lt;/ref&gt; He cited the death of Alice Ayres as an example of the type of event he proposed to commemorate, and included in his letter a distorted account of Ayres's actions during the Union Street fire.&lt;ref name=&quot;Another Jubilee Suggestion&quot; /&gt;

{{Quotation|The roll would be a long one, but I would cite as an example the name of Alice Ayres, the maid of all work at an oilmonger's in Gravel-lane, in April, 1885, who lost her life in saving those of her master's children.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The facts, in case your readers have forgotten them, were shortly these:—Roused by the cries of &quot;Fire&quot; and the heat of the fiercely advancing flames the girl is seen at the window of an upper story, and the crowd, holding up some clothes to break her fall, entreat her to jump at once for her life. Instead she goes back, and reappears dragging a feather bed after her, which, with great difficulty, she pushes through the window. The bed caught and stretched, the girl is again at the window, a child of three in her arms, which with great care and skill she throws safely upon the mattress. Twice again with still older children she repeats the heroic feat. When her turn comes to jump, suffocated or too exhausted by her efforts, she cannot save herself.

Watts had originally proposed that the monument take the form of a colossal bronze figure,&lt;ref name=&quot;Price15&quot; /&gt; but by 1887 was proposing that the memorial take the form of &quot;a kind of [[Camposanto Monumentale|Campo Santo]]&quot;, consisting of a covered way and marble wall inscribed with the names of everyday heroes, to be built in [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Price21&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Price|2008|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|In 1902, shortly before his death, Watts would eventually realise his ambition of erecting a giant bronze monument.

A fireman stands on a ladder and reaches out to Ayres and the child; meanwhile, a sailor in full [[Royal Navy]] uniform holds a second child.&lt;ref name=&quot;Price60&quot; /&gt; Although in reality Ayres had been at a much higher level of the building and the heat of the burning oil and gunpowder had made it impossible for the fire brigade to approach the building,&lt;ref name=&quot;Cross13&quot; /&gt; by depicting Ayres with the fireman and sailor, widely seen as symbols of British heroism and British strength, Crane's picture further enhanced her growing reputation as a heroic figure.&lt;ref name=&quot;Price60&quot; /&gt; Crane's picture in the Red Cross Hall was itself mentioned in [[s:Alice Ayres|''Alice Ayres'']], a [[border ballad]] by [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] founder [[Hardwicke Rawnsley|Canon Hardwicke Rawnsley]] published in his 1896 ''Ballads of Brave Deeds'', for which George Frederic Watts wrote the preface.&lt;ref name=&quot;Price60&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rawnsley&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Rawnsley|first=H.

===Memorial to Heroic Self Sacrifice===
In 1898 George Frederic Watts was approached by Henry Gamble, vicar of [[St Botolph's Aldersgate]] church in the [[City of London]]. St Botolph's former [[churchyard]] had recently been converted, along with two smaller adjoining burial grounds, into [[Postman's Park]], one of the largest public parks in the City of London, and the church was engaged in a protracted financial and legal dispute over ownership of part of the park.&lt;ref name=&quot;Price14&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Price|2008|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; To provide a public justification for keeping the disputed land as part of the park, and to raise the park's profile and assist in fundraising, the church offered part of the park as a site for his proposed memorial. Watts agreed, and in 1900 the [[List of tablets on the Memorial to Heroic Self Sacrifice|Memorial to Heroic Self Sacrifice]] was unveiled by Alfred Newton, [[Lord Mayor of the City of London|Lord Mayor of London]], and [[Mandell Creighton]], [[Bishop of London]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Times unveiling&quot;&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=The Postmen's Park and Cloister |author= |section=News |day_of_week=Tue |date=1900-07-31 |page_number=2 |page_numbers= |issue= |column=E }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Price17&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Price|2008|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Memorial consisted of a {{convert|50|ft|m|adj=on}} long and {{convert|9|ft|m|adj=on}} tall wooden [[loggia]] with a tiled roof, designed by [[Ernest George]], sheltering a wall with space for 120 ceramic memorial tablets.&lt;ref name=&quot;Price21&quot; /&gt;

The memorial tablets were hand made and expensive to produce, and at the time of the Memorial's unveiling only four were in place. In 1902 a further nine tablets were unveiled, including the memorial to Alice Ayres for which Watts had long lobbied.&lt;ref name=&quot;Price22&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Price|2008|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Made by [[William De Morgan]] in the [[Arts and Crafts Movement|Arts and Crafts]] style, the green-and-white tablet reads &quot;Alice Ayres, daughter of a bricklayer's labourer who by intrepid conduct saved 3 children from a burning house in Union Street, Borough, at the cost of her own young life April 24, 1885&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Price50&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Price|2008|p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Changing attitudes and differing perceptions===
Although the public would have been familiar with the concept of a female national heroic figure following the widespread coverage and public admiration of [[Harriet Newell]], [[Grace Darling]], and [[Florence Nightingale]], the ongoing coverage of Ayres and her elevation as a national hero was unusual for the period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Price62&quot; /&gt; Ayres was an uneducated working class woman, who after her death underwent what has been described as &quot;a secular canonisation&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Perry|first=Lara|title=History's Beauties|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|location=Aldershot|year=2006|page=163|isbn=0-7546-3081-1|oclc=60697164}}&lt;/ref&gt; at a time when, despite the gradual formal recognition of the contributions of the lower classes, national heroes were generally male and engaged in exploration, the military, religion or science and engineering.&lt;ref name=&quot;Price65&quot; /&gt;

This was a period in which political pressures for social reform were growing. The version of Ayres presented to the public as a woman devoted entirely to duty embodied the idealised British character at the time, while the image of a hard working but uncomplaining woman who set the welfare of others above her own embodied the idealised vision of the working class presented by social reformers, and the ideal selfless and dedicated woman presented by campaigners for women's rights.&lt;ref name=&quot;Price62&quot; /&gt; At the unveiling of the Memorial to Heroic Self Sacrifice the Lord Mayor, Alfred Newton, had remarked that it was &quot;intended to perpetuate the acts of heroism which belonged to the working classes&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Price68&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Price|2008|p=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; while George Frederic Watts, although he was opposed in principle to discrimination based on class and saw the Memorial as being theoretically open to all classes, had remarked that &quot;the higher classes do not or ought not to require reminders or inducements&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Price68&quot; /&gt; Watts saw the purpose of his Memorial not as a commemoration of deeds, but as a tool for the education of the lower classes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Price68&quot; /&gt;

Watts's view was shared by others who sought to provide inspirational material on British heroes, and authors writing about Ayres systematically altered the fact that the children rescued were members of her family, instead describing them as the children of her employer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Price69&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Price|2008|p=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; Press reports at the time of the fire described Ayres variously as a &quot;little nursemaid&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Star&quot; /&gt; &quot;a willing, honest, hard-working servant&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Star&quot; /&gt; and a &quot;poor little domestic&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;d=TT18850624.2.36|title=Heroism of a Servant Girl|date=1885-06-24|work=Tuapeka Times|page=5|accessdate=2009-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; As well as Watts's 1887 description of Ayres as &quot;the maid of all work at an oilmonger's&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Another Jubilee Suggestion&quot; /&gt; Cross's chapter on Ayres in ''Beneath the Banner'' is titled &quot;Only a Nurse Girl!&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Cross13&quot; /&gt; while Rawnsley called her &quot;the nursemaid in the household&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rawnsley&quot; /&gt; Barrington, writing five years after the fire at the unveiling of Price's panel, acknowledges in a footnote that Ayres was related to the Chandlers,&lt;ref name=&quot;Barrington316&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Barrington|1896|p=316}}&lt;/ref&gt; but nonetheless describes her as displaying the &quot;typical English virtues—courage, fortitude, and an unquestioning sense of duty&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barrington319&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Barrington|1896|p=319}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While George and Mary Watts and their fellow [[Paternalism|paternalist]] social reformers, along with the broadly sympathetic mainstream British press, portrayed Ayres as an inspirational selfless servant to her employer, others had a different view. The left-wing ''[[Reynold's News|Reynolds Weekly Newspaper]]'' complained that the lack of support for Ayres's family from the state was symbolic of poor treatment of workers as a whole.&lt;ref name=&quot;Price69&quot; /&gt; The pioneering feminist periodical ''[[Englishwoman's Review|The Englishwoman's Review]]'' described their &quot;righteous pride&quot; at Ayres's &quot;instinctive motherhood&quot;;&lt;ref name=&quot;Price69&quot; /&gt; on the other hand ''[[Young England magazine|Young England]]'', an imperialist children's [[story paper]], said that &quot;there is no sex in self-sacrifice&quot;, lauding Ayres as a model of devotion to duty.&lt;ref name=&quot;Price69&quot; /&gt;

==Later years==
[[File:Ayres Street.JPG|right|thumb|180px|Ayres Street|alt=A long narrow deserted street. On the right of the picture a long row of traditional English red brick cottages line the street, while the left side of the street is lined with modern industrial units.]]
In 1936 the new [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] administration of the [[London County Council]] renamed White Cross Street, near the site of the Red Cross Hall and the scene of the Union Street fire, to Ayres Street in tribute to Alice Ayres, a name it retains today.&lt;ref name=&quot;Price Heroism&quot; /&gt; The Chandlers' house at 194 Union Street no longer stands, and the site is occupied by part of the Union House office complex; immediately opposite the site of the fire is the present-day headquarters of the [[London Fire Brigade]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.london-fire.gov.uk/Documents/Directions-HQ.pdf|title=London Fire Brigade Headquarters|publisher=London Fire Brigade|accessdate=2009-08-27|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alice Ayres came to renewed public notice with the release of the 1997 play ''[[Closer (play)|Closer]]'' by [[Patrick Marber]] and the 2004 [[British Academy Film Awards|BAFTA Award]]- and [[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globe]]-winning film [[Closer (film)|''Closer'']] based on it starring [[Natalie Portman]], [[Julia Roberts]], [[Jude Law]] and [[Clive Owen]]. A key plot element revolves around the memorial tablet to Ayres in Postman's Park, in which it is revealed that the character Jane Jones (played by Portman in the film), who calls herself Alice Ayres for most of the story, has in fact fabricated her identity based on the tablet on the Memorial to Heroic Self Sacrifice,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Innes|first=Christopher|title=Modern British Drama|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|year=2002|edition=2|page=432|isbn=0-521-01675-4|oclc=216904040}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Times Pitt&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Kaya |last=Burgess |title=Leigh Pitt, who died saving boy, added to 'everyday heroes' memorial |url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/visual_arts/architecture_and_design/article6481318.ece |work=[[The Times]] |location=London |date=2009-06-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which she reads at the time of her first meeting with Dan Woolf (played by Jude Law in the film) at the beginning of the action.&lt;ref name=&quot;Price7&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thelondonpaper.com/going-out/whats-new/londons-10-best-picnic-spots|title=London's 10 best picnic spots|date=2009-05-22|work=thelondonpaper|publisher=News International|accessdate=2009-08-18|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090603182005/http://www.thelondonpaper.com/going-out/whats-new/londons-10-best-picnic-spots &lt;!-- Added by H3llBot --&gt;|archivedate=2009-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The park, and the memorial to Ayres, feature prominently in the opening and closing scenes of the film.&lt;ref name=&quot;Price11&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Price|2008|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
