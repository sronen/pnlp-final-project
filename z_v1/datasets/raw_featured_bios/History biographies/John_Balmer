'''John Raeburn Balmer''', [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire|OBE]], [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|DFC]] (3 July 1910 – 11&amp;nbsp;May 1944) was a senior officer and bomber pilot in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF). Born in [[Bendigo]], Victoria, he studied law before joining the RAAF as an air cadet in 1932. An [[Flight instructor|instructor]] at [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Wiiliams Point Cook Base|Point Cook]] from 1935 to 1937, he achieved renown in Air Force circles when he reportedly parachuted from a training aircraft to motivate his pupil to land single-handedly. He also became known to the general public as a cross-country motorist, setting records for trans-Australia and round-Australia trips prior to World War&amp;nbsp;II. 

A [[flight lieutenant]] when war broke out, Balmer was promoted to [[squadron leader]] in June 1940, becoming the inaugural commanding officer of [[No. 13 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;13 Squadron]], which operated [[Lockheed Hudson]]s out of [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], Northern Territory. He was raised to temporary [[Wing Commander (rank)|wing commander]] in April 1941, and within a year had taken charge of the RAAF's first [[Bristol Beaufort]] unit, [[No. 100 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;100 Squadron]]. Appointed an [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] in June 1942, he led the Beauforts on bombing and torpedo missions against Japanese targets in the [[New Guinea campaign]].

Posted to England in June 1943, Balmer took command of [[No.&amp;nbsp;467 Squadron RAAF]], flying [[Avro Lancaster]]s in the [[RAF Bomber Command#Strategic Bombing 1943-45|air war over Europe]]. He led his unit through the [[Battle of Berlin (air)|Battle of Berlin]] from November 1943 to March 1944. In April he was awarded the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross]], and the following month promoted to temporary [[group captain]]. Days later, on the night of 11/12 May, the last scheduled operation of his tour as No.&amp;nbsp;467 Squadron's commanding officer, Balmer failed to return from a mission over Belgium. Initially posted as missing, his plane was later confirmed to have been shot down, and all of the crew killed. Balmer was buried outside [[Brussels]].

==Early life==
The son of lawyer Sydney Balmer and his wife Catherine (&quot;Kittie&quot;), John Balmer was born in [[Bendigo]], Victoria, on 3&amp;nbsp;July 1910.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;&gt;[http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A130118b.htm Balmer, John Raeburn] at [[Australian Dictionary of Biography]].

Promoted to [[flight lieutenant]], from July 1935 to November 1937 Balmer was assigned to [[No. 1 Flying Training School RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School]], Point Cook, as an instructor. He gained a reputation as a hard taskmaster, and on one occasion—according to RAAF folklore—parachuted from a training aircraft to give his student the proper motivation to make a solo landing, though at least one newspaper at the time reported that he had in fact fallen out.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp. 206–207, 496&lt;/ref&gt; On 15&amp;nbsp;August 1938, Balmer was forced to crash land an [[Avro Anson]] near [[Whitfield, Victoria|Whitfield]], Victoria, after its wings iced up—one of a series of accidents that befell the type following its introduction to Australian service.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p. 329&lt;/ref&gt; By mid-1939 he was instructing on [[Hawker Demon]] biplane fighters with [[No. 3 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;3 Squadron]] at [[RAAF Base Richmond|RAAF Station Richmond]], New South Wales.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers&quot;&gt;Odgers, ''Mr Double Seven'', p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; 

Parallel to his Air Force career, in the years leading up to the outbreak of World War&amp;nbsp;II Balmer gained national attention as a long-distance motorist. Partnered by a fellow officer, he set a cross-country record of 65 hours and 10 minutes travelling from [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], Western Australia, to Melbourne in December 1936. He and another driver followed this up with a record-breaking round-Australia journey in October–November 1938, completing their run in 23½ days, almost halving the previous best time.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Argus&quot;/&gt;

When [[Military history of Australia in World War II|Australia declared war]] in September 1939, Flight Lieutenant Balmer was a member of [[No. 22 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;22 Squadron]], which conducted coastal surveillance out of Richmond with Ansons and, later, [[CAC Wirraway]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Song&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roylance, ''Air Base Richmond'', p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; Promoted to [[squadron leader]], he was posted to [[RAAF Base Darwin|RAAF Station Darwin]], Northern Territory, on 1&amp;nbsp;June 1940, becoming the inaugural commander of [[No. 13 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;13 Squadron]], which had been &quot;cannibalised&quot; from the base's resident unit, [[No. 12 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;12 Squadron]]. Retaining its Wirraway flight, No.&amp;nbsp;12 Squadron gave up its two flights of Ansons to the new formation; these were replaced later that month by more capable [[Lockheed Hudson]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;AWM&quot;&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/units/people_8009.asp Group Captain John Raeburn Balmer] at Australian War Memorial.

Despite finding his bomb release gear faulty, necessitating three low-level attack runs in the face of increasingly heavy anti-aircraft fire, Balmer managed to score two hits, while his companions also successfully bombed the vessel. The ship appeared to be on fire and sinking, and the squadron received credit for its destruction at the time, but later investigation could not confirm its loss.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison 27&quot;/&gt; The unit withdrew to Laverton for training and patrol work during July and August, before moving to [[Milne Bay]] to again take part in the [[New Guinea campaign]].&lt;ref name=&quot;100Sqn&quot;&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Units of the Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 99–102&lt;/ref&gt; On 7&amp;nbsp;September 1942, Balmer commanded a combined force of [[Curtiss P-40 variants|P-40 Kittyhawk]]s from [[No. 75 Squadron RAAF|Nos.&amp;nbsp;75]] and [[No. 76 Squadron RAAF|76 Squadrons]], [[Bristol Beaufighter]]s from [[No. 30 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;30 Squadron]], Hudsons from [[No. 6 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;6 Squadron]], and his own No.&amp;nbsp;100 Squadron Beauforts in an assault on Japanese shipping near Milne Bay.

Beginning in October, Nos.&amp;nbsp;6 and 100 Squadrons were given what the [[Australia in the War of 1939–1945|official history of the RAAF in World War&amp;nbsp;II]] called the &quot;huge task&quot; of keeping open the sea lanes between Australia and New Guinea, while disrupting as best they could Japanese lines of communication and supply. The units kept up a punishing schedule of daily long-range reconnaissance and anti-submarine patrols, &quot;practically without navigation aids, frequently through rain storms and heavy cloud&quot; but, &quot;supported by ground staffs as enduring as themselves, the crews maintained an almost inflexibly high standard and achieved considerable success&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison 30&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/30.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', pp. 639–640]&lt;/ref&gt; On the night of 4/5&amp;nbsp;October, Balmer took ten of his Beauforts from Milne Bay on a far-ranging assault against Japanese ships in the vicinity of the [[Shortland Islands]], near [[Bougainville Island|Bougainville]]. Two aircraft disappeared along the way in storms and the remainder became separated into two flights that nevertheless managed to rendezvous near the target. Seven of these launched their torpedoes against as many ships and the crews believed that four were accurate, but were unable to confirm any hits because of dwindling visibility. The {{convert|950|nmi|km|sing=on}} mission was considered a failure but this was put down to problems with the torpedoes and not the aircrew.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison 30&quot;/&gt; Subsequent reports suggested that three ships had in fact been damaged.&lt;ref name=&quot;100Sqn&quot;/&gt; Balmer came down with [[malaria]] in November, and went on three weeks sick leave the following month; he returned to operations on 2&amp;nbsp;January 1943.&lt;ref&gt;King, ''Song of the Beauforts'', pp. 7, 771&lt;/ref&gt; In March, during the [[Battle of the Bismarck Sea]], No.&amp;nbsp;100 Squadron launched its last torpedo attack; bad weather prevented all but two aircraft finding their targets, and no hits were registered.

Balmer relinquished command of No.&amp;nbsp;100 Squadron in April 1943, and was posted from the [[South West Pacific theatre of World War II|South West Pacific]] to the [[European Theatre of World War II|European theatre]] that June.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;100Sqn&quot;/&gt; His planned secondment to the Royal Air Force was for two years.&lt;ref&gt;King, ''Song of the Beauforts'', pp. 90–91&lt;/ref&gt; Partly in an effort to bolster Australian aspirations to form a distinct RAAF [[Group (military aviation unit)|group]] within [[RAF Bomber Command]], in August he was appointed commanding officer of [[No. 467 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;467 Squadron]], based at [[RAF Bottesford]], Leicestershire. The squadron had been raised under [[Article XV squadrons|Article XV]] of the [[British Commonwealth Air Training Plan|Empire Air Training Scheme]], and operated [[Avro Lancaster]] heavy bombers.&lt;ref&gt;Herington, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/28/chapters/24.pdf ''Air War Against Germany and Italy'', p. 649]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;467Sqn&quot;&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Units of the Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 144–147&lt;/ref&gt; Balmer led his unit in a costly raid on [[Nuremburg]] the night of 27/28&amp;nbsp;August, before attacking [[Hanover]] in September and October.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; From its new base at [[RAF Waddington]], Lincolnshire, Balmer then took No.&amp;nbsp;467 Squadron through the [[Battle of Berlin (air)|Battle of Berlin]] that commenced in November 1943 and continued until March 1944.&lt;ref name=&quot;467Sqn&quot;/&gt; The statistical likelihood of surviving an operational tour of 30 missions in Bomber Command was never more than 50 per cent, and during the Battle of Berlin, loss rates were far higher.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 95–96&lt;/ref&gt; No.&amp;nbsp;467 Squadron was the only Australian unit to take part in all sixteen heavy attacks against the German capital during the battle.&lt;ref&gt;Herington, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/28/chapters/24.pdf ''Air War Against Germany and Italy'', pp. 636–637, 642–643]&lt;/ref&gt; In the same period it also raided [[Frankfurt]], [[Liepzig]], [[Stettin]], [[Stuttgart]], [[Essen]], and [[Augsburg]].&lt;ref&gt;Herington, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/28/chapters/24.pdf ''Air War Against Germany and Italy'', pp. 651, 653, 655, 658–660]&lt;/ref&gt; Following the Battle of Berlin, No.&amp;nbsp;467 Squadron began to concentrate on targets in France and Belgium as the Allied air campaign shifted focus from strategic bombing to destroying airfields and disrupting lines of communication prior to the [[Operation Overlord|invasion of the continent]]. On the night of 10/11 April, Balmer led not only his own unit but a total of 148 aircraft of [[No.&amp;nbsp;5 Group RAF]] in an assault on [[Toulouse]], striking at an airfield, and aircraft and explosives factories. The bombing was highly accurate, and the Australians suffered no losses on the raid.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Herington, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/29/chapters/02.pdf ''Air Power Over Europe'', pp. 19–21]&lt;/ref&gt;

Considered a &quot;dynamic&quot; leader and a &quot;brilliant&quot; pilot,&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers&quot;/&gt; Balmer was decorated with the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] (DFC) for &quot;great skill and devotion to duty&quot; during &quot;a varied tour of operations&quot;; promulgated in the ''[[London Gazette]]'' on 18&amp;nbsp;April, the award citation further described him as &quot;a most efficient squadron commander, whose keenness and zeal have set a fine example&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=36475|supp=yes|startpage=1779|date=18 April 1944|accessdate=on 6 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also earned the respect of his crews with displays of empathy such as the occasion one of his young pilots, who had flown on 15 missions, refused to take off on his next sortie. Rather than take disciplinary action, Balmer allowed the man medical leave and sought out respite for him in the country, after which the pilot returned to active duty and completed his tour of operations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Song&quot;/&gt; From early April, No.&amp;nbsp;467 Squadron began playing a leading role in a series of attacks against railways, which continued into the following month.&lt;ref&gt;Herington, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/29/chapters/02.pdf ''Air Power Over Europe'', pp. 27–28]&lt;/ref&gt;  Balmer was promoted to temporary group captain on 4&amp;nbsp;May.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; On 10/11&amp;nbsp;May, his Lancasters took part in a raid on [[Lille]], losing three of their number. In an effort to shore up the morale of his younger crews, Balmer decided to personally lead their next mission the following night, against a military camp at Bourg-Léopold ([[Leopoldsburg]]), Belgium. It was planned to be his last operation before going on to a more senior position. His aircraft failed to return from the raid, causing considerable shock to his unit. The next day, Balmer's place as commanding officer of No.&amp;nbsp;467 Squadron was taken by Wing Commander [[William Brill]], previously a member of [[No.&amp;nbsp;463 Squadron RAAF]], which was also based at Waddington.&lt;ref&gt;Herington, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/29/chapters/02.pdf ''Air Power Over Europe'', pp. 37–38]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Initially posted as missing, Balmer and his crew were later confirmed to have died when their Lancaster crashed near [[Herenthout]] in [[Antwerp (province)|provincial Antwerp]], after being attacked by a [[night fighter]]. He was buried in [[Heverlee Commonwealth War Graves Commission Cemetery|Heverlee War Cemetery]], outside [[Brussels]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/ROH_RAAF/CREWS/467CREW_70D.pdf RAAF Casualty Information] at Australian War Memorial.
