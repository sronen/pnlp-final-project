'''Elias Ashmole''' (23 May 1617 – 18 May 1692) was a celebrated English [[antiquarian|antiquary]], [[politician]], [[officer of arms]], [[astrology|astrologer]] and student of [[alchemy]]. Ashmole supported the [[Cavalier|royalist]] side during the [[English Civil War]], and at the [[English Restoration|restoration]] of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] he was rewarded with several lucrative offices.

Ashmole was an antiquary with a strong [[Baconian method|Baconian]] bent for the study of nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.theses.com/idx/scripts/it.asp?xml=F:\index\idx\docs\all\55\it00494404.htm&amp;subfolder=/search|title=Elias Ashmole and the Uses of Antiquity|author=Feola, Vittoria|year=2005|accessdate=25 January 2010|journal=Index to Theses|publisher=Expert Information Ltd}} (Password required)&lt;/ref&gt; His library reflected his intellectual outlook, including works on English history, law, [[numismatics]], [[chorography]], alchemy, astrology, astronomy, and botany. Although he was one of the founding members of the [[Royal Society]], a key institution in the development of experimental science, his interests were antiquarian and mystical as well as scientific. He was an early [[Freemasonry|Freemason]], although the extent of his involvement and commitment is unclear. Throughout his life he was an avid collector of curiosities and other artifacts. Many of these he acquired from the traveller, botanist, and collector [[John Tradescant the Younger]]. Ashmole donated most of his collection, his antiquarian library and priceless [[manuscript]]s to the [[University of Oxford]] to create the [[Ashmolean Museum]].

Ashmole was born in Breadmarket Street, [[Lichfield]], [[Staffordshire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.lichfield.gov.uk/history-ea.ihtml|title=Elias Asmole – (1617–1692)|publisher=Lichfield City Council|accessdate=2008-02-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; His family had been prominent, but its fortunes had declined by the time of Ashmole's birth. His mother, Anne, was the daughter of a wealthy [[Coventry]] draper, Anthony Bowyer, and a relative of James Pagit, a [[Exchequer of pleas|Baron of the Exchequer]]. His father, Simon Ashmole (1589–1634), was a saddler, who had served as a soldier in Ireland and Europe. Elias Ashmole attended [[Lichfield Grammar School]] (now [[King Edward VI School (Lichfield)]]) and became a [[chorister]] at [[Lichfield Cathedral]]. In 1633, he went to live in London as companion to Pagit's sons, and in 1638, with the help of Pagit, he became a [[solicitor]]. He enjoyed a successful practice in London, and married Eleanor Mainwaring (1603–1641), a member of a poor but [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] family, who died, while pregnant,&lt;ref&gt;Josten, C. H. (editor) (1966). ''Elias Ashmole (1617–1692). His Autobiographical and Historical Notes, his Correspondence, and Other Contemporary Sources Relating to his Life and Work'' Oxford: Clarendon Press, vol. I, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; only three years later on 6 December 1641.&lt;ref name=Hunter&gt;[[Michael Hunter (historian)|Hunter, Michael]] (September 2004; online edition May 2006) [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/764 &quot;Ashmole, Elias (1617–1692)&quot;], ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', London, Oxford University Press, [[doi: 10.1093/ref:odnb/764]], retrieved 25 January 2010 (Subscription required)&lt;/ref&gt; Still in his early twenties, Ashmole had taken the first steps towards status and wealth.

Ashmole supported the side of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] in the [[English Civil War|Civil War]]. At the outbreak of fighting in 1642, he left London for the house of his father-in-law, Peter Mainwaring, at [[Smallwood, Cheshire|Smallwood]] in [[Cheshire]]. There he lived a retired life until 1644, when he was appointed [[Her Majesty's Customs and Excise|King's Commissioner of Excise]] at Lichfield.&lt;ref&gt;Josten, vol. I, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; Soon afterwards, at the suggestion of [[George Wharton]], a leading astrologer with strong court connections, Ashmole was given a military post at [[Oxford]], where he served as an ordnance officer for the King's forces. In his spare time, he studied mathematics and physics at his lodgings, [[Brasenose College]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.bnc.ox.ac.uk/345/brasenose-college-archives-and-history-38/famous-brasenose-names-222/elias-ashmole%2c-founder-of-the-ashmolean-museum-485.html|title=Elias Ashmole, founder of the Ashmolean Museum|publisher=Brasenose College, University of Oxford|accessdate=2008-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; There he acquired a deep interest in astronomy, astrology, and magic. In late 1645, he left Oxford to accept the position of Commissioner of Excise at [[Worcester]]. Ashmole was given the additional military post of Captain in [[Jacob Astley, 1st Baron Astley of Reading|Lord Astley's]] Regiment of Foot, part of the Royalist Infantry, though as a mathematician, he was appointed to artillery positions. He seems never to have participated in any actual fighting.&lt;ref&gt;Josten, vol. I, pp. 28–30&lt;/ref&gt;

After the surrender of Worcester to Parliamentary forces in July 1646, he retired again to Cheshire.&lt;ref name=Ford&gt;{{citation|last=Nash Ford|first=David|year=2004|title=Elias Ashmole (1617–1692)|journal=David Nash Ford's Royal Berkshire History|publisher=Nash Ford Publishing|url=http://www.berkshirehistory.com/bios/eashmole.html|accessdate=2008-02-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Passing through Lichfield on his way there, he learnt that his mother had died just three weeks before of the plague.&lt;ref&gt;Josten, vol. I, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, he was admitted as a [[Freemasonry|Freemason]]. His diary entry for 16 October 1646 reads in part: &quot;I was made a Free Mason at Warrington in Lancashire, with Coll: Henry Mainwaring of Karincham in Cheshire.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Josten, vol. II, pp. 395–396&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Henry Mainwaring was a cousin of Ashmole's first wife who had fought with the Parliamentary forces (Josten, vol. I, p. 33).&lt;/ref&gt; Although there is only one other mention of Masonic activity in his diary he seems to have remained in good standing and well-connected with the fraternity as he was still attending meetings in 1682. On 10 March that year he wrote: &quot;About 5 H: P.M. I received a Sumons to appeare at a Lodge to held the next day, at Masons Hall London.&quot; The following day, 11 March 1682, he wrote: &quot;Accordingly, I went&amp;nbsp;... I was the Senior Fellow among them (it being 35 yeares since I was admitted)&amp;nbsp;... We all dyned at the halfe Moone Taverne in [[Cheapside|Cheapeside]], at a Noble Dinner prepaired at the charge of the New-accepted Masons.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Josten, vol. IV, pp. 1699–1701&lt;/ref&gt; Ashmole's notes are one of the earliest references to Freemasonry known in England,&lt;ref&gt;Michael Hunter calls it the first (see Hunter, 2004), but other sources propose [[Robert Moray]] in 1641 as the first Speculative Mason whose name is known (see {{citation|last=Westfall|first=Richard S.|date=1996–2008|title=Elias Ashmole|publisher=Pietre-Stones Review of Freemasonry|url=http://www.freemasons-freemasonry.com/ashmole.html|accessdate=2008-02-29}}).&lt;/ref&gt; but apart from these entries in his autobiographical notes, there are no further details about Ashmole's involvement.&lt;ref name=yb&gt;{{citation|last=Beresiner|first=Yasha|url=http://www.mqmagazine.co.uk/issue-11/p-06.php|title=Elias Ashmole: Masonic icon|journal=MQ Magazine|issue=11|date=October 2004|pages=6–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1646–47, Ashmole made several simultaneous approaches to rich widows in the hope of securing a good marriage.&lt;ref name=hill&gt;{{citation|last=Hill|first=Christopher|authorlink=John Edward Christopher Hill|year=1968|title=Elias Ashmole (1617–1692). His Autobiographical and Historical Notes, his Correspondence, and Other Contemporary Sources Relating to his Life and Work, Review|journal=[[The English Historical Review]]|volume=83|issue=327|pages=355–357}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1649, he married Mary, Lady Mainwaring (daughter of Sir William Forster of [[Aldermaston]]), a wealthy thrice-widowed woman twenty years his senior.&lt;ref&gt;She was the widow of Sir Edward Stafford (d. 1623), John Hamlyn (d. 1633) and Sir Thomas Mainwaring (d. July 1646), [[Recorder (judge)|recorder]] of [[Reading, Berkshire]] (Josten, vol. I, p. 43).&lt;/ref&gt; She may have been a relative by marriage of his first wife's family and was the mother of grown children. The marriage took place over the opposition of the bride's family, and it did not prove to be harmonious: Lady Mainwaring filed suit for separation and [[alimony]] but it was dismissed by the courts in 1657. Nevertheless, the marriage provided Ashmole with Mary's first husband's estates centred on [[Bradfield, Berkshire|Bradfield]] in [[Berkshire]] which left him wealthy enough to pursue his interests, now including botany and alchemy, without concern for his livelihood. He arranged for his friend Wharton to be released from prison and appointed him to manage the estates.&lt;ref name=Ford/&gt;

During the 1650s, Ashmole devoted a great deal of energy to the study of alchemy. In 1650, he published ''[[Fasciculus Chemicus]]'' under the [[anagram]]matic [[pseudonym]] ''James Hasolle''. This work was an English translation of two [[Latin language|Latin]] alchemical works, one by [[Arthur Dee]], the son of [[John Dee (mathematician)|John Dee]]. In 1652, he published his most important alchemical work, ''[[Theatrum Chemicum Britannicum]]'', an extensively annotated compilation of metaphysical poems in English. The book preserved and made available many works that had previously existed only in privately held manuscripts. There is little evidence that Ashmole conducted his own alchemical experiments. He appears to have been a collector of alchemical writings and a student of alchemy rather than an active practitioner, and refers to himself as a pupil of [[William Backhouse]]. His final alchemical publication was ''[[The Way to Bliss]]'' in 1658, but thereafter his interest seems to wane in favour of his other pursuits.&lt;ref name=Hunter/&gt; Ashmole promoted the use of therapeutic remedies drawing on both [[Galen]]ic and [[Paracelsianism|Paracelsian]] principles, and his works attempt to merge the two schools. ''The Way to Bliss'' recommends ways to prevent illness: a balanced diet, moderate exercise and enough sleep.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Feola, Vittoria|title=English antiquarian medical books of the 1650s|publisher=[[Medical University of Vienna]]|url=http://www.termine-meduniwien.at/veranstaltungen/vortrag+im+josephinum+%7C+d/?sid=609f431190e8d2b5d9676a1c27ceff04|accessdate=25 January 2010}} (pdf)&lt;/ref&gt; His works were avidly studied by other natural philosophers, such as [[Isaac Newton]].&lt;ref name=Churton&gt;{{Citation|last=Churton|first=Tobias|year=2004|title=Magus: The Invisible Life of Elias Ashmole|location=Lichfield|publisher=Signal Publishing|isbn=0-9543309-2-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ashmole met the [[botanist]] and collector [[John Tradescant the younger]] around 1650. Tradescant had, with [[John Tradescant the elder|his father]], built up a vast and renowned collection of exotic [[plants]], [[mineral]] specimens and other curiosities from around the world at their house in [[Lambeth]]. Ashmole helped Tradescant catalogue his collection in 1652, and, in 1656, he financed the publication of the catalogue, the ''[[Musaeum Tradescantianum]]''. In 1659, Tradescant, who had lost his only son seven years earlier, legally deeded his collection to Ashmole. Under the agreement, Ashmole would take possession at Tradescant's death. When Tradescant died in 1662, his widow, Hester, contested the deed, claiming her husband had signed it when drunk without knowing its contents, but the matter was settled in [[Court of Chancery|Chancery]] in Ashmole's favour two years later. Hester was to hold the collection in trust for Ashmole until her death. Ashmole's determined aggressiveness in obtaining the Tradescant collection for himself has led some scholars to consider that Ashmole was an ambitious, ingratiating social climber who stole a hero's legacy for his own glorification.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Swann|first=Marjorie|title=Curiosities and Texts: The Culture of Collecting in Early Modern England|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|location=Philadelphia|year=2001|isbn=0-8122-3610-6|pages=12, 40–54}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.economist.com/books/PrinterFriendly.cfm?story_id=7109138|title=Heaven on earth|date=29 June 2006|journal=The Economist}} (Subscription required)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Restoration==
Ashmole embarked on further catalogues, including one of the Roman coin collection of the [[Bodleian Library]], which he finally completed in 1666 after eight years of work. It may have taken so long because Ashmole's progress was interrupted by the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] in 1660, when Ashmole's loyalty was richly rewarded with political offices. He was appointed Secretary and Clerk of the Courts of [[Surinam]] and Comptroller of the White Office. While these two titles do not seem to have provided either an income or any specific duties,&lt;ref&gt;Josten, vol. I, pp. 137, 153&lt;/ref&gt; he was also given the office of Commissioner and then Comptroller for the Excise in London, and later was made the Accountant General of the Excise, a position that made him responsible for a large portion of the King's revenue. These latter posts yielded him considerable income as well as considerable [[patronage]] power.&lt;ref name=Hunter/&gt;

The King commissioned Ashmole to prepare a catalogue of the coins and medals held in the [[Royal Collection]], and appointed him to the commission responsible for tracing items from the collection which had been dispersed or sold by the parliamentary regime. Ashmole also appears to have been involved in the organisation of the coronation, or at least set himself up as an expert upon it.&lt;ref name=Hunter/&gt;

Ashmole became one of the founding members of the [[Royal Society]] in 1661, but he was not a very active member. His most significant appointment was to the [[College of Arms]] as [[Windsor Herald|Windsor Herald of Arms in Ordinary]] in June 1660. In this position he devoted himself to the study of the history of the [[Order of the Garter]], which had been a special interest of his since the 1650s, and proposed a design for the Royal Society's coat of arms.&lt;ref name=yb/&gt;

By 1665, he was collecting information for his [[English county histories|county history]], ''The Antiquities of Berkshire''; and in 1672 he published ''The Institution, Laws and Ceremonies of the Most Noble Order of the Garter'', a lavish [[Book size|folio]] with illustrations by [[Wenceslaus Hollar]], for which he had conducted years of research. An earlier attempt to promote himself as the official historiographer of the order had failed but this work firmly established Ashmole as an expert. He had written a large part of it in 1665 while living in the country to escape the Great Plague which was then raging in London.&lt;ref&gt;Josten, vol. I, pp. 155–156&lt;/ref&gt; Presentation copies sent to the foreign members of the order were reciprocated by gifts of gold insignia from the [[Christian V of Denmark|King of Denmark]], the [[Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg|Elector of Brandenburg]] and the [[Charles I Louis, Elector Palatine|Elector Palatine]]. Ashmole performed the [[heraldry|heraldic]] and [[genealogy|genealogical]] work of his office scrupulously, and he was considered a leading authority on court protocol and [[ceremony]].&lt;ref name=Hunter/&gt;

On 1 April 1668, Lady Mainwaring died, and on 3 November the same year Ashmole married Elizabeth Dugdale (1632–1701), the much younger daughter of his friend and fellow [[herald]], the antiquarian Sir [[William Dugdale]]. All of Elizabeth's pregnancies ended in stillbirths or miscarriages, and Ashmole remained childless.&lt;ref&gt;Josten, vol. I, pp. 172–173, 219, and 243&lt;/ref&gt; In 1675, he resigned as Windsor Herald, perhaps because of factional strife within the College of Arms.&lt;ref name=Hunter/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Josten, vol. I, p. 195&lt;/ref&gt; He was offered the post of [[Garter Principal King of Arms]], which traditionally came with a knighthood, but he turned it down in favour of Dugdale.&lt;ref name=Ford/&gt;

[[Image:Stained glass - Elias Ashmole coat of arms.jpg|thumb|upright|Ashmole's coat of arms is here shown in the first and last quarters of the shield. His crest placed the god Mercury between the twin constellation of Gemini (here used as supporters).]]

Ashmole possessed his own [[coat of arms]]. In his case, he was entitled to one by descent from [[armigerous]] ancestors, expressed in [[blazon|heraldic terminology]] as ''Quarterly gules and or a fleur de lis argent in the first quarter'' with ''a greyhound courant'' for the [[crest (heraldry)|crest]]. After the Restoration, Ashmole was granted a new crest in place of the greyhound, one which reflected his interest in astrology: ''On a wreath sable and or the planet Mercury collocated in the middle of the caelestiall Signe Gemini proper his right hand extended toward heaven and left holding a Caducan rod or''. The new grant also altered the tinctures of his arms to ''quarterly sable and or a fleur de lis in the first quarter''.&lt;ref&gt;Josten, vol. I, pp. 114–115, 131&lt;/ref&gt;

The Restoration led to the re-establishment of the [[Church of England]], and Ashmole presented new service books to Lichfield Cathedral. In 1684, Dugdale wrote to his son-in-law that &quot;the vulgar sort of people&quot; were not &quot;yet weaned from the presbyterian practises, which was long prayers of their own devising, and senseless sermons&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Josten, vol. IV, p. 1742&lt;/ref&gt; Like many royalists, Ashmole's circle was contemptuous of non-conformity.&lt;ref name=hill/&gt; Though Ashmole was &quot;one of the earliest [[Freemasons]], [and] appears from his writings to have been a zealous [[Rosicrucian]]&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=De Quincey|first=Thomas|authorlink=Thomas de Quincey|title=Confessions of an English Opium-eater|location=London|publisher=Walter Scott|year=1886|chapter=Historico-Critical Inquiry into the Origin of the Rosicrucians and the Freemasons|page=207}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Gadbury]] wrote that &quot;[[Anthony Wood]] hath falsely called him a Rosicrucian, Whereas no man was further from fostring such follies.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Josten, vol. I, pp. 681–682&lt;/ref&gt; Ashmole's involvement with Freemasonry and Rosicrucianism may have been social or the interest of an antiquarian, rather than born out of any religious fervour. However, the notion of a repository of universal knowledge is described in Rosicrucian writings and this idea may have partly inspired Ashmole's desire to found a great museum.&lt;ref name=Churton/&gt;

==Ashmolean Museum==

[[Image:Ashmolean.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The main entrance of the current Ashmolean Museum building.]]

In 1669, Ashmole received a Doctorate in Medicine from the University of Oxford. He maintained his links with the University and, in 1677, Ashmole made a gift of the Tradescant Collection, together with material he had collected independently, to the University on the condition that a suitable home be built to house the materials and make them available to the public. Ashmole had already moved into the house adjacent to the Tradescants' property in 1674 and had already removed some items from their house into his. In 1678, in the midst of further legal wrangling over the Tradescant collection, Hester was found drowned in a garden pond. By early 1679, Ashmole had taken over the lease of the Tradescant property and began merging his and their collections into one.&lt;ref name=Swann&gt;Swann, pp. 40–54&lt;/ref&gt; The Ashmolean Museum was completed in 1683, and is considered by some to be the first truly public museum in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Unlike previous collections assembled by aristocrats, the museum was open to anyone, regardless of rank, who could afford the entrance fee (Swann, pp. 40–54).&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Anthony Wood]], the collection filled twelve wagons when it was transferred to Oxford. It would have been more, but a large part of Ashmole's own collection, destined for the museum, including antiquities, books, manuscripts, prints, and 9000 coins and medals, was destroyed in a disastrous fire in the [[Middle Temple]] on 26 January 1679.&lt;ref&gt;Ashmole's collection had escaped the [[Great Fire of London]] in 1666; it was evacuated by barge before the fire reached the Temple precincts, which were, in any case, largely spared from the fire (Josten, vol. I, p. 158).&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the fire, the proportion of the collection derived from the Tradescants was larger than originally anticipated and in the opinion of [[Michael Hunter (historian)|Professor Michael Hunter]] this misfortune has contributed to criticisms that Ashmole took an unfair share of the credit in assembling the collection at the expense of the Tradescants.&lt;ref name=Hunter/&gt;

In 1678, Ashmole stood as a candidate in a [[by-election]] for the [[Lichfield (UK Parliament constituency)|Lichfield borough parliamentary constituency]] caused by the death of one of the two incumbent members. During Ashmole's campaign his cousin, Thomas Smalridge, who was acting as a kind of campaign manager, fell ill and died. Ashmole did not visit the constituency, and, as Ashmole's own horoscope had predicted, he lost the election.&lt;ref&gt;Josten, vol. I, pp. 220–225&lt;/ref&gt; He also put himself forward as a candidate in the general election of 1685. Surviving documents indicate that he was the most popular candidate, but after [[James II of England|King James II]] requested he stand down (in an age when monarchs were likely to interfere with parliamentary elections), Ashmole did so. On election day, all the votes cast for Ashmole, instead of being declared invalid, were declared as votes for the King's candidate, and only as a result of this ruse was the candidate favoured by the Court ([[Richard Leveson]]) elected.&lt;ref&gt;Josten, vol. I, p. 268&lt;/ref&gt;

Ashmole's health began to deteriorate in the 1680s and, though he would hold his excise office throughout the reign of James II and retained it after the [[Glorious Revolution]] until his death, he became much less active in affairs. His home cures included hanging three spiders around his neck which &quot;drove my Ague away&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Probably live spiders trapped inside nutshells (Josten, vol. IV, p. 1680).&lt;/ref&gt; He began to collect notes on his life in diary form to serve as source material for a biography; although the biography was never written, these notes are a rich source of information on Ashmole and his times.&lt;ref name=hill/&gt; He died at his house in [[Lambeth]] on 18 May 1692,&lt;ref&gt;According to his tombstone and a Treasury warrant, or 19 May according to [[John Gadbury]] (Josten, vol. IV, pp. 1889–1890).&lt;/ref&gt; and was buried at St. Mary's Church, Lambeth on 26 May. Ashmole bequeathed the remainder of his collection and library to Oxford for the Ashmolean Museum. Two-thirds of his library now resides in the Bodleian at Oxford; its separation from the museum collection in the Victorian era&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.bodley.ox.ac.uk/dept/scwmss/rarebooks/rbdac.htm|title=Rare Books and Printed Ephemera|publisher=Bodleian Library, University of Oxford|accessdate=2008-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.archiveshub.ac.uk/news/02120301.html|title=Ashmole Manuscripts|publisher=Archives Hub, Universities of Manchester and Liverpool|accessdate=2008-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; contributed to the belief that Ashmole designed the museum around the Tradescant collection, rather than his own.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Feola, Vittoria|date=23 July 2004|title=Elias Ashmole's library|url=http://ihl.enssib.fr/siteihl.php?page=171|publisher=Institut d'Histoire du Livre|journal=Society for the History of Authorship, Reading and Publishing annual congress 2004|accessdate=2008-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ashmole’s widow, Elizabeth, married a stonemason, John Reynolds, on 15 March 1694. They had no children and on her death seven years later the house and lands in Lambeth passed into Reynolds’s hands.&lt;ref&gt;Josten, vol. I, pp. 300–301&lt;/ref&gt;

Michael Hunter, in his entry on Ashmole for the ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', concluded that the most salient points of Ashmole's character were his ambition and his hierarchical vision of the world—a vision that unified his [[monarchism|royalism]] and his interests in heraldry, genealogy, ceremony, and even astrology and magic. He was as successful in his legal, business and political affairs as he was in his collecting and scholarly pursuits.&lt;ref name=Hunter/&gt; His antiquarian work is still considered valuable, and his alchemical publications, especially the ''[[Theatrum Chemicum Britannicum]]'', preserved many works that might otherwise have been lost. He formed several close and long-lasting friendships, with the astrologer [[William Lilly]] for example,&lt;ref&gt;[[Samuel Pepys]] describes in his diary an evening at Lilly's house on 24 October 1660, where Pepys met Ashmole and thought him &quot;a very ingenious gentleman&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; but, as [[Richard Garnett (writer)|Richard Garnett]] observed, &quot;acquisitiveness was his master passion&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Garnett (writer)|Garnett, Richard]] (1891, repr. 1973). &quot;Ashmole, Elias (1617–1692).&quot; ''[[Dictionary of National Biography]]'' (London: Oxford University Press).&lt;/ref&gt;
