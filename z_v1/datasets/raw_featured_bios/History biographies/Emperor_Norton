'''Joshua Abraham Norton''' (''c.'' 1819&lt;ref&gt;There are a number of disputed claims regarding Norton's date of birth. Many sources (Cowan, Norton's tombstone, and most present-day books on Norton) pinpoint Norton being born sometime in 1819, while a few sources state that he was born on 4 February 1819. Norton's obituary by the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' put him at 65 years old at the time of his death, which would mean he was born in 1814. Drury's ''Norton I, Emperor of the United States'' (1986) refers to immigration records which said Norton was two years old in 1820 when his parents moved to South Africa.&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– January 8, 1880), the self-proclaimed [[Imperial Majesty (style)|Imperial Majesty]] '''Emperor Norton I''', was a celebrated citizen of [[San Francisco|San Francisco, California]], who in 1859 proclaimed himself &quot;Emperor of these United States&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Emperor Joshua Norton I of America|publisher=[[BBC]]|first=Fred|last=Smith|date=2002-01-31|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/alabaster/A678026|accessdate=2007-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently &quot;Protector of Mexico&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;SFMuseumNorton&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Hansen|first=Gladys|title=San Francisco Almanac|publisher=[[Chronicle Books]]|location=San Francisco|year=1995|isbn=0-8118-0841-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Born in England, Norton spent most of his early life in South Africa. He emigrated to San Francisco in 1849 after receiving a [[bequest]] of $40,000 from his father's estate. Norton initially made a living as a businessman, but he lost his fortune investing in [[Peru]]vian [[rice]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Carr&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Carr|first= Patricia E.|month=July|year=1975|title=Emperor Norton I: The benevolent dictator beloved and honored by San Franciscans to this day |journal=American History Illustrated|volume=10|issue=|pages=14–20|url=http://www.molossia.org/norton.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After losing a lawsuit in which he tried to void his rice contract, Norton left San Francisco. He returned a few years later, apparently mentally unbalanced, claiming to be the Emperor of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weeks|first=David|coauthors= James, Jamie|title=Eccentrics: A Study of Sanity and Strangeness|publisher=Kodansha Globe|location=New York|year=1996|isbn= 1-56836-156-4|pages=3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he had no political power, and his influence extended only so far as he was humored by those around him, he was treated deferentially in San Francisco, and currency issued in his name was honored in the establishments he frequented.

Though he was considered insane, or at least highly eccentric,&lt;ref name=&quot;PBS&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title=New Perspectives on the West: Joshua Abraham Norton|publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]|year=2001|url= http://www.pbs.org/weta/thewest/people/i_r/norton.htm| accessdate = 2007-04-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the citizens of San Francisco celebrated his regal presence and his proclamations, most famously, his &quot;order&quot; that the [[United States Congress]] be dissolved by force and his numerous decrees calling for a bridge crossing and a tunnel to be built under [[San Francisco Bay]] (which both happened long after his death in the form of the [[San Francisco&amp;nbsp;– Oakland Bay Bridge]] and the [[Transbay Tube]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;SH&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Emperor Norton's name may yet span the bay|first=Suzanne|last=Herel|date= 2004-12-15|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2004/12/15/SFSUPES.TMP|accessdate=2007-04-17 | work=The San Francisco Chronicle}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 8, 1880, Norton collapsed at a street corner, and died before he could be given medical treatment.

==Early life==
Norton was born in England, but scholarly works disagree as to the date and town of his birth. His obituary in the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', &quot;following the best information obtainable&quot;, cited the [[silver]] plate on his coffin which said he was &quot;aged about 65&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Mort2&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Le Roi Est Mort|work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=1880-01-11|url= http://www.zpub.com/sf/history/nort3.html|accessdate=2006-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting that 1814 could be the year of his birth. Other sources claim that he was born on February 4, 1819 in [[London]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Cowan&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cowan|first=Robert|title= Norton I Emperor of the United States and Protector of Mexico (Joshua A. Norton, 1819-1880)|journal=Quarterly of the California Historical Society|publisher=California Historical Society|month=October|year=1923|url=http://www.emperornorton.net/NortonI-Cowan.html|accessdate=2006-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Immigration records indicate he was two years old in 1820 when his parents moved to South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Drury|first=William|title=Norton I, Emperor of the United States|publisher=Dodd, Mead &amp; Company|year=1986|location=New York|isbn=0-396-08509-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; South African genealogies suggest his parents were John Norton (d. August 1848) and Sarah Norden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dakers|first=Hazel|title=Southern Africa Jewish Genealogy SA-SIG|date=2000-04-06|url=http://www.jewishgen.org/Safrica/norden/index.htm#EMPEROR|accessdate=2009-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sarah was a daughter of Abraham Norden and a sister of Benjamin Norden, a successful Jewish merchant.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cowan&quot;/&gt;

Norton emigrated from South Africa to San Francisco in 1849 after receiving a bequest of $40,000 from his father's estate.&lt;ref name=&quot;SFMHS&quot;/&gt; He enjoyed a good deal of success in the real estate market, and by the early 1850s had accumulated a fortune of $250,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;SFMHS&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cowan&quot;/&gt; Norton thought he saw a business opportunity when China, facing a severe famine, placed a ban on the export of [[rice]], causing the price of rice in San Francisco to skyrocket from four cents per pound to thirty-six cents per pound (9 cents/kg to 79 cents/kg).&lt;ref name=&quot;SFMHS&quot;/&gt; When he heard the ''Glyde'', which was returning from Peru, was carrying {{convert|200000|lb}} of rice, he bought the entire shipment for $25,000 (or twelve and a half cents per pound), hoping to corner the market.&lt;ref name=&quot;SFMHS&quot;/&gt;

Shortly after he signed the contract, several other shiploads of rice arrived from Peru, causing the price of rice to plummet to three cents a pound.&lt;ref name=&quot;SFMHS&quot;/&gt; Norton tried to void the contract, stating the dealer had misled him as to the quality of rice to expect.&lt;ref name=&quot;SFMHS&quot;/&gt; From 1853 to 1857, Norton and the rice dealers were involved in a protracted litigation. Although Norton prevailed in the lower courts, the case reached the [[Supreme Court of California]], which ruled against Norton.&lt;ref&gt;''Ruiz v. Norton'', 4 Cal. 355 (1854).&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the Lucas Turner and Company Bank foreclosed on his real estate holdings in [[North Beach, San Francisco|North Beach]] to pay Norton's debt.&lt;ref name=&quot;SFMHS&quot;/&gt; Norton's mental state was severely affected by these financial setbacks. He declared [[bankruptcy]] in 1858 and left the city for a time.&lt;ref name=&quot;SH&quot;/&gt;

==Declares himself &quot;Emperor&quot;==
[[Image:Emperor Joshua A. Norton I.jpg|thumb|Norton in full regalia]]

When Norton returned to San Francisco from his self-imposed exile, he had become completely disgruntled with what he considered the inadequacies of the legal and political structures of the United States. On September 17, 1859, he took matters into his own hands and distributed letters to the various newspapers in the city, proclaiming himself &quot;Emperor of these United States&quot;:

{{cquote|At the peremptory request and desire of a large majority of the citizens of these United States, I, Joshua Norton, formerly of [[Algoa Bay]], Cape of Good Hope, and now for the last 9 years and 10 months past of S.

The announcement was first reprinted for humorous effect by the editor of the [[San Francisco Bulletin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=San Francisco Chronicle|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/09/17/MNA019NGBL.DTL|date=2009-09-17|author=Carl Nolte|title=Emperor Norton, zaniest S.F. street character}}&lt;/ref&gt; Norton would later add &quot;Protector of Mexico&quot; to this title. Thus commenced his unprecedented and whimsical 21-year &quot;reign&quot; over America.

[[Image:Emperor Norton proclamation re. assumption of prerogatives WFHM SF.JPG|thumb|One of Norton's undated [[proclamation]]s]]

In his self-appointed role of emperor, Norton issued numerous decrees on matters of the state. After assuming absolute control over the country, he saw no further need for a legislature, and on October 12, 1859, he issued a decree formally abolishing the [[United States Congress]]. In it, Norton observed:

{{cquote|...fraud and corruption prevent a fair and proper expression of the public voice; that open violation of the laws are constantly occurring, caused by mobs, parties, factions and undue influence of political sects; that the citizen has not that protection of person and property which he is entitled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=He abolishes Congress|publisher=|first=Joel|last= Gazis-Sax|year=1998|url=http://www.notfrisco.com/nortoniana/nocongress.html|accessdate=2007-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Norton ordered all interested parties to assemble at Platt's Music Hall in San Francisco in February 1860 to &quot;remedy the evil complained of&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Decrees&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=The Proclamations of Norton I|publisher=|first=Joel |last=Gazis-Sax|year=1998|url=http://www.notfrisco.com/colmatales/norton/proclaim.html|accessdate=2007-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an imperial decree the following month, Norton summoned the Army to depose the elected officials of the U.S. Congress:

{{cquote|WHEREAS, a body of men calling themselves the National Congress are now in session in Washington City, in violation of our Imperial edict of the 12th of October last, declaring the said Congress abolished;
&lt;br /&gt;
WHEREAS, it is necessary for the repose of our Empire that the said decree should be strictly complied with;
&lt;br /&gt;
NOW, THEREFORE, we do hereby Order and Direct [[Winfield Scott|Major-General Scott]], the Command-in-Chief of our Armies, immediately upon receipt of this, our Decree, to proceed with a suitable force and clear the Halls of Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=He calls on the Army|publisher=|first=Joel|last=Gazis-Sax|year=1998|url=http://www.notfrisco.com/nortoniana/bringdaarmy.html| accessdate=2007-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Norton's orders were ignored by the Army, and Congress likewise continued undisturbed. Further decrees in 1860 dissolved the republic and forbade the assembly of any members of the former Congress.&lt;ref name=&quot;Decrees&quot;/&gt; Norton's battle against the elected leaders of America persisted throughout his reign, though it appears he eventually, if grudgingly, allowed Congress to exist without his permission. Hoping to resolve the many disputes that had resulted in the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], in 1862 Norton issued a mandate ordering both the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and [[Protestantism|Protestant]] churches to publicly ordain him as &quot;Emperor&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cowan&quot;/&gt;

His attempts to overthrow the elected government having been ignored, Norton turned his attention to other matters, both political and social. On August 12, 1869, &quot;being desirous of allaying the dissensions of party strife now existing within our realm&quot;, he abolished the [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic]] and [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] parties.&lt;ref name=&quot;SFMuseumNorton&quot;/&gt; The failure to treat to Norton's adopted home city with appropriate respect was the subject of a particularly stern edict in 1872:

{{cquote|Whoever after due and proper warning shall be heard to utter the abominable word &quot;Frisco,&quot; which has no linguistic or other warrant, shall be deemed guilty of a High Misdemeanor, and shall pay into the Imperial Treasury as penalty the sum of twenty-five dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = He Bans the F-Word| publisher = | author =Joel Gazis-Sax | year =1998 | url = http://www.notfrisco.com/nortoniana/notfrisco.html| accessdate = 2007-04-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Despite his quirks and regardless of the nature of his psychological condition, Norton was occasionally a visionary, and some of his &quot;Imperial Decrees&quot; exhibited  profound foresight. He issued instructions to form a [[League of Nations]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Mencken | first=Henry Louis| coauthors=George Jean Nathan |title=The American Mercury | publisher= | location=| year = 1951|isbn= | page=499|authorlink4=[[H. L. Mencken]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he explicitly forbade any form of conflict between religions or their sects. Norton saw fit to decree the construction of a suspension bridge or tunnel connecting [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] and San Francisco, his later decrees becoming increasingly irritated at the lack of prompt obedience by the authorities:

{{cquote|WHEREAS, we issued our decree ordering the citizens of San Francisco and Oakland to appropriate funds for the survey of a suspension bridge from Oakland Point via [[Yerba Buena Island|Goat Island]]; also for a tunnel; and to ascertain which is the best project; and whereas the said citizens have hitherto neglected to notice our said decree; and whereas we are determined our authority shall be fully respected; now, therefore, we do hereby command the arrest by the army of both the Boards of City Fathers if they persist in neglecting our decrees.
&lt;br /&gt;
Given under our royal hand and seal at San Francisco, this 17th day of September, 1872.&lt;ref name=&quot;SH&quot;/&gt;}}

The intent of this decree, unlike many others, actually came to fruition; construction of the [[San Francisco&amp;nbsp;– Oakland Bay Bridge]] began on July 9, 1933 and was completed on November 12, 1936.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Dannhausen | first=William O. | title=Better Roads | publisher= | location=| year = 1931|isbn= | page=58 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The construction of [[Bay Area Rapid Transit]]'s [[Transbay Tube]] was completed in 1969, with Transbay rail service commencing in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = BART&amp;nbsp;— History and Facts, System Facts| publisher = [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] [[Bay Area Rapid Transit]] District (BART)| author = | date = | url = http://bart.gov/about/history/systemFacts.asp| accessdate = 2007-04-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eccentric &quot;Imperial&quot; behavior==
[[Image:Lazarus2.jpg|thumb|left|A fanciful depiction of Norton dressed as the [[Pope]] at the funeral of the itinerant dog Lazarus&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = The Funeral of Lazarus| publisher =Virtual Museum of the City of San Francisco| author = | date =2004-07-24 | url = http://www.sfmuseum.org/hist6/lazarus.html| accessdate = 2006-09-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Norton spent his days inspecting San Francisco's streets in an elaborate blue [[uniform]] with gold-plated epaulets, given to him by officers of the United States Army post at the [[Presidio of San Francisco]]. He also wore a [[beaver hat]] decorated with a [[peacock feather]] and a rosette.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Two Bay Area Bridges&amp;nbsp;— The Golden Gate and San Francisco&amp;nbsp;– Oakland Bay Bridge| publisher =[[Federal Highway Administration]]| author = | date =2005-01-18 | url = http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/2bridges.htm| accessdate = 2007-06-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He frequently enhanced this regal posture with a cane or umbrella. During his inspections, Norton would examine the condition of the sidewalks and [[cable car (railway)|cable cars]], the state of repair of public property, and the appearance of police officers.&lt;ref name=&quot;p153&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last=Moran | first=Mark  |authorlink=Mark Moran |coauthors=[[Mark Sceurman]]| title=Weird U.S.: Your Travel Guide To America's Local Legends And Best Kept Secrets | publisher= Sterling Publishing| location=New York| year = 2005|isbn=0-7607-5043-2| page=153}}&lt;/ref&gt; Norton would also frequently give lengthy philosophical expositions on a variety of topics to anyone within earshot.

During one of his inspections Norton is said to have performed one of his most famous acts of &quot;diplomacy.&quot; During the 1860s and 1870s, there were occasional anti-Chinese demonstrations in the poorer districts of San Francisco. Ugly riots, sometimes resulting in fatalities, took place. During one incident, Norton is claimed to have positioned himself between the rioters and their Chinese targets; with a bowed head, he started reciting the [[Lord's Prayer]] repeatedly until the rioters dispersed without incident.&lt;ref name=&quot;p153&quot;/&gt;

Norton was loved and revered by the citizens of San Francisco. Although penniless, he regularly ate at the finest restaurants in San Francisco; restaurateurs took it upon themselves to add brass plaques in their entrances declaring &quot;[b]y Appointment to his Imperial Majesty, Emperor Norton I of the United States.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Sinclair | first=Mick |coauthors=| title=San Francisco: A Cultural and Literary History | publisher= Signal Books| location=Oxford, England| year = 2004|isbn=1-902669-65-7| page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such &quot;Imperial seals of approval&quot; were prized and a substantial boost to trade. No play or musical performance in San Francisco would dare to open without reserving balcony seats for Norton.&lt;ref name=&quot;SFMHS&quot;/&gt;

A rumor started by the devoted Norton caricaturist [[Edward Jump|Ed Jump]] claims he had two dogs, [[Bummer and Lazarus]], which were also notable San Francisco celebrities.&lt;ref name=&quot;BL&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title = Bummer and Lazarus| publisher =Encyclopedia of San Francisco| author =Malcolm E. Barker | date = | url = http://www.sfhistoryencyclopedia.com/articles/b/bummerLazarus.html| accessdate = 2007-06-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Though he did not own the dogs, Norton ate at free lunch counters where he shared his meals with the dogs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carr&quot;/&gt;

[[Image:Nort10d.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A ten dollar note issued by the Imperial Government of Norton I]]

In 1867, a policeman named Armand Barbier arrested Norton to commit him to involuntary treatment for a [[mental disorder]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC&quot;/&gt; The Emperor's arrest outraged the citizens and sparked scathing editorials in the newspapers. Police Chief Patrick Crowley ordered Norton released and issued a formal apology on behalf of the police force.&lt;ref name=&quot;SFMHS&quot;/&gt; Crowley wrote &quot;that he had shed no blood; robbed no one; and despoiled no country; which is more than can be said of his fellows in that line.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cowan&quot;/&gt; Norton  magnanimously granted an &quot;Imperial Pardon&quot; to the errant policeman. All police officers of San Francisco thereafter saluted Norton as he passed in the street.&lt;ref name=&quot;p153&quot;/&gt;

Norton did receive some tokens of recognition for his position. The 1870 U.S. census lists Joshua Norton as 50 years old and residing at 624 Commercial Street; his occupation was &quot;Emporer&quot;{{Sic}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;SFMuseumNorton&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rootsweb.com/~cenfiles/ca/sanfrancisco/1870/ed41/sanfrancisco/ward03/sanfrancisco-c07.txt Transcription of census records page]&lt;/ref&gt; Norton also issued his own money to pay for his debts, and it became an accepted [[local currency]] in San Francisco. These notes came in denominations between from fifty cents and ten dollars; the few surviving notes are collector's items. The city of San Francisco also honored Norton. When his uniform began to look shabby, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors bought him a suitably regal replacement. Norton sent a gracious thank you note and issued a &quot;patent of nobility in perpetuity&quot; for each supervisor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Gorman | first=Michael R. |coauthors=| title=The Empress Is a Man: Stories from the Life of Jose Sarria| publisher= [[Haworth Press|The Haworth Press, Inc.]]| location=[[Binghamton, New York]]| year = 1998|isbn=0-7890-0259-0| page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later years and death==
During the later years of Norton's &quot;reign&quot;, he was the subject of considerable speculation. One popular story suggested he was the son of Emperor [[Napoleon III]], and that his claim of coming from South Africa was a ruse to prevent persecution.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mort2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;To have been an illegitimate son of [[Napoleon III of France|Louis Napoleon]], he would have had to have been conceived when the French Emperor was only eleven; Louis Napoleon's actual son, [[Napoléon Eugène, Prince Imperial]], died fighting in the [[Anglo-Zulu War]] in 1879.&lt;/ref&gt; Another popular story suggested Norton was planning to marry [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC&quot;/&gt; While this claim is unsupported, Norton did write to the Queen on several occasions, and he is reported to have met Emperor [[Pedro II of Brazil]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Cowan&quot;/&gt; Rumors also circulated that Norton was supremely wealthy—only affecting poverty because he was miserly.

A number of decrees that were probably fraudulent were submitted and duly printed in local newspapers, and it is believed that in at least a few cases, newspaper editors themselves drafted fictitious edicts to suit their own agendas.&lt;ref name=&quot;SFMHS&quot;/&gt; The [[Museum of the City of San Francisco]] maintains a list of the decrees believed to be genuine.&lt;ref name=&quot;SFMuseumNorton&quot;/&gt;

On the evening of January 8, 1880, Norton collapsed on the corner of California Street and Dupont Street (now Grant Avenue) in front of [[Old Saint Mary's Cathedral|Old St. Mary's Church]] while on his way to a lecture at the [[California Academy of Sciences]].&lt;ref name=&lt;ref name=&quot;SFMHS&quot;/&gt; His collapse was immediately noticed and &quot;the police officer on the beat hastened for a carriage to convey him to the City Receiving Hospital.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mort&quot;&gt;{{cite news| title = Le Roi Est Mort | publisher=San Francisco Chronicle |author = | date =January 9, 1880 | url = http://www.notfrisco.com/colmatales/norton/nobit.html| accessdate = 2006-09-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Norton died before a carriage could arrive. The following day the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' published his obituary on its front page under the headline &quot;''Le Roi est Mort''&quot; (&quot;The King is Dead&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;Mort&quot;/&gt; In a tone tinged with sadness, the article respectfully reported that, &quot;[o]n the reeking pavement, in the darkness of a moon-less night under the dripping rain..., Norton I, by the grace of God, Emperor of the United States and Protector of Mexico, departed this life&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mort&quot;/&gt; The ''Morning Call'', another leading San Francisco newspaper, published a front-page article using an almost identical sentence as a headline: &quot;Norton the First, by the grace of God Emperor of these United States and Protector of Mexico, departed this life.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;SFMuseumNorton&quot;/&gt;

It quickly became evident that, contrary to the rumors, Norton had died in complete poverty. Five or six dollars in small change had been found on his person, and a search of his room at the boarding house on Commercial Street turned up a single gold [[Sovereign_(British_coin)|sovereign]], then worth around $2.50; his collection of walking sticks; his rather battered saber; a variety of headgear (including a stovepipe, a derby, a red-laced Army cap, and another cap suited to a martial band-master); an 1828 French [[franc]]; and a handful of the Imperial bonds he sold to tourists at a fictitious 7% interest.&lt;ref name=&quot;SFMHS&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Death&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title = The Madness of Joshua Norton| publisher = | author =Joel Gazis-Sax | year =1997 | url = http://www.notfrisco.com/colmatales/norton/norton2.html| accessdate = 2007-06-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There were fake telegrams purporting to be from Emperor [[Alexander II of Russia]], congratulating Norton on his forthcoming marriage to Queen Victoria, and from the President of France, predicting that such a union would be disastrous to world peace. Also found were his letters to Queen Victoria and 98 shares of stock in a defunct gold mine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Asbury | first=Herbert| title=The Barbary Coast| publisher=Thunder's Mouth Press | location=New York| year = 2002|isbn=1-56025-408-4 | page=231|authorlink4=Herbert Asbury }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initial funeral arrangements were for a pauper's coffin of simple redwood. However, members of the Pacific Club, a San Francisco businessman's association, established a funeral fund that provided for a handsome rosewood casket and arranged a suitably dignified farewell.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cowan&quot;/&gt; Norton's funeral on Sunday, January 10, was solemn, mournful, and large. Paying their respects were members of &quot;...all classes from capitalists to the pauper, the clergyman to the pickpocket, well-dressed ladies and those whose garb and bearing hinted of the social outcast.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mort2&quot;/&gt; Some accounts say as many as 30,000 people lined the streets, and that the funeral cortege was two miles (3&amp;nbsp;km) long. San Francisco's total population was then 230,000.&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/1880a_v1-13.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Norton was buried in the Masonic Cemetery, at the expense of the City of San Francisco.&lt;ref name=&quot;SFMHS&quot;/&gt;

In 1934, Emperor Norton's remains were transferred, as were all graves in the city, to a grave site of moderate splendor at Woodlawn Cemetery, in [[Colma, California|Colma]]. The grave is marked by a large stone inscribed &quot;Norton I, Emperor of the United States and Protector of Mexico&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Photos of gravestone at [http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GRid=766 Findagrave.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = Emperor Reburied | author = | date = July 9, 1934| publisher=''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' |url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,769908-1,00.html| accessdate = 2007-07-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Adjacent to his plot is one marked for the self-declared &quot;Her Royal Majesty, Empress of San Francisco, José I, [[José Sarria|The Widow Norton]].&quot;

Although details of his life story may have been forgotten, Emperor Norton was immortalized in literature. [[Mark Twain]], who resided in San Francisco during part of Emperor Norton's &quot;reign&quot;, modeled the character of the King in ''[[Adventures of Huckleberry Finn]]'' on Joshua Norton.&lt;ref name=&quot;SFMHS&quot;/&gt;

[[Robert Louis Stevenson]] made Norton a character in his 1892 novel, ''The Wrecker''. Stevenson's stepdaughter, Isobel Field, mentioned Norton in her autobiography, ''This Life I've Loved''. She said that Norton &quot;was a gentle and kindly man, and fortunately found himself in the friendliest and most sentimental city in the world, the idea being 'let him be emperor if he wants to.' San Francisco played the game with him.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;SFMHS&quot;/&gt;

Over the years, Norton's eccentricity has been a continuing source of inspiration. He appears as a patron saint in the [[religion]] of [[Discordianism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Metzger | first=Richard | title=Book of Lies: The Disinformation Guide to Magick and the Occult | publisher= The Disinformation Company| location=New York| year = 2003|isbn=0-9713942-7-X | page=158 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and makes [[Emperor Norton in popular culture|numerous appearances in popular culture]].

In 1939, [[E Clampus Vitus]] placed a plaque on the [[Transbay Terminal]] of the [[San Francisco Bay Bridge]] commemorating Emperor Norton's &quot;The bridge will be built&quot; proclamation.

In January 1980, ceremonies were conducted in San Francisco to honor the 100th anniversary of the demise of the one and only &quot;Emperor of the United States.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;SFMuseumNorton&quot;/&gt; Norton's proclamations promoting a bridge between San Francisco and Oakland were commemorated on December 14, 2004, when after a campaign by local cartoonist [[Phil Frank]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=San Francisco Chronicle|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2004/12/15/MNGUMAC6LN1.DTL|title=Emperor Norton's name may yet span the bay: S.F. supervisors endorse plan to rechristen Bay Bridge after 19th century eccentric|author=Suzanne Herel|date=2005-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; the San Francisco Board of Supervisors approved a resolution to name the new span of the [[San Francisco&amp;nbsp;– Oakland Bay Bridge]] to be named after Norton. The proposal needed approval by the City of Oakland and state authorities before it could be ratified. However, Oakland City Council expressed disapproval, and the resolution went no further.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first =Delfin| last = Vigil| title = A gay court pays homage to its queer emperor| publisher = ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]''| date =2005-02-21| url = http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2005/02/21/BAGKHBEO9N1.DTL| accessdate = 2007-06-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Emperor Norton was also included in an issue of Sandman comics in issue #31 entitled Three Septembers and a January. In the story, Dream, Despair, Delirium and Desire fight over who can take him into their realm before Death can take him. Dream gave him the idea of being emperor, which prevented Desire, Despair and Delirium from taking him. In the end, in his death, Death implies that Norton is one of the 36 [[Tzadikim Nistarim|Tzaddikums]] of the Jewish stories, and remarked that among all the emperors, kings and heads of states she has met, he is her favorite.
