'''John Francis Jackson''' [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|DFC]] (23 February 1908&amp;nbsp;– 28 April 1942) was an Australian [[flying ace|fighter ace]] and squadron commander of World War&amp;nbsp;II. He was credited with eight aerial victories, and led [[No. 75 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;75 Squadron]] during the [[Battle of Port Moresby]] in 1942. Born in [[Brisbane]], he was a [[Pastoral farming|grazier]] and businessman, who also operated his own private plane, when he joined the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) Reserve in 1936. Called up for active service following the outbreak of war in 1939, Jackson served with [[No. 23 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;23 Squadron]] in Australia before he was posted to the [[Middle East Theatre of World War II|Middle East]] in November 1940. As a fighter pilot with [[No. 3 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;3 Squadron]] he flew [[Gloster Gladiator]]s, [[Hawker Hurricane]]s and [[Curtiss P-40 variants|P-40 Tomahawks]] during the [[North African campaign|North African]] and [[Syria–Lebanon campaign]]s. 

Jackson was awarded the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] and [[mentioned in despatches]] for his actions in the Middle East. Later posted to the [[South West Pacific theatre of World War II|South West Pacific theatre]], he was promoted to [[squadron leader]] in March 1942 and given command of No.&amp;nbsp;75 Squadron at [[Port Moresby]], New Guinea, operating P-40 Kittyhawks. Described as &quot;rugged, simple&quot; and &quot;true as steel&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;&gt;[http://adbonline.anu.edu.au/biogs/A140619b.htm? Jackson, John Francis] at [[Australian Dictionary of Biography]]. Retrieved on 6 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Jackson was nicknamed &quot;Old John&quot; in affectionate tribute to his thirty-four years. He earned praise for his leadership during the defence of Port Moresby before his death in combat on 28&amp;nbsp;April. His younger brother [[Leslie Douglas Jackson|Les]] took over No.&amp;nbsp;75 Squadron, and also became a fighter ace. [[Jacksons International Airport]], Port Moresby, is named in John Jackson's honour.

== Early career ==
John Jackson was born on 23 February 1908 in the [[Brisbane]] suburb of [[New Farm, Queensland|New Farm]], Queensland, the eldest son of businessman William Jackson and his wife Edith. Educated at [[Brisbane Grammar School]] and [[The Scots PGC College|The Scots College, Warwick]], Jackson joined the [[Young Australia League]], with which he visited Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; After leaving school he ran a [[Station (Australian agriculture)|grazing property]] in [[St George, Queensland|St George]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Newton&quot;&gt;Newton, ''Australian Air Aces'', p. 92&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 1930s he was in business as a stock and station agent, and had interests in engineering and financial concerns. He was inspired by the [[MacRobertson Air Race|1934 London to Melbourne Air Race]] to take up flying, and purchased a [[British Aircraft Swallow|Klemm Swallow]] monoplane.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ewer&quot;&gt;Ewer, ''Storm Over Kokoda'', pp. 116–117&lt;/ref&gt; In 1936 he took part in the [[South Australia]]n centenary air race, flying from Brisbane to [[Adelaide]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; That August, he joined the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) Reserve, or Citizen Air Force.&lt;ref name=&quot;Newton&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Garrisson&quot;&gt;Garrisson, ''Australian Fighter Aces'', pp. 140–141&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1937 he upgraded his aircraft to a [[Beechcraft Model 17 Staggerwing|Beechcraft Staggerwing]], a type that was faster than many in the RAAF's inventory.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ewer&quot;/&gt;

Jackson first saw action with No.&amp;nbsp;3 Squadron in the [[North African campaign]] at the controls of a [[Gloster Gladiator]]. Soon after he arrived, he had an accident taking off that finished with the biplane on its nose.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gladiator&quot;&gt;Thomas, ''Gloster Gladiator Aces'', p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; Though he considered himself a &quot;full-blown operational pilot&quot;, his experience in air-to-air gunnery was &quot;practically nil&quot;, and he essentially learned the skills of being a fighter pilot as he went along.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ewer&quot;/&gt; Once the unit had converted to [[Hawker Hurricane]]s, however, he began to score victories in quick succession.

Jackson became an [[flying ace|ace]] on 25&amp;nbsp;June, when he destroyed a [[Potez 630]] light bomber (possibly a misidentified [[Lioré et Olivier LeO 45|LeO 451]]) of the [[Vichy France|Vichy French]] air force.

Following his return from the Middle East, Jackson was briefly an instructor at [[No. 1 Flying Training School RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Service Flying Training School]], based at [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Point Cook Base|RAAF Station Point Cook]], Victoria. He wrote to his wife, &quot;I just loathe this joint.

As the Japanese advanced towards New Guinea in early 1942, the RAAF urgently established three new fighter units for Australia's northern defence, [[No. 75 Squadron RAAF|Nos.&amp;nbsp;75]], [[No. 76 Squadron RAAF|76]] and [[No. 77 Squadron RAAF|77 Squadrons]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 139–141&lt;/ref&gt; Jackson was promoted to acting [[squadron leader]] and appointed commanding officer (CO) of No.&amp;nbsp;75 Squadron on 19&amp;nbsp;March, barely two weeks after the unit was formed at [[Townsville]], Queensland.&lt;ref name=&quot;Newton&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Aces&quot;&gt;Thomas, ''Tomahawk and Kittyhawk Aces'', pp. 50–55&lt;/ref&gt; He took over from Wing Commander [[Peter Jeffrey (RAAF officer)|Peter Jeffrey]], who had led No.&amp;nbsp;3 Squadron in the Middle East and been given the task of preparing No.&amp;nbsp;75 for operations at [[Port Moresby]], where the local [[Australian Army]] garrison was under regular attack by Japanese bombers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/23.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 458–462]&lt;/ref&gt; Jeffrey later recalled chiding Jackson for his eagerness to return to combat despite having already done enough in the war, to which the latter replied, &quot;What are you fighting for?

Well, I'm fighting for my wife and kids and no Jap bastard's going to get them!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, ''Whispering Death'', pp. 155–156, 470&lt;/ref&gt; On 21&amp;nbsp;March, Jackson led the squadron's main force to Seven Mile Aerodrome to take part in the [[Battle of Port Moresby|defence of Port Moresby]], a crucial early battle in the [[New Guinea campaign]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens&quot;/&gt; and what military aviation historian Andrew Thomas called &quot;one of the most gallant episodes in the history of the RAAF&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aces&quot;/&gt;  The unit was equipped with [[Curtiss P-40 variants|P-40 Kittyhawks]], whose long-awaited arrival had seen them irreverently dubbed &quot;Tomorrowhawks&quot;, &quot;Neverhawks&quot;, and &quot;Mythhawks&quot; by the beleaguered garrison at Moresby.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison&quot;/&gt; Jackson's age of thirty-four was considered advanced for a fighter pilot, and he was affectionately known as &quot;Old John&quot; to his men, one of whom was his younger brother Les, now a flight lieutenant.

On 22&amp;nbsp;March, the day after he arrived in New Guinea, Jackson took No.&amp;nbsp;75 Squadron on a dawn raid against the Japanese airfield at [[Lae]].  Rather than attacking directly from the south, he led the Kittyhawks in from the east, where they would not be expected and where the rising sun would hide their approach. Achieving the surprise he had hoped for, Jackson made two strafing passes over the airfield, ignoring standard practice that called for only one such pass to reduce the risk from anti-aircraft fire.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ewer122&quot;&gt;Ewer, ''Storm Over Kokoda'', p. 122–127&lt;/ref&gt; The Australians claimed a dozen Japanese planes destroyed on the ground and five more damaged.&lt;ref name=&quot;Newton&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens&quot;/&gt; They also shot down two [[Mitsubishi A6M Zero|Mitsubishi Zero]] fighters in the air, and lost two Kittyhawks over Lae, along with one that had crash-landed on takeoff from Moresby.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ewer122&quot;/&gt; The Japanese struck back the next day, destroying two Kittyhawks on Seven Mile Aerodrome. With his losses mounting, Jackson was given permission to withdraw the squadron to [[Horn Island, Queensland|Horn Island]] in Far North Queensland, but refused.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aces&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison&quot;/&gt; On 4&amp;nbsp;April, Jackson made a solo reconnaissance over Lae, after which he led another four Kittyhawks on a raid against the airfield, claiming seven enemy aircraft destroyed on the ground without loss to themselves; Japanese sources credited the Australians with only two machines destroyed, but seventeen others damaged. Two days later, Les Jackson was forced to ditch his aircraft on a coral reef, but made it to shore with the aid of a life jacket that John dropped to him, not realising at the time that the downed pilot was his younger brother.&lt;ref&gt;Ewer, ''Storm Over Kokoda'', pp. 155–157&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, ''Whispering Death'', p. 169&lt;/ref&gt;
