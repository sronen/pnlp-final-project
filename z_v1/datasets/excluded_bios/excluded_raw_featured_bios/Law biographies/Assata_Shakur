Shakur was arrested for the first time in 1967 with 100 other Manhattan Community College students, on charges of [[trespass]]ing. The students had chained and locked the entrance to a college building to protest a curriculum deficient in [[Africana studies|black studies]] and a lack of black faculty.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, 1993, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; She married Louis Chesimard, a fellow student-activist at CCNY, in April 1967, divorcing him in December 1970. Shakur devotes only one paragraph of her autobiography to her marriage, attributing its termination to disagreements related to [[gender roles]].&lt;ref&gt;Perkins, 2000, p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduation from CCNY at 23, Shakur became involved in the Black Panther Party (BPP), eventually becoming a leading member of the [[Harlem]] branch.&lt;ref name=&quot;riley&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;james&quot;&gt;James, Matthew Thomas. Joy James (Ed.). (2005). ''The New Abolitionists: (Neo)slave Narratives And Contemporary Prison Writings''. SUNY Press. ISBN 0-7914-6485-7. p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to joining the BPP, Shakur had met several of its members on a 1970 trip to [[Oakland, California]].&lt;ref name=&quot;africana&quot;/&gt; One of Shakur's main activities with the Panthers was coordinating a school breakfast program. However, she soon left the Party, charging macho behavior of males in these organizations,&lt;ref&gt;Shakur, 1987, pp. 223–224.&lt;/ref&gt; but did not go as far as other female Panthers like Regina Jennings who left the organization over [[sexual harassment]].&lt;ref&gt;Jones, 1998, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, Shakur's main criticism of the Black Panther Party was its alleged lack of focus on [[African diaspora|black history]]:
:&quot;The basic problem stemmed from the fact that the BPP had no systematic approach to political education. They were reading the [[Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong|Red Book]] but didn't know who Harriet Tubman, Marcus Garvey, and Nat Turner were. They talked about intercommunalism but still really believed that the Civil War was fought to free the slaves. A whole lot of them barely understood any kind of history, Black, African or otherwise. [...] That was the main reason many Party members, in my opinion, underestimated the need to unite with other Black organizations and to struggle around various community issues.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Shakur, 1987, p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt;

That same year she changed her name to Assata Shakur&lt;ref name=&quot;africana&quot;/&gt; and joined the Black Liberation Army (BLA), &quot;a [[Stratocracy|politico-military]] organization, whose primary objective (was) to fight for the independence and self-determination of Afrikan people in the United States.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;James, Joy.

==Allegations and manhunt==

On April 6, 1971, Shakur was shot in the stomach during a struggle with a guest at the [[Hotel Pennsylvania|Statler Hilton Hotel]] in [[Midtown Manhattan]] and was arrested on a string of charges. According to police, Shakur knocked on the door of a room occupied by an out-of-town guest and asked &quot;Is there a party going on here?&quot; to which the occupant responded in the negative.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT_1971-04-07&quot;/&gt; Shakur then allegedly displayed a revolver and a struggle ensued, during which she was shot.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT_1971-04-07&quot;&gt;Waggoner, Walter H. 1971, April 7. &quot;[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30A1FF93A5F127A93C5A9178FD85F458785F9 Woman Shot in Struggle With Her Alleged Victim]&quot;.

By June 1973, an apparatus that would become the FBI's [[Joint Terrorism Task Force]] (JTTF)&lt;ref&gt;According to Churchill and Vander Wall (2002): &quot;What had emerged in the 1980s was a formal amalgamation of FBI COINTELPRO specialists and New York City red squad detectives known as the Joint Terrorist Task Force (JTTF), consolidating the more ''ad hoc'' models of such an apparatus which had materialized in cities like Chicago and Los Angeles during the late '60s&quot; (p.  309); &quot;JTTF: The Joint Terrorist Task Force, created in the late 1970s as an interlock between the FBI and New York City red squads to engage in COINTELPRO-type activities&quot; (p. xiii).&lt;/ref&gt; was issuing near daily briefings on Shakur's status and the allegations against her.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, 1993, p. 3.&lt;br&gt;&quot;It was the spring of 1973 and for the last two years the nationwide dragnet for her capture had intensified each time a young African American identified as a member of the BLA was arrested or wounded or killed. The Joint Terrorist Task Force, made up of the FBI and local police agencies across the country, issued daily bulletins predicting her imminent apprehension each time another bank had been robbed or another cop had been killed. Whenever there was a lull in such occurrences, they leaked information, allegedly classified as 'confidential,' to the media, repeating past accusations and flashing her face across television screens and newspapers with heartbeat regularity, lest the public forget.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ck16&quot;&gt;Cleaver and Katsiaficas, 2001, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Cleaver and Katsiaficas, the FBI and local police &quot;initiated a national search-and-destroy mission for suspected BLA members, collaborating in stakeouts that were the products of intensive political repression and counterintelligence campaigns like NEWKILL&quot; and &quot;attempted to tie Assata to every suspected action of the BLA involving a woman&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Cleaver and Katsiaficas, 2001, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; The JTTF would later serve as the &quot;coordinating body in the search for Assata and the renewed campaign to smash the BLA&quot;, after her escape from prison.&lt;ref name=&quot;ck16&quot;/&gt; After her capture, however, Shakur was not charged with any of the crimes that had made her the subject of the manhunt.&lt;ref name=&quot;churchill308&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;marable529&quot;&gt;[[Manning Marable|Marable, Manning]], and Mullings, Leith.

===Turnpike shootout change of venue===
On the charges related to the New Jersey Turnpike shootout, New Jersey Superior Court Judge Leon Gerofsky ordered a [[change of venue]] in 1973 from [[Middlesex County, New Jersey|Middlesex]] to [[Morris County, New Jersey]], saying &quot;it was almost impossible to obtain a jury here {{sic|hide=y|comprised |of}} people willing to accept the responsibility of impartiality so that defendants will be protected from transitory passion and prejudice&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hershberger&quot;&gt;Hershberger, James.

===Bronx bank robbery mistrial===
In December 1973, Shakur was tried for a September 29, 1972 $3,700 robbery of the [[Manufacturer's Hanover Trust Company]] in the Bronx, along with co-defendant Kamau Sadiki (born Fred Hilton).&lt;ref name=&quot;p81&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;awaited&quot;/&gt; In light of the pending murder prosecution against Shakur in New Jersey state court, her lawyers requested that the trial be postponed for six months in order to permit further preparation. Judge [[Lee P. Gagliardi]] denied a postponement, and the Second Circuit denied Shakur's petition for [[mandamus]].&lt;ref&gt;Chesimard v. Gagliardi, 489 F.2d 271 (2d Cir. 1973) (per curiam).&lt;/ref&gt; In protest, the lawyers stayed mute, and Shakur and Sadiki conducted their own defense.&lt;ref name=&quot;p81&quot;&gt;Perkins, 2000, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;awaited&quot;&gt;''The New York Times''.

(August 23, 1973). &quot;9 'Black Liberation' Suspects Indicted&quot;. p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; who—according to Gold—represented the &quot;top echelon&quot; of the BLA as determined by a year-long investigation.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, Vincent. (August 24, 1973). &quot;Black Liberation leaders indicted&quot;. ''Chicago Tribune'', p. A16.&lt;/ref&gt;

The prosecution's case rested largely on the testimony of two men who had pleaded guilty to participating in the holdup.&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times''. (December 30, 1973). &quot;Chesimard Acquitted&quot;. p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; The prosecution called four witnesses: Avon White and John Rivers (both of whom had already been convicted of the robbery) and the manager and teller of the bank.&lt;ref name=&quot;prial&quot;&gt;Prial, Frank J.

''The New York Times'', p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; White and Rivers, although convicted, had not yet been sentenced for the robbery and were promised that the charges would be dropped in exchange for their testimony.&lt;ref name=&quot;prial&quot;/&gt; White and Rivers testified that Shakur had guarded one of the doors with a [[.357 magnum]] pistol and that Sadiki had served as a lookout and drove the getaway truck during the robbery; neither White nor Rivers was cross-examined due to the defense attorney's refusal to participate in the trial.&lt;ref name=&quot;prial&quot;/&gt; Shakur's aunt and lawyer, Evelyn Williams, was also cited for contempt after walking out of the courtroom after many of her attempted motions were denied.&lt;ref name=&quot;p81&quot;/&gt; The trial was delayed for a few days after Shakur was diagnosed with [[pleurisy]].&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times''. (December 7, 1973). &quot;Miss Chesimard Ill; Trial Here Delayed&quot;. p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the trial, the defendants were escorted to a &quot;holding pen&quot; outside the courtroom several times after shouting complaints and epithets at Judge Gagliardi.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT_1973-12-06&quot;&gt;Lichtenstein, Grace. 1973-12-06. &quot;[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F7091EFA395D127A93C4A91789D95F478785F9 New Outbursts Mark Chesimard Trial]&quot;.

Sadiki's lawyer, Robert Bloom, attempted to have the trial dismissed and then postponed due to new &quot;revelations&quot; regarding the credibility of White, a former co-defendant working for the prosecution.&lt;ref name=&quot;licht&quot;&gt;Lichtenstein, Grace. (December 11, 1973). &quot;Judge and Defendants Clash Again as Chesimard Jury Is Chosen&quot;.

(December 13, 1973). &quot;Chesimard Trial Goes To The Jury&quot;.

(December 20, 1973). &quot;Jury Picked for New Chesimard Trial&quot;. p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; In the retrial, White testified that the six alleged robbers had saved their hair clippings to create disguises, and identified a partially obscured head and shoulder in a photo taken from a surveillance camera as Shakur's.&lt;ref name=&quot;prial3&quot;&gt;Prial, Frank J. (December 21, 1973). &quot;Mrs. Chesimard Is Ousted Again as 2d Trial for Robbery Begins&quot;. ''The New York Times'', p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Kennedy objected to this identification on the grounds that the prosecutor, assistant United States attorney Peter Truebner, had offered to [[Stipulated judgment|stipulate]] that Shakur was not depicted in any of the photographs.&lt;ref name=&quot;prial3&quot;/&gt; Although both White and Rivers testified that Shakur was wearing overalls during the robbery, the person identified as Shakur in the photograph was wearing a jacket.&lt;ref name=&quot;c&quot;/&gt; The defense attempted to discredit White on the grounds that he had spent eight months in Matteawan Hospital for the Criminally Insane in 1968, and White countered that he had faked insanity (by claiming to be [[Allah]] in front of three psychiatrists) to get transferred out of prison.&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times''. (December 22, 1973). &quot;U.S. Witness Tells Of Faking Insanity&quot;. p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shakur and four others (including Fred Hilton, Avon White, and Andrew Jackson) were indicted in the State Supreme Court in Bronx on December 31, 1973 on charges of attempting to shoot and kill two policemen—Michael O'Reilly and Roy Polliana, who were wounded but had since returned to duty—in a January 28, 1973, ambush in [[St. Albans, Queens]].&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times''.

''The New York Times'', p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; The trial was delayed until 1976,&lt;ref name=&quot;qbank&quot;/&gt; when Shakur was represented by Stanley Cohen and Evelyn Williams.&lt;ref name=&quot;qacquit&quot;/&gt; In this trial, Shakur acted as her own co-counsel and told the jury in her opening testimony:
&lt;!--The capitalization of the following quotation is correct--&gt;
:&quot;i have decided to act as co-counsel, and to make this opening statement, not because i have any illusions about my legal abilities, but, rather, because there are things that i must say to you. i have spent many days and nights behind bars thinking about this trial, this outrage. And in my own mind, only someone who has been so intimately a victim of this madness as i have can do justice to what i have to say.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;rod63&quot;/&gt;
One bank employee testified that Shakur was one of the bank robbers, but three other bank employees (including two tellers) testified that they were uncertain.&lt;ref name=&quot;qacquit&quot;/&gt; The prosecution showed surveillance photos of four of the six alleged robbers, contending that one of them was Shakur wearing a wig. Shakur was forcibly subdued and photographed by the FBI on the judge's order, after having refused to cooperate, believing that the FBI would use [[photo manipulation]]; a subsequent judge determined that the manners in which the photos were obtained violated Shakur's rights and ruled the new photos inadmissible.&lt;ref name=&quot;p81&quot;/&gt; In her autobiography, Shakur recounts being beaten, choked, and kicked on the courtroom floor by five marshals, as Williams narrated the events to ensure they would appear on the court record.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shakur, 1987, p. 161&quot;&gt;Shakur, 1987, p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after deliberation began, the jury asked to see all the photographic exhibits taken from the surveillance footage.&lt;ref name=&quot;qacquit&quot;/&gt; The jury determined that a widely circulated FBI photo allegedly showing Shakur participating in the robbery was not her.&lt;ref name=&quot;taylor&quot;&gt;Taylor, Mark Lewis.

===Turnpike shootout retrial===
[[Image:Map of New Jersey highlighting Middlesex County.svg|thumb|right|150px|Shakur's murder trial for the Turnpike shootout took place in [[New Brunswick, New Jersey|New Brunswick]], [[Middlesex County, New Jersey]], not far from the [[East Brunswick, New Jersey|East Brunswick]] site of the gunfight.]]
By the time Shakur was retried in 1977, Acoli had already been convicted of the murder of Foerster (on the theory that he fired the bullets),&lt;ref name=&quot;churchill308&quot;/&gt; and a total of 289&amp;nbsp;articles had been published in the local press relating to the various crimes with which Shakur had been accused.&lt;ref name=&quot;kirsta&quot;/&gt; Shakur's trial, along with Acoli's, would end up costing Middlesex County an estimated $1 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;december2003&quot;&gt;''AP''. (December 18, 2003). &quot;News in brief from around New Jersey&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shakur again attempted to [[Removal jurisdiction|remove]] the trial to federal court. The [[United States District Court for the District of New Jersey]] denied the petition  and also denied Skahur an injunction against the holding of trial proceedings on Fridays (the [[African American Muslims|Black Muslim Sabbath]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;wag2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Janson, Donald. (February 19, 1977). &quot;Mrs. Chesimard Bids U.S. Court Bar Trial Sessions on Her Sabbath&quot;. ''The New York Times'' p. 51, column 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times''. (January 27, 1977). &quot;Chesimard Plea Rejected&quot;. p. 76, column 2.&lt;/ref&gt; An [[en banc]] panel of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit]] affirmed.&lt;ref&gt;New Jersey v. Chesimard, 555 F.2d 63 (3d Cir. 1977) (en banc).&lt;/ref&gt;

The nine-week trial was widely publicized, and was even reported on by the [[Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union]] (TASS).&lt;ref name=&quot;kirsta&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;b159&quot;/&gt;  On March 25, 1977, back in Middlesex County, Shakur was convicted as an [[accomplice]] in the [[Felony murder|murders]] of New Jersey State Trooper Werner Foerster and Zayd Shakur and possession of weapons, as well as of [[assault]] and [[attempted murder]] of Harper.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT_1977-03-26&quot;/&gt; During the trial, hundreds of civil rights campaigners demonstrated outside of the Middlesex County courthouse each day.&lt;ref name=&quot;kirsta&quot;/&gt;

Following the 13-minute opening statement by Edward J. Barone, the first assistant Middlesex County prosecutor (directing the case for the state), William Kunstler (the chief of Shakur's defense staff) moved immediately for a mistrial, calling the eight-count grand jury indictment &quot;adversary proceeding solely and exclusively under the control of the prosecutor&quot;, whom Kunstler accused of &quot;improper prejudicial remarks&quot;; Judge Appleby, noting the frequent defense interruptions which had characterized the previous days' jury selection, denied the motion.&lt;ref name=&quot;wag&quot;/&gt; The prosecution contended that Shakur shot and killed her companion, Zayd Shakur, and &quot;executed&quot; Trooper Foerster with his own weapon.&lt;ref name=&quot;wag&quot;/&gt;

The next day the jury listened to State Police radio tapes while being provided with a printed transcript, an arrangement which was the result of &quot;hours of haggling&quot; between the defense and prosecution.&lt;ref name=&quot;wag2&quot;/&gt; The &quot;climax&quot; of the tape came when Trooper Ronald Foster, the State Police radio operator, shouted into his microphone &quot;They just shot Harper! Be on the lookout for this car!&quot; and &quot;It is a Pontiac. It's got one tail light&quot; after the wounded Harper entered into the administration building near the site of the shootout.&lt;ref name=&quot;wag2&quot;/&gt; As the tapes were played, Shakur was seated &quot;calmly and without apparent concern&quot; wearing a yellow [[turban]] and brightly colored floor-length dress over a white turtleneck sweater.&lt;ref name=&quot;wag2&quot;/&gt;

On February 23, Shakur's attorneys filed papers asking Judge Appleby to [[subpoena]] FBI Director [[Clarence M. Kelley|Clarence Kelley]], Senator [[Frank Church]] and other federal and New York law enforcement officials to testify about the Counter Intelligence Program, which they alleged was designed to harass and disrupt black activist organizations.&lt;ref name=&quot;sul&quot;&gt;Sullivan, Joseph F. (February 24, 1977). &quot;Chesimard Attorney Acts to Call Kelley; Wants F.B.I. Director and Others to Testify on Program Aimed at Harassing Activists&quot;. ''The New York Times'', p. 76, column 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Kunstler had previously been successful in subpoenaing Kelley and Church for the trials of [[American Indian Movement]] (AIM) members charged with murdering FBI agents.&lt;ref name=&quot;sul&quot;/&gt; The motion (argued March 2)—which also asked the court to require the production of memos, tapes, documents, and photographs of alleged [[COINTELPRO]] involvement from 1970 to 1973—was denied.&lt;ref name=&quot;sul&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;joy&quot;/&gt;

Shakur herself was called as a witness on March 15, the first witness called by the defense; she denied shooting either Harper or Foerster, and also denied handling a weapon during the incident. She was questioned by her own attorney, Stuart Ball, for under 40&amp;nbsp;minutes, and then cross-examined by Barone for less than two hours (see the [[Assata Shakur#Witnesses|Witnesses section]] below).&lt;ref name=&quot;sul2&quot;/&gt; Ball's questioning ended with the following exchange:
:&quot;On that night of May 2[n]d, did you shoot, kill, execute or have anything to do with the death of Trooper Werner Foerster?&quot;
:&quot;No.&quot;
:&quot;Did you shoot or assault Trooper James Harper?&quot;
:&quot;No.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;sul2&quot;&gt;Sullivan, Joseph F. (March 16, 1977). &quot;[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F0071EFE385D167493C4A81788D85F438785F9 Mrs. Chesimard, on Stand, Denies Having Weapon in Turnpike Shooting]&quot;. ''The New York Times'', p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;
Under cross-examination, Shakur was unable to explain how three clips of ammunition and 16 live shells had gotten into her shoulder bag; she also admitted to knowing that Zayd Shakur carried a gun at times, and specifically to seeing a gun sticking out of Acoli's pocket while stopping for supper at a [[Howard Johnson's]] restaurant shortly before the shooting.&lt;ref name=&quot;sul2&quot;/&gt; Shakur admitted to carrying an identification card with the name &quot;Justine Henderson&quot; in her billfold the night of the shootout, but denied using any of the aliases on the long list that Barone proceeded to read.&lt;ref name=&quot;sul2&quot;/&gt;

====Defense attorneys====
[[Image:William Kunstler.jpg|thumb|right| Lawyer [[William Kunstler]] was the chief of Shakur's defense staff.]]
Shakur's defense attorneys were [[William Kunstler]] (the chief of Shakur's defense staff),&lt;ref name=&quot;wag&quot;/&gt; Stuart Ball, Robert Bloom, [[Raymond A. Brown]],&lt;ref&gt;Berger, Joseph. [http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/12/nyregion/12brown.html &quot;Raymond A. Brown, Civil Rights Lawyer, Dies at 94&quot;], ''[[The New York Times]]'', October 11, 2009. Accessed October 12, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Stanley Cohen (who died of unknown causes early on in the Turnpike trial), Lennox Hinds, [[Florynce Kennedy]], Louis Myers, Laurence Stern, and Evelyn Williams, Shakur's aunt.&lt;ref name=&quot;nelson&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;wag&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shakur, 1987, p. 247.&lt;/ref&gt; Of these attorneys, Kunstler, Ball, Cohen, Myers, Stern and Williams appeared in court for the turnpike trial.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT_1977-03-26&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Williams, 1993, p. 162-163.&lt;/ref&gt; Kunstler became involved in Shakur's trials in 1975, when contacted by Williams, and commuted from New York City to New Brunswick every day with Stern.&lt;ref&gt;Kunstler, 1994, pp. 275–276.&lt;/ref&gt;

Her attorneys, in particular Lennox Hinds, were often held in [[contempt of court]], which the [[National Conference of Black Lawyers]] cited as an example of [[systemic bias]] in the judicial system.&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times''. (May 9, 1977). &quot;Black Legal Group Assails U.S. Courts; Lawyers at Conference Find Bias Still Exists Against Blacks Despite Constitutional Bans&quot;. p. 67, column 6.&lt;/ref&gt; The New Jersey Legal Ethics Committee also investigated complaints against Hinds for comparing Shakur's murder trial to &quot;legalized lynching&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times''. (March 2, 1977). &quot;Complaint on Lawyer&quot;. Section 2, p. 21, column 2.&lt;/ref&gt; undertaken by a &quot;[[kangaroo court]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;kirsta&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In the Matter of Hinds, 449 A.2d 483 (N.J. 1982).&lt;/ref&gt; Hinds' disciplinary proceeding reached the U.S. Supreme Court in ''[[Middlesex County Ethics Committee v. Garden State Bar Ass'n]]'' (1982).&lt;ref&gt;[[Middlesex County Ethics Committee v. Garden State Bar Ass'n]], 457 U.S. 423 (1982).&lt;/ref&gt; According to Kunstler's autobiography, the sizeable contingent of New Jersey State Troopers guarding the courthouse were under strict orders from their commander, Col. Clinton Pagano, to completely shun Shakur's defense attorneys.&lt;ref name=&quot;k276&quot;/&gt;

Judge Appleby also threatened Kunstler with dismissal and contempt of court after he delivered an October 21, 1976 speech at nearby [[Rutgers University]] that in part discussed the upcoming trial,&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Waldron|Waldron, Martin]]. (December 3, 1976). &quot;Kunstler and the Courts in a Battle On Right to Discuss Pending Trial&quot;. ''The New York Times'', Section 2, p. 21, column 1.&lt;/ref&gt; but later ruled that Kunstler could represent Shakur.&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times''. (December 15, 1976). &quot;Judge Approves Kunstler&quot;. Section 2, p. 53, column 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Until obtaining a court order, Williams was forced to strip naked and undergo a body search before each of her visits with Shakur—during which Shakur was shackled to a bed by both ankles.&lt;ref name=&quot;kirsta&quot;/&gt; Judge Appleby also refused to investigate a burglary of her defense counsel's office that resulted in the disappearance of trial documents,&lt;ref name=&quot;joy&quot;/&gt; amounting to half of the legal papers related to her case.&lt;ref&gt;Christol, 2001, p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt; Her lawyers also claimed that their offices were [[Covert listening device|bugged]].&lt;ref name=&quot;p81&quot;/&gt;

Tensions and dissention existed among the members of the defense team.  Evelyn Williams felt that she was a victim of male prejudice stating that &quot;for the second time in (her) legal career (she) became aware of the disdain with which men perceive women&quot;.  She expressed &quot;amazement and contempt&quot; for the actions of her fellow lawyers as she watched their &quot;infighting for center stage&quot; during the trial. Other members of the team were concerned that Williams was overly aggressive during her sole cross-examination to the point of passing her notes which read in part, &quot;You’re antagonizing the jury&quot; and &quot;Shut up and sit down.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Williams, 1993, p. 158-163.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Witnesses====
Sundiata Acoli, Assata Shakur, Trooper  Harper, and a New Jersey Turnpike driver who saw part of the incident were the only surviving witnesses.&lt;ref name=&quot;williamsfacts&quot;&gt;Williams, Evelyn A. (June 25, 2005). &quot;[http://assatashakur.org/appeal_case_facts_2005.htm Statement of Facts in the New Jersey trial of Assata Shakur]&quot;. The Talking Drum Collective. Retrieved on 2008-05-09.&lt;/ref&gt; Acoli did not testify or make any pre-trial statements, nor did he testify in his own trial or give a statement to the police.&lt;ref&gt;Schuppe, Jonathan. (February 8, 2004). &quot;In parole bid, Chesimard cohort denies killing trooper&quot;. ''The Star-Ledger''.&lt;/ref&gt; The driver traveling north on the turnpike testified that he had seen a State Trooper struggling with a Black man between a white vehicle and a State Trooper car, whose revolving lights illuminated the area.&lt;ref name=&quot;williamsfacts&quot;/&gt;

Shakur testified that Trooper Harper shot her after she raised her arms to comply with his demand, the second shot hitting her in the back as she was turning to avoid it, and that she fell onto the road for the duration of the gunfight before crawling back into the backseat of the Pontiac which Acoli drove {{convert|5|mi|km|0}} down the road and parked, and remained there until State Troopers dragged her onto the road.&lt;ref name=&quot;sul3&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;williamsfacts&quot;/&gt;

Trooper Harper's three official reports state that after he stopped the Pontiac, he ordered Acoli to the back of the vehicle  for Trooper Foerster—who had arrived on the scene—to examine his [[driver's license]].&lt;ref name=&quot;williamsfacts&quot;/&gt; The reports then state that after Acoli complied and as Harper was looking inside the vehicle to examine the [[vehicle registration|registration]], Trooper Foerster yelled and held up an ammunition clip, as Shakur simultaneously reached into her red [[Handbag|pocketbook]], pulled out a [[9 mm caliber|nine-millimeter weapon]] and fired at him.&lt;ref name=&quot;williamsfacts&quot;/&gt; Trooper Harper's reports then state that he ran to the rear of his car and shot at Shakur who had exited the vehicle and was firing from a crouched position next to the vehicle.&lt;ref name=&quot;williamsfacts&quot;/&gt; Under [[cross-examination]] at both Acoli and Shakur's trials, Trooper Harper admitted to having lied in these reports and in his [[Grand Jury]] testimony about Trooper Foerster yelling and showing him an ammunition clip, about seeing Shakur holding a pocketbook or a gun inside the vehicle, and about Shakur shooting at him from the car.&lt;ref name=&quot;kirsta&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;taylor&quot;/&gt; Trooper Harper retracted his previous statements and said that he had never seen Shakur with a gun, and that she did not shoot him.&lt;ref&gt;James, Joy.

====Jury====
A total of 408 potential jurors were questioned during the ''[[voir dire]]'', which concluded on February 14.&lt;ref name=&quot;wag&quot;&gt;Waggoner, Walter H. (February 16, 1977). &quot;[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10713FB3D5A177B8EDDAF0994DA405B878BF1D3 Chesimard Murder Trial Opens in New Brunswick]&quot;. ''The New York Times'', p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; All of the 15 jurors—ten women and five men—were white, and most were under thirty years old.&lt;ref name=&quot;wag&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times''. (February 15, 1977). &quot;Chesimard Jury Chosen&quot;. p. 67, column 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Five jurors had personal ties to State Troopers (one girlfriend, two nephews, and two friends).&lt;ref name=&quot;joy&quot;&gt;James, Joy. p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Browder, 2006, p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt; A sixteenth female juror was removed before the trial formally opened when it was determined that Sheriff Joseph DeMarino of Middlesex County, while a private detective several years earlier, had worked for a lawyer who represented the juror's husband.&lt;ref name=&quot;wag&quot;/&gt; Judge Appleby repeatedly denied Kunstler's requests for DeMarino to be removed from his responsibilities for the duration of the trial &quot;because he did not divulge his association with the juror&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;wag&quot;/&gt;

One prospective juror was dismissed for reading ''Target Blue'',&lt;ref&gt;Daley, Robert. 1973. ''Target Blue: An Insider's View of the N.Y.P.D.''. Delacorte Press. ISBN 978-0-440-08489-1.&lt;/ref&gt; a book by Robert Daley, a former New York City Deputy Police Commander, which dealt in part with Shakur and had been left in the jury assembly room.&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times''. (January 25, 1974). &quot;Chesimard Panelist Out For Reading Daley Book&quot;. p. 71, column 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Before the jury entered the courtroom, Judge Appleby ordered Shakur's lawyers to remove a copy of ''[[Roots: The Saga of an American Family]]'' by [[Alex Haley]] from a position on the defense counsel table easily visible to jurors.&lt;ref name=&quot;wag&quot;/&gt; The ''Roots'' [[Roots (TV miniseries)|TV miniseries]] adapted from the book and shown shortly before the trial was believed to have evoked feelings of &quot;[[White guilt|guilt and sympathy]]&quot; with many white viewers.&lt;ref name=&quot;wag&quot;/&gt;

Shakur's attorneys sought a new trial on the grounds that one jury member, John McGovern, had violated the jury's [[Jury sequestration|sequestration]] order.&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times''. (April 20, 1977). &quot;Chesimard Retrial Asked&quot;. Section 2, p. 23, column 3.&lt;/ref&gt; McGovern later sued Kunstler for [[Slander and libel|defamation]]&lt;ref&gt;Krebs, Alan.

''The New York Times'', p. 16, column 5.&lt;/ref&gt; after Judge Appleby rejected Kunstler's claim that the juror had violated the order.&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times''. May 10, 1977. &quot;Law Group Urges Grand Jury Change&quot;. p. 71, column 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Kunstler eventually publicly apologized to McGovern and paid him a small settlement.&lt;ref name=&quot;k277&quot;/&gt; Additionally, in his autobiography, Kunstler alleged that he later learned from a law enforcement agent that a New Jersey State Assembly member had addressed the jury at the hotel where they were sequestered, urging them to convict Shakur.&lt;ref name=&quot;k277&quot;&gt;Kunstler, 1994, p. 277.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the high security of the trial and the sequestration, Shakur's trial, along with Acoli's, cost Middlesex County an estimated $1 million combined.&lt;ref name=&quot;december2003&quot;/&gt; In September 1977, [[Governor of New Jersey|New Jersey Governor]] [[Brendan Byrne]] vetoed a bill to give the Morris County sheriff $7,491 for [[overtime]] expenses incurred in guarding Shakur's jury.&lt;ref&gt;Waldron, Martin. (September 5, 1977). &quot;Trenton Topics; Byrne and Bateman Stepping Up Campaigns as the Summer Fades&quot;. ''The New York Times'', p. 35, column 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Medical evidence====
A key element of Shakur's defense was [[forensic biology|medical testimony]] meant to demonstrate that she was shot with her hands up and that she would have been subsequently unable to fire a weapon. A [[neurologist]] testified that the [[median nerve]] in Shakur's right arm was severed by the second bullet, making her unable to pull a trigger.&lt;ref name=&quot;hinds&quot;/&gt; Neurosurgeon Dr. Arthur Turner Davidson, Associate Professor of Surgery at [[Albert Einstein College of Medicine]], testified that the wounds in her upper arms, armpit and chest, and severed median nerve that instantly paralyzed her right arm, would only have been caused if both arms were raised, and that to sustain such injuries while crouching and firing a weapon (as described in Trooper Harper's testimony) &quot;would be anatomically impossible&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;kirsta&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;wag4&quot;&gt;Waggoner, Walter H. (March 17, 1977). &quot;Neurosurgeon's Testimony Backs Mrs. Chesimard&quot;. ''The New York Times'', Section 2, p. 20, column 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Davidson based his testimony on an August 4, 1976 examination of Shakur and on [[X-ray]]s taken immediately after the shootout at Middlesex General Hospital.&lt;ref name=&quot;wag4&quot;/&gt; Prosecutor Barone questioned whether Davidson was qualified to make such a judgment 39&amp;nbsp;months after the injury; Barone proceeded to suggest (while a female Sheriff's attendant acted out his suggestion) that Shakur was struck in the right arm and collar bone and &quot;then spun around by the impact of the bullet so an immediate second shot entered the fleshy part of her upper left arm&quot; to which Davidson replied &quot;Impossible.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;wag4&quot;/&gt;
[[Image:Illu pectoral girdles.png|thumb|right|Shakur's broken [[clavicle]] was a key element of her defense, and the implications of her injury for the differing accounts of the shootout were points of contention.]]
Dr. David Spain, a [[pathologist]] from [[Brookdale Community College]], testified that her bullet scars as well as X-rays supported her claim that her arms were raised, and that there was &quot;no conceivable way&quot; the first bullet could have hit Shakur's [[clavicle]] if her arm was down.&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan, Joseph F. (March 18, 1977). &quot;[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F1091EFC385D167493CAA81788D85F438785F9 Doctor Testifies On Bullet Scars in Chesimard Trial]&quot;.

ISBN 0-631-21007-5. p. 279.&lt;/ref&gt;

Judge Appleby eventually cut off funds for any further expert defense testimony.&lt;ref name=&quot;kirsta&quot;/&gt; Shakur, in her autobiography, and Williams, in ''Inadmissible Evidence'', both claim that it was difficult to find expert witnesses for the trial, not only because of the financial expense, but also because most forensic and ballistic specialists declined on the grounds of a [[conflict of interest]] when approached because they routinely performed such work for law enforcement officials.&lt;ref&gt;Perkins, 2000, pp. 80–81.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other evidence====
[[Neutron activation analysis]] administered after the shootout showed no [[gun powder]] residue on Shakur's fingers; her [[fingerprint]]s were not found on any weapon at the scene, according to forensic analysis performed at the [[Trenton, New Jersey]] crime lab and the FBI crime labs in [[Washington, D.C.]]&lt;ref name=&quot;howell&quot;&gt;Howell, Ron. (June 7, 1998). &quot;Revolutionary on Ice: Assata Shakur's Cuban Exile&quot;. ''Newsday''.&lt;/ref&gt; According to tape recordings and police reports made several hours after the shoot-out, when Harper returned on foot to the administration building 200&amp;nbsp;yards (183&amp;nbsp;m) away, he did not report Foerster's presence at the scene; no one at headquarters knew of Foerster's involvement in the shoot-out until his body was discovered beside his patrol car, more than an hour later.&lt;ref name=&quot;kirsta&quot;/&gt;

====Conviction and sentencing====
On March 24, the jurors listened for 45&amp;nbsp;minutes to a rereading of testimony of the State Police chemist regarding the blood found at the scene, on the LeMans, and Shakur's clothing.&lt;ref name=&quot;sul3&quot;/&gt; That night, the second night of jury deliberation, the jury asked Judge Appleby to repeat his instructions regarding the four assault charges 30&amp;nbsp;minutes before retiring for the night, which lead to speculation that the jury had decided in Shakur's favor on the remaining charges, especially the two counts of murder.&lt;ref name=&quot;sul3&quot;&gt;Sullivan, Joseph E.

''The New York Times'', p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; Appleby reiterated that the jury must consider separately the four assault charges (atrocious assault and battery, assault on a police officer acting in the line of duty, [[assault with a deadly weapon]], and assault with intent to kill), each of which carried a total maximum penalty of 33&amp;nbsp;years in prison.&lt;ref name=&quot;sul3&quot;/&gt; The other charges were: first-degree murder (of Foerster), second-degree murder (of Zayd Shakur), illegal possession of a weapon, and armed robbery (related to Foerster's service revolver).&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT_1977-03-26&quot;/&gt; The jury also asked Appleby to repeat the definitions of &quot;[[intent (law)|intent]]&quot; and &quot;[[reasonable doubt]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;sul3&quot;/&gt;

Shakur was convicted on all eight counts: two murder charges, and six assault charges.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT_1977-03-26&quot;/&gt; The prosecution did not need to prove that Shakur fired the shots that killed either Trooper Foerster or Zayd Shakur: being an accomplice to murder carries an equivalent life sentence under New Jersey law.&lt;ref name=&quot;kirsta&quot;&gt;Kirsta, Alix.

At the post trial press conference Kunstler blamed the verdict on racism stating that &quot;the white element was there to destroy her.&quot;  When asked by a reporter that if that were the case why did it take the jury 24 hours to reach a verdict Kunstler replied, &quot;That was just a pretense.&quot; A few minutes later the prosecutor Barone disagreed with Kunstler’s assessment saying the trial’s outcome was decided &quot;completely on the facts.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT_1977-03-26&quot;/&gt;

At Shakur's sentencing hearing on April 25, Appleby sentenced her to 26 to 33&amp;nbsp;years in state prison (10 to 12 for the four counts of assault, 12 to 15 for robbery, 2 to 3 for armed robbery, plus 2 to 3 for aiding and abetting the murder of Foerster) which was to be served consecutively with her [[Mandatory sentencing|mandatory life sentence]]; however, Appleby dismissed the second-degree murder of Zayd Shakur, as the [[New Jersey Supreme Court]] had recently narrowed the application of the law.&lt;ref name=&quot;sentencing&quot;&gt;Sullivan, Joseph F.

===Murder dismissal===
In October 1977, New York State Superior Court Justice John Starkey dismissed murder and robbery charges against Shakur related to the death of Richard Nelson during a December 28, 1972, hold-up of a Brooklyn social club, ruling that the state had [[Statute of limitations|delayed too long]] in bringing her to trial, saying &quot;People have constitutional rights, and you can't shuffle them around.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;seigel&quot;&gt;Seigel, Max H.
