'''Ronnie Lee Gardner''' (January 16, 1961 – June 18, 2010) was an American criminal who received the [[capital punishment|death penalty]] for murder in 1985, and was [[execution by firing squad|executed by firing squad]] by the state of [[Utah]] in 2010. Gardner's case spent nearly 25&amp;nbsp;years in the court system, prompting the [[Utah House of Representatives]] to introduce legislation to limit the number of appeals in capital cases.&lt;ref name=&quot;Deseret-20101020-limit&quot;&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Deseret News|last=Romboy|first=Dennis|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/700075120/Utah-lawmaker-aims-to-limit-death-row-inmate-appeals.html|title=Utah lawmaker aims to limit death-row inmate appeals|accessdate=2010-10-24|date=2010-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1984, Gardner killed Melvyn John Otterstrom during a robbery in [[Salt Lake City]]. While being transported in April 1985 to a court hearing for the homicide, he fatally shot attorney Michael Burdell in an unsuccessful escape attempt. Convicted of two counts of murder, Gardner was sentenced to [[life imprisonment]] for the first count and received the death penalty for the second.&lt;ref name=&quot;SLT-20100614&quot;&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[The Salt Lake Tribune]]|url=http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/news/49705008-78/gardner-events-shooting-1985.html.csp|title=Ronnie Lee Gardner: A dark and deadly path|last=Carlisle|first=Nate|accessdate=2010-06-22|date=2010-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gadsden-19850402-courthouse&quot;&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[The Gadsden Times]]|agency=[[Associated Press]]|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=XLgfAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=rNcEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2928,108585&amp;dq=ronnie+lee+gardner+inmate&amp;hl=en|title=Convict Shoots Way Out Of Courthouse|page=A2|accessdate=2010-09-25|date=1985-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The state adopted more stringent security measures as a result of the incident at the courthouse.&lt;ref name=&quot;Deseret-20100615-security&quot;&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Deseret News|last=Reavy|first=Pat|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/700040414/Security-scarce-at-courthouse-when-Ronnie-Lee-Gardner-murdered-attorney.html|title=Security scarce at courthouse when Ronnie Lee Gardner murdered attorney|pages=1–2|accessdate=2010-10-01|date=2010-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; While held at [[Utah State Prison]], Gardner was charged with another capital crime for stabbing an inmate in 1994.

==Life==
Ronnie Lee Gardner was born in Salt Lake City, Utah and was the youngest of Dan and Ruth Gardner's seven children. Dan was a heavy drinker who left the household to start another family while Ronnie was a toddler; Dan and Ruth divorced when Ronnie was 18&amp;nbsp;months old. Six months later, Ronnie was found malnourished and wandering the streets alone in a diaper. Child welfare workers filed a &quot;failure to care&quot; petition and took him into custody, but later returned him to his mother. Gardner's relationship with his father was tumultuous; Dan did not believe he was Gardner's biological father and frequently told his son of his belief. According to Gardner, he was raised by an older sister, and was sexually abused by his siblings.&lt;ref name=&quot;SLT-20100614&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Deseret-20100612-punishment&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Donaldson|first=Amy|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/700039868/Crime-and-punishment-for-Ronnie-Lee-Gardner.html|title=Crime and punishment for Ronnie Lee Gardner|newspaper=[[Deseret News]]|pages=1–6|accessdate=2010-10-02|date=2010-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes he and his sister Bonnie would run away and seek refuge in a &quot;[[hobo]] camp.&quot; By the age of 10, Gardner was addicted to drugs and permitted access to alcohol. He and his brother Randy were arrested for stealing cowboy boots and taken into [[juvenile detention]]. Gardner recalled with distress that his father Dan came to take his brother Randy home and left him behind.&lt;ref name=&quot;Deseret-20100612-punishment&quot; /&gt;

===Early institutionalization===
Gardner's mother married Bill Lucas, who had been incarcerated in Wyoming in 1968.&lt;ref name=&quot;Deseret-20100612-punishment&quot; /&gt; The Gardner-Lucas family eventually had nine children. Gardner admired Lucas, who used his stepsons as lookouts while burgling homes. By his early teens, Gardner had been held in detention at a series of institutions, including an [[involuntary commitment]] at [[Utah State Hospital]] in [[Provo, Utah|Provo]].&lt;ref name=&quot;SLT-20100614&quot;/&gt; Gardner was small as a boy, and described that he had to fight to defend himself and earn respect. In Gardner's own words, &quot;I was a nasty little bugger.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Deseret-20100612-punishment&quot; /&gt;

While held at [[Utah State Industrial School]] in [[Ogden, Utah|Ogden]], Gardner was visited by Jack Statt, a man who was living with his brother Randy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Deseret-20100612-punishment&quot; /&gt; According to Gardner, Statt met Randy at a bus stop and paid him $25 for oral sex.&lt;ref name=&quot;SLT-20100614&quot;/&gt; When released from the school in 1975, Gardner stayed with Statt. Although social workers noted that the men in the household were dressed like women, Statt officially became a [[foster care|foster parent]] to Gardner and his brother. Gardner said that Statt performed sex acts on them and explained, &quot;I thought life like that was normal.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Deseret-20100612-punishment&quot; /&gt; Gardner stated in a psychological evaluation that he worked as a [[prostitute]] while living with Statt, who was profiled by the psychologists as a [[pedophilia|pedophile]]. Gardner said his time in foster care was the most stable period of his life, stating, &quot;Jack was a good man, and he tried to help us out.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;SLT-20100614&quot; /&gt;

While Gardner intermittently continued to go to the industrial school,&lt;ref name=&quot;Deseret-20100612-punishment&quot; /&gt; he met Debra Bischoff at a Salt Lake City apartment complex where his mother lived. Bischoff described him as: &quot;Very caring. He never put me in the rough situations he was in throughout his life. He sheltered me from that stuff.&quot; Gardner had a daughter&lt;!--, Brandie,--&gt; in May 1977 and a son&lt;!--, Daniel,--&gt; in February 1980 with Bischoff, but was convicted of robbery and sent to [[Utah State Prison]] in the same month his son was born.&lt;ref name=&quot;SLT-20100614&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SLT-20100617-goodbye&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last= LaPlante |first=Matthew D.|newspaper=The Salt Lake Tribune|url=http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/home/49784115-76/gardner-family-members-brandie.html.csp|title=For family, it’s a final goodbye|accessdate=2010-10-04|date=2010-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gardner successfully escaped the prison's [[Prison#Security levels|maximum security]] unit on April 19, 1981, and was shot in the neck while attempting to kill a man who he believed had raped Bischoff.&lt;ref name=&quot;Deseret-20100612-punishment&quot; /&gt; In February 1983, he was identified as a ringleader in a disturbance in which inmates barricaded a cell block and started fires.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gadsden-19850402-courthouse&quot; /&gt;

On August 6, 1984, Gardner escaped from custody at the [[University of Utah Hospital]] after faking an illness by vomiting. He attacked transportation officer Don Leavitt and forced him to unlock his shackles by telling him: &quot;I guess you know if that doctor comes back, I'll have to kill you both.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gadsden-19850402-courthouse&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Deseret-20100612-punishment&quot; /&gt; In the course of the escape, Gardner struck Leavitt so hard that he needed wires to reconstruct his face.&lt;ref name=&quot;SLT-20100614&quot; /&gt; Gardner forced a medical student named Mike Lynch to take him from the premises on a motorcycle while pointing a gun into his back.&lt;ref name=&quot;Deseret-20100612-punishment&quot; /&gt; On August 11, a letter carrier found Leavitt's firearm in a mailbox with a note from Gardner that said, &quot;Here’s the gun and wallet taken from the guard at the hospital. I don’t want to hurt no one else. I just want to be free.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;SLT-20100614&quot; /&gt;

===Murders===
During the night of October 9, 1984, Gardner robbed the Cheers Tavern in Salt Lake City. While under the influence of cocaine, he shot bartender Melvyn John Otterstrom in the face, killing him.&lt;ref name=&quot;SLT-20100614&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SLT-20100916-destroyed&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Smart|first=Christopher|newspaper=The Salt Lake Tribune|url=http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/home/49704873-76/jason-kathy-melvyn-gardner.html.csp|title=‘Gardner has destroyed enough lives’|pages=1–3|accessdate=2010-10-24|date=2010-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Otterstrom's cousin Craig Watson stated that the robbery &quot;gained less than $100.&quot; Family members said Gardner attended Otterstrom's funeral and pretended to be a childhood friend.&lt;ref name=&quot;Deseret-20100612-punishment&quot; /&gt; Following a tip, police apprehended Gardner three weeks later at the home of his cousin. Gardner said that the shooting occurred because Otterstrom put up a fight, but investigators did not find any evidence to support this claim.&lt;ref name=&quot;SLT-20100614&quot; /&gt; Gardner was held in custody in lieu of $1.5&amp;nbsp;million bail.&lt;ref name=&quot;CCP-2010-RLG&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.clarkprosecutor.org/html/death/US/gardner1217.htm|title=Ronnie Lee Gardner|publisher=[[Clark County, Indiana|Clark County]] Prosecutor|accessdate=2010-10-02|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; His [[crime scene getaway|getaway driver]] was identified as Darcy Perry McCoy, who testified against him in court.&lt;ref name=&quot;Deseret-20100615-accomplice&quot;&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Deseret News|last=Falk|first=Aaron|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/700040635/Ronnie-Lee-Gardner-identifies-2nd-accomplice-in-courthouse-escape-attempt.html|title=Ronnie Lee Gardner identifies 2nd accomplice in courthouse escape attempt|accessdate=2010-06-23|date=2010-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During trial proceedings for the Otterstrom murder on April 2, 1985, Gardner attempted to escape from custody with a revolver that had been smuggled into the Metropolitan Hall of Justice at Salt Lake City.&lt;ref name=&quot;Deseret-20100615-accomplice&quot; /&gt; Jim Kleine of the Salt Lake City Fire Department believed that the gun was passed to Gardner as he was being escorted into the courthouse from the underground parking lot.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gadsden-19850402-courthouse&quot; /&gt; Gardner was immediately shot in the chest by guard Luther Hensley.&lt;ref name=&quot;SLT-20100614&quot; /&gt; Gardner then wounded unarmed bailiff George &quot;Nick&quot; Kirk in the abdomen.&lt;ref name=&quot;SHJ-19850403-fatal&quot;&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[Spartanburg Herald-Journal]]|agency=Associated Press|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=UTwsAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=R84EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6642,366011&amp;dq=ronnie-lee-gardner&amp;hl=en|title=Escape Try Ends in Fatal Shooting|page=A10|accessdate=2010-09-25|date=1985-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; After running to the courtroom archives, Gardner confronted attorneys Robert Macri and Michael Burdell. According to Macri, Gardner initially pointed the gun at him and changed aim to Burdell,&lt;ref name=&quot;Deseret-19851023-guilty&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Thompson|first=Jan|newspaper=Deseret News|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=EpQpAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=7YMDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6569,3478591&amp;dq=ronnie-lee-gardner&amp;hl=en|title=Gardner found guilty of murder|page=B1|accessdate=2010-09-25|date=1985-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; who had been doing [[pro bono]] work for his church. Burdell yelled, &quot;Oh, my God,&quot; when Gardner shot him in the eye. Gardner made his way outside the building, where he was surrounded by dozens of police officers. Gardner threw the gun away, dropped and yelled: &quot;Don’t shoot, I don’t have a gun.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;SLT-20100614&quot; /&gt;

Gardner was taken to the University of Utah Health Services Center where he was listed in [[serious condition]], but recovered.

On September 25, 1994, Gardner got drunk from consuming alcohol, which he fermented in his own prison cell sink, and stabbed inmate Richard &quot;Fats&quot; Thomas with a [[Shiv (weapon)|shiv]] fashioned from a pair of sunglasses. Thomas suffered nine puncture wounds to his face, mouth, arm and chest that were life-threatening, but made a full recovery. Though Thomas had survived the stabbing, Gardner was charged with another [[capital punishment|capital crime]] under a 1974 Utah law reserved for prison attacks by first-degree felony inmates.&lt;ref name=&quot;Deseret-19950209-constitutionality&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Parkinson|first=Chip|newspaper=Deseret News|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/403500/CONSTITUTIONALITY-AT-ISSUE-IN-2ND-DEATH-PENALTY.html|title=Constitutionality at issue in 2nd death penalty|pages=B1–B2|accessdate=2010-09-25|date=1995-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was no precedent in the United States for a death penalty that was carried out for such a crime.

In February 1996, Gardner threatened to sue to force the state of Utah to execute him by firing squad. He had told a judge in a 1991 hearing that he was motivated by his children to seek lethal injection, but later changed his mind as they became older. He said that he preferred the firing squad because of his &quot;Mormon heritage.&quot; Gardner also felt that lawmakers were trying to eliminate the firing squad, in opposition to popular opinion in Utah, because of concern over the state's image in the upcoming [[2002 Winter Olympics]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Deseret-19960209-threatens&quot; /&gt;

In 1998, the old Metropolitan Hall of Justice was vacated and replaced by the multimillion-dollar [[Scott M. Matheson (Utah governor)|Scott M. Matheson]] Courthouse. Gardner's deadly escape attempt in 1985 was blamed on the open access and light security of the previous building and greatly influenced the tighter security measures adopted by Salt Lake City's new courthouse.

In 2007, U.S. federal judge [[Tena Campbell]] rejected Gardner's appeal that his attorneys were inadequate because they were unable to prove that he did not mean to kill his victim.

At Gardner's [[commutation of sentence|commutation]] hearing on June 10, 2010, lawyers and medical experts in his defense argued whether [[meningitis]] contracted at the age of 4 had damaged his brain.

Assistant state attorney general Tom Brunker argued against clemency, stating: &quot;Mr. Gardner was sentenced to death and earned that death penalty because of his unflagging history of violent crime.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Deseret-20100610-example&quot; /&gt; The family of the late George &quot;Nick&quot; Kirk recounted how his being shot by Gardner affected their lives and ultimately shortened Kirk's life.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In the mid-19th century, when rhetorical, emotional oratory was common, some church members and leaders used strong language that included notions of people making restitution for their sins by giving up their own lives.

However, so-called &quot;[[blood atonement]],&quot; by which individuals would be required to shed their own blood to pay for their sins, is not a doctrine of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. We believe in and teach the infinite and all-encompassing atonement of Jesus Christ, which makes forgiveness of sin and salvation possible for all people.&lt;ref name=&quot;Deseret-20100617-atonement&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Other denominations voiced their opposition to the use of capital punishment. Reverend David Henry of the First Baptist Church of Salt Lake City said, &quot;Violence breeds violence... It doesn’t work. It's ineffective, and it's brutalizing all of us.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;SLT-20100618-protesters&quot; /&gt; Cardinal [[Keith Michael Patrick O'Brien|Keith O'Brien]] of the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]] later used Gardner's case to describe the &quot;culture of vengeance&quot; in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;ch-201000809&quot; /&gt;

==Execution==
The [[Utah Department of Corrections]] provided Gardner's attorney Andrew Parnes with documentation about executions by firing squad and lethal injection.

He was placed in restraints on a black metal chair with a hood covering his head. Sandbags were arranged around him to absorb ricochets. The firing squad was made up of five anonymous volunteers who were certified police officers. The officers stood about {{convert|25|ft|m}} from Gardner, aiming at a white target positioned over his heart. One of their [[.30-30 Winchester|.30-caliber Winchester]] rifles was selected at random and loaded with a non-lethal [[wax bullet]] so that they would not know with certainty who fired the fatal shots.&lt;ref name=&quot;DailyTelegraph-20100618-executed&quot; /&gt; According to the [[Utah Department of Corrections]], the squad used a countdown [[Military cadence|cadence]] beginning with five and simultaneously firing right before two.&lt;ref name=&quot;CSM-20100618-executed&quot; /&gt; A media witness observed that Gardner reacted to being shot by briefly clenching and raising his fist.
