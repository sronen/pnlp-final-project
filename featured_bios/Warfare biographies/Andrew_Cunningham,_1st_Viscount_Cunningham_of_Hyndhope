[[Admiral of the Fleet (Royal Navy)|Admiral of the Fleet]] '''Andrew Browne Cunningham, 1st Viscount Cunningham of Hyndhope''' [[Order of the Thistle|KT]], [[Order of the Bath|GCB]], [[Order of Merit|OM]], [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]] and [[medal bar|two Bars]] (7 January 1883 – 12 June 1963), was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[admiral]] of the [[World War II|Second World War]]. Cunningham was widely known by his [[List of military figures by nickname|nickname]], &quot;'''ABC'''&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Michael |last=Simpson|title=Cunningham, Andrew Browne, Viscount Cunningham of Hyndhope (1883–1963)|work=[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|month=September|year=2004; online edition, January 2008|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/32665|accessdate=20 May 2010|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/32665}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cunningham was born in [[Rathmines]] in the southside of [[Dublin]] on 7 January 1883. After starting his schooling in Dublin and Edinburgh, he enrolled at a naval academy, at the age of ten, beginning his association with the [[Royal Navy]]. After passing out of [[Britannia Royal Naval College|Britannia Royal Naval College, Dartmouth]], in 1898, he progressed rapidly in rank. He commanded a destroyer during the [[World War I|First World War]] and through most of the interwar period. He was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Order]] and two [[Medal bar|Bar]]s, for his performance during this time, specifically for his actions in the [[Naval operations in the Dardanelles Campaign|Dardanelles]] and in the [[Baltic states|Baltics]].

In the Second World War, as [[Commander-in-Chief]], [[Mediterranean Fleet (United Kingdom)|Mediterranean Fleet]], Cunningham led British naval forces to victory in several critical [[Battle of the Mediterranean|Mediterranean naval battles]]. These included the [[Battle of Taranto|attack on Taranto]] in 1940, the first completely all-aircraft naval attack in history,&lt;ref name = RNtaranto&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/server/show/conWebDoc.1593|title=Taranto 1940|publisher = [[Royal Navy]]|date = 13 June 2007 |accessdate=13 June 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070108141316/http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/server/show/conWebDoc.1593 |archivedate = 8 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Battle of Cape Matapan]] in 1941. Cunningham controlled the defence of the [[Malta Convoys|Mediterranean supply lines]] through Alexandria, Gibraltar, and the [[Malta Convoys|key chokepoint of Malta]]. The admiral also directed naval support for the various major allied landings in the Western Mediterranean [[Littoral zone|littoral]]. In 1943, Cunningham was promoted to [[First Sea Lord]], a position he held until his retirement in 1946. He was ennobled as Baron Cunningham of Hyndhope in 1945 and made Viscount Cunningham of Hyndhope the following year. After his retirement Cunningham enjoyed several ceremonial positions including [[Lord High Steward]] at the [[Coronation of the British monarch|coronation]] of [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] in 1953. He died on 12 June 1963.

==Childhood==
Cunningham was born at [[Rathmines]], [[County Dublin]], on 7 January 1883,&lt;ref&gt;Michael Simpson p.1&lt;/ref&gt; the third of five children born to Professor Daniel Cunningham and his wife Elizabeth Cumming Browne, both of Scottish ancestry.&lt;ref name =1901Census&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.census.nationalarchives.ie/reels/nai003810418/|title=D Cunningham Household Census Return, 1901|accessdate=18 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alan Cunningham|General Sir Alan Cunningham]] was his younger brother.&lt;ref&gt;Cunningham, Andrew Chap.1&lt;/ref&gt; His parents were described as having a &quot;strong intellectual and clerical tradition,&quot; both [[grandfather]]s having been in the clergy. His father was a Professor of [[Anatomy]] at [[Trinity College, Dublin]],&lt;ref name =1901Census/&gt; whilst his mother stayed at home. Elizabeth Browne, with the aid of servants and [[governess]]es, oversaw much of his upbringing; as a result he reportedly had a &quot;warm and close&quot; relationship with her. After a short introduction to schooling in Dublin he was sent to [[Edinburgh Academy]], where he stayed with his aunts Doodles and Connie May.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Cunningham p. 9–14&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of ten he received a telegram from his father asking &quot;would you like to go into the Navy?&quot; At the time, the family had no maritime connections, and Cunningham only had a vague interest in the sea. Nevertheless he replied &quot;Yes, I should like to be an Admiral&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Cunningham p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; He was then sent to a Naval Preparatory School, [[Stubbington House]], which specialised in sending pupils through the [[Britannia Royal Naval College|Dartmouth]] entrance examinations.&lt;ref name=Histwar&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historyofwar.org/articles/people_cunningham.html|title=Cunningham biography|publisher = Historyof war|date = 11 June 2007 |accessdate=11 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cunningham passed the exams showing particular strength in mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Simpson p.2–3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early naval career==
[[File:United Kingdom - England - London - Greenwich - Old Royal Naval College.jpg|thumb|left|The Old Royal Naval College, Greenwich where Cunningham took a Sub-Lieutenant course]]Along with 64 other men Cunningham joined the [[Royal Navy]] as a cadet aboard the training ship [[HMS Prince of Wales (1860)|HMS ''Britannia'']] in 1897.&lt;ref name=Simpsonp.2&gt;Michael Simpson Chap1 p.2&lt;/ref&gt; One of his classmates was future Admiral of the Fleet [[James Fownes Somerville]].&lt;ref name=Dartarc/&gt; Cunningham was known for his lack of enthusiasm for field sports, although he did enjoy golf and spent most of his spare time &quot;messing around in boats&quot;.&lt;ref name=Simpsonp.2/&gt; He said in his memoirs that by the end of his course he was &quot;anxious to seek adventure at sea&quot;. Although he committed numerous minor misdemeanors, he still obtained a ''very good'' for conduct.&lt;ref name=Simpsonp.2/&gt; He passed out tenth in April, 1898, with first-class-marks for mathematics and [[seamanship]].&lt;ref name=Dartarc&gt;Dartmouth archives 1897–1899 cited by Michael Simpson in the &quot;References&quot; section, p.283&lt;/ref&gt;

His first service was as a [[Midshipman]] on [[HMS Doris (1896)|HMS ''Doris'']] in 1899, serving at the [[Cape of Good Hope Station]] when the [[Second Boer War]] began.&lt;ref name=NavalMuseum&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.royalnavalmuseum.org/info_sheets_andrew_cunningham.htm |title=Cunningham information sheet |publisher = Royal Naval Museum|date = 11 June 2007 |accessdate=11 June 2007}}; quote from source cited.&lt;/ref&gt; By February, 1900, he had transferred into the [[Naval Brigade]] as he believed &quot;this promised opportunities for bravery and distinction in action.&quot; Cunningham then saw action at Pretoria and [[Battle of Diamond Hill|Diamond Hill]] as part of the Naval Brigade. He then went back to sea, as Midshipman in [[HMS Hannibal (1896)|HMS ''Hannibal'']] in December, 1901. The following November he joined the [[protected cruiser]] [[HMS Diadem (1896)|HMS ''Diadem'']]. Beginning in 1902, Cunningham took [[Sub-Lieutenant]] courses at [[HMNB Portsmouth|Portsmouth]] and [[Royal Naval College, Greenwich|Greenwich]]; he served as Sub-Lieutenant on the [[battleship]] [[HMS Implacable (1899)|HMS ''Implacable'']],&lt;ref name=NavalMuseum/&gt; in the Mediterranean, for six months in 1903. In September 1903, he was transferred to [[HMS Locust (1896)|HMS ''Locust'']] to serve as second-in-command. He was promoted to [[Lieutenant]] in 1904, and served on several vessels during the next four years. In 1908, he was awarded his first command, [[Torpedo boat|HM Torpedo Boat No. 14]].&lt;ref name=NavalMuseum/&gt;

==First World War==
[[File:Distinghuised Service Order correct.jpg|80px|thumb|right|Distinguished Service Order]] Cunningham was a highly decorated officer during the First World War, receiving the [[Distinguished Service Order|Distinguished Service Order (DSO)]] and two [[Medal bar|bars]]. In 1911 he was given command of the [[destroyer]] [[HMS Scorpion (1910)|HMS ''Scorpion'']], which he commanded throughout the war. In 1914, ''Scorpion'' was involved in the shadowing of the [[German Navy|German]] [[battlecruiser]] and [[cruiser]] [[Pursuit of Goeben and Breslau|SMS ''Goeben'' and SMS ''Breslau'']]. This operation was intended to find and destroy the ''Goeben'' and the ''Breslau'' but the German warships evaded the British fleet,&lt;ref name=Mooreheadchap1&gt;Moorehead, Alan p11–28&lt;/ref&gt; and passed through the [[Dardanelles]] to reach [[Constantinople]]. Their arrival contributed to the [[Ottoman Empire]] joining the [[Central Powers]] in November 1914.&lt;ref name =Mooreheadchap1/&gt; Though a bloodless &quot;battle&quot;, the failure of the British pursuit had enormous political and military ramifications—in the words of [[Winston Churchill]], they brought &quot;more slaughter, more misery and more ruin than has ever before been borne within the compass of a ship.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Tuchman, Barbara p.154&lt;/ref&gt;

Cunningham stayed on in the Mediterranean and in 1915 ''Scorpion'' was involved in the attack on the [[Naval operations in the Dardanelles Campaign|Dardanelles]]. For his performance Cunningham was rewarded with promotion to [[Commander]] and the award of the Distinguished Service Order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iwm.org.uk/upload/package/2/gallipoli/pdf_files/Galnaval.pdf |format=PDF |title=Gallipoli Campaign |publisher = [[Imperial War Museum]]|date = 13 June 2007 |accessdate=13 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cunningham spent much of 1916 on routine patrols. In late 1916, he was engaged in convoy protection, a duty he regarded as mundane.&lt;ref name =Simpsonp.13&gt;Michael Simpson p.13&lt;/ref&gt; He had no contact with German U-boats during this time, on which he commented; &quot;The immunity of my convoys was probably due to sheer luck&quot;.&lt;ref name=Simpsonp.13/&gt; Convinced that the Mediterranean held few offensive possibilities he requested to sail for home. ''Scorpion'' paid off on 21 January 1918. In his seven years as captain of the ''Scorpion'', Cunningham had developed a reputation for first class seamanship.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Simpson p.14&lt;/ref&gt; He was transferred by [[Roger Keyes, 1st Baron Keyes|Vice-Admiral Roger Keyes]] to [[HMS Termagent|HMS ''Termagent'']], part of Keyes' [[Dover Patrol]], in April 1918.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.dover-kent.co.uk/history/ww1a_dover_patrol.htm |title= History of Dover|publisher = Dover Information website |date = 13 June 2007 |accessdate=13 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for his actions with the Dover Patrol, he was awarded a [[Medal bar|bar]] to his DSO the following year.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Simpson p.14–15&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interwar years==
===Association with Cowan===
Cunningham saw much action in the interwar years. In 1919, he commanded the [[S class destroyer (1916)|S class destroyer]] [[HMS Seafire (1918)|HMS ''Seafire'']], on duty in the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]]. The [[Communist]]s, the [[White movement|White Russian]]s, several varieties of Latvian nationalists, Germans, and the [[Poles]]  were trying to control [[Latvia]]; the [[Her Majesty's Government|British Government]] had recognised Latvia's independence after the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]]. It was on this voyage that Cunningham first met [[Admiral (United Kingdom)|Admiral]] [[Walter Cowan]]. Cunningham was impressed by Cowan's methods, specifically his navigation of the potentially dangerous seas, with thick fog and [[Naval mine|minefields]] threatening the fleet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hmshood.com/crew/biography/cowan_bio.htm |title=Cowan biography|publisher =HMS Hood association |date = 11 June 2007 |accessdate=11 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout several potentially problematic encounters with German forces trying to undermine the Latvian independence movement, Cunningham exhibited &quot;good self control and judgement&quot;. Cowan was quoted as saying &quot;Commander Cunningham has on one occasion after another acted with unfailing promptitude and decision, and has proved himself an Officer of exceptional valour and unerring resolution.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, Michael, Chap 3, Cowans Protege, p.17–18&lt;/ref&gt;

For his actions in the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]], Cunningham was awarded a second bar to his DSO,&lt;ref name=NavalMuseum/&gt; and promoted to [[Captain (Royal Navy)|Captain]] in 1920. On his return from the Baltic in 1922, he was appointed Captain of the [[List of squadrons and flotillas of the Royal Navy|British 6th Destroyer Flotilla]]. Further commands were to follow; the [[List of squadrons and flotillas of the Royal Navy|British 1st Destroyer Flotilla]] in 1923, and the destroyer base, [[HMS Lochinvar (shore establishment)|HMS ''Lochinvar'']], at [[Port Edgar]] in the [[Firth of Forth]], from 1927–1926. Cunningham renewed his association with Vice Admiral Cowan between 1926 and 1928, when Cunningham was [[Captain of the fleet|Flag Captain and Chief Staff Officer]] to Cowan while serving on the [[North America and West Indies Station|North America and West Indies Squadron]]. In his memoirs Cunningham made clear the &quot;high regard&quot;&lt;ref name=Cunnbio262&gt;Andrew Cunningham p. 262&lt;/ref&gt; in which he held Cowan, and the many lessons he learned from him during their two periods of service together.&lt;ref name=Cunnbio262/&gt; The late 1920s found Cunningham back in the UK participating in courses at the Army's [[Senior Officers' School]] at [[Sheerness]], as well as at the [[Royal College of Defence Studies|Imperial Defence College]].&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, Michael p.25&lt;/ref&gt; While Cunningham was at the Imperial Defence College, in 1929, he married Nona Byatt (daughter of Horace Byatt, MA; the couple had no children). After a year at the College, Cunningham was given command of his first big ship; the battleship [[HMS Rodney (29)|HMS ''Rodney'']].&lt;ref name=NavalMuseum/&gt; Eighteen months later, he was appointed [[Commodore (Royal Navy)|Commodore]] of [[HMS Pembroke]], the Royal Naval barracks at [[Chatham Dockyard|Chatham]].

===Promoted to Flag Rank===
[[File:British Battlecruiser HMS Hood circa 1932.jpg|thumb|left|HMS ''Hood'']]
In September 1932, Cunningham was promoted to [[Flag officer#United Kingdom|flag rank]], and [[Aide-de-camp|Aide-de-Camp]] to the [[George V of the United Kingdom|King]]. He was appointed [[Rear admiral|Rear Admiral]] (Destroyers) in the Mediterranean in December 1933 and was made a [[Order of the Bath|Companion of the Bath]] in 1934. Having hoisted his flag in the light [[cruiser]] [[HMS Coventry (1916)|HMS ''Coventry'']], Cunningham used his time to practice [[Naval fleet|fleet]] handling for which he was to receive much praise in the Second World War.&lt;ref name=Cunnbio158&gt;Cunningham, Andrew p.158&lt;/ref&gt; There were also fleet exercises in the [[Atlantic Ocean]] in which he learnt the skills and values of night actions that he would also use to great effect in years to come.&lt;ref name=Cunnbio158/&gt;

On his promotion to [[Vice admiral (United States)|Vice Admiral]] in July 1936, due to the [[London Naval Treaty|interwar naval policy]], further active employment seemed remote. However, a year later due to the illness of [[Geoffrey Blake (Royal Navy officer)|Sir Geoffrey Blake]], Cunningham assumed the combined appointment of commander of the [[Battlecruiser Squadron (United Kingdom)|British Battlecruiser Squadron]] and second-in-command of the [[Mediterranean Fleet (United Kingdom)|Mediterranean Fleet]], with [[HMS Hood (51)|HMS ''Hood'']] as his [[flagship]].&lt;ref name=CunnbioCh7&gt;Andrew Cunningham ch.7&lt;/ref&gt; After his long service in small ships, Cunningham considered his accommodation aboard ''Hood'' to be almost palatial,&lt;ref name=CunnbioCh7/&gt; even surpassing his previous big ship experience on ''Rodney''.&lt;ref name=HMShood&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hmshood.com/crew/biography/abc_bio.htm |title=Cunningham biography|publisher = HMS Hood association|date = 11 June 2007 |accessdate=11 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He retained command until September 1938, when he was appointed to the [[Admiralty]] as [[List of senior officers of the Royal Navy#Deputy Chiefs of the Naval Staff|Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff]], although he did not actually take up this post until December 1939. He accepted this shore job with reluctance since he loathed administration, but the Board of Admiralty’s high regard of him was evident. For six months during an illness of [[Roger Backhouse|Admiral Sir Roger Backhouse]], the then [[First Sea Lord]], he deputised for Backhouse on the [[Committee of Imperial Defence]] and on the [[Admiralty Board]].&lt;ref name=NavalMuseum/&gt; In 1939 he was made a [[Order of the Bath|Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath]] (KCB), becoming known as Sir Andrew Cunningham.

==Second World War==
Cunningham described the command of the [[Mediterranean Fleet (United Kingdom)|Mediterranean Fleet]] as &quot;The finest command the Royal Navy has to offer&quot;&lt;ref name=Simpson42&gt;Michael Simpson|Chapter 5 p.42&lt;/ref&gt; and he remarked in his memoirs that &quot;I probably knew the Mediterranean as well as any Naval Officer of my generation&quot;.&lt;ref name=Simpson42/&gt; Cunningham was made Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean, hoisting his flag in [[HMS Warspite (03)|HMS ''Warspite'']] on 6 June 1939, one day after arriving in [[Alexandria]] on 5 June 1939. As Commander-in-Chief, Cunningham's main concern was for the safety of convoys heading for [[Egypt]] and [[Malta Convoys|Malta]]. These convoys were highly significant in that they were desperately needed to keep Malta, a small [[British overseas territories|British colony]] and naval base, in the war. Malta was a strategic strongpoint and Cunningham fully appreciated this.&lt;ref name=Histwar/&gt; Cunningham believed that the main threat to British Sea Power in the Mediterranean would come from the [[Regia Marina|Italian Fleet]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Simpson p.43&lt;/ref&gt; As such Cunningham had his fleet at a heightened state of readiness, so that when Italy did choose to enter into hostilities, then the British Fleet would be ready.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Simpson p.44&lt;/ref&gt;

===French Surrender (June 1940)===
{{See also|Attack on Mers-el-Kébir}}

In his role as Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean, Cunningham had to negotiate with the French Admiral [[Rene-Emile Godfroy]] for the demilitarisation and internment of a French squadron at [[Alexandria]], in June 1940, following the [[Armistice with France (Second Compiègne)|Fall of France]]. Churchill had ordered Cunningham to prevent the French warships from leaving port, and to ensure that French warships did not pass into enemy hands. Stationed at the time at [[Alexandria]], Cunningham entered into delicate negotiations with Godfroy to ensure his fleet, which consisted of the battleship [[French battleship Lorraine|''Lorraine'']], 4 cruisers, 3 destroyers and a submarine, posed no threat.&lt;ref name=warner97&gt;Oliver Warner p.97&lt;/ref&gt; The Admiralty ordered Cunningham to complete the negotiations on 3 July.&lt;ref name=warner97/&gt; Just as an agreement seemed imminent Godfroy heard of the British action against the French at [[Attack on Mers-el-Kébir|Mers el Kebir]] and, for a while, Cunningham feared a battle between French and British warships in the confines of [[Alexandria Port|Alexandria harbour]]. The deadline was overrun but negotiations ended well, after Cunningham put them on a more personal level and had the British ships appeal to their French opposite numbers.&lt;ref&gt;Oliver Warner p.99&lt;/ref&gt; Cunningham's negotiations succeeded and the French emptied their fuel [[Fuel oil#Bunker fuel|bunker]]s and removed the firing mechanisms from their guns.&lt;ref name=Warner100&gt;Oliver Warner p.100&lt;/ref&gt; Cunningham in turn promised to repatriate the ships' crews.&lt;ref name=Warner100/&gt;

===Battle of Taranto (November 1940)===
{{Main|Battle of Taranto}}
[[File:Operazione Judgement Taranto.jpg|thumb|right|Attack directions of British planes at Taranto]]

Although the threat from the French Fleet had been neutralised, Cunningham was still aware of the threat posed by the Italian Fleet to British [[North African campaign|North African operations]], based in [[Egypt]]. Although the Royal Navy had won in several actions in the Mediterranean, considerably upsetting the [[Balance of power in international relations|balance of power]], the Italians who were following the theory of a [[fleet in being]] had left their ships in harbour. This made the threat of a [[sortie]] against the British Fleet a serious problem.&lt;ref name = RNtaranto/&gt; At the time the harbour at Taranto contained six [[battleship]]s (five of them battle-worthy), seven [[heavy cruiser]]s, two [[light cruiser]]s, and eight [[destroyer]]s. The Admiralty, concerned with the potential for an attack, had drawn up Operation ''Judgement''; a surprise attack on Taranto Harbour. To carry out the attack, the Admiralty sent the new aircraft carrier [[HMS Illustrious (87)|HMS ''Illustrious'']], commanded by [[Lumley Lyster]], to join [[HMS Eagle (1918)|HMS ''Eagle'']] in Cunningham's fleet.

The attack started at 21:00, 11 November 1940, when the first of two waves of [[Fairey Swordfish]] [[torpedo bombers]] took off from ''Illustrious'', followed by the second wave an hour later. The attack was a  great success:&lt;ref name = RNtaranto/&gt; the Italian fleet lost half its strength in one night. The &quot;fleet-in-being&quot; diminished in importance and the threat to the Royal Navy's control of the Mediterranean had been considerably reduced. Cunningham said of the victory: &quot;Taranto, and the night of 11–12 November 1940, should be remembered for ever as having shown once and for all that in the [[Fleet Air Arm]] the Navy has its most devastating weapon.&quot;&lt;ref name = RNtaranto/&gt; The Royal Navy had launched the first all-aircraft naval attack in history, flying a small number of aircraft from an aircraft carrier. This, and other aspects of the raid, were important facts in the planning of the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941]]: the Japanese planning staff were thought to have studied it intensively.&lt;ref name = RNtaranto/&gt;

Cunningham's official reaction at the time was memorably terse. After landing the last of the attacking aircraft, ''Illustrious'' signalled &quot;Operation Judgement executed&quot;. After seeing aerial reconnaissance photographs the next day which showed several Italian ships sunk or out of action, Cunningham replied with the two-letter code group which signified, &quot;Manoeuvre well executed&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jack Broome|Broome, Jack]], ''Make Another Signal'', William Kimber, 1973, ISBN 0-7183-0193-5&lt;/ref&gt;

===Battle of Cape Matapan (March 1941)===
{{Main|Battle of Cape Matapan}}
[[File:Www2mR130BMatapan.GIF|thumb|300px|left|Battle summary of Cape Matapan]]

At the end of March 1941, Hitler wanted the convoys supplying the [[Operation Lustre|British Expeditionary force in Greece]] stopped, and the Italian Navy was the only force able to attempt this.&lt;ref name =RNCpMatapan/&gt; Cunningham stated in his biography: &quot;I myself was inclined to think that the Italians would not try anything. I bet Commander [[Manley Laurence Power|Power]], the Staff Officer, Operations, the sum of ten [[shilling]]s that we would see nothing of the enemy.&quot;&lt;ref name =RNCpMatapan&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royal-navy.mod.uk/server/show/nav.3946 |title=Cape Matapan: battle|publisher=[[Royal Navy]]|date = 14 June 2007 |accessdate=14 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under pressure from Germany, the Italian Fleet planned to launch an attack on the British Fleet on 28 March 1941.

The Italian commander, Admiral [[Angelo Iachino]], intended to carry out a surprise attack on the British Cruiser Squadron in the area (commanded by Vice-Admiral Sir [[Henry Pridham-Wippell]]), executing a [[pincer movement]] with the battleship [[Italian battleship Vittorio Veneto|''Vittorio Veneto'']].&lt;ref name=Salvo&gt;Bernard Edwards, Chapter 11, Cape Matapan&lt;/ref&gt; Cunningham though, was aware of Italian naval activity through intercepts of Italian [[Enigma machine|Enigma]] messages. Although Italian intentions were unclear, Cunningham's staff believed an attack upon British troop convoys was likely and orders were issued to spoil the enemy plan and, if possible, intercept their fleet. Cunningham wished, however, to disguise his own activity and arranged for a game of golf and a fictitious evening gathering to mislead enemy agents (he was, in fact, overheard by the local Japanese Consul).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Sebag-Montefiore |first = Hugh |authorlink =  |coauthors =  |title = Enigma: The Battle of the Code |publisher = Phoenix |year = 2001 |location = London |pages = 123–125 |url =  |doi =  |isbn = 0-7538-1130-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After sunset, he boarded HMS ''Warspite'' and left Alexandria.

Cunningham, realising that an air attack could weaken the Italians,&lt;ref name=Salvo/&gt; ordered an attack by the [[HMS Formidable (67)|''Formidable'''s]] [[Fairey Albacore|Albacore]] torpedo-bombers. A hit on the ''Vittorio Veneto'' slowed her temporarily&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NAVAL-HISTORY.NET |author=Smith, Gordon |accessdate=20 August 2007|url=http://www.naval-history.net/WW2CampaignsRNMed.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Iachino, realising his fleet was vulnerable without air cover, ordered his forces to retire. Cunningham gave the order to pursue the Italian Fleet.&lt;ref name =RNCpMatapan/&gt;

An air attack from the ''Formidable'' had disabled the cruiser [[Italian cruiser Pola|''Pola'']] and Iachino, unaware of Cunningham's pursuing battlefleet, ordered a squadron of cruisers and destroyers to return and protect the ''Pola''. Cunningham, meanwhile, was joining up with Pridham-Wippell's cruiser squadron.&lt;ref name=Salvo/&gt; Throughout the day several chases and sorties occurred with no overall victor.&lt;ref name=Salvo/&gt; None of the Italian ships were equipped for night fighting, and when night fell, they made to return to Taranto.&lt;ref name =RNCpMatapan/&gt; The British battlefleet equipped with [[radar]] detected the Italians shortly after 22:00. In a pivotal&lt;ref name=Salvo/&gt; moment in naval warfare during the Second World War, the battleships [[HMS Barham (1914)|''Barham'']], [[HMS Valiant (1914)|''Valiant'']] and ''Warspite'' opened fire on two Italian cruisers at only 3,800 yards (3.5&amp;nbsp;km), destroying them in only five minutes.&lt;ref name =RNCpMatapan/&gt;

Although the ''Vittorio Veneto'' escaped from the battle by returning to Taranto, there were many accolades given to Cunningham for continuing the pursuit at night, against the advice of his staff.&lt;ref name=Salvo/&gt; After the previous defeat at Taranto, the defeat at Cape Matapan dealt another strategic blow to the Italian Navy. Five ships - three heavy cruisers and two destroyers - were sunk, and around 2,400 Italian sailors were killed, missing or captured.&lt;ref name =HistnetMat&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historynet.com/air_sea/naval_battles/3029406.html |title=The Battle of Cape Matapan |publisher = [[Historynet]]|date = 14 June 2007 |accessdate=14 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The British lost only three aircrew when one torpedo bomber was shot down. Cunningham had lost his bet with Commander Power but he had won a strategic victory in the war in the Mediterranean.&lt;ref name=Salvo/&gt; The defeats at Taranto and Cape Matapan meant that the Italian Navy did not intervene&lt;ref name =HistnetMat/&gt; in the heavily contested evacuations of Greece and Crete, later in 1941. It also ensured that, for the remainder of the war, the [[Regia Marina]] conceded the Eastern Mediterranean to the Allied Fleet, and did not leave port for the remainder of the war.&lt;ref name =HistnetMat/&gt;

===Battle of Crete (May 1941)===
{{Main|Battle of Crete}}
[[File:Wounded British troops disembarking.jpg|thumb|right|British wounded evacuated to [[Alexandria, Egypt|Alexandria]]]]

On the morning of 20 May 1941, [[Nazi Germany]] launched an [[Airborne forces|airborne invasion]] of Crete, under the code-name ''Unternehmen Merkur'' (Operation Mercury). Despite initial heavy casualties,&lt;ref name =AWM&gt;{{cite book |first=Gavin |last=Long |series=''[[Australia in the War of 1939–1945]]'' |title=''Volume II – Greece, Crete and Syria''| publisher = [[Australian War Memorial]] |location=Canberra |year = 1953 |url=http://www.awm.gov.au/histories/chapter.asp?volume=18 |accessdate=13 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Maleme]] airfield in western Crete fell to the Germans and enabled the Germans to fly in heavy reinforcements and overwhelm the Allied forces.&lt;ref name =AWM/&gt;

After a week of heavy fighting, British commanders decided that the situation was hopeless and ordered a withdrawal from [[Sfakia]].&lt;ref name =AWM/&gt; During the next four nights, 16,000 troops were evacuated to Egypt by ships (including [[HMS Ajax (22)|HMS ''Ajax'']]&lt;ref name =AWM/&gt; of [[Battle of the River Plate]] fame). A smaller number of ships were to withdraw troops on a separate mission from [[Heraklion]], but these ships were attacked en route by [[Luftwaffe]] [[dive bomber]]s. Without air cover, Cunningham's ships suffered serious losses. Cunningham was determined, though, that the &quot;navy must not let the army down&quot;, and when army generals feared he would lose too many ships, Cunningham famously said, {{cquote|It takes three years to build a ship; it takes three centuries to build a tradition.&lt;ref name= Churchill265&gt;Churchill, Winston; The Second World War Volume III, &quot;The Grand Alliance&quot;, Chapter XVI Crete: The Battle. p265&lt;/ref&gt;}} 
The &quot;never say die&quot; attitude of Cunningham and the men under his command meant that of 22,000 men on Crete, 16,500 were rescued but at the loss of three cruisers and six destroyers. Fifteen other major warships were damaged.&lt;ref name= Churchill265/&gt;

===Allied Expeditionary Force (1943–1946)===
[[File:Yalta summit 1945 with Churchill, Roosevelt, Stalin.jpg|thumb|left|Cunningham standing behind Churchill at [[Yalta conference]]]]
Cunningham became a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath (GCB), &quot;in recognition of the recent successful combined operations in the Middle East&quot;, in March 1941&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=35094 |date=4 March 1941 |startpage=1303 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was created a '''Baronet''', of Bishop's Waltham in the County of Southampton, in July 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=35586 |date=5 June 1942 |startpage=2475 }}&lt;/ref&gt; From late 1942 to early 1943, he served under [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|General Eisenhower]], who made him the Supreme Commander, Allied Expeditionary Force. In this role that Cunningham commanded the large fleet that covered the Anglo-American landings in North Africa ([[Operation Torch]]). General Eisenhower said of him in his diary:

{{cquote|Admiral Sir Andrew Browne Cunningham. He remains in my opinion at the top of my subordinates in absolute selflessness, energy, devotion to duty, knowledge of his task, and in understanding of the requirements of allied operations. My opinions as to his superior qualifications have never wavered for a second.}}

On 21 January 1943, Cunningham was promoted to Admiral of the Fleet.&lt;ref name=HMSHoodpage&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hmshood.com/crew/biography/abc_bio.htm|author=Paul Bevand|title=Biography of Admiral of the Fleet Sir Andrew Browne Cunningham
|publisher = HMS Hood Association |date = 15 May 2008 |accessdate=8 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  February 1943 saw him return to his post as Commander-in-Chief, [[Mediterranean Fleet (United Kingdom)|Mediterranean Fleet]]. Three months later, when Axis forces in North Africa were on the verge of surrender, he ordered that none should be allowed to escape.&lt;ref name=RNpage&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.royal-navy.mod.uk/server/show/nav.3893|title=Viscount Cunningham|publisher = Royal Navy |date = 14 June 2007 |accessdate=14 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Entirely in keeping with his fiery character he signalled the fleet &quot;Sink, burn and destroy: Let nothing pass&quot;.&lt;ref name=RNpage/&gt; He oversaw the naval forces used in the joint Anglo-American amphibious invasions of Sicily, during [[Operation Husky]], [[Operation Baytown]] and [[Operation Avalanche]]. On the morning of 11 September 1943, Cunningham was present at Malta when the Italian Fleet surrendered. Cunningham informed the Admiralty with a telegram; &quot;Please to inform your Lordships that the Italian battle fleet now lies at anchor under the guns of the fortress of Malta.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Churchill p.102&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1943, Cunningham became [[First Sea Lord]] of the Admiralty and Chief of the Naval Staff, after the death of [[Dudley Pound]]. This promotion meant that he had to relinquish his coveted post of Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean, recommending his namesake Admiral [[John H. D. Cunningham]] as his successor.&lt;ref&gt;Cunningham Papers p.270&lt;/ref&gt; In the position of First Sea Lord, and as a member of the Chiefs of Staff committee, Cunningham was responsible for the overall strategic direction of the navy for the remainder of the war. He attended the major conferences at [[Cairo Conference|Cairo]], [[Tehran Conference|Tehran]], [[Yalta Conference|Yalta]] and [[Potsdam Conference|Potsdam]],&lt;ref name=RNpage/&gt; at which the Allies discussed future strategy, including the [[invasion of Normandy]] and the deployment of a [[British Pacific Fleet|British fleet]] to the [[Pacific Ocean]].

==Retirement==
[[File:Bust of Cunningham in Trafalgar Square.jpg|thumb|upright|The bust of Cunningham in Trafalgar Square]]
In 1945 Cunningham was appointed a [[Order of the Thistle|Knight of the Thistle]]&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=16193 |date=9 January 1945 |startpage=16 |city=e |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and raised to the peerage as '''Baron Cunningham of Hyndhope''', of Kirkhope in the County of Selkirk.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=37305 |date=12 October 1945 |startpage=5026 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was entitled to retire at the end of the war in 1945 but he resolved to pilot the Navy through the transition to peace before retiring. With the election of [[Clement Attlee]] as British [[Prime Minister]] in 1945, and the implementation of his [[Post-war consensus]], there was a large reduction in the Defence Budget. The extensive reorganisation was a challenge for Cunningham. &quot;We very soon came to realise how much easier it was to make war than to reorganise for peace.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Simpson p.209&lt;/ref&gt; Due to pressures on the budget from all three services, the Navy embarked on a reduction programme that was larger than Cunningham had envisaged.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Simpson p.209–213&lt;/ref&gt;

He was made '''Viscount Cunningham of Hyndhope''', of Kirkhope in the County of Selkirk, in January 1946,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=37461 |date=8 February 1946 |startpage=863 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and appointed to the [[Order of Merit]] in June of that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=37598 |date=4 June 1946 |startpage=2759 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of May 1946, after overseeing the transition through to peacetime, Cunningham retired from his post as First Sea Lord.&lt;ref name=Navalpapers&gt;The Cunningham Papers&lt;/ref&gt; Cunningham retreated to the &quot;little house in the country&quot;, 'Palace House', at [[Bishop's Waltham]] in Hampshire, which he and Lady Cunningham had acquired before the war. They both had a busy retirement.&lt;ref name=Navalpapers/&gt; He attended the House of Lords irregularly and occasionally lent his name to press statements about the Royal Navy, particularly those relating to Admiral [[Dudley Burton Napier North|Dudley North]], who had been relieved of his command of [[Gibraltar]] in 1940. Cunningham, and several of the surviving Admirals of the Fleet, set about securing justice for North, and they succeeded with a partial vindication in 1957.&lt;ref name=Navalpapers/&gt; He also busied himself with various appointments; he was [[Lord High Commissioner to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland]] in 1950 and 1952, and in 1953 he acted as [[Lord High Steward]] - the most recent one to date - at the [[Coronation of the British monarch|coronation]] of [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]]. Throughout this time Cunningham and his wife entertained family and friends, including his own great nephew, [[Jock Slater]], in their extensive gardens. Cunningham died in London on 12 June 1963,&lt;ref name=Navalpapers/&gt; and was buried at sea off Portsmouth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|coauthors = Hans Houterman &amp; Jeroen Koppes|title = RN Officers service histories|url = http://www.unithistories.com/officers/RN_officersC4.html|accessdate =8 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were no children from his marriage and his titles consequently became extinct on his death.

A bust of Cunningham by [[Franta Belsky]] was unveiled in [[Trafalgar Square]] in [[London]] on 2 April 1967 by [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://yourarchives.nationalarchives.gov.uk/index.php?title=Bust_of_Viscount_Cunningham_of_Hyndhope_by_Franta_Belsky Bust of Viscount Cunningham of Hyndhope by Franta Belsky] at nationalarchives.gov.uk (accessed 27 November 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; The April 2010 UK naval operation to ship British military personnel and air passengers stranded in continental Europe by the [[air travel disruption after the 2010 Eyjafjallajökull eruption]] back to the UK was named [[Operation Cunningham]] after him.
