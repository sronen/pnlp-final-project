[[Air Marshal]] '''Sir George Jones''' [[Order of the British Empire|KBE]], [[Order of the Bath|CB]], [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|DFC]] (18 October 1896 – 24 August 1992) was a senior commander in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF). He rose from [[Private (rank)|private]] soldier in World War I to air marshal in 1948, and served as [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]] from 1942 to 1952, the longest continuous tenure of any RAAF chief. Jones was a surprise appointee to the Air Force’s top role, and his achievements in the position were coloured by a divisive relationship during World War II with his nominal subordinate, the head of [[RAAF Command]], Air Vice Marshal [[William Bostock]].

During World War I, Jones saw action as an [[infantry]]man in the [[Battle of Gallipoli|Gallipoli campaign]] of 1915, before transferring to the Australian Flying Corps a year later. Originally an air mechanic, he undertook flying training in 1917 and was posted to a [[Fighter aircraft|fighter]] squadron in France, achieving seven victories to become an [[flying ace|ace]]. After a short spell in civilian life following World War I, he joined the newly formed RAAF in 1921, rising steadily through training and personnel commands prior to World War II.

Jones did not actively seek the position of Chief of the Air Staff before being appointed in 1942, and his conflict with Bostock—with whom he had been friends for 20&amp;nbsp;years—was partly the result of a divided command structure, which neither man had any direct role in shaping. After World War II Jones had overall responsibility for transforming what was then the world's fourth largest air force into a peacetime service that was also able to meet overseas commitments in [[Malayan Emergency|Malaya]] and [[Korean War|Korea]]. Following his retirement from the RAAF he continued to serve in the aircraft industry and later ran unsuccessfully for political office.

== Early life ==
Jones was born near [[Rushworth, Victoria|Rushworth]], a rural community in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. The date that appears on his birth certificate is 22 November 1896; however this was the date of registration and not of the birth itself, which occurred on 18 October. His father, a miner, had died three months earlier. Jones was brought up in a strict [[Methodist]] household and for the rest of his life rarely touched alcohol. He attended Rushworth State School, leaving at the age of 14 with a Certificate of Merit.&lt;ref name=&quot;Helson pp.1-3&quot;&gt;Helson, ''Ten Years at the Top'', pp.1-3&lt;/ref&gt;

Following his schooling, Jones took an apprenticeship as a carpenter before moving to [[Melbourne]], where he became a motor mechanic. He undertook three years part-time military service prior to World War I, firstly in [[Australian Army Cadets|cadets]] and later in a [[Australian Army Reserve|militia]] unit, the 29th [[Australian Light Horse|Light Horse]] Regiment (also known as the [[Port Phillip]] Horse).&lt;ref name=&quot;Helson pp.1-3&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.regiments.org/regiments/australia/volmil/vic-cav/29philip.htm 29th Light Horse Regiment (Port Phillip Horse)] at [http://www.regiments.org Land Forces of Britain, the Empire and Commonwealth].

== World War I ==
In May 1915 Jones joined the [[First Australian Imperial Force|Australian Imperial Force]], embarking for Egypt in August with the 9th Light Horse Regiment. He landed at [[Battle of Gallipoli|Gallipoli]] the following month and served there until the end of the campaign in December. His experiences at Gallipoli, especially witnessing the death by enemy fire of one of his friends, affected him deeply and he suffered from headaches and nightmares for years afterwards. After briefly transferring to the [[Imperial Camel Corps]], Jones applied to join the Australian Flying Corps (AFC) in October 1916, taking a drop in rank from [[corporal]] to private to do so.&lt;ref&gt;Helson, ''Ten Years at the Top'', pp.4–8&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:P00826.128Snipe1918.jpg|thumb|left|Snipe of No. 4 Squadron AFC, c. 1918]]
Jones became an air mechanic in [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No. 1 Squadron AFC]] (known as No. 67 Squadron [[Royal Flying Corps]] by the British), before being accepted for flying training in England. He gained his wings on 22 November 1917 and was posted to [[No. 4 Squadron RAAF|No. 4 Squadron AFC]] (also known as No. 71 Squadron RFC) as a [[second lieutenant]] in January the following year. Flying [[Sopwith Camel]]s and [[Sopwith Snipe|Snipes]] on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]], Jones finished the war a [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|captain]] and an [[Flying ace|ace]], with seven victories from 150&amp;nbsp;patrols. He was badly injured by a bullet wound and petrol burns in combat with a German fighter in March 1918, and did not return to his unit for three months.&lt;ref&gt;Cutlack, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/9/chapters/17.pdf ''The Australian Flying Corps'', p.239]&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 October 1918 he achieved two kills in one engagement, at [[Tournai]], in what is frequently described as &quot;one of the greatest air battles of the war&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens, p.21&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p.21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers&quot;&gt;Odgers, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.42–43&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cutlack&quot;&gt;Cutlack, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/9/chapters/26.pdf ''The Australian Flying Corps'', pp.377–378]&lt;/ref&gt; Amid a confrontation involving over 75 Allied and German fighters, Jones led his patrol of three Snipes in a dive on ten [[Fokker]]s, destroying a brace of enemy aircraft in the attack.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cutlack&quot;/&gt; He was decorated with the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] for displaying &quot;the greatest daring and ability in aerial fighting&quot;; the award was promulgated in the ''[[London Gazette]]'' on 5 April 1919.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/collection/records/awm28/2/awm28-2-120-0009.pdf Recommended: Distinguished Flying Cross] at [[Australian War Memorial]].

== Inter-war years ==
[[File:E04146JonesAFC.jpg|thumb|260px|Captain George Jones (far right) and pilots of No. 4 Squadron AFC, British Occupation forces in Germany, December 1918]]
Jones remained with the Australian Flying Corps until June 1919, as part of the British Occupation forces in Germany. After returning to Australia he worked as a [[Turning|turner]] in Melbourne. He married Muriel Cronan, a [[clerk (position)|clerk]] who also played piano professionally, on 15 November 1919. They had met prior to the war and kept in touch throughout Jones' overseas postings. The couple's first child, Ronald, arrived on 2 October 1920. A second son, Ian, would be born on 26 June 1934. Jones was described by family members as being a somewhat distant husband and father, dedicated to his career and rarely given to obvious displays of emotion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Helson pp.14-15,23&quot;&gt;Helson, ''Ten Years at the Top'', pp.14–15,23&lt;/ref&gt;

Encouraged by a fellow No. 4 Squadron veteran, [[Harry Cobby]], Jones applied to join the new [[Royal Australian Air Force|Australian Air Force]] on 22 March 1921 (the prefix &quot;Royal&quot; was added that August). His rank was [[flying officer]], one below the equivalent of his AFC rank of captain. Another Australian pilot joining the fledgling Air Force was [[William Bostock|William (Bill) Bostock]], a [[lieutenant]] in World War I. The pair became firm friends, Bostock acting as something of a mentor to the younger officer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.116-119&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.116–119&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Helson pp.16-21&quot;&gt;Helson, ''Ten Years at the Top'', pp.16–21&lt;/ref&gt; Jones was promoted to [[flight lieutenant]] on 1 July 1923.&lt;ref name=&quot;AWM&quot;&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/people/229.asp Air Marshal George Jones] at Australian War Memorial. Retrieved  23 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Posted to [[RAAF Williams|RAAF Point Cook]], Jones was put in charge of the Motor Transport Repair Section and made acting (later permanent) [[Officer Commanding]] Workshops. He was highly regarded for his technical and administrative ability but rated only &quot;average&quot; in command and dealing with personnel. In 1926 he took up [[Flight instructor|flight instruction]] and within a year had been graded a 1A Flying Instructor. He was promoted to [[squadron leader]] on 31 March 1927 and given command of Flying Squadron at [[No. 1 Flying Training School RAAF|No. 1 Flying Training School]] (No. 1 FTS). Jones spent two years in Britain from 1928, attending the [[RAF Staff College, Andover|Royal Air Force Staff College, Andover]], and graduating top of his class at the RAF's [[Central Flying School]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Helson pp.16-21&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AWM&quot;/&gt; He later recalled of this posting, &quot;The social life was new to me, as was the etiquette... I learned as fast as I could, but I have no doubt that I unwittingly committed many a social blunder.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.90&lt;/ref&gt; While in the UK Jones had expected, as the RAAF's senior officer in the country, to accompany the airship ''[[R101]]'' on its maiden flight to India. Instead another Australian officer was nominated to make the trip, and Jones avoided the disaster which followed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pathfinder&quot;&gt;Air Power Development Centre, &quot;The Difference One Man Makes&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; 

Returning to Australia in October 1930, Jones was made Chief Flying Instructor at Point Cook and Officer Commanding No. 1 FTS. He became Director of Training at RAAF Headquarters, Melbourne, in November 1931.&lt;ref name=&quot;Helson pp.16-21&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AWM&quot;/&gt; On 2 April 1932, he was taking off from [[Sydney Airport|Mascot]] in a [[De Havilland Moth]] when he struck the perimeter fence and crashed, resulting in major damage to the aircraft and injuries to himself and his passenger.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Bother, p.323&lt;/ref&gt;  From late 1934 to early 1935, he collaborated with the Director of Equipment, [[George Mackinolty]], on an investigation into the state of aircraft production in Australia to highlight shortfalls in local defence in the face of possible future conflict with Japan.  Though the report was reviewed enthusiastically by the Air Member for Personnel, [[William Anderson (RAAF officer)|Bill Anderson]], it apparently went no further in the chain of command and thus was effectively ignored.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.445&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1936, Jones was promoted to [[Wing Commander (rank)|wing commander]] and appointed Director of Personnel Services.&lt;ref name=&quot;AWM&quot;/&gt;

== World War II ==
=== Rise to Chief of the Air Staff ===
Shortly after the outbreak of World War II, in December 1939, Jones was raised to temporary [[group captain]]. In 1940, returning to the position of Director of Training, he assumed responsibility for Australia's part in the [[British Commonwealth Air Training Plan|Empire Air Training Scheme]] (EATS), establishing many schools, acquiring hundreds of aircraft, and overseeing the training of thousands of airman. The RAAF's [[Central Flying School RAAF|Central Flying School]] was reformed in April 1940 to meet the vital requirement for additional flying instructors, whose numbers would grow from 16 in the first year of the war to 3,600 by 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.67–68&lt;/ref&gt; His performance in this role led to Jones being promoted to acting [[air commodore]] on 21 February 1941, and appointed a [[Order of the British Empire|Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] in the 1942 [[New Year Honours]] for &quot;diligence, devotion to duty and perseverance of outstanding merit&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Helson, ''Ten Years at the Top'', pp.42–44&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue= 35399|supp=yes|startpage=12|endpage=13|date=1 January 1942|accessdate=10 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Jones-Bostock-Burnett AWM 012249.jpg‎|thumb|260px|left|Newly appointed Chief of the Air Staff Air Vice Marshal George Jones (left) with Air Vice Marshal Bill Bostock (centre) and outgoing CAS Air Chief Marshal Sir Charles Burnett, May 1942]]
On 5 May 1942, Jones was appointed [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]] (CAS), the RAAF's senior position. He was considered an unlikely choice, a contemporary newspaper describing him as &quot;the darkest of dark horses&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Helson pp.68-77&quot;&gt;Helson, ''Ten Years at the Top'', pp.68–77&lt;/ref&gt; Jones was still only a substantive wing commander and acting air commodore when he succeeded to the role, leapfrogging several more senior officers including his friend Bill Bostock, now an [[air vice marshal]] and [[Deputy Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Deputy Chief of the Air Staff]]. Bostock, thought to be &quot;among the Air Force's best brains&quot; at the time, was believed by himself (and Jones) to be the leading candidate for the position.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.116-119&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.446&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/24.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', pp.475–477]&lt;/ref&gt; The suggestion even arose that Jones' selection was a mistake, based on the government's reading of an organisation chart that implied he was the RAAF's most senior officer after Bostock, when in fact he was ranked six places below.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.116-119&quot;/&gt;

Other potential appointees had included Air Marshal [[Richard Williams (RAAF officer)|Richard Williams]] and Air Vice Marshal [[Peter Roy Maxwell Drummond|Peter Drummond]]. Williams, however, had been out of favour since his dismissal from the position of CAS in the wake of the [[Edward Leonard Ellington|Ellington Report]] criticising RAAF flying safety in 1939, while Drummond was not released from his position as Deputy Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief [[Middle East Command|RAF Middle East]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.113–116&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Helson pp.64-68&quot;&gt;Helson, ''Ten Years at the Top'', pp.64–68&lt;/ref&gt; Bostock was first choice of the incumbent CAS, Air Chief Marshal [[Charles Burnett (RAF officer)|Sir Charles Burnett]], but the latter’s ill-concealed contempt for [[John Curtin]]'s [[Australian Labor Party|Federal Labor government]] helped ensure that his preference was ignored.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.116-119&quot;/&gt; Although he admitted to being &quot;stunned&quot; by the decision, Jones himself had the ambition and a reasonable expectation of becoming CAS at some point in his career. However, he found it occurred &quot;much sooner than I anticipated&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.116-119&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Helson, ''Ten Years at the Top'', p.26&lt;/ref&gt; Jones had proved his organisational abilities directing EATS, and believed that this was a significant factor in his appointment. His working class origin has also been seen as contributing to his suitability to a Labor government.&lt;ref name=&quot;Helson pp.68-77&quot;/&gt;

=== Divided command ===
[[Image:AVM George Jones.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Air Vice Marshal Jones shortly after he was appointed Chief of the Air Staff in May 1942]]
Passed over as CAS, Bostock became [[Air Officer Commanding]] [[RAAF Command]], in charge of RAAF operations in the Pacific. Jones' role, in contrast, was primarily administrative, that of &quot;raising, training and maintaining&quot; the service.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.120-123&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.120–123&lt;/ref&gt; Though the CAS was ''[[de jure]]'' head of the RAAF, Jones’ new rank of Air Vice Marshal was no higher than Bostock's. In the words of Air Force historian Alan Stephens, &quot;Jones was the head of his service, but he was neither unambiguously its senior officer, nor presiding over a unified command. [...] The system of divided command... was not an ideal arrangement, but with men of goodwill it could have worked. Regrettably Bostock and Jones were not of that mind...&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.120-123&quot;/&gt;

Friction between the two senior officers over the command structure rapidly deteriorated into a state of &quot;complete obduracy&quot;, and remained so until the end of the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/28.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', pp.595–596]&lt;/ref&gt; As a direct report to the [[United States Army Air Forces|USAAF]]'s Lieutenant-General [[George Kenney]], commander of Allied Air Forces in the [[South West Pacific theatre of World War II|South West Pacific Area]] (SWPA), Bostock was able to ignore many directives from Jones, his nominal superior in the RAAF.&lt;ref&gt;Helson, ''Ten Years at the Top'', pp.128,132,159&lt;/ref&gt; The CAS, however, continued to assert his authority over Bostock’s supplies of manpower and equipment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison&quot;/&gt;

In March 1943 Jones proposed that he take over responsibility for air operations in defence of the Australian mainland but General [[Douglas MacArthur]], Supreme Commander SWPA, refused to countenance it.&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/09.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p.140n]&lt;/ref&gt; The next month, with the support of the Air Board, Jones tried to remove Bostock from RAAF Command and replace him with Air Commodore [[Joe Hewitt (RAAF officer)|Joe Hewitt]], Air Officer Commanding [[No. 9 Operational Group RAAF|No. 9 Operational Group]] (No. 9 OG). Bostock appealed to Kenney, who advised Jones that he was opposed to any such change of command and threatened to escalate the matter to the Australian Government. MacArthur subsequently told Prime Minister Curtin that Hewitt &quot;was not an adequate replacement&quot; for Bostock, and the matter was dropped.&lt;ref&gt;Helson, ''Ten Years at the Top'', pp.123–126&lt;/ref&gt; Six months later Jones would sack Hewitt over morale issues in No. 9 OG raised during the offensive on [[Rabaul]]; Kenney called Hewitt’s removal &quot;bad news&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.120-123&quot;/&gt;

[[File:AWM012244JonesHancockHewitt.jpg|thumb|260px|left|Jones (right) in 1942 with members of HQ Allied Air Forces SWPA, including Group Captains [[Allan Walters]] (second left) and [[Valston Hancock|Val Hancock]] (centre) and Air Commodore Joe Hewitt (second right)]]
Jones himself came under threat of transfer or subordination in April 1943 when the Federal Government began moves to unite the Air Force's command by creating an overarching ''Air Officer Commanding RAAF'' position that would have effectively replaced Jones as CAS and also been senior to Bostock. Air Marshal Drummond was again approached but once more the British [[Air Ministry]] refused to release him, having selected him for an Air Council post. Macarthur rejected two other RAF candidates, and the plan was held over.&lt;ref&gt;Helson, ''Ten Years at the Top'', pp.165–172&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/01.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.15–17]&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Queen's Birthday Honours|King's Birthday Honours]] that June, Jones was appointed a [[Order of the Bath|Companion of the Order of the Bath]].&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=36033|supp=yes|startpage=2419|endpage=2420|date=28 May 1943|accessdate=3 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By June 1944 the Jones-Bostock conflict and the anomalous division of administrative and operational responsibilities again led the Australian government to consider the appointment of a new commander senior to both officers. Air Marshal [[Keith Park|Sir Keith Park]], the New Zealand-born AOC of [[No. 11 Group RAF]] during the [[Battle of Britain]], was sought for the position but negotiations were broken off when MacArthur advised that it was too late to make such a change and that the problem had now gone &quot;quiet&quot;. That it was far from over, however, was apparent in a series of cables exchanged between the two Air Vice Marshals in January 1945. Jones sent a signal to Bostock complaining of the latter’s &quot;insubordinate tone&quot; and &quot;repeated attempts to usurp authority of this Headquarters&quot;. Bostock replied that as AOC RAAF Command he was &quot;responsible to Commander, Allied Air Forces, and not, repeat not, subordinate to you&quot;, and that he would &quot;continue to take the strongest exception to your unwarranted and uninformed interference&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Air War Against Japan pp.436-437&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/26.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.436–437]&lt;/ref&gt; Despite such acrimony, the command structure remained unchanged for the rest of the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.120-123&quot;/&gt;

Responsible as CAS for building up Australia's air combat assets, in 1943 Jones had given an assurance to the Australian government that he could maintain a force of 73&amp;nbsp;squadrons, despite Kenney's prediction that even the RAAF's then-currently approved strength of 45&amp;nbsp;squadrons was beyond its capacity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Air War Against Japan p.12&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/01.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p.12]&lt;/ref&gt; In the event, by the end of the war Jones had expanded the RAAF to 70&amp;nbsp;squadrons in the Pacific and Europe, including several heavy bomber units.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.151-152&quot;/&gt; One of his most controversial decisions of the war was during the [[Battle of Tarakan (1945)|invasion of Tarakan]] in May 1945 when he grounded Australian [[B-24 Liberator]] squadrons scheduled to take part in the attack, due to their crews having exceeded their monthly quota of flying hours. Bostock was not consulted, and said that he would have thankfully &quot;fallen through a crack in the boards on the deck&quot; as he watched the attacking formations from a U.S. warship, minus the expected RAAF aircraft.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.120-123&quot;/&gt; Kenney sympathised with him; he once commented in his diary that &quot;Jones and Bostock ... fight each other harder than the Japs&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.120-123&quot;/&gt;

=== The &quot;Morotai Mutiny&quot; ===
[[Image:Jones Kenney (AWM VIC1638).jpg|thumb|260px|Air Vice Marshal Jones (left) and Lieutenant General Kenney (right) in July 1945]]
Towards the end of the war Jones intervened in the so-called &quot;[[Morotai Mutiny]]&quot;, when a number of senior pilots in the [[Australian First Tactical Air Force]] (No. 1 TAF) proffered their resignations rather than carry on attacking what they saw as unimportant targets. Jones personally interviewed all but one of the officers involved, later declaring, &quot;I believed them all to be sincere in what they were stating and what they had attempted to do ... Yes, sincerely held beliefs, no matter how ill-founded, coupled possibly with a rather exaggerated sense of national duty.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cleaning the augean stables&quot;&gt;Alexander, &quot;Cleaning the augean stables&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Kenney also insisted on speaking to the pilots himself, overriding Jones' protestations that it was an internal RAAF matter, and threatened to appear on behalf of the pilots should they be [[court-martial]]led. Jones sacked the Air Officer Commanding No. 1 TAF, his former No. 4 Squadron comrade Harry Cobby, along with two of Cobby's staff. In what has been considered a reaction to Kenney's threat, Jones insisted that the subsequent inquiry before Justice [[John Vincent Barry]] focus not only on the attempted resignations but on reports of alcohol trafficking on Morotai. While no action was taken against the pilots over the mutiny directly, two of the RAAF's best-known aces, Group Captain [[Clive Caldwell]] and Wing Commander [[Bobby Gibbes]], were court-martialled for their involvement in the alcohol racket and reduced in rank.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.123-125&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Carman | first = Gerry | date = 14 April 2007 | title = Air ace was born to fly: Bobby Gibbes 1916–2007 | journal = The Sydney Morning Herald | page = p.34 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Barry did not find it a significant factor, the Jones-Bostock conflict was also blamed for contributing to the poor morale that precipitated the &quot;mutiny&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley, ''Tarakan: An Australian Tragedy'', p.41&lt;/ref&gt; One of the other participants, Wing Commander Kenneth Ranger, told the inquiry: &quot;I deplore the fighting and wrangling between them which is common knowledge throughout the Air Force. Every week there are instances of it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cleaning the augean stables&quot;/&gt;

Along with Bostock, Jones represented the RAAF at the [[Japanese Instrument of Surrender|Japanese surrender]] aboard [[USS Missouri (BB-63)|USS ''Missouri'']] in September 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.208&lt;/ref&gt; With Jones' concurrence, Bostock and a number of other senior commanders were summarily retired in 1946, in Bostock's case for &quot;inability to work in harmony with certain other high ranking RAAF officers&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens p.179&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p.179&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Helson pp.237-240&quot;&gt;Helson, ''Ten Years at the Top'', pp.237-240&lt;/ref&gt; The CAS oversaw planning for the demobilisation of thousands of RAAF personnel and the creation of a peacetime service, known as the &quot;Interim Air Force&quot;. When he was eventually promoted [[air marshal]] in 1948 the RAAF was made up of approximately 8,000&amp;nbsp;staff, compared to 175,000—the world's fourth largest air force—he had commanded in 1945 as air vice marshal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.170-171,179&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.170–171,179&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Helson, ''Ten Years at the Top'', p.190&lt;/ref&gt; 

Believing that wastage was reaching a critical point, Jones proposed recruiting women into a new service to replace the [[Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force]] that had been disbanded in September 1946.  Blocked initially by the Labor government of the day, it came into being in 1950 as the [[Women's Royal Australian Air Force]], following the election of [[Robert Menzies]]' [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]] in December 1949.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.203–205&lt;/ref&gt; Concurrently with demobilisation, Jones shaped the RAAF’s &quot;Plan D&quot;, adopted in 1947. It outlined the service’s post-war organisation and requirements, which included 16&amp;nbsp;squadrons flying technologically advanced aircraft. This basic structure remained in place for the next 20&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.221-222&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.221–222&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Helson pp.xvi-xvii&quot;&gt;Helson, ''Ten Years at the Top'', pp.xvi-xvii,303–304&lt;/ref&gt; In 1949, Jones visited the UK with a team of advisors and recommended the [[English Electric Canberra]] jet to replace the RAAF's [[Avro Lincoln]] piston-engined bombers.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp.346,363&lt;/ref&gt; Entering service in 1953, the Canberras ultimately equipped three Squadrons, operating with distinction in the [[Vietnam War]] and continuing to fly until 1982. Other enduring types purchased under Jones’ tenure as CAS included the [[CAC Sabre]], [[P-2 Neptune]] and [[CAC Winjeel]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Helson pp.xvi-xvii&quot;/&gt;

=== Overseas commitments and retirement from RAAF ===
[[Image:AWM042907JonesMacArthur.jpg|thumb|260px|Lieutenant General [[Horace Robertson|Sir Horace Robertson]] (second left), General MacArthur (second right) and Air Marshal Jones (right) in Japan after the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950]]
When Australia committed forces to the [[Malayan Emergency]] in April 1950, Jones formed the requisite RAAF assets into one unit, No. 90 (Composite) Wing, to ensure they would operate autonomously rather than be dispersed throughout other Allied groups. He also stipulated that the air officer commanding all [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] air force units should be from the RAAF. This was agreed by the British Air Ministry, and the position gave valuable experience to two future Chiefs of the Air Staff, Air Vice Marshals [[Frederick Scherger]] and [[Valston Hancock|Val Hancock]]. Jones allocated [[No. 77 Squadron RAAF|No. 77 Squadron]], then based in Japan as part of [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]]s, to the [[United Nations Command (Korea)|United Nations Command]] when the [[Korean War]] broke out. Prime Minister Menzies rang Jones at home on Saturday, 1 July 1950, requesting a squadron and the unit went into action the following day.&lt;ref name=&quot;Helson pp.274-275&quot;&gt;Helson, ''Ten Years at the Top'', pp.274–275&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost immediately that Menzies' Liberal Party replaced the [[Ben Chifley|Chifley]] Labor government at the end of 1949, it began to investigate possible replacements (largely from the RAF) for the incumbent CAS, eventually deciding on Air Marshal (later Air Chief Marshal) [[Donald Hardman|Sir James (Donald) Hardman]]. Jones was informed of his retirement, which he claimed to have been expecting, in December 1951. In a farewell speech at the Australia Club in Melbourne, attended by Menzies, Jones said that organising EATS and expanding the Air Force in the South West Pacific had been his greatest achievements. His official exit from RAAF was on 22 February 1952. The Prime Minister sent him a letter thanking him for his &quot;valuable contribution&quot;, which would &quot;long be remembered&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Helson pp.290-297&quot;&gt;Helson, ''Ten Years at the Top'', pp.290–297&lt;/ref&gt;

== Later life ==
Following his departure from the Air Force in 1952, Jones became Director of Coordination with the [[Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation]] (CAC) and member of the board of [[Ansett Australia|Ansett]] Transport Industries. In the 1953 New Year Honours, he was appointed a [[Order of the British Empire|Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] for his military service.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=39734|supp=yes|startpage=40|date=30 December 1952|accessdate=3 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/people/timeLine_229.asp Air Marshal George Jones: Timeline] at Australian War Memorial. Retrieved 23 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; He retired from the CAC directorship in 1957 but remained on the Ansett board until the early 1970s.&lt;ref name=&quot;AWM&quot;/&gt; Jones pursued a political career in parallel to his aviation industry work, unsuccessfully standing for Liberal Party pre-selection in the seat of [[Division of Flinders|Flinders]] in 1952. In 1958, he left the Liberals in favour of the [[Australian Labor Party|Labor Party]], contesting the seat of [[Division of Henty|Henty]] in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;Helson, ''Ten Years at the Top'', p.70&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens p.182&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p.182&lt;/ref&gt; He switched parties when his views became too leftist for the Liberals, declaring &quot;They got rather nasty with me and wouldn't give me a fair go, so I resigned and joined the Labor Party&quot;. He pursued an energetic campaign in Henty, but lost to his Liberal opponent by fewer than 3,000 primary votes.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''Soldiers in Politics'', p.135&lt;/ref&gt;

Jones also evinced an interest in [[unidentified flying object]]s, having first encountered unexplained aerial phenomena at [[Warrnambool, Victoria|Warrnambool]], Victoria, in 1930. He reported witnessing another UFO in October 1957, but admitted that he was &quot;loath to talk about it publicly lest people should think I was either an incompetent witness or getting a little screwy in the head&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chalker&quot;&gt;{{cite web| last=Chalker | first=Bill | year=2000 | title=Air Marshall Sir George Jones and the UFO | url=http://www.theozfiles.com/air_marshall_george_jones.html | accessdate=25 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-1960s he patronised the Commonwealth Aerial Phenomena Investigation Organisation and joined the Victorian UFO Research Society.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chalker&quot;/&gt; In 1988 Jones published his autobiography, ''From Private to Air Marshal''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pathfinder&quot;/&gt; He was Australia's last surviving World War I ace when he died in 1992, at the age of 95.&lt;ref name=&quot;AWM&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Franks, ''Sopwith Camel Aces of World War 1'', p.75&lt;/ref&gt;

}}
Jones' ten years as CAS was the longest continuous tour of any RAAF chief.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.airforce.gov.au/leaders/formerchiefs.aspx Royal Australian Air Force leaders: Former Chiefs of the Air Force] at [http://www.airforce.gov.au/ RAAF Official Site]. Retrieved 1 December 2008. Air Marshal [[Richard Williams (RAAF officer)|Sir Richard Williams]]' thirteen years as head of the RAAF comprised three separate terms, the longest of which was eight years.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his longevity in the position, he is still primarily known for two events early in his term, the surprise circumstance of his appointment, and his feud with Bill Bostock that lasted until the end of World War II.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens, p.21&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Helson, ''Ten Years at the Top'', pp.ii-xv,299&lt;/ref&gt; The conflict between its two senior officers has been labelled &quot;disastrous&quot; for the RAAF, one that &quot;diminished its standing&quot; in the eyes of its Allies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.123-125&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.123–125&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Horner, &quot;The Evolution of Australian Higher Command Arrangements&quot;, p.13&lt;/ref&gt; Jones would claim in his autobiography that he had never intrigued for the role of CAS and would have worked loyally for Bostock if the latter had been appointed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Helson pp.290-297&quot;/&gt;

[[Image:AWM019070Jones.jpg|thumb|upright|Air Vice Marshal George Jones pictured shortly after the end of World War II, August 1945]]
Beyond these controversies, however, Jones significantly influenced the Air Force's development during and after the war. He was honoured for his work running the Empire Air Training Scheme in 1940–42 and has received credit as CAS for building up the RAAF's strength to 70&amp;nbsp;squadrons by 1945.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.151-152&quot;/&gt; After the war he played a personal part in improving education within the service, including the establishment of [[RAAF College]], along similar lines to [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]] and the [[HMAS Creswell|Royal Australian Naval College]], as well as the RAAF Staff College.&lt;ref name=&quot;Helson pp.xvi-xvii&quot;/&gt; One of his last directions as Chief was the formation of [[RAAF Museum]] at Point Cook, where it is still based.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defence.gov.au/raaf/raafmuseum/research/units/museum.htm RAAF Museum] Official Site. Retrieved 23 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jones encouraged local industry to design and build trainers for the RAAF and produce more sophisticated combat aircraft under licence from overseas manufacturers. This led to the Winjeel basic trainer and Australian industry co-partnership in production of the CAC Sabre and Canberra jets; such local participation has continued to figure in major RAAF aircraft acquisitions.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.188&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Boeing, RAAF |year= 2005 | title= A Hornet History | publisher= Boeing Australia Limited | url=http://www.boeing.com.au/YearOfHornet/History.html |accessdate=17 October 2007| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071009002652/http://www.boeing.com.au/YearOfHornet/History.html| archivedate = 9 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He refused to update the Air Force's command structure from one based on region to one of function, something his successor, Air Marshal Hardman, would accomplish, and has been criticised for a systemic resistance to change.&lt;ref name=&quot;Helson pp.253-254&quot;&gt;Helson, ''Ten Years at the Top'', pp.253–254&lt;/ref&gt; Jones was described in [[David Horner]]'s ''The Commanders'' as &quot;a steady, sincere but colourless leader&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Horner, ''The Commanders'', p.305&lt;/ref&gt; while Alan Stephens found him &quot;a good and decent man, who had overcome considerable personal hardship in his youth to achieve exceptional professional success&quot; but &quot;neither an inspiring leader, nor a notable thinker&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens p.182&quot;/&gt; Nevertheless his 'Plan D' for the RAAF's post-war organisation remained the service’s blueprint until the early 1970s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.221-222&quot;/&gt;
