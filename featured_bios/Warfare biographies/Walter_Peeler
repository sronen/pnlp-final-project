'''Walter &quot;Wally&quot; Peeler''' [[Victoria Cross|VC]], [[British Empire Medal|BEM]] (9 August 1887 &amp;ndash; 23 May 1968) was an [[List of Australian Victoria Cross recipients|Australian recipient]] of the [[Victoria Cross]], the highest award for gallantry &quot;in the face of the enemy&quot; that can be awarded to members of the [[United Kingdom|British]] and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] armed forces. He was decorated following his actions during the [[Battle of Broodseinde]] in October 1917. Then a [[lance corporal]] in the [[First Australian Imperial Force|Australian Imperial Force]], he repeatedly took the lead in the 37th Battalion's advance on well-defended German positions, destroying four machine gun posts and killing more than 30 German soldiers during the battle.

Born in [[Castlemaine, Victoria|Castlemaine]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], Peeler worked at various jobs in his home town and in the Melbourne area before enlisting in the Australian Imperial Force in February 1916. Posted to the 3rd Pioneer Battalion, he arrived on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] during November. In June 1917, his battalion participated in the [[Battle of Messines|assault on Messines ridge]], where he was lightly wounded. Eight days after his Victoria Cross action, Peeler was severely wounded in his right arm and spent the next seven months recuperating in the United Kingdom. Following the [[Armistice with Germany (Compiègne)|armistice with Germany]], he was discharged from service with the rank of sergeant in December 1918.

Peeler re-settled with his family in Victoria, and was appointed the inaugural custodian of Melbourne's [[Shrine of Remembrance]] in 1934. In May 1940, Peeler enlisted for service in the [[Second World War]], understating his age by fourteen years to avoid the upper age limit imposed on volunteers. He was posted to the 2/2nd Pioneer Battalion and initially saw action in the [[Syria-Lebanon Campaign]]. However, with the entry of Japan into the war, his unit was recalled to Australia in early 1942. It was hastily diverted to [[Java]] en route, to assist in the Dutch defence of the island. When Dutch resistance collapsed in March, Peeler and his comrades were captured by the Japanese. After three-and-a-half years as [[prisoner of war]], Peeler was freed in August 1945 and returned to Australia in October, resuming his duties at the Shrine of Remembrance. He retired in 1964 and, aged 80, died at his home in [[Caulfield South, Victoria|South Caulfield]] on 23 May 1968.

==Early life==
Walter &quot;Wally&quot; Peeler was born at Barker's Creek, near [[Castlemaine, Victoria|Castlemaine]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], on 9 August 1887. He was the eighth child of William Peeler, a farmer and miner, and his English-born wife Mary Ellen (née Scott). As a youth Peeler worked in his parent's orchard, before gaining employment with Thompson's Foundry in Castlemaine.&lt;ref name=&quot;AF&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;&gt;{{Australian Dictionary of Biography|last=Staunton|first=Anthony|year=1988|id=A110198b|title=Peeler, Walter (1887 &amp;ndash; 1968)|accessdate=6 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;VCs172&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Snelling|2000|p=172}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 July 1907, he wed Kathleen Emma Hewitt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AF&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Staunton|2005|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; the couple were to have five children.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; An active sportsman, Peeler was a member of the Castlemaine Cricket Club and, briefly, secretary of the Wesley Hill Football Club.&lt;ref name=&quot;VCs172&quot;/&gt;

==First World War==

By 1916, Peeler was living in the [[Melbourne]] suburb of [[Richmond, Victoria|Richmond]] with his wife and three daughters.&lt;ref name=&quot;VCs172&quot;/&gt; On 17 February, he enlisted in the [[First Australian Imperial Force|Australian Imperial Force]] for service in the First World War. Posted as a [[Private (rank)|private]] soldier to the machine gun section of the 3rd Pioneer Battalion, Peeler underwent his initial training in Victoria,&lt;ref name=&quot;AF&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Embark&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/AWM8/14_15_1/PDF/0051.pdf|title=Peeler, Walter|accessdate=9 November 2009|format=PDF|work=First World War Embarkation Roll|publisher=[[Australian War Memorial]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; before departing from Melbourne headed for England aboard [[HMAT Wandilla|HMAT ''Wandilla'']] on 6 June.&lt;ref name=&quot;Embark&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AIF&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aif.adfa.edu.au:8080/showPerson?pid=237660|title=Walter Peeler|accessdate=9 November 2009|work=The AIF Project|publisher=[[Australian Defence Force Academy]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The battalion arrived in [[Plymouth]] seven weeks later.&lt;ref name=&quot;ServRec&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://naa12.naa.gov.au/scripts/imagine.asp?B=6221610&amp;I=1&amp;SE=1|title=Peeler, Walter VX8345|accessdate=9 November 2009|format=|work=Records Search|publisher=[[National Archives of Australia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the three months Peeler's unit spent in England undergoing additional training, he was charged with being [[AWOL|absent without leave]] for six hours on 3 July, and fined a day's pay.&lt;ref name=&quot;ServRec&quot;/&gt; He was nevertheless promoted to [[lance corporal]] on 6 November.&lt;ref name=&quot;AF&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;

Two weeks later, the 3rd Pioneer Battalion was posted to the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ServRec&quot;/&gt; Sent to the [[Armentières]] sector, the battalion spent several months working on trench and railway construction.&lt;ref name=&quot;VCs173&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Snelling|2000|p=173}}&lt;/ref&gt; In mid-December, Peeler attended a week-long course at the Machine Gun School in [[Le Touquet-Paris-Plage|Le Touquet]],&lt;ref name=&quot;ServRec&quot;/&gt; and in early 1917, accompanied the battalion north in preparation for the upcoming [[Battle of Messines|Messines offensive]].&lt;ref name=&quot;VCs173&quot;/&gt; However, on 8 May 1917, one month before the offensive, Peeler found himself the subject of a [[Drumhead court-martial|court-martial in the field]]. Following an incident that occurred during a training session on 26 April, he was charged with &quot;careless and negligent handling of a Lewis Gun whilst instructing&quot; that led to &quot;grievous bodily injury&quot; to Private John Martin Fife. Found guilty of the charge, Peeler was stripped of his lance corporal stripe.&lt;ref name=&quot;ServRec&quot;/&gt;

On 7 June 1917, Peeler participated in the initial assault on Messines Ridge. Manning a [[Lewis Gun]] during the action,&lt;ref name=&quot;VCs173&quot;/&gt; he was injured twice, suffering shrapnel wounds to his face and eye from an artillery shell, and a gunshot wound to his right cheek.&lt;ref name=&quot;ServRec&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;VCs173&quot;/&gt; He spent three days in hospital before returning to his battalion. On 22 June, he was once again promoted to lance corporal.&lt;ref name=&quot;ServRec&quot;/&gt; The 3rd Pioneer Battalion spent the next four months in a quieter section of the front.&lt;ref name=&quot;VCs173&quot;/&gt;

===Victoria Cross===

As part of the third stage of General [[Herbert Plumer, 1st Viscount Plumer|Sir Herbert Plumer's]] [[Battle of Passchendaele|Passchendaele offensive]], an attack against Broodseinde was scheduled for 4 October 1917.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/units/event_82.asp|title=Battle of Broodseinde Ridge|accessdate=11 November 2009|work=Australian Military Units|publisher=Australian War Memorial}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;VCs167&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Snelling|2000|p=167}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[3rd Division (Australia)|3rd Australian Division]]'s [[10th Brigade (Australia)|10th Australian Infantry Brigade]] was one of the assault formations charged with delivering the main blow, and ultimately with seizing the heavily defended Broodseinde Ridge.&lt;ref name=&quot;VCs167&quot;/&gt; To provide defence against low-flying German aircraft during the attack, a group of 24 men, including Peeler, from the 3rd Pioneer Battalion's machine gun section were attached to the 10th Brigade's 37th Battalion.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;VCs167&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bean&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Bean|1941|p=850}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Battle of Broodseinde|attack on Broodseinde]] began at 06:00 under the cover of an artillery barrage.&lt;ref name=&quot;VCs167&quot;/&gt; Armed with a Lewis Gun, Peeler advanced with the initial wave. The Australians rapidly crossed the first {{convert|100|m|yd}} before becoming pinned down by a party of nine German soldiers, who were situated in a shellhole and sniping at the advancing troops.&lt;ref name=&quot;AF&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;VC Recommendation&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/AWM28/1/148P2/0086.pdf|title=Recommendation for Walter Peeler to be awarded a Victoria Cross|accessdate=13 November 2009|format=PDF|work=Recommendations: First World War|publisher=Australian War Memorial}}&lt;/ref&gt; Firing his machine gun from the hip, Peeler dashed forward across the exposed ground and shot the group of Germans, &quot;clearing the way for the advance&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;AF&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;VC Recommendation&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;VCs168&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Snelling|2000|p=168}}&lt;/ref&gt; He performed similar feats on two subsequent occasions, killing several German soldiers and emerging unscathed.&lt;ref name=&quot;AF&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;VCs168&quot;/&gt;

The Australian force continued to press their assault, encountering pillboxes and machine gun positions as they pushed forward. One such machine gun position, situated in the open, held up the advance. Firing a single burst from his Lewis Gun,&lt;ref name=&quot;VCs168&quot;/&gt; Peeler killed the gunner and caused the remainder of the gun's defenders to seek cover in a nearby dugout.&lt;ref name=&quot;VC Recommendation&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;LG&quot;&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=30400|date=26 November 1917|startpage=12329|supp=yes|accessdate=13 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the Australians then lobbed a &quot;well aimed&quot; grenade into the dugout, driving out ten soldiers whom Peeler then shot.&lt;ref name=&quot;VCs168&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;LG&quot;/&gt; Described as being &quot;particularly prominent in the advance&quot; by historian [[Charles Bean]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Bean&quot;/&gt; Peeler &quot;almost single-handedly&quot; destroyed four German posts in an hour,&lt;ref name=&quot;VCs168&quot;/&gt; accounting for more than 30 soldiers.&lt;ref name=&quot;AF&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;

Peeler is standing at left.]]

By 07:15 the following morning, the 37th Battalion had captured its objective, having seized eight pillboxes, several concrete dugouts, 20 machine guns and 420 [[Prisoner of war|prisoners]]. Two hours later, the Australians were in possession of Broodseinde Ridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Snelling|2000|p=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; For his actions during the battle, Peeler was awarded the Victoria Cross; one of two Australians to be so decorated that day.&lt;ref name=&quot;AF&quot;/&gt; On 12 October, eight days after Peeler's actions, the men of the 10th Brigade returned to the front line in an effort to exploit the success of the previous week. The ground in front of their position was dominated by a series of German pillboxes and had been turned into a [[Bog|quagmire]] by heavy rain.&lt;ref name=&quot;VCs170&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Snelling|2000|p=170}}&lt;/ref&gt; The brigade's attack was soon subject to a &quot;torrent of machine gun fire&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;VCs170&quot;/&gt; and Peeler was severely wounded in his right arm. Initially evacuated to the 11th Australian Field Ambulance casualty station, it was decided that his wound necessitated treatment in England so he embarked for the Northampton War Hospital on 15 October, arriving the following day.&lt;ref name=&quot;ServRec&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;VCs173&quot;/&gt;

While recuperating in England, the announcement and accompanying citation for Peeler's Victoria Cross was promulgated in a supplement to the ''London Gazette'' on 26 November 1917, reading:&lt;ref name=&quot;LG&quot;/&gt;

{{quote|''War Office, 26th November, 1917.''

His Majesty the KING has been graciously pleased to approve of the award of the Victoria Cross to the undermentioned Officer, Non-commissioned Officers and Men: —

No. 114 L./Cpl. Walter Peeler, Aus. Imp. Force.

For most conspicuous bravery when with a Lewis gun accompanying the first wave of the assault he encountered an enemy party sniping the advancing troops from a shell-hole.

L./Cpl. Peeler immediately rushed the position and accounted for nine of the enemy, and cleared the way for the advance. On two subsequent occasions he performed similar acts of valour, and each time accounted for a number of the enemy.

During operations he was directed to a position from which an enemy machine gun was being fired on our troops. He located and killed the gunner, and the remainder of the enemy party ran into a dugout close by. From this shelter they were dislodged by a bomb, and ten of the enemy ran out. These he disposed of.

This non-commissioned officer actually accounted for over thirty of the enemy.

He displayed an absolute fearlessness in making his way ahead of the first wave of the assault, and the fine example which he set ensured the success of the attack against most determined opposition.}}

===Recuperation and repatriation===
As news of Peeler's decoration spread, it prompted a &quot;wave of celebrations&quot; in his hometown of Castlemaine; flags flew in his honour, and one of his daughters was cheered by fellow pupils at her school.&lt;ref name=&quot;VCs173&quot;/&gt; On 8 January 1918, Peeler was formally conferred with his Victoria Cross by [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]] in an investiture ceremony at [[Buckingham Palace]]. Having sufficiently recovered from his wound, Peeler rejoined the 3rd Pioneer Battalion in France on 17 May; he was promoted to temporary [[corporal]] two weeks later.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;VCs173&quot;/&gt;

On 22 June 1918, Peeler was posted to the Corps Gas School for eight days.&lt;ref name=&quot;ServRec&quot;/&gt; He was promoted to [[sergeant]] on 30 July.&lt;ref name=&quot;AF&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Around this time, [[Prime Minister of Australia|Australian Prime Minister]] [[Billy Hughes]] invited several of Australia's Victoria Cross recipients of the war to return to Australia and assist in a recruiting drive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Macklin|2006|p=214}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among a group of ten who accepted the offer, Peeler embarked for Melbourne aboard ''HMAT Medic'' on 24 August, arriving in Melbourne seven weeks later. He would not return to France; on 11 November 1918 an [[Armistice with Germany (Compiègne)|armistice with Germany]] was declared, effectively ending the war. Peeler was discharged from the Australian Imperial Force on 10 December.&lt;ref name=&quot;AF&quot;/&gt;

==Inter-war years==
Following his discharge, Peeler gained employment with the soldier-settler branch of the Victorian Department of Lands. He remained with the department for six years, before acquiring an orchard in the Castlemaine district. However, this venture proved short-lived and he soon returned with his family to Melbourne, joining the H.V. McKay Harvester Works at [[Sunshine, Victoria|Sunshine]]. Also on the company's staff was a fellow Victoria Cross recipient, [[Lawrence Dominic McCarthy]]. When Melbourne's [[Shrine of Remembrance]] was completed in 1934, Peeler was appointed as the memorial's first custodian. He occupied this post for next 30 years, coming to regard the Shrine as &quot;his second home&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;VCs173&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AF2&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Staunton|2005|p=112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second World War==
===Enlistment and Syrian Campaign===
On 27 May 1940, Peeler enlisted in the [[Second Australian Imperial Force]] for service in the [[Second World War]],&lt;ref name=&quot;AF2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WWII&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/script/veteran.asp?ServiceID=A&amp;VeteranID=422696|title=Peeler, Walter|accessdate=20 November 2009|work=World War II Nominal Roll|publisher=Commonwealth of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; giving his date of birth on his enlistment forms as 9 August 1901, thus understating his age by fourteen years.&lt;ref name=&quot;ServRec&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;VCs173&quot;/&gt; At 52, Peeler was twelve years over the maximum age limit, although he later claimed he was not the &quot;oldest fellow in my unit&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;VCs173&quot;/&gt; Granted the acting rank of sergeant, he was allotted to the newly raised 2/2nd Pioneer Battalion.&lt;ref name=&quot;ServRec&quot;/&gt; The battalion completed its initial training at [[Puckapunyal]],&lt;ref name=&quot;2/2nd&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/units/unit_11401.asp|title=2/2nd Pioneer Battalion|accessdate=20 November 2009|work=Australian military units|publisher=Australian War Memorial}}&lt;/ref&gt; during which time Peeler was made acting [[staff sergeant]] and Company Quartermaster Sergeant of D Company on 1 August.&lt;ref name=&quot;ServRec&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;VCs173&quot;/&gt;

On 7 April 1941, the 2/2nd Pioneer Battalion embarked aboard [[RMS Queen Mary|HMT ''Queen Mary'']] at [[Sydney]], bound for the [[Middle East]]; Peeler's rank of staff sergeant was confirmed as substantive on the same day. After just under four weeks at sea, the troopship disembarked at Port Tewfik in [[Suez]], where the battalion entrained for [[British Mandate of Palestine|Palestine]]. There it was attached to the [[7th Division (Australia)|7th Division]] in support of the [[Syria-Lebanon Campaign|Syrian campaign]] against [[Vichy French]] forces.&lt;ref name=&quot;ServRec&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;2/2nd&quot;/&gt;

The 2/2nd Pioneer Battalion was initially divided up, with each company attached to a different brigade of the 7th Division. Peeler's D Company&amp;mdash;assigned to the [[25th Brigade (Australia)|25th Brigade]]&amp;mdash;was originally tasked with the maintenance and general repair of the road network in its locality. However, when the Vichy French launched a counter-attack on 15 June, the battalion was concentrated in the Merdjayoun area in an effort to prevent any further French gains.&lt;ref name=&quot;2/2nd&quot;/&gt; On the night of 27 June, after a [[Battle of Merdjayoun|costly assault against the Vichy French]] at Merdjayoun earlier that day, Peeler led out a patrol to recover the wounded. Four soldiers were discovered and brought back to the Australian lines.&lt;ref name=&quot;AF2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Long|1953|pp=450&amp;ndash;451}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite suffering heavy casualties in Syria, the 2/2nd Pioneer Battalion served throughout the campaign, including participation in the decisive [[Battle of Damour]] in July.&lt;ref name=&quot;2/2nd&quot;/&gt;

After the Vichy French defeat in Syria, the 2/2nd Pioneer Battalion was relocated to [[Tripoli]] in [[Libya]], where it headquartered itself in an olive grove while carrying out training and garrison duties over the next four months. During November, the battalion was moved to [[Qatana]] in Syria, but with the entry of [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] into the war in late 1941, the [[6th Division (Australia)|6th]] and 7th Divisions were directed to return to Australia for service in the [[Pacific War|Pacific theatre]].&lt;ref name=&quot;2/2nd&quot;/&gt; In January 1942, Peeler was among the men of the 2/2nd Pioneer Battalion who embarked aboard [[SS Orcades (1937)|HMT ''Orcades'']] to make the journey back to Australia. He was promoted to [[Warrant officer#Australia|Warrant Officer Class II]] during this time.&lt;ref name=&quot;ServRec&quot;/&gt;

===Defence of Java and prisoner of war===
With the rapid Japanese advance through the Pacific and the [[Battle of Singapore|fall of Singapore]] in February 1942, the 3,400 troops aboard ''Orcades'' were hastily diverted to [[Java]] in the [[Dutch East Indies]].&lt;ref name=&quot;VCs173&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;2/2nd&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wigmore|1957|p=446}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disembarking at [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]] on 18 February,&lt;ref name=&quot;ServRec&quot;/&gt; Peeler's battalion was combined with the other units aboard ''Orcades'' to form Blackforce. This ad hoc grouping, under the command of fellow Victoria Cross holder Brigadier [[Arthur Seaforth Blackburn]], was tasked with defending a series of airfields and supporting the Dutch.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wigmore|1957|pp=457, 495&amp;ndash;496}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blackburn organised his men into a brigade formation, consisting of a headquarters and three infantry battalions&amp;mdash;the men of the 2/2nd Pioneers made up the bulk of Blackforce's 2nd Battalion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wigmore|1957|p=496}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 February 1942, elements of the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] landed on Java.&lt;ref name=&quot;2/2nd&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Landing&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Wigmore|1957|pp=499&amp;ndash;501}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blackforce was stationed at [[Buitenzorg]], poised to advance west to confront the invaders. However, rapid Japanese progress pushed the defending Dutch forces in the opposite direction, and Blackforce was assigned the defence of Buitenzorg and [[Subdistricts of West Java|Leuwiliang]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Landing&quot;/&gt; As the situation deteriorated further, Blackburn was forced to withdraw his men east on the night of 4/5 March, and again on 7/8 March. On 8 March, the Dutch surrendered, ordering all men to lay down their arms. With supplies running low and unable to contact the [[Australian Government]], Brigadier Blackburn announced the surrender of Blackforce four days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wigmore|1957|pp=502&amp;ndash;503}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peeler and his fellow soldiers thus became prisoners of war.

{{quote|My wartime experiences are nothing to make a splash about&amp;nbsp;... I'm just an ex-soldier who did his job. I never saw the faces of those I killed. They were just men in an enemy uniform. It was simply them or me. I don't think I was brave&amp;mdash;not any more than the other Aussies who were with me. I simply had a job to do and I did it&amp;nbsp;... Only afterwards did I realise how lucky I'd been not to get killed myself.|Walter Peeler}}

Survived by his wife, Kathleen, and their four remaining children, he was buried in [[Brighton Cemetery]].
