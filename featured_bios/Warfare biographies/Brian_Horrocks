}}
[[Lieutenant-General (United Kingdom)|Lieutenant-General]] '''Sir Brian Gwynne Horrocks''', [[Order of the Bath|KCB]], [[Order of the British Empire|KBE]], [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]], [[Military Cross|MC]] (7 September 1895 &amp;ndash; 4 January 1985) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[British Army|Army]] officer. He is chiefly remembered as the commander of [[XXX Corps (United Kingdom)|XXX&amp;nbsp;Corps]] in [[Operation Market Garden]] and other operations during the [[World War II|Second World War]]. He also served in the [[World War I|First World War]] and the [[Russian Civil War]], was a [[prisoner of war]] twice, and competed in the [[1924 Summer Olympics|1924 Paris Olympics]]. Later he was a television presenter, authored books on military history, and was [[Black Rod]] in the [[House of Lords]] for 14&amp;nbsp;years.

In 1940 Horrocks commanded a [[battalion]] during the [[Battle of France]], the first time he served under [[Bernard Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein|Bernard Montgomery]], the most prominent British commander of the war. Montgomery later identified Horrocks as one of his most able officers, appointing him to [[corps]] commands in both [[North Africa]] and [[Europe]]. In 1943, Horrocks was seriously wounded and took more than a year to recover before returning to command a corps in Europe. It is likely that this period out of action meant he missed out on promotion;&lt;ref&gt;Warner. ''Horrocks'', p.&amp;nbsp;77.&lt;/ref&gt; his contemporary corps commanders in North Africa, [[Oliver Leese|Leese]] and [[Miles Dempsey|Dempsey]], went on to command at [[Field army|army]] level and above. Horrocks' wound caused continuing health problems and led to his early retirement from the army after the war. 

Since 1945, Horrocks has been regarded by some as one of the most successful [[British Army|British]] generals of the war, &quot;a man who really led, a general who talked to everyone, down to the simplest private soldier&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Generals – The Canadian Army's Senior Commanders in the Second World War|last=Granatstein|page=265}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the  &quot;''beau ideal'' of a corps commander&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mead210&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Churchill's Lions |last=Mead |page=210}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] called him &quot;the outstanding British general under Montgomery&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Warner. ''Horrocks'', p.&amp;nbsp;72.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and First World War==
Horrocks was the only son of Colonel [[William Horrocks|Sir William Horrocks]], a doctor in the [[Royal Army Medical Corps]]. Educated at [[Uppingham School]], an English [[Independent school (UK)|public school]], he entered the [[Royal Military College, Sandhurst]], in 1913.&lt;ref&gt;Warner. ''Horrocks'', pp.&amp;nbsp;3–6.&lt;/ref&gt;  His score was sixth-lowest of the 167 successful applicants for cadetships&amp;mdash;even after the addition of 200 bonus points for an [[Officer Training Corps]] (OTC) certificate, which not all the other candidates had.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Cadetships In The Army |section=News |day_of_week=Friday |date=17 January 1913 |page_number=35 |issue=40111 |column=G}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An unpromising student, he may not have received a commission at all but for the outbreak of the [[World War I|First World War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Horrocks |last=Warner |page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Commissioned on 8 August 1914 into the 1st&amp;nbsp;[[Battalion]] of the [[Middlesex Regiment]],&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=28864|startpage=6205|endpage=6206|date=7 August 1914|accessdate=8 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Second Lieutenant]] Horrocks joined the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]]'s retreat following its baptism of fire at the [[Battle of Mons]]. On 21 October, at the [[Race to the Sea|Battle of Armentières]], his platoon was surrounded, and he was wounded and taken prisoner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Horrocks |last=Warner |page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Incarcerated in a military hospital, he was repeatedly interrogated by his German captors, who believed that the British Army were using [[dum-dum|expanding bullets]] in contravention of the [[Hague Conventions (1899 and 1907)|1899 Hague Convention]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Text of Declaration III of Hague Convention, 1899| work = The Avalon Project| publisher = Yale Law School| url = http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/lawofwar/dec99-03.htm| accessdate =14 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Horrocks' captors refused to change his clothes or sheets, and denied him and a fellow officer basic amenities. Both had temporarily lost the use of their legs, and were forced to crawl to the toilet, which caused Horrocks' wounds to become infected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Horrocks |last=Warner |page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, conditions improved after his discharge and transfer to a [[prisoner of war camp]]. On his way to the camp, Horrocks befriended his German escort&amp;mdash;he attributed their rapport to the mutual respect that front-line troops share.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Full Life |last=Horrocks |page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was promoted to [[First Lieutenant|lieutenant]] on 18 December 1914,&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=29170|supp=yes|startpage=4997|date=21 May 1915|accessdate=22 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite being in enemy hands, and often tried to escape, once coming within {{convert|500|yd|m}} of the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] border before being recaptured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Horrocks |last=Warner |page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was eventually placed in a compound for [[Russia]]n officers, in the hope that the language barrier would hinder his escape attempts; Horrocks used the time to learn the [[Russian language]]. Years later, when working in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]], he surprised [[Nikita Khrushchev]] and [[Nikolai Bulganin]] by greeting them in their native tongue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Horrocks |last=Warner |page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; His resistance in captivity would earn him the [[Military Cross]], awarded in 1920 and backdated to 5 May 1919.&lt;ref name=MC/&gt;

Repatriated at the end of the war, Horrocks had difficulty adapting to a peace-time routine. He went on sprees in [[London]], spending four years of accumulated back-pay in six weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Full Life |last=Horrocks |page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he returned to active service in 1919 when the [[War Office]] called for volunteers who knew Russian.

==Inter-war period==
===Russia===
In 1919 Horrocks was posted to [[Russia]] as part of the [[Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War]]. After landing at [[Vladivostok]] on 19 April, he was taken to British headquarters and briefed. The [[White movement|White Army]] under Admiral [[Aleksandr Kolchak|Kolchak]], with the help of released [[Czechoslovak Legions|Czechoslovak Legion]] prisoners, had driven the [[Red Army]] out of [[Siberia]]. However, Kolchak's Czech troops were returning home, and the British military contingent was urgently trying to replace them with Russians. To accomplish this, the British had just two infantry battalions and two small administrative missions, one charged with training and arming the Russians with British war-surplus equipment, and the other with improving the White Army's communications.&lt;ref&gt;Warner. ''Horrocks'', pp.&amp;nbsp;28–29; Horrocks. ''A Full Life'', p.&amp;nbsp;38.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bolshveki killed at Vladavostak.jpg|thumb|right|Soldiers of Czechoslovak Legion, allied to White army, stand over the bodies of Red Army soldiers killed at Vladivostok. As part of the British mission, Horrocks helped provide aid to the White forces.]]
Horrocks' first task, along with a party of 13&amp;nbsp;British officers and 30 [[other ranks]], was to guard a train delivering 27&amp;nbsp;carriages of shells to the White Army in [[Omsk]], {{convert|3000|mi|km}} away on the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]].&lt;ref&gt;Warner. ''Horrocks'', p.&amp;nbsp;30.&lt;/ref&gt; The journey took more than a month, and as the only party member fluent in Russian, Horrocks had to deal with many of the difficulties they encountered. At every station, he had to ward off station masters intent on acquiring the cars. While stopped in [[Manchuli]], the British officers' presence provoked a [[duel]] between two [[Cossack]] officers. Horrocks accepted an invitation to act as a second, but the pair were arrested before the duel could take place. However, he managed to defuse the situation before it came to trial, by claiming his faulty Russian had been the cause of the misunderstanding.&lt;ref&gt;Horrocks. ''A Full Life'', pp.&amp;nbsp;41–22.&lt;/ref&gt; The train eventually arrived in Omsk on 20 May, with a full cargo.

His next assignment was in [[Yekaterinburg]] in the [[Urals]], where he was appointed second in command of a training school for [[non-commissioned officer]]s attached to the Anglo-Russian Brigade.&lt;ref&gt;Horrocks. ''A Full Life'', p.&amp;nbsp;44; Warner. ''Horrocks'', p.&amp;nbsp;29.&lt;/ref&gt; He found this post frustrating, having to dismiss nearly a third of his initial [[cadre]] on medical grounds, and struggling to get supplies and support from the White Army authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Horrocks. ''A Full Life'', p.&amp;nbsp;45.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, he developed a rapport with his men and an admiration for the Russian soldier.&lt;ref&gt;Warner. ''Horrocks'', p.&amp;nbsp;32.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although British forces were ordered home shortly afterwards, Horrocks and another officer, George Hayes, remained to advise the First Siberian Army.&lt;ref&gt;Horrocks. ''A Full Life'', p.&amp;nbsp;47.&lt;/ref&gt; The White Army was in retreat, and Horrocks joined them as they fell back to Vladivostok, {{convert|3000|mi|km}} away. He was captured by the [[Red Army]] on 7 January 1919, in the town of [[Krasnoyarsk]],&lt;ref&gt;Horrocks. ''A Full Life'', p.&amp;nbsp;53.&lt;/ref&gt; and spent 10&amp;nbsp;months as a prisoner, narrowly surviving severe [[typhus]].&lt;ref&gt;Warner. ''Horrocks'', p.&amp;nbsp;36.&lt;/ref&gt; The British government negotiated a prisoner release, and Horrocks left Russia on 29 October, returning home on the [[Royal Navy]] cruiser [[HMS Delhi (D47)|HMS ''Delhi'']].&lt;ref&gt;Horrocks. ''A Full Life'', p.&amp;nbsp;61.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Back home===
Horrocks rejoined his regiment, based in Germany with the [[British Army of the Rhine]], and followed it to [[Ireland]], then embroiled in the [[Irish War of Independence|Anglo-Irish War]]. There his duties included searching for arms and dealing with ambushes and road-blocks, which he called &quot;a most unpleasant form of warfare&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Horrocks. ''A Full Life'', p.&amp;nbsp;65.&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by a short period in [[Silesia]], to deal with tensions between the [[Poles|Polish]] and [[Germans|German]] populations.

On his return to Britain, Horrocks took up the [[modern pentathlon]]. He competed successfully in army tournaments, and was picked for the British Olympic team for the [[1924 Summer Olympics|1924 Paris Olympics]], where he finished 20th out of 38.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://users.skynet.be/hermandw/olymp/mop1924.html |title= Modern Pentathlon 1924 at Full Olympians|accessdate=24 May 2008 |publisher=Herman De Wael |date=3 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Horrocks spent the remainder of the inter-war years in postings that included [[adjutant]] for the 9th&amp;nbsp;Battalion, Middlesex Regiment of the [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] (1926&amp;mdash;1930);&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=33250|startpage=1189|date=22 February 1927|accessdate=22 April 2008}}&lt;br/&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=33251|startpage=1255|date=25 February 1927|accessdate=22 April 2008}}&lt;br/&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=33681|startpage=379|date=16 January 1931|accessdate=22 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; student at the [[Staff College, Camberley]] (1931&amp;mdash;1932);&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=33682|startpage=459|date=20 January 1931|accessdate=22 April 2008}}&lt;br/&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=33895|startpage=8224|date=23 December 1932|accessdate=22 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Staff Officer|Staff Captain]] at the [[War Office]] (1934&amp;mdash;1936);&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=34019|startpage=678|endpage=680|date=30 January 1934|accessdate=22 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brigade Major]] with the [[5th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|5th Infantry Brigade]] (1936&amp;mdash;1938);&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=34263|startpage=1560|date=10 March 1936|accessdate=22 April 2008}}&lt;br/&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=34479|startpage=735|date=4 February 1938|accessdate=22 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and instructor at the Staff College.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=34539|supp= |startpage=5052|endpage= |date=5 August 2008 |accessdate=22 August 2008}}&lt;br/&gt;
{{LondonGazette|issue=34538|supp=yes|startpage=5016|endpage=5017|date=5 August 1938|accessdate=22 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Territorial Army posting, which Horrocks considered to be among his happiest periods, provided experience in dealing with citizen soldiers, which would prove highly valuable during the Second World War.&lt;ref&gt;Horrocks. ''A Full Life'', p.&amp;nbsp;68.&lt;/ref&gt;  He received a [[brevet (military)|brevet]] [[Major (United Kingdom)|majority]] in 1935, and was promoted to substantive major in 1936, and brevet [[Lieutenant-Colonel (United Kingdom)|lieutenant colonel]] in 1937.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=34343|startpage=7572|date=24 November 1936|accessdate=22 April 2008}}&lt;br/&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=34120|startpage=62|date=1 January 1935|accessdate=22 April 2008}}&lt;br/&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=34414|startpage=4250|date=2 July 1937|accessdate=22 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1928, Horrocks married Nancy Kitchin, daughter of an architect for the [[Local Government Board]]. They had one child, a daughter named Gillian, who drowned in 1979 while swimming in the [[River Thames]].&lt;ref name=ODNB&gt;Lamb. ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second World War==

At the outbreak of the Second World War, Horrocks was working as an instructor at the Staff College, where he had taught since 1938.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=34538|supp=yes|startpage=5016|endpage=5052|date=5 August 1938|accessdate=22 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; After helping organise a new, shorter, officer-training course,&lt;ref&gt;Warner. ''Horrocks'', p.&amp;nbsp;50.&lt;/ref&gt; in December 1939 he was promoted to substantive lieutenant-colonel.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=34787|supp=yes|startpage=770|date=6 February 1940|accessdate=22 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The following May, he was despatched to [[France]] to command the 2nd&amp;nbsp;Battalion, Middlesex Regiment, a machine-gun battalion directly subordinate to the [[3rd Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|3rd&amp;nbsp;Division]] headquarters of Major-General [[Bernard Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein|Bernard Montgomery]]. British [[Military doctrine|doctrine]] at the time retained heavy machine guns under the direct command of a corps or division, rather than as an organic part of subordinate formations.&lt;ref&gt;French. ''Raising Churchill's Army'', p.&amp;nbsp;38.&lt;/ref&gt; He joined the battalion during its retreat to [[Dunkirk]], and after only 17&amp;nbsp;days had impressed his superiors sufficiently to be given the temporary rank of [[brigadier]], and the command of [[11th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|11th&amp;nbsp;Brigade]]. The brigade's previous commander, [[Kenneth Arthur Noel Anderson|Kenneth Anderson]], had been promoted to [[General Officer Commanding]] 3rd&amp;nbsp;Division during the [[Dunkirk evacuation|evacuation]], when [[Alan Brooke, 1st Viscount Alanbrooke|Alan Brooke]], commander of [[II Corps (United Kingdom)|II&amp;nbsp;Corps]], was recalled to the [[United Kingdom]] and Montgomery took over the corps.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mead210&quot;/&gt; On Horrocks' return to Britain, he was given command of [[9th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|9th&amp;nbsp;Brigade]] and assigned to defend against a possible German invasion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mead210&quot;/&gt; A short period as Brigadier General Staff of Western Command followed, before promotion to acting [[Major-General (United Kingdom)|major-general]] and command of [[44th (Home Counties) Infantry Division|44th&amp;nbsp;(Home Counties) Infantry Division]] on 25 June 1941.&lt;ref&gt;Warner. ''Horrocks'', p.&amp;nbsp;60.&lt;br/&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=35205|supp=yes|startpage=3755|date=1 July 1941|accessdate=22 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to his acting rank, he was promoted to substantive [[colonel (United Kingdom)|colonel]] on 28 May 1941 (with seniority backdated to 1 July 1940).&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=35207|supp=yes|startpage=3808|date=1 July 1941|accessdate=22 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1942, Horrocks was given command of the newly formed [[9th Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|9th&amp;nbsp;Armoured Division]] and gained the temporary rank of major-general on 27 June.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=35612|supp=yes|startpage=2861|date=26 June 1942|accessdate=22 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Horrocks, an infantry soldier with no experience in dealing with cavalry, was an unusual choice for commander of an armoured division.&lt;ref&gt;Warner. ''Horrocks'', p.&amp;nbsp;62.&lt;/ref&gt; He trained the division hard, organising a number of exercises to improve the effectiveness of his troops, and to familiarise himself with [[armoured warfare]].&lt;ref&gt;Warner. ''Horrocks'', p.&amp;nbsp;63.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite never having commanded a division in battle, he was further promoted to acting lieutenant-general and sent to [[Egypt]] to command the [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|Eighth Army]]'s [[XIII Corps (United Kingdom)|XIII&amp;nbsp;Corps]], under Montgomery.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=35690|supp=yes|startpage=3855|date=4 September 1942|accessdate=22 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; General [[Harold Alexander, 1st Earl Alexander of Tunis|Harold Alexander]] and Lieutenant-General Montgomery had decided to make a &quot;clean sweep&quot; when replacing the dismissed [[Claude Auchinleck]] as [[Middle East Command|Commander-in-Chief Middle East]] and Eighth Army commander respectively. Officers perceived to have failed under the old regime were removed, and Montgomery's favoured commanders were brought in. Among these was Horrocks, an officer whom Montgomery felt was &quot;exactly what was wanted for the job that lay ahead&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Mead. ''Churchill's Lions'', p.&amp;nbsp;211.&lt;/ref&gt;

===North Africa===
On arriving in North Africa, Horrocks' corps was ordered to defend the [[Battle of Alam el Halfa|Alam el Halfa]] ridge from an expected attack by the [[Afrika Korps]]. Concerned that heavy casualties would jeopardise his planned [[Second Battle of El Alamein|El Alamein offensive]], Montgomery instructed Horrocks to repel Field Marshal [[Erwin Rommel]]'s forces &quot;without getting unduly mauled in the process&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Horrocks. ''A Full Life'', p.&amp;nbsp;108.&lt;/ref&gt; Horrocks prepared for a purely defensive battle, with his armour dug in around the ridge. When the Germans attacked on 30 August, they failed to lure the British tanks towards their [[88mm gun]]s&amp;mdash;a tactic that had previously been used with great success&amp;mdash;and found themselves battered by both artillery and the [[Desert Air Force]].&lt;ref&gt;Mead. ''Churchill's Lions'', p.&amp;nbsp;212.&lt;/ref&gt; The battle ended with the Germans in control of Himeihat hill, but at a high cost, and the Allied forces unwilling to try to re-take it after a failed attack by the [[2nd Division (New Zealand)|2nd&amp;nbsp;New Zealand Division]].&lt;ref&gt;Warner. ''Horrocks'', p.&amp;nbsp;75.&lt;/ref&gt; The army's defensive success raised morale,&lt;ref&gt;Neillands. ''The Desert Rats'', p.&amp;nbsp;138.&lt;/ref&gt; and Horrocks was praised by his subordinate, Brigadier [[George Philip Bradley Roberts|Roberts]], for his &quot;wonderful knack of inspiring confidence and enthusiasm wherever he goes&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts and Bayerlein&lt;/ref&gt; Montgomery, too, was pleased, saying &quot;he deserves great credit for his action on that day&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Warner. ''Horrocks'', p.&amp;nbsp;76.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:2 Battle of El Alamein 002.png|right|thumb|300px|During the attack at El Alamein, 23 October 1942, the [[7th Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|7th&amp;nbsp;Armoured Division]], [[44th (Home Counties) Infantry Division|44th&amp;nbsp;Division]] and the 1st [[Free French Forces|Free French]] Brigade of Horrocks' XIII&amp;nbsp;Corps make a [[feint]] to the south.]] 
Horrocks was offered the command of [[X Corps (United Kingdom)|X&amp;nbsp;Corps]], an armoured corps, in the planned Alamein battle. He refused it, believing that Major-General [[Herbert Lumsden]], a cavalry officer, would be more suited to the role.&lt;ref name=&quot;Warner&quot;&gt;Warner. ''Horrocks'', p.&amp;nbsp;83.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead he retained command of XIII&amp;nbsp;Corps, and was given the task of making a feint to the south to deceive [[Axis powers|Axis forces]], while the main thrust was made by [[XXX Corps (United Kingdom)|XXX&amp;nbsp;Corps]] and X&amp;nbsp;Corps to the north.&lt;ref name=&quot;Warner&quot;/&gt; Montgomery told Horrocks that he was not to incur tank losses, so XIII&amp;nbsp;Corps' offensive operations were limited to small-scale raids.&lt;ref&gt;Warner. ''Horrocks'', p.&amp;nbsp;85.&lt;/ref&gt; In the aftermath of the landmark British victory that followed, Horrocks' corps was assigned to the reserve, and was reduced in size while the rest of the Eighth Army pursued the retreating Axis forces.

Following the fall of [[Tripoli]] in January 1943, the remaining Axis forces retreated to prepared defences in Southern Tunisia, in front of the [[Mareth Line]] built by France before the war. Here in March, Horrocks carried out one of his most successful actions. His corps, composed of the [[British 1st Armoured Division|1st&amp;nbsp;Armoured Division]], a Free French brigade and the attached [[New Zealand]] Corps (which included New Zealand's [[New Zealand 2nd Division|2nd&amp;nbsp;Division]] and the [[British 8th Armoured Brigade]]), was ordered to attack as part of [[Operation Pugilist#Supercharge II|Operation Supercharge]] after XXX&amp;nbsp;Corps failed to breach the line.&lt;ref&gt;Warner. ''Horrocks'', p.&amp;nbsp;92.&lt;/ref&gt; He carried out a [[Flanking maneuver|flanking manoeuvre]] through a pass judged by the Germans to be impenetrable, rendering the Mareth position untenable and forcing the Axis into another retreat. Three [[Italy|Italian]] divisions were destroyed, and the German [[15th Panzer Division]], [[21st Panzer Division (Germany)|21st&amp;nbsp;Panzer Division]] and [[164th Infantry Division (Germany)|164th&amp;nbsp;Division]] were heavily depleted.&lt;ref&gt;Warner. ''Horrocks'', p.&amp;nbsp;93.&lt;/ref&gt; Horrocks was then transferred to [[First Army (United Kingdom)|First Army]] to take over [[IX Corps (United Kingdom)|IX&amp;nbsp;Corps]] after its previous commander, [[John Crocker]], was wounded in a training accident. He led this corps in the final Allied offensive in Tunisia during April and May 1943, capturing [[Tunis]] and accepting the surrender of the remnants of Rommel's [[Army Group Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;Warner. ''Horrocks'', pp.&amp;nbsp;97–98.&lt;/ref&gt; He was [[Mentioned in Despatches]] on 24 June,&lt;ref name=MiD43/&gt; and for his service in Tunisia, was appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] on 5 August.&lt;ref name=CB/&gt; He was also given the rank of temporary lieutenant-general and war substantive major-general.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=36153|supp=yes|startpage=3877|date=27 August 1943|accessdate=22 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1943, Horrocks sustained serious injuries during an air raid at [[Bizerte]], while watching a rehearsal for the [[Allied invasion of Italy#Salerno landings|Salerno landing]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Warner. ''Horrocks'', p.&amp;nbsp;99.&lt;/ref&gt; Bullets from a [[strafing]] German fighter struck his upper chest and carried through the body, piercing his [[lung]]s, [[stomach]], and [[intestine]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Horrocks. ''A Full Life'', p.&amp;nbsp;175.&lt;/ref&gt; He underwent five operations and spent 14&amp;nbsp;months recovering.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt; This injury caused him pain for the rest of his life, and continuing health problems later led to his early retirement from active service.

Horrocks carried the map board with him to provide front-line soldiers with an overview.&lt;ref&gt;Neillands. ''The Desert Rats'', pp.&amp;nbsp;135–136.&lt;/ref&gt;]] 
It was a year before Horrocks recovered sufficiently to tell [[Alan Brooke, 1st Viscount Alanbrooke|Alan Brooke]], the [[Chief of the Imperial General Staff]], that he was &quot;very anxious to be given another corps&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Alanbrooke. ''War Diaries'', p.&amp;nbsp;555.&lt;/ref&gt; Restored to the acting rank of lieutenant-general in August 1944,&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=36769|supp=yes|startpage=4963|date=31 October 1944|accessdate=22 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was sent to France to assume command of [[XXX Corps (United Kingdom)|XXX&amp;nbsp;Corps]] during the cataclysm engulfing the trapped [[7th Army (Wehrmacht)|German Seventh Army]] and [[5th Panzer Army]] in the [[Falaise pocket]]. Montgomery had been dissatisfied with the performance of the corps and its commander, [[Gerard Bucknall]], since the [[Invasion of Normandy|landings in Normandy]] two months earlier.&lt;ref&gt;Smart. ''Biographical Dictionary of British Generals of the Second World War'', p.&amp;nbsp;51.&lt;/ref&gt; Horrocks retained control of XXX&amp;nbsp;Corps during the advance through [[Belgium]], taking [[Brussels]] and at one point covering {{convert|250|mi|km}} in only six days.&lt;ref&gt;Warner. ''Horrocks'', p.&amp;nbsp;110.&lt;/ref&gt; Supplies, however, were a constant concern, with the major French deep-water ports still in German hands, and Allied supply lines stretching perilously back to the Normandy beaches. Montgomery's [[21st Army Group]] was by now operating {{convert|300|mi|km}} from its ports&amp;mdash;twice the distance [[Military logistics|logistical]] planners had accounted for&amp;mdash;so XXX&amp;nbsp;Corps was diverted towards [[Antwerp]] to secure its [[Port of Antwerp|docks and harbour]].&lt;ref name=&quot;French&quot;&gt;French. ''Raising Churchill's Army'', p.&amp;nbsp;119.&lt;/ref&gt; The city and port fell to the [[11th Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|11th&amp;nbsp;Armoured Division]] in early September, but Montgomery halted XXX&amp;nbsp;Corps for resupply short of the wide [[Albert Canal]] to the north of the city, which consequently remained in enemy hands.&lt;ref&gt;Neillands. ''The Battle for the Rhine'', p.&amp;nbsp;53.&lt;/ref&gt; Horrocks regretted this after the war, believing that his corps might have advanced another {{convert|100|mi|km}} with the fuel available,&lt;ref&gt;Horrocks. ''A Full Life'', p.&amp;nbsp;205.&lt;/ref&gt; although it is doubtful this could have been achieved without delays.&lt;ref name=&quot;French&quot;/&gt; Unknown to the Allies, at that time XXX&amp;nbsp;Corps was opposed by only a single German division.&lt;ref&gt;Warner. ''Horrocks'', p.&amp;nbsp;111.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the pause allowed the Germans to regroup around the [[Scheldt]] River, and by the time the Allies resumed their advance, [[Kurt Student|General Student]]'s [[1st Parachute Army (Germany)|First Paratroop Army]] had arrived and set up strong defensive positions along the opposite side of the canal.&lt;ref&gt;Neillands. ''The Battle for the Rhine'', p.&amp;nbsp;58.&lt;/ref&gt; The task of breaking the strengthened German line, which stretched from Antwerp to the North Sea along the Scheldt River, would fall to the [[First Canadian Army]] in the month-long, costly [[Battle of the Scheldt]].&lt;ref&gt;Neillands. ''The Battle for the Rhine'', pp.&amp;nbsp;157–161.&lt;/ref&gt; By mid-September, XXX&amp;nbsp;Corps had been diverted again, this time to the east.  
[[File:Sherman Firefly tank of the Irish Guards Group.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Sherman Firefly]] passes knocked-out British tanks, 17 September 1944. Horrocks' XXX&amp;nbsp;Corps had to advance along a single raised road. This made it easy for German gunners to knock out the leading vehicles, causing delays.]]
Field Marshal Montgomery made his ambitious September thrust across the [[Rhine]] and into Germany's industrial heartland, codenamed [[Operation Market Garden]], a priority for 21st&amp;nbsp;Army Group. XXX&amp;nbsp;Corps under Horrocks was to lead the ground assault, passing along a corridor held by airborne forces in order to link up with the [[British 1st Airborne Division]] in [[Arnhem]] within four days.&lt;ref&gt;Neillands. ''The Battle for the Rhine'', p.&amp;nbsp;87.&lt;/ref&gt; In the event XXX&amp;nbsp;Corps never arrived, and although 1st&amp;nbsp;Airborne clung on to their tenuous position for a further five days, by 21 September almost three-quarters of the division was destroyed or captured.&lt;ref&gt;Neillands. ''The Battle for the Rhine'', pp.&amp;nbsp;151–152.&lt;/ref&gt; Postwar analyses have been divided, some stressing a perceived lack of urgency on the part of Horrocks' men, while others note that German defences in the area were severely underestimated by [[First Allied Airborne Army]]'s [[Military intelligence|intelligence]].&lt;ref&gt;Neillands. ''The Battle for the Rhine'', pp.&amp;nbsp;87–88.&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly important was the failure to identify the remnants of two SS Panzer divisions, which after Normandy had been sent to the Arnhem area for rest and refitting; intelligence had stated that only &quot;a few infantry units and between 50 and 100&amp;nbsp;tanks&quot; were in the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;Neillands. ''The Battle for the Rhine'', pp.&amp;nbsp;96–97.&lt;/ref&gt; A series of counterattacks by Army Group B under [[Walter Model|Field Marshal Model]] kept Horrocks' units on the defensive, and delayed their advance by forcing the British to halt and secure their flank. The terrain over which Horrocks' men had to move was unsuitable, restricting the vanguard ([[Guards Armoured Division]]) to a single narrow raised highway through flat or flooded countryside.&lt;ref&gt;Neillands. ''The Battle for the Rhine'', p.&amp;nbsp;114.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the [[Nijmegen]] Bridge, just {{convert|8|mi|km}} from Arnhem, was not captured by the [[508th Infantry Regiment (United States)|508th Parachute Infantry Regiment]] on the first day as planned, and XXX&amp;nbsp;Corps had to assist in its capture on their arrival in Nijmegen two days later, causing a further delay of 36&amp;nbsp;hours.&lt;ref&gt;Neillands. ''The Battle for the Rhine'', p.&amp;nbsp;106.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Horrocks was not personally blamed for the operation's failure; in fact, during this period the [[82nd Airborne Division (United States)|U.S.&amp;nbsp;82nd Airborne Division]] of [[James M. Gavin]] came under Horrocks' command, and Gavin later wrote: {{quotation|He was truly a unique general officer and his qualities of leadership were greater than any I have ever seen. In lecturing at the American service school I stated frequently that General Horrocks was the finest general officer I met during the war, and the finest corps commander&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Horrocks |last=Warner |page=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;|James Gavin}}

In early 1945, XXX&amp;nbsp;Corps took part in [[Operation Veritable|Operation ''Veritable'']], during which the [[Heer (1935-1945)|German Army]] was finally forced back over the [[Rhine]]. The corps employed firepower on a massive scale,&lt;ref&gt;By this point, XXX&amp;nbsp;Corps possessed 1,050&amp;nbsp;artillery pieces, 114&amp;nbsp;[[Bofors 40 mm gun|Bofors anti-aircraft guns]], 80&amp;nbsp;[[Mortar (weapon)|medium mortars]], 60&amp;nbsp;[[M4 Sherman|Sherman tanks]], 24&amp;nbsp;[[Ordnance QF 17 pounder|17&amp;nbsp;pounder guns]], and 188&amp;nbsp;machine guns (French, p.&amp;nbsp;268).&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;every trick that had been learnt during the past two and a half years was brought into play, and several new ones added&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bidwell p. 290&quot;&gt;Bidwell &amp; Graham. ''Fire-Power – The British Army Weapons &amp; Theories of War 1904–1945'', p.&amp;nbsp;290.&lt;/ref&gt;  For a short period XXX Corps also had nine divisions under its command.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mead214&quot;&gt;Mead. ''Churchill's Lions'', p.&amp;nbsp;214.&lt;/ref&gt; Before the operation, Horrocks accepted an offer to use [[RAF Bomber Command|Bomber Command]] to attack the town of [[Kleve|Cleves]], assisting the advance of the [[15th (Scottish) Division]]. The bombers released {{convert|1384|LT|t}} of high explosive that devastated the town. Horrocks later said that this had been &quot;the most terrible decision I had ever taken in my life&quot; and that he felt &quot;physically sick&quot; when he saw the bombers overhead.&lt;ref&gt;Horrocks. ''Corps Commander'', p.&amp;nbsp;184.&lt;/ref&gt; Operation ''Veritable'' was successful; and by the evening of 9 February (D+1) XXX&amp;nbsp;Corps had broken through the [[Siegfried Line]] and into [[Germany]] with only light casualties.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bidwell p. 290&quot;/&gt; [[Bremen (city)|Bremen]] was captured on 26 April, exposing the [[Sandbostel]] concentration camp, [[Stalag X-B]]. The corps had reached [[Cuxhaven]] by the time [[End of World War II in Europe|hostilities ceased]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Mead214&quot;/&gt;

Horrocks received two further Mentions in Despatches for his service in north-west Europe on 22 March&lt;ref name=MiDMar45/&gt; and 9 August 1945,&lt;ref name=MiDAug45/&gt; and was appointed [[Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] on 5 July.&lt;ref name=KBE/&gt; In addition to his native country's recognition, he was honoured by the governments of Belgium (the [[War Cross (Belgium)|Croix de Guerre 1940 with Palm]] and [[Order of the Crown (Belgium)|Grand Officer of the Order of the Crown with Palm]]), France ([[Croix de guerre 1939–1945|Croix de Guerre]] and [[Légion d'honneur|Commandeur of the Légion d'honneur]]), the Netherlands (Knight Grand Officer of the [[Order of Orange-Nassau]]), Greece (Commander of the Order of King George&amp;nbsp;I), and the United States ([[Legion of Merit]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=37853|supp=yes|startpage=324|date=14 January 1947|accessdate=22 April 2008}}&lt;br/&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documentsonline/details-result.asp?Edoc_Id=7704466&amp;queryType=1&amp;resultcount=8|title=Documents online—Family History: Recommendations for Honours and Awards (Army)—Image details—Horrocks, Brian—Legion of Honour (Commandeur)|format=fee required to view full citation|publisher=[[The National Archives]]|accessdate=23 April 2008}}&lt;br/&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=37761|supp=yes|startpage=5143|date=15 October 1946|accessdate=22 April 2008}}&lt;br/&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=36569|supp=yes|startpage=2913|date=20 June 1944|accessdate=22 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-war career==
Horrocks continued to serve in the armed forces after the war, initially as GOC-in-Chief of [[Western Command (United Kingdom)|Western Command]]&lt;ref&gt;Lamb, ''Brian Horrocks'', ODNB&lt;/ref&gt; receiving substantive promotion to lieutenant-general in 1946, with seniority backdated to 29 December 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=37507|supp=yes|startpage=1475|date=19 March 1946|accessdate=22 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He briefly commanded the [[British Army of the Rhine]], until he fell ill in August 1948;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newspapers.nl.sg/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19480830.2.20.5.aspx
|accessdate=10 September 2011 |title=General Surprises}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was invalided out of the service early in January 1949 by the lingering effects of the wounds he had received in North Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=38512|supp=yes|startpage=245|date=14 January 1949|accessdate=22 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Promoted to Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in the [[King's Birthday Honours]] that year,&lt;ref name=KCB/&gt; he served as Honorary Colonel of a [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] unit of the [[Royal Artillery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=38762|supp=yes|startpage=5465|date=18 November 1949|accessdate=22 April 2008}}&lt;br/&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=40207|supp=yes|startpage=3601|endpage=4199|date=15 June 1954|accessdate=22 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1949 he was appointed [[Black Rod|Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod]],&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=38516|startpage=313|date=18 January 1949|accessdate=22 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; a post traditionally held by retired officers, this appointment was confirmed on the accession of [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II]] in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=39616|supp=yes|startpage=4197|endpage=4199|date=1 August 1952|accessdate=22 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Black Rod has the responsibility of supervising the administration of the [[House of Lords]], controlling admission to it, and taking part in ceremonies. In 1957, Horrocks had the unusual duty of ordering [[Vivien Leigh]] out of the House when she interrupted proceedings to plead that the [[St James's Theatre]] be saved from demolition.&lt;ref&gt;Warner. ''Horrocks'', p.&amp;nbsp;143.&lt;/ref&gt; On other occasions, because the Black Rod had to remain in place during long debates, Horrocks relieved his boredom by completing [[football pools]] tickets. This had the advantage of looking like note-taking to the assembled lords.&lt;ref&gt;Warner. ''Horrocks'', p.&amp;nbsp;144.&lt;/ref&gt; Horrocks held the post of Black Rod until 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=43030|supp=|startpage=5181|date=18 June 1963|accessdate=22 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Horrocks became interested in writing, and submitted articles about military matters to newspapers and magazines including the ''[[Picture Post]]'' and ''[[The Sunday Times]]''. This led to a short but successful career as the presenter of a series of television programmes, ''Men in Battle'' and ''Epic Battle'', produced by [[Huw Wheldon]]. In these, Horrocks lectured on great historical battles, &quot;highlighting excitement and interest&quot; to allow the programmes to appeal to the widest possible audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Lieut-Gen Sir Brian Horrocks |section=Obituaries  |day_of_week=Wednesday |date=9 January 1985|page_number=12 |column=H}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was interviewed extensively for the [[Thames Television]] series, ''[[The World at War]]'', and, to his embarrassment, appeared on the cover of the BBC's ''[[Radio Times]]'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;Horrocks. ''A Full Life'', p.&amp;nbsp;306.&lt;/ref&gt;  After his television career ended, he served on the [[Board of directors|board]] of the housebuilding company [[Bovis Homes Group|Bovis]], and continued writing, contributing a column to ''The Sunday Times'' and editing a series of British Army [[regiment]]al histories.&lt;ref&gt;Warner. ''Horrocks'', pp.&amp;nbsp;153–154.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968 Horrocks collaborated with [[J &amp; L Randall]] as editor of the 'Merit' board game 'Combat'. His portrait and signature appear on the box and in his introduction to the game he states &quot;In war no two battles are ever the same because the terrain is always different and it is this, more than anything else, which influences the composition of the different armies and the tactics employed by the rival Commanders&quot;. 
His autobiography, ''A Full Life'', was published in 1960, and he co-authored ''Corps Commander'', an account of his battles in north-west Europe, published in 1977.

Horrocks acted as a military consultant for the 1977 film [[A Bridge Too Far (film)|''A Bridge Too Far'']], based on Operation Market Garden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.imdb.com/title/tt0075784|accessdate=25 March 2008 |title=A Bridge Too Far [[Internet Movie Database]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The actor [[Edward Fox (actor)|Edward Fox]] played Horrocks in the film, and later commented: {{quotation|I enjoyed all of the films but ''A Bridge Too Far'' is the one I enjoyed the most because of the character I had to play, Lieutenant-General Brian Horrocks. Brian was alive then and I knew him well - we were friends until his death. He was a very particular type of general and it was important that I play the role correctly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/features/attenborough/bridgefar.html |title=A Bridge Too Far (1977) [[British Film Institute]]|accessdate=25 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;|Edward Fox}}

Horrocks died on 4 January 1985, at the age of 89. The memorial service, held at [[Westminster Abbey]] on 26 February, was attended by Major-General Peter Gillett and [[Secretary of State for Defence]] [[Michael Heseltine]], who represented the [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen]] and [[Margaret Thatcher|Prime Minister]] respectively. Thirty regiments and many other formations and associations were represented at the service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Memorial service |section=Deaths |day_of_week=Wednesday |date=27 February 1985|page_number=12 |issue=62073 |column=F}}&lt;/ref&gt;
