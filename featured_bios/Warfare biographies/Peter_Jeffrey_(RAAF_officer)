'''Peter Jeffrey''' [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]], [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|DFC]] (6 July 1913 &amp;ndash; before 10&amp;nbsp;April 1997) was a senior officer and [[flying ace|fighter ace]] in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF). Born in [[Tenterfield, New South Wales|Tenterfield]], New South Wales, he joined the RAAF active reserve in 1934, and transferred to the Permanent Air Force (PAF) shortly before World War&amp;nbsp;II. Posted to the [[Middle East Theatre of World War II|Middle East]] in July 1940, Jeffrey saw action with [[No. 3 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;3 Squadron]] and took command of the unit the following year, earning the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] for his energy and fighting skills. He was appointed wing leader of [[List of Royal Air Force wings|No.&amp;nbsp;234 Wing RAF]] in November 1941, and became an ace the same month with his fifth solo victory. The next month he was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Order]] for his achievements, which included rescuing a fellow pilot who had crash landed in the desert. 

In 1942, Jeffrey was posted to the [[South West Pacific theatre of World War II|South West Pacific]], where he helped organise [[No. 75 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;75 Squadron]] for the [[Battle of Port Moresby|defence of Port Moresby]], and [[No. 76 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;76 Squadron]] prior to the [[Battle of Milne Bay]]. He served two stints in charge of [[No. 2 Operational Conversion Unit RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;2 Operational Training Unit]] in southern Australia before the end of the war, broken by command of [[No. 1 Wing RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 (Fighter) Wing]] in the [[Northern Territory]] and [[Western Australia]] during 1943–44, at which time he was promoted to temporary [[group captain]].  Jeffrey was transferred to the RAAF reserve after the war but returned to the PAF in 1951, holding training posts in Victoria and command of [[RAAF Base Edinburgh]] in South Australia, before resigning in 1956. Outside the military, he was a [[Station (Australian agriculture)|grazier]] and [[stock broker]]. He died in 1997, aged 83.

==Early life==
The son of A.L. Jeffrey, Peter Jeffrey was born in [[Tenterfield, New South Wales|Tenterfield]], New South Wales, on 6&amp;nbsp;July 1913. He was educated at [[Toowoomba Preparatory School|Church of England Preparatory School]] in [[Toowoomba, Queensland|Toowoomba]], Queensland, and at [[Cranbrook School, Sydney|Cranbrook]] in [[Sydney]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Alexander&quot;&gt;Alexander, ''Who's Who in Australia 1962'', p. 449&lt;/ref&gt;  Having spent time as a [[Jackaroo (trainee)|jackaroo]], by 1934 he was in his first year of engineering studies at [[University of Sydney|Sydney University]], residing in [[St. Andrew's College, Sydney|St Andrew's College]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Newton&quot;&gt;Newton, ''Australian Air Aces'', pp. 93&amp;ndash;94&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Garrisson&quot;&gt;Garrisson, ''Australian Fighter Aces'', pp. 142&amp;ndash;143&lt;/ref&gt; In December that year, he enlisted as an air cadet in the RAAF active reserve, known as the Citizen Air Force (CAF).&lt;ref name=&quot;AWM&quot;&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/units/people_20333.asp Group Captain Peter Jeffrey] at [[Australian War Memorial]].

Jeffrey undertook flying instruction on the 1935 'B'&amp;nbsp;(reservists) course conducted by [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron]] at [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Laverton Base|RAAF Station Laverton]], and was commissioned as a [[pilot officer]] in July.&lt;ref name=&quot;AWM&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp. 239&amp;ndash;240&lt;/ref&gt; Serving with [[No. 22 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;22 (City of Sydney) Squadron]] from July 1936, he transferred from the CAF to the Permanent Air Force (PAF) on a short-service commission in May 1938. He was then assigned to [[No. 1 Flying Training School RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School]] at [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Point Cook Base|RAAF Point Cook]], Victoria, as an [[Flight instructor|instructor]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Garrisson&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AWM&quot;/&gt; In January 1939, he was posted to Britain to attend the Specialists Signals Course at [[Royal Air Force College Cranwell]], and was promoted to [[flight lieutenant]] in September.&lt;ref name=&quot;Newton&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Garrisson&quot;/&gt;

==World War II==
Completing his course at Cranwell in November 1939, Jeffrey returned to Australia the following January as Signals Officer with [[No. 3 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;3 (Army Cooperation) Squadron]] at [[RAAF Base Richmond|RAAF Station Richmond]], New South Wales.&lt;ref name=&quot;Newton&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Garrisson&quot;/&gt; He resumed flying duties in June 1940,&lt;ref name=&quot;Garrisson&quot;/&gt; and posted out to the [[Middle East Theatre of World War II|Middle East]] as a [[Flight (military unit)|flight commander]] with No.&amp;nbsp;3 Squadron on 15&amp;nbsp;July.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alexander&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Newton&quot;/&gt;

Sailing via [[Mumbai|Bombay]], India, No.&amp;nbsp;3 Squadron arrived at [[Suez]], Egypt, in late August 1940.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p. 80&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Herington, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/28/chapters/03.pdf ''Air War Against Germany and Italy'', p. 57]&lt;/ref&gt; Along with most of his comrades, Jeffrey flew obsolescent [[Gloster Gladiator]] biplanes in support of the Australian [[6th Division (Australia)|6th Division]] during the [[North African Campaign]], but he claimed no victories at this stage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, ''Gloster Gladiator Aces'', p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;  Promoted [[squadron leader]], he took over No.&amp;nbsp;3 Squadron from Wing Commander [[Ian Dougald McLachlan|Ian McLachlan]] on 13&amp;nbsp;February 1941, by which time the unit had converted to [[Hawker Hurricane]] monoplane fighters.&lt;ref&gt;Herington, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/28/chapters/03.pdf ''Air War Against Germany and Italy'', p. 70]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, ''Hurricane Aces'', pp. 49, 92&lt;/ref&gt; Based at [[Benina International Airport|RAF Benina]] in defence of [[Benghazi]] when Jeffrey assumed command, No.&amp;nbsp;3 Squadron retreated eastwards only hours ahead of German tanks after [[Erwin Rommel|Rommel]] launched his offensive in April. The Australians were forced to use ten different airfields in as many days before the Allies regrouped.&lt;ref name=&quot;SMH&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|title= Peter Jeffrey DSO, DFC |journal=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |page=p. 36|date=10 April 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jeffrey was flying a Hurricane when he claimed his first aerial victory on 15&amp;nbsp;April 1941. Following a flight of four German [[Junkers Ju&amp;nbsp;52]] transports back to their base near [[Fort Capuzzo]], Libya, he shot one down before it landed and strafed the other three on the ground, setting all on fire.&lt;ref name=&quot;Newton&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Herington, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/28/chapters/04.pdf ''Air War Against Germany and Italy'', p. 74]&lt;/ref&gt; He was decorated with the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] (DFC) for this exploit, as well as his &quot;untiring efforts&quot; and &quot;high standard of efficiency&amp;nbsp;... under extremely trying conditions&quot;; the award was promulgated in the ''[[London Gazette]]'' on 13&amp;nbsp;May.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue= 35161|supp=yes|startpage=2744|endpage=2745|date=13 May 1941|accessdate=on 18 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; After converting to [[Curtiss P-40 Warhawk|P-40 Tomahawks]] the same month, No.&amp;nbsp;3 Squadron took part in the [[Syria-Lebanon Campaign]]. Jeffrey scored the unit's first victory in the new fighter when he shot down in flames an Italian [[Junkers Ju&amp;nbsp;88]] over the sea near [[Beirut]] on 13&amp;nbsp;June 1941.&lt;ref name=&quot;Newton&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas p. 8&quot;&gt;Thomas, ''Tomahawk and Kittyhawk Aces'', pp. 8&amp;ndash;9&lt;/ref&gt; Within two days he had followed this up by destroying a [[Vichy France|Vichy French]] [[Martin Maryland|Martin 167]] bomber in southern Syria.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas p. 8&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Herington, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/28/chapters/05.pdf ''Air War Against Germany and Italy'', p. 91]&lt;/ref&gt; Jeffrey was credited with another Ju&amp;nbsp;88 before the squadron returned to North Africa in September to support the Allied counter-attack against the [[Afrika Korps]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Garrisson&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Shores&quot;&gt;Shores; Williams, ''Aces High'', p. 192&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Remembering 1941&quot;&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/events/conference/2001/stephens.asp 2001 History Conference &amp;ndash; Remembering 1941] at Australian War Memorial.

As commanding officer of No.&amp;nbsp;3 Squadron, Jeffrey came up with innovative ways of improving morale in the face of living conditions that were &quot;primitive at best&quot;. On one occasion he arranged accommodation for his men near a beach, well away from the din of night-time bombing that was causing them to lose sleep on a regular basis. Another of his more &quot;radical ideas&quot; and lasting legacies was a combined [[mess]] for all pilots in the combat zone, whether [[Officer (armed forces)|commissioned]] or [[Non-commissioned officer|non-commissioned]]. The concept was initially frowned upon by [[Royal Air Force]] units; however when Air Vice Marshal [[Arthur Coningham (RAF officer)|&quot;Mary&quot; Coningham]] dined at the shared mess on 11&amp;nbsp;October 1941 and gave his approval, it took root across the entire [[Desert Air Force]]; leading ace [[Clive Caldwell]] later put the same idea into practice as commander of the RAAF's [[No. 1 Wing RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 (Fighter) Wing]] in [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], Northern Territory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/events/conference/2003/scully.asp Fighter Operations – North Africa and the Middle East] at Australian War Memorial. Retrieved on 18 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, ''Clive Caldwell'', p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; One of No.&amp;nbsp;3 Squadron's [[flight sergeant]]s recalled that Jeffrey made it a rule for new pilots to get to know their ground crew to increase their sense of comradeship, and also gave one of his senior [[warrant officer]]s special responsibility for keeping track of the location of Allied airfields and petrol supplies to ensure that the unit was never short of fuel or places to land in an emergency.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/transcripts/kmsa/s00943_tran.htm Thom, John 'Jock' (Flight Sergeant)] at Australian War Memorial.

Having been promoted to temporary [[Wing Commander (rank)|wing commander]] and appointed wing leader of [[List of Royal Air Force wings|No.&amp;nbsp;234 Wing RAF]] earlier in the month,&lt;ref name=&quot;Garrisson&quot;/&gt; Jeffrey was credited with a share in the destruction of a [[Messerschmitt Bf&amp;nbsp;110]] heavy fighter on 20&amp;nbsp;November. Two days later he was shot down himself, but was uninjured and managed to make his way back to base.&lt;ref name=&quot;Newton&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Shores&quot;/&gt; On 25&amp;nbsp;November, above cheering Allied soldiers [[Siege of Tobruk|besieged in Tobruk]], Jeffrey led No.&amp;nbsp;3 Squadron and [[No.&amp;nbsp;112 Squadron RAF]] in an attack on [[Axis powers|Axis]] bombers that resulted in seven enemy aircraft being destroyed and eight damaged, against one Tomahawk lost.&lt;ref name=&quot;Remembering 1941&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, ''Air Force Australia'', p. 81&lt;/ref&gt; He scored his fifth solo victory during the engagement, shooting down a Bf&amp;nbsp;110, and damaged another.&lt;ref name=&quot;Newton&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Garrisson&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, ''Tomahawk and Kittyhawk Aces'', p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; On 30&amp;nbsp;November, Jeffrey rescued one of his old comrades from No.&amp;nbsp;3 Squadron, [[Sergeant Pilot]] Allan Cameron, who had crash-landed behind enemy lines. Nicknamed &quot;Tiny&quot;, Cameron had the bulkiest frame of any man in the unit, and after landing Jeffrey had to ditch his parachute to make room for his passenger in the Tomahawk's cockpit. He nevertheless managed to take off and return to base, and Cameron went on to survive the war and become an ace in the process.&lt;ref&gt;Herington, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/28/chapters/09.pdf ''Air War Against Germany and Italy'', p. 206]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, ''Tomahawk and Kittyhawk Aces'', pp. 18–19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garrisson, ''Australian Fighter Aces'', pp. 122, 142&lt;/ref&gt; For this and other achievements Jeffrey was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Order]] on 12&amp;nbsp;December 1941. As well as his rescue of the downed pilot, the citation paid tribute to his &quot;great success&quot; as wing leader, his &quot;fine fighting spirit&quot; in returning to base after having been shot down himself, and to his &quot;magnificent leadership, fearlessness and skill&quot; that had &quot;contributed in a large measure to the successes achieved&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=35378|supp=yes|startpage=7051|date=12 December 1941|accessdate=on 18 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the month, Jeffrey was posted back to Australia to serve in the [[South West Pacific theatre of World War II|South West Pacific]]. He was credited with a total of five aerial victories in the Middle East, plus one shared and one damaged, though he was considered to be &quot;conservative&quot; in his scoring.&lt;ref name=&quot;Newton&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, ''Tomahawk and Kittyhawk Aces'', p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;

===South West Pacific===
Arriving in Australia in January 1942, Jeffrey briefly took charge the following month of [[RAAF Bankstown]], New South Wales.&lt;ref name=&quot;AWM&quot;/&gt; On 4&amp;nbsp;March he became the inaugural commander of [[No. 75 Squadron RAAF|No. 75 (Fighter) Squadron]], operating newly delivered [[Curtiss P-40 Warhawk|P-40 Kittyhawks]]. Forming the squadron in [[Townsville, Queensland|Townsville]], Queensland, Jeffrey was responsible for readying it for the [[Battle of Port Moresby|defence of Port Moresby]], which would become one of the crucial early battles in the [[New Guinea campaign]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 139–141&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/23.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 458–461]&lt;/ref&gt;  Although it included two other veterans of No.&amp;nbsp;3 Squadron in the Middle East, Flight Lieutenants [[John Francis Jackson|&quot;Old John&quot; Jackson]] and [[Peter Turnbull (RAAF officer)|Peter Turnbull]], most of the unit's pilots were untried, and Jeffrey had only nine days to instil in them basic principles of combat flying, gunnery and tactics. He handed over command to Jackson on 19&amp;nbsp;March, but assisted in ferrying the Kittyhawks to Moresby two days later, only to be fired upon by nervous [[Anti-aircraft artillery|anti-aircraft gunners]] as he came in to land with Turnbull and two other pilots. All four aircraft were damaged, and Jeffrey came within inches of death as a bullet flew past his skull and into the headrest of his seat. By 24&amp;nbsp;March, No.&amp;nbsp;75 Squadron had already shot down a number of Japanese raiders; having witnessed it &quot;quickly established as a fighting unit&quot;, Jeffrey returned to Australia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, ''Tomahawk and Kittyhawk Aces'', p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; He immediately began working up a second new Kittyhawk unit for service in New Guinea, [[No. 76 Squadron RAAF|No. 76 (Fighter) Squadron]]. Based in Townsville at this stage, it was subsequently commanded by Peter Turnbull and joined No.&amp;nbsp;75 Squadron in the [[Battle of Milne Bay]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Garrisson&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/29.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 603–605]&lt;/ref&gt;
