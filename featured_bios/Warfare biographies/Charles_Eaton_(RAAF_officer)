'''Charles Eaton''' [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]], [[Air Force Cross (United Kingdom)|AFC]] (21&amp;nbsp;December 1895 &amp;ndash; 12&amp;nbsp;November 1979) was a senior officer and aviator in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF), who later served as a diplomat. Born in London, he joined the [[British Army]] upon the outbreak of [[World War I|World War&amp;nbsp;I]] and saw action on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] before transferring to the [[Royal Flying Corps]] in 1917. Posted as a bomber pilot to [[No. 206 Squadron RAF|No.&amp;nbsp;206 Squadron]], he was twice captured by German forces, and twice escaped. Eaton left the military in 1920 and worked in India until moving to Australia in 1923. Two years later he joined the RAAF, serving initially as an [[Flight instructor|instructor]] at [[No. 1 Flying Training School RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School]]. Between 1929 and 1931, he was chosen to lead three expeditions to search for lost aircraft in [[Central Australia]], gaining national attention and earning the [[Air Force Cross (United Kingdom)|Air Force Cross]] for his &quot;zeal and devotion to duty&quot;.   

In 1939, on the eve of [[World War II]], Eaton became the inaugural [[Commanding Officer]] of [[No. 12 Squadron RAAF|No. 12 (General Purpose) Squadron]] at the newly established [[RAAF Base Darwin|RAAF Station Darwin]] in Northern Australia. Promoted [[Group Captain]] the following year, he was appointed an [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] in 1942. He took command of [[No. 79 Wing RAAF|No. 79 Wing]] at [[Batchelor, Northern Territory|Batchelor]], Northern Territory in 1943, and was [[Mentioned in Despatches]] during operations in the [[South West Pacific theatre of World War II|South West Pacific]]. Retiring from the RAAF in December 1945, Eaton took up diplomatic posts in the [[Dutch East Indies]], heading a [[United Nations]] commission as [[Consul (representative)|Consul-General]] during the [[Indonesian National Revolution]]. He returned to Australia in 1950, and served in [[Canberra]] for a further two years. Popularly known as &quot;Moth&quot; Eaton, he was a farmer in later life, and died in 1979 at the age of 83.

Charles Eaton was born on 21&amp;nbsp;December 1895 in [[Lambeth]], London, the son of William Walpole Eaton, a butcher, and his wife Grace. Schooled in [[Wandsworth]], he worked in [[Battersea|Battersea Town Council]] from the age of fourteen, before joining the [[London Regiment]] upon the outbreak of [[World War I]] in August 1914.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;&gt;[http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A140082b.htm?hilite=eaton Eaton, Charles (1895 &amp;ndash; 1979)] at [http://adbonline.anu.edu.au/adbonline.htm Australian Dictionary of Biography Online].

On 14&amp;nbsp;May 1915, Eaton transferred to the [[Royal Flying Corps]] (RFC), undergoing initial pilot training at [[Oxford]]. While landing his [[Farman MF.11|Maurice Farman Shorthorn]] at the end of his first solo flight, another student collided with him and was killed, but Eaton emerged  uninjured.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cross and Cockade&quot;/&gt; He was commissioned in August and was awarded his [[Flying badge|wings]] in October. Ranked [[Lieutenant]], he served with [[No. 110 Squadron RAF|No.&amp;nbsp;110 Squadron]], which operated [[Martinsyde G.100|Martinsyde G.100 &quot;Elephant&quot;]] fighters out of [[Sedgeford]], defending London against [[Zeppelin]] airships.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cas.awm.gov.au/item/P03531.004 P03531.004] at [[Australian War Memorial]].

Eaton remained in the RAF following the cessation of hostilities. He married Beatrice Godfrey in St. Thomas's church at [[Shepherd's Bush]], London, on 11&amp;nbsp;January 1919. Posted to [[No. 1 Squadron RAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron]], he was a pilot on the first regular passenger service between London and Paris, ferrying delegates to and from the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Peace Conference]] at [[Versailles]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Grose&quot;/&gt; Eaton was sent to India in December to undertake aerial survey work, including the first such survey of the [[Himalayas]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Farram&quot;&gt;Farram, ''Charles &quot;Moth&quot; Eaton'', pp. 1&amp;ndash;3&lt;/ref&gt; He resigned from the RAF in July 1920, remaining in India to take up employment with the Imperial Forest Service. After successfully applying for a position with the [[Queensland]] Forestry Service, he and his family migrated to Australia in 1923.&lt;ref name=&quot;Farram&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, ''Who's Who in Australia 1950'', p. 235&lt;/ref&gt; Moving to [[South Yarra, Victoria|South Yarra]], Victoria, he enlisted as a [[Flying Officer]] in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) at [[Laverton, Victoria|Laverton]] on 14&amp;nbsp;August 1925.&lt;ref name=&quot;WW2&quot;&gt;[http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/script/veteran.asp?ServiceID=R&amp;VeteranID=1046384 Eaton, Charles] at [http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/ World War 2 Nominal roll].

Regarded as one of the RAAF's most skilful cross-country pilots and navigators, Eaton came to public attention as leader of three military expeditions to find lost aircraft in [[Central Australia]] between 1929 and 1931.&lt;ref name=&quot;Third Brother pp.297-303&quot;&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp. 297&amp;ndash;303&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lax&quot;&gt;Lax, ''100 Years of Aviation'', p. 81&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1929, he coordinated the Air Force's part in the search for aviators Keith Anderson and Bob Hitchcock, missing in their aircraft the ''Kookaburra'' while themselves looking for [[Charles Kingsford Smith]] and [[Charles Ulm]], who had force landed the ''[[Southern Cross (aircraft)|Southern Cross]]'' in north [[Western Australia]] during a flight from Sydney. Three of the RAAF's five &quot;ancient&quot; [[Airco DH.9|DH.9]] biplanes went down in the search&amp;mdash;though all crews escaped injury&amp;mdash;including Eaton's, which experienced what he labelled &quot;a good crash&quot; on 21&amp;nbsp;April near [[Tennant Creek]] after the engine's pistons melted. With the wreck of the ''Kookaburra'' located by Captain [[Lester Brain]] in a [[Qantas]] aircraft, Eaton led the ground party that buried the crew, who had perished of thirst and exposure. Following the burial, Eaton, not a particularly religious man, recalled seeing a perfect cross formed by [[cirrus cloud]] in an otherwise clear blue sky above the ''Kookaburra''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lax&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Farram, ''Charles &quot;Moth&quot; Eaton'', pp. 4&amp;ndash;12&lt;/ref&gt; The Air Board described the RAAF's search as taking 240 hours flying time &quot;under the most trying conditions&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;where a forced landing meant certain crash&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Third Brother pp.297-303&quot;/&gt; In November 1930, Eaton was selected to lead another expedition for a missing aircraft near [[Uluru|Ayers Rock]], but it was called off soon afterwards when the pilot showed up in [[Alice Springs]]. The next month, however, he was ordered to search for W.L. Pittendrigh and S.J. Hamre, who had disappeared in the biplane ''Golden Quest&amp;nbsp;2'' while attempting to discover [[Lasseter's Reef]]. Employing a total of four DH.60 Moths, the RAAF team located the missing men near Dashwood Creek on 7&amp;nbsp;January 1931, and they were rescued four days later by a ground party accompanied by Eaton. While staying in nearby Alice Springs, he recommended a site for the town's new airfield, which was approved and has remained in use ever since.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lax&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Farram, ''Charles &quot;Moth&quot; Eaton'', pp. 13&amp;ndash;17&lt;/ref&gt;

Eaton was awarded the [[Air Force Cross (United Kingdom)|Air Force Cross]] on 10&amp;nbsp;March 1931 &quot;in recognition of his zeal and devotion to duty in conducting flights to Central Australia in search of missing aviators&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=33697|supp=yes|startpage=1648|date=10 March 1931|accessdate=16 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The media called him the &quot;'Knight Errant' of the desert skies&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lax&quot;/&gt; Aside from his crash landing in the desert while searching for the ''Kookaburra'', Eaton had another narrow escape in 1929 when he was test flying the [[Wackett Warrigal|Wackett Warrigal I]] with [[Sergeant]] Eric Douglas. Having purposely put the biplane trainer into a spin and finding no response in the controls when he tried to recover, Eaton called on Douglas to bail out. When Douglas stood up to do so, the spin stopped, apparently due to his torso changing the airflow over the tail plane. Eaton then managed to land the aeroplane, he and his passenger both badly shaken by the experience.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p. 268&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1931, he was posted to No.&amp;nbsp;1 Aircraft Depot at Laverton, where he continued to fly in addition to performing administrative work. Promoted [[Squadron Leader]] in 1936,&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; he undertook a clandestine mission around the new year to scout for suitable landing grounds in the [[Dutch East Indies]], primarily [[Timor]] and [[Ambon Island|Ambon]]. Wearing civilian clothes, he and his companion were arrested and held for three days by local authorities in [[Kupang|Koepang]], Dutch Timor.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p. 450&lt;/ref&gt; Eaton was appointed [[Commanding Officer]] (CO) of [[No. 21 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;21 Squadron]] in May 1937, one of his first tasks being to undertake another aerial search in Central Australia, this time for prospector Sir Herbert Gepp, who was subsequently discovered alive and well.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lax&quot;/&gt; Later that year, Eaton presided over the court of inquiry into the crash of a [[Hawker Demon]] biplane in Victoria, recommending a gallantry award for [[Aircraftman]] [[William McAloney]], who had leapt into the Demon's burning wreckage in an effort to rescue its pilot; McAloney subsequently received the [[Albert Medal (lifesaving)|Albert Medal]] for his heroism.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp. 342&amp;ndash;344&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a plan hatched in 1937 for the first [[Northern Australia|north Australian]] RAAF base, in April 1938 Eaton, now on the Headquarters staff of [[RAAF Williams#RAAF_Williams_Laverton_Base|RAAF Station Laverton]], and [[Wing Commander (rank)|Wing Commander]] [[George Jones (RAAF officer)|George Jones]], Director of Personnel Services at RAAF Headquarters, flew an [[Avro Anson]] on an inspection tour of [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], Northern Territory. They then began developing plans for the new station, to be commanded by Jones, and a new squadron that would be based there, led by Eaton. Delays meant that [[No. 12 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;12 (General Purpose) Squadron]] was not formed until 6&amp;nbsp;February 1939 at Laverton. Jones had moved on to another posting by this time but Eaton took up the squadron's command as planned. Promoted to Wing Commander on 1&amp;nbsp;March, he and his equipment officer, Flying Officer Hocking, were ordered to build up the unit as quickly as possible, and established an initial complement of fourteen officers and 120 airmen, plus four Ansons and four Demons, within a week. An advance party of thirty [[Non-commissioned officer|NCOs]] and airmen under Hocking began moving to Darwin on 1&amp;nbsp;July. Life at the newly established air base had a &quot;distinctly raw, pioneering feel about it&quot; according to Air Force historian Chris Coulthard-Clark, but morale was good.&lt;ref name=&quot;Third Brother pp.145-148&quot;&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp. 145&amp;ndash;148&lt;/ref&gt; On 31&amp;nbsp;August, No.&amp;nbsp;12 Squadron launched its first patrol over the Darwin area, flown by one of seven Ansons that had so far been delivered. These were augmented by a [[Flight (military unit)|flight]] of four [[CAC Wirraway]]s (replacing the originally planned complement of Demons) that took off from Laverton on 2&amp;nbsp;September, the day before [[Military history of Australia during World War II‎|Australia declared war]], and arrived in Darwin four days later. A fifth Wirraway in the flight crashed on landing, killing both crewmen.&lt;ref name=&quot;Third Brother pp.145-148&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Farram, ''Charles &quot;Moth&quot; Eaton'', p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

Once war was declared, Darwin began to receive more attention from military planners. In June 1940, No.&amp;nbsp;12 Squadron was &quot;cannibalised&quot; to form two additional units, [[RAAF Base Darwin|Headquarters RAAF Station Darwin]] and [[No. 13 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;13 Squadron]]. No.&amp;nbsp;12 Squadron retained its Wirraway flight, while its two flights of Ansons went to the new squadron; these were replaced later that month by more capable [[Lockheed Hudson]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/06.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939&amp;ndash;1942'', pp. 125&amp;ndash;126]&lt;/ref&gt;  Eaton was appointed CO of the base, gaining promotion to temporary [[Group Captain]] in September.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; His squadrons were employed in escort, maritime reconnaissance, and coastal patrol duties, the overworked aircraft having to be sent to [[RAAF Base Richmond|RAAF Station Richmond]], New South Wales after every 240 hours flying time&amp;mdash;with a consequent three-week loss from Darwin's strength&amp;mdash;as deep maintenance was not yet possible in the Northern Territory.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison&quot;/&gt; Soon after the establishment of Headquarters RAAF Station Darwin, Minister for Air [[James Fairbairn]] visited the base. Piloting his own light plane, he was greeted by four Wirraways that proceeded to escort him into landing; the Minister subsequently complimented Eaton on the &quot;keen-ness and efficiency of all ranks&quot;, particularly considering the challenging environment.&lt;ref&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Units of the Royal Australian Air Force'', p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; When Fairbairn died in the [[Canberra air disaster, 1940|Canberra air disaster]] shortly afterwards, his pilot was Flight Lieutenant Robert Hitchcock, son of Bob Hitchcock of the ''Kookaburra'' and also a former member of Eaton's No.&amp;nbsp;21 Squadron.&lt;ref name=&quot;Farram, p. 27&quot;&gt;Farram, ''Charles &quot;Moth&quot; Eaton'', p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, ''The Brotherhood of Airmen'', pp. 36&amp;ndash;37&lt;/ref&gt;

As senior air commander in the region, Eaton sat on the Darwin Defence Co-ordination Committee. He was occasionally at loggerheads with his naval counterpart, [[Captain (naval)|Captain]] E.P. Thomas, and also incurred the ire of [[trade union]]ists when he used RAAF staff to unload ships in [[Port Darwin]] during [[Strike action|industrial action]]; Eaton himself took part in the work, shovelling coal alongside his men.&lt;ref&gt;Farram, ''Charles &quot;Moth&quot; Eaton'', p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; On 25&amp;nbsp;February 1941, he made a flight north to reconnoitre Timor, Ambon, and Babo in [[Netherlands New Guinea|Dutch New Guinea]] for potential use by the RAAF in any Pacific conflict.&lt;ref name=&quot;Farram, p. 27&quot;/&gt; By April, the total strength based at RAAF Station Darwin had increased to almost 700 officers and airmen; by the following month it had been augmented by satellite airfields at [[Bathurst Island (Northern Territory)|Bathurst Island]], [[Groote Eylandt]], [[Batchelor, Northern Territory|Batchelor]], and [[Katherine, Northern Territory|Katherine]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Farram, ''Charles &quot;Moth&quot; Eaton'', p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; Handing over command of Darwin to Group Captain [[Frederick Scherger]] in October, Eaton took charge of [[No. 2 Service Flying Training School RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;2 Service Flying Training School]] near [[Wagga Wagga, New South Wales|Wagga Wagga]], New South Wales.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p. 136&lt;/ref&gt; His &quot;marked success&quot;, &quot;untiring energy&quot;, and &quot;tact in handling men&quot; while in the Northern Territory were recognised in the new year with his appointment as an [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=35399|supp=yes|startpage=13|date=1 January 1942|accessdate=16 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eaton became CO of No.&amp;nbsp;1 Engineering School and its base, [[Ascot Vale, Victoria|RAAF Station Ascot Vale]], Victoria, in April 1942.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison&quot;/&gt; Twelve months later in [[Townsville, Queensland|Townsville]], Queensland, he formed [[No. 72 Wing RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;72 Wing]], which subsequently deployed to [[Merauke]] in Dutch New Guinea, comprising [[No. 84 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp; 84 Squadron]] (flying [[CAC Boomerang]] fighters), [[No. 86 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp; 86 Squadron]] ([[Curtiss P-40|P-40 Kittyhawk]] fighters), and [[No. 12 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;12 Squadron]] ([[A-31 Vengeance]] dive bombers).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/07.pdf Odgers, ''Air War Against Japan'', pp. 114&amp;ndash;115]&lt;/ref&gt;  However, his relations with the Area Command in Townsville were strained; &quot;mountains were made out of molehills&quot; in his opinion, and he was reassigned that July to lead No.&amp;nbsp;2 Bombing and Gunnery School in [[Port Pirie, South Australia|Port Pirie]], South Australia.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;

On 30&amp;nbsp;November 1943, Eaton returned to the Northern Territory to establish [[No. 79 Wing RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;79 Wing]] at Batchelor, comprising [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1]] and [[No. 2 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;2 Squadrons]] (flying [[Bristol Beaufort]] light reconnaissance bombers), [[No. 31 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;31 Squadron]] ([[Bristol Beaufighter]] long-range fighters), and [[No. 18 (Netherlands East Indies) Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;18 (Netherlands East Indies)

On 19&amp;nbsp;April, he organised a large raid against [[South Central Timor Regency|Su]], Dutch Timor, employing thirty-five Mitchells, Beauforts and Beaufighters to destroy the town's barracks and fuel dumps, the results earning him the personal congratulations of the [[Air Officer Commanding]] NWA, Air Vice Marshal [[Adrian Cole (RAAF officer)|&quot;King&quot; Cole]], for his &quot;splendid effort&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Farram pp.48-49&quot;/&gt; On the day of the Allied landings, 22&amp;nbsp;April, the Mitchells and Beaufighters made a daylight raid on [[Dili]], Portuguese Timor. The ground assault met little opposition, credited in part to the air bombardment in the days leading up to it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers&quot;/&gt; In June&amp;ndash;July, No.&amp;nbsp;79 Wing supported the [[Battle of Noemfoor|Allied attack on Noemfoor]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/15.pdf Odgers, ''Air War Against Japan'', pp. 243&amp;ndash;244]&lt;/ref&gt; Eaton was recommended to be [[Mentioned in Despatches]] on 28&amp;nbsp;October 1944 for his &quot;Gallant and distinguished service&quot; in NWA; this was accepted and promulgated in the ''London Gazette'' on 9&amp;nbsp;March 1945.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/AWM192/00311/003110022.pdf Recommendation: Mention in Dispatches] at Australian War Memorial.

Completing his tour with No.&amp;nbsp;79 Wing, Eaton was appointed Air Officer Commanding Southern Area, Melbourne, in January 1945. The German [[U-boat]] [[German submarine U-862|''U-862'']] operated off southern Australia during the first months of 1945, and the small number of combat units in Eaton's command were heavily engaged in [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine patrols]] which sought to locate this and any other U-boats in the area. The Air Officer Commanding [[RAAF Command]], Air Vice Marshal [[William Bostock|Bill Bostock]], considered the sporadic attacks to be partly &quot;nuisance value&quot;, designed to draw Allied resources away from the front line of the South West Pacific war. In April, Eaton complained to Bostock that intelligence from [[British Pacific Fleet]] concerning its ships' movements eastwards out of Western Area was hours out of date by the time it was received at Southern Area Command, leading to RAAF aircraft missing their rendezvous and wasting valuable flying hours searching empty ocean. There had been no U-boat strikes since February, however, and by June the naval authorities indicated that the need for air cover was minor except for the most important vessels.&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/21.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp. 351&amp;ndash;354]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-war career and legacy==

Eaton retired from the RAAF on 31&amp;nbsp;December 1945.&lt;ref name=&quot;WW2&quot;/&gt; In recognition of his war service, he was appointed a [[Order of Orange-Nassau|Commander of the Order of Orange-Nassau with Swords]] by the Dutch government on 17&amp;nbsp;January 1946.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/research/people/honours_and_awards/person.asp?p=360933 Award: Dutch Order of Orange-Nassau &amp;ndash; Commander] at Australian War Memorial. Retrieved on 14 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The same month, he became Australian [[Consul (representative)|consul]] in Dili. He had seen an advertisement for the position and was the only applicant with experience of the area. While based there, he accompanied the provincial governor on visits to townships damaged in Allied raids during the war, taking care to be circumspect about the part played by his own forces from No.&amp;nbsp;79 Wing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Farram pp.52-53&quot;&gt;Farram, ''Charles &quot;Moth&quot; Eaton'', pp. 52&amp;ndash;53&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1947, Dutch forces launched a &quot;police action&quot; against territory held by the fledgling [[Indonesian National Revolution|Indonesian Republic]], which had been declared shortly after the end of the war. Following a ceasefire, the [[United Nations]] set up a commission, chaired by Eaton as Consul-General, to monitor progress. Eaton and his fellow commissioners believed that the ceasefire was serving the Dutch as a cover for further penetration of republican enclaves. His requests to the Australian government for military observers led to deployment of the first peacekeeping force to the region; the Australians were soon followed by British and US observers, and enabled Eaton to display a more realistic impression of the situation to the outside world. The Dutch administration strongly opposed the presence of UN forces and accused Eaton of &quot;impropriety&quot;, but the Australian government refused to recall him.&lt;ref name=&quot;Air Power&quot;&gt;RAAF, ''The Australian Experience of Air Power'', pp.142&amp;ndash;143&lt;/ref&gt; Following the transfer of sovereignty in December 1949, he became Australia's first secretary and [[chargé d'affaires]] to the Republic of the United States of Indonesia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Farram pp.52-53&quot;/&gt; In 1950, he returned to Australia to serve with the Department of External Affairs in Canberra.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; After retiring from public service in 1951, he and his wife farmed at [[Metung, Victoria|Metung]], Victoria, and cultivated [[orchid]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Farram pp.52-53&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Farram pp.54-55&quot;&gt;Farram, ''Charles &quot;Moth&quot; Eaton'', pp. 54&amp;ndash;55&lt;/ref&gt; They later moved to [[Frankston, Victoria|Frankston]], where Eaton was involved in promotional work.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; 

Charles Eaton died in Frankston on 12&amp;nbsp;November 1979. Survived by his wife and two sons, he was cremated. In accordance with his wishes, his ashes were scattered near Tennant Creek, site of his 1929 forced landing during the search for the ''Kookaburra'', from an RAAF [[DHC-4 Caribou|Caribou]] on 15&amp;nbsp;April 1981.&lt;ref name=&quot;Air Force News&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Farram pp.54-55&quot;/&gt; His name figures prominently in the Northern Territory, commemorated by Lake Eaton in Central Australia, Eaton Place in the Darwin suburb of [[Karama, Northern Territory|Karama]], Charles Eaton Drive on the approach to [[Darwin International Airport]], and the Charles Moth Eaton Saloon Bar in the Tennant Creek Goldfields Hotel. He is also honoured with a display at the [[Northern Territory Parliament]], and a [[National Trust of Australia|National Trust]] memorial at [[Tennant Creek Airport]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Farram&quot;/&gt; At the RAAF's 2003 History Conference, Air Commodore Mark Lax, recalling Eaton's search-and-rescue missions between the wars, commented: &quot;Today, we might think of Eaton perhaps as the pioneer of our contribution to assistance to the civil community—a tradition that continues today. Perhaps I might jog your memory to a more recent series of rescues no less hazardous for all concerned—the amazing location of missing yachtsmen Thierry Dubois, [[Isabelle Autissier]] and [[Tony Bullimore]] by our [[P-3 Orion|P-3s]] that guided the [[Royal Australian Navy|Navy]] to their eventual rescue. My observation is that such activities remain vital for our relevance in that we must remain connected, supportive and responsive to the wants and needs of the Australian community.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lax&quot;/&gt;
