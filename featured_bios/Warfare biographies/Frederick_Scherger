[[Air Chief Marshal (Australia)|Air Chief Marshal]] '''Sir Frederick Rudolph William Scherger''' [[Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire|KBE]], [[Companion of the Order of the Bath|CB]], [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]], [[Air Force Cross (United Kingdom)|AFC]] (18&amp;nbsp;May 1904{{spaced ndash}}16&amp;nbsp;January 1984) was a senior commander in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]]. He served as [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]], the RAAF's highest-ranking position, from 1957 until 1961, and as Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee, forerunner of the role of Australia's [[Chief of the Defence Force (Australia)|Chief of the Defence Force]], from 1961 until 1966. He was the first of three RAAF officers to have held the rank of Air Chief Marshal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Air Force Defence Chiefs of the Past&quot;&gt;{{Cite web| last=Clark|first=Dr Chris| title=Air Force Defence Chiefs of the Past| date= 19 May 2005 | url=http://www.defence.gov.au/news/raafnews/editions/4708/history/story02.htm |work=Air Force News, Volume 47, No. 8 | accessdate=on 12 October 2007}} The other officers are Air Chief Marshal [[Neville McNamara|Sir Neville McNamara]] (Chief of the Defence Force Staff 1982&amp;ndash;1984) and Air Chief Marshal [[Angus Houston]] (Chief of the Defence Force 2005&amp;ndash;2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

Born in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] of German origins, Scherger graduated from the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]] before transferring to the Air Force in 1925. He was considered one of the top aviators between the wars, serving as a [[fighter pilot]], [[test pilot]], and [[Flight instructor|flying instructor]]. He held senior training posts in the late 1930s and the early years of [[Military history of Australia during World War II|World War II]], earning the [[Air Force Cross (United Kingdom)|Air Force Cross]] in June 1940. Promoted to [[Group Captain]], Scherger was acting commander of North Western Area when [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], Northern Territory suffered its [[Bombing of Darwin|first air raid in February 1942]]. Praised for his actions in the aftermath of the attack, he went on to lead the RAAF's major mobile strike force in the [[South West Pacific theatre of World War II|South West Pacific]], No.&amp;nbsp;10 Operational Group (later the [[Australian First Tactical Air Force]]), and was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Order]] in September 1944 for his actions during the [[Operations Reckless and Persecution|assaults on Aitape]] and [[Battle of Noemfoor|Noemfoor]] in [[Western New Guinea campaign|Western New Guinea]].

After the war, Scherger served in senior posts, including [[Deputy Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Deputy Chief of the Air Staff]], Head of the Australian Joint Services Staff in [[Washington, D.C.]], and commander of [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] air forces in [[Malaysia|Malaya]] during the [[Malayan emergency|emergency]]. In 1957, he was promoted to [[Air Marshal]] and became Chief of the Air Staff (CAS), presiding over a significant modernisation of RAAF equipment. Completing his term as CAS in 1961, he was the Air Force's first appointee to the position of Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee (COSC). As Chairman of COSC, Scherger became Australia's first Air Chief Marshal in 1965, and played a leading role in the commitment of troops to the [[Military history of Australia during the Vietnam War|Vietnam War]]. Leaving the military the following year, he was appointed Chairman of the [[Trans Australia Airlines|Australian National Airlines Commission]] and, from 1968, of the [[Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation]]. Popularly known as &quot;Scherg&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Personal correspondence at National Archives of Australia, pp. 6&amp;ndash;7&lt;/ref&gt; he retired in 1975 and lived in [[Melbourne]] until his death in 1984 at the age of seventy-nine.

==Early career==
===1920s: Duntroon to Point Cook===
Born in [[Ararat, Victoria|Ararat]], Victoria, the grandson of German migrants, Fred Scherger was educated to junior certificate level at his local high school.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Commanders&quot;&gt;Rayner, ''The Commanders'', pp. 298&amp;ndash;299&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;&gt;Stephens; Isaacs, ''High Fliers'', pp. 123&amp;ndash;126&lt;/ref&gt; His ancestry and surname made him the object of [[xenophobia]] in his childhood during [[Military history of Australia during World War I|World War&amp;nbsp;I]], which carried on into the early part of his military career and beyond; as late as 1941, an anonymous letter writer from [[RAAF Base Wagga|RAAF Station Wagga]] would tell Prime Minister [[Robert Menzies]] that his &quot;blood ran cold&quot; at the notion of someone called &quot;Scherger&quot; commanding trainee Australian pilots.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Commanders&quot;/&gt; Scherger nevertheless entered the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]] in 1921 and graduated as a [[Lieutenant]] in 1924, winning the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon#Queen's Medal|King's Medal]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; Two days prior to graduation, he volunteered for an Air Force secondment, which was later made permanent.&lt;ref name=&quot;Air Force Defence Chiefs of the Past&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moore, ''Duntroon'', p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; He commenced his flight training as a [[Pilot Officer]] (temporary [[Flying Officer]]) in 1925 at [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Point Cook Base|RAAF Point Cook]], Victoria.&lt;ref name=&quot;Personnel file&quot;&gt;Personnel file at National Archives, pp. 2&amp;ndash;4&lt;/ref&gt;

Scherger quickly took to the art of flying open-cockpit [[biplane]]s and gained a reputation as a skilful if occasionally reckless pilot, being berated early in his career by his flight commander for &quot;inverted and very low flying&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;&gt;Dennis et al., ''Oxford Military History of Australia'', pp. 530&amp;ndash;531&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rayner, ''The Commanders'', p. 304&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of the Air Force's first volunteers for [[parachute]] instruction, under the tutelage of Flying Officer [[Ellis Wackett]] at [[RAAF Base Richmond|RAAF Richmond]], New South Wales, and made the first public freefall descent in Australia, at [[Essendon, Victoria|Essendon]], Victoria on 21&amp;nbsp;August 1926.&lt;ref name=&quot;Third Brother pp. 337-338&quot;&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp. 337&amp;ndash;338&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1927, he was asked by the [[Commanding Officer]] of [[No. 1 Flying Training School RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School]] (1FTS), [[Wing Commander (rank)|Wing Commander]] [[Adrian Cole (RAAF officer)|Adrian &quot;King&quot; Cole]], to drop a message to a woman at [[Port Melbourne]] before she departed on a steamer. After doing so, Scherger illegally flew his [[Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5|SE5]] fighter between ship and wharf before heading back to Point Cook, only to be hauled into Cole's office the next morning to find the CO brandishing a photograph taken by a member of the public, catching the young pilot in the act. Sent for a dressing down to the Air Member for Personnel, [[Group Captain]] [[Stanley Goble|Jimmy Goble]], Scherger was forced to admit it was not the first time he had engaged in such stunts. Goble responded, &quot;Good, I'm glad to see we've still got a few in the Air Force with spirit. Go back and tell King Cole that I beat the hell out of you.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p. 331&lt;/ref&gt;

===1930s: Flying instructor to Director of Training===

By the 1930s, as a [[flight instructor]] and [[test pilot]], Scherger was considered &quot;perhaps the RAAF's outstanding aviator&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p. 254&lt;/ref&gt; He married Thelma Harrick on 1&amp;nbsp;June 1929, and they had a daughter named Jill.&lt;ref name=&quot;Legge&quot;&gt;Legge, ''Who's Who in Australia 1968'', p. 756&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SMH&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal| date = 18 January 1984 | title = Sir Frederick Scherger dies after illness| url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1301&amp;dat=19840118&amp;id=EcMRAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=AOcDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1439,743922| journal = [[The Sydney Morning Herald]] | accessdate = on 1 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Promoted to [[Flight Lieutenant]], Scherger became Chief Flying Instructor at Point Cook that August.&lt;ref name=&quot;Personnel file&quot;/&gt; He also flew with Fighter Squadron, a unit of 1FTS operating [[Bristol Bulldog]]s. As one of the leading pilots of the Bulldog, then regarded as the peak of military technology, and in what was generally thought of as the RAAF's elite formation, he gained popular exposure that helped his later rise to senior leadership.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coulthard-Clark pp.187-188,405&quot;&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp. 187&amp;ndash;188, 405&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1931, he won an Aero Club derby at [[Adelaide]] in a Bulldog, clocking a top speed of {{convert|160.98|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p. 401&lt;/ref&gt;

Raised to [[Squadron Leader]], Scherger was posted to England in August 1934 to study at [[RAF Staff College, Andover]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Personnel file&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;/&gt; Just prior to departing, he was involved in a notorious incident at [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Laverton Base|RAAF Station Laverton]]. A fellow Squadron Leader arrived home early from a [[mess]] function to find his wife sleeping with another officer, who escaped by crashing through the bedroom window. The Squadron Leader then pursued his wife with a loaded [[revolver]], the pair eventually arriving at Scherger's quarters. Faced with the frightened woman and the enraged husband crying that he would &quot;shoot the bitch&quot;, Scherger knocked the man down with a [[fireplace poker|poker]]. The unconscious husband was placed in the guardhouse, and the woman given shelter off the base; the officer she had slept with promptly resigned his commission.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp. 123&amp;ndash;124&lt;/ref&gt; Scherger graduated from Andover in December 1935; over the next year he also completed courses at the RAF's School of Air Navigation and [[Central Flying School]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Personnel file&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;/&gt; Returning to Australia, he resumed his position as Chief Flying Instructor at Point Cook in May 1937. At the direction of the Federal government, he was responsible for training the [[Treasurer of Australia|Treasurer]], [[Richard Casey, Baron Casey|Richard Casey]], to fly; the employment of Air Force facilities for his own benefit by an elected official led to adverse publicity when it was revealed by the media.&lt;ref name=&quot;Personnel file&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp. 201&amp;ndash;202&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1937, he test flew the [[North American NA-16]] at Laverton; this evaluation program led to the design being adapted as the [[CAC Wirraway]] the following year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coulthard-Clark pp.275-281&quot;&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp. 275&amp;ndash;281&lt;/ref&gt; Scherger was appointed Director of Training at RAAF Headquarters, [[Melbourne]] in January 1938, and promoted to Wing Commander in March 1939.&lt;ref name=&quot;Personnel file&quot;/&gt;

==World War II==
===1939&amp;ndash;42: Outbreak of war to raid on Darwin===

As Director of Training at the outbreak of [[Military history of Australia during World War II|World War II]], Scherger's main challenge was to expand the RAAF's pool of flying instructors.&lt;ref&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/03.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939&amp;ndash;1942'', p. 71]&lt;/ref&gt; Awarded the [[Air Force Cross (United Kingdom)|Air Force Cross]] in June 1940 for his &quot;outstanding ability&quot; as a pilot and instructor,&lt;ref&gt;Personnel file at National Archives, pp. 203&amp;ndash;204&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AFC&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=34893|supp=yes|startpage=4269|date=9 July 1940|accessdate=28 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; he took charge of [[No. 2 Service Flying Training School RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;2 Service Flying Training School]] near [[Wagga Wagga, New South Wales|Wagga]] the following month, and was promoted to Group Captain in September.&lt;ref name=&quot;Personnel file&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Units of the Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 102&amp;ndash;103&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1941, he was made Commanding Officer of [[RAAF Base Darwin|RAAF Station Darwin]], Northern Territory. Described by Major General [[Lewis H. Brereton]], commander of the US [[Far East Air Force (United States)|Far East Air Force]], as &quot;energetic, efficient and very impatient&quot;, Scherger started improving the operational readiness of the base and its surrounds without waiting for specific orders from RAAF Headquarters.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.136-138&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 136&amp;ndash;138&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/08.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939&amp;ndash;1942'', p. 184]&lt;/ref&gt; The following January, he was appointed Senior Air Staff Officer, North Western Area (NWA), which administered the RAAF Station and its satellite airfields. In [[Air Commodore]] Douglas Wilson's absence at [[American-British-Dutch-Australian Command|ABDA Command Headquarters]] in Java, Scherger was acting [[Air Officer Commanding]] NWA on 19&amp;nbsp;February 1942 when Darwin suffered its [[Bombing of Darwin|first aerial attacks]] by the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]].&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/22.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939&amp;ndash;1942'', pp. 424&amp;ndash;425]&lt;/ref&gt; Driving into town to meet [[Air Marshal]] [[Richard Williams (RAAF officer)|Richard Williams]], who was in transit on his way to England, Scherger first became aware of the assault after he heard [[anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft fire]] and counted twenty-seven enemy aircraft in the distance. He arrived at the civil airfield to witness a [[Curtiss P-40]] crash land on the runway, before his car was strafed by fighters.&lt;ref&gt;Lockwood, ''Australia Under Attack'', pp. 35&amp;ndash;36&lt;/ref&gt; In a lull after the initial attack that day, he made contact with Williams before the two men were forced to take shelter in a makeshift trench that was straddled by falling bombs as a second raid got under way. Afterwards, Scherger began to restore order and launched a [[Lockheed Hudson|Hudson]] light bomber on a [[reconnaissance]] mission, though there was no further contact with Japanese forces.&lt;ref&gt;Lockwood, ''Australia Under Attack'', pp. 128&amp;ndash;129&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the loss of civil and military infrastructure, twenty-three aircraft and ten ships, and the death of some 250&amp;nbsp;people, 278&amp;nbsp;RAAF personnel had deserted Darwin in an exodus that became known as the &quot;[[Adelaide River]] Stakes&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.136-138&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grose, ''An Awkward Truth'', pp. 225&amp;ndash;231&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;There was&quot;, in Scherger's words, &quot;an awful panic and a lot of men simply [[The Bush|went bush]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Lockwood, ''Australia Under Attack'', p. 133&lt;/ref&gt; Praised for his &quot;great courage and energy&quot;, he was one of the few senior Air Force officers in the region to emerge from Commissioner Charles Lowe's inquiry into the debacle with his long-term career prospects undamaged.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.136-138&quot;/&gt; In the immediate aftermath, however, his outspoken criticism of the RAAF's state of preparedness alienated members of the Air Board, the service's controlling body that consisted of its most senior officers and which was chaired by the Chief of the Air Staff (CAS).&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; He was relieved of his position at NWA by CAS [[Air Chief Marshal]] [[Charles Burnett (RAF officer)|Sir Charles Burnett]], and shunted through a series of postings for the remainder of the year,&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Commanders p. 301&quot;/&gt; including Commanding Officer at RAAF Station Richmond,&lt;ref&gt;Roylance, ''Air Base Richmond'', p. 113&lt;/ref&gt; [[Supernumerary]] at RAAF Headquarters,&lt;ref name=&quot;Personnel file&quot;/&gt; Director of Defence at Allied Air Forces Headquarters, [[South West Pacific Area (command)|South West Pacific Area]],&lt;ref&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/24.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939&amp;ndash;1942'', p. 473]&lt;/ref&gt; and Director of Training at RAAF Headquarters.&lt;ref name=&quot;Personnel file&quot;/&gt; Seeking restitution, he boldly went over the heads of the Air Board and successfully appealed to the [[Minister for Defence (Australia)|Minister for Air]], [[Arthur Drakeford]], supported by Commissioner Lowe.&lt;ref&gt;Grose, ''An Awkward Truth'', pp. 213&amp;ndash;214&lt;/ref&gt;

===1943&amp;ndash;45: No.&amp;nbsp;10 Operational Group and First Tactical Air Force===
[[File:OG0994SchergerWurtsmith.jpg|left|thumb|240px|Air Commodore Scherger (left) with USAAF Brigadier General [[Paul Wurtsmith]] (second left) on 24 April 1944, after the landings at Aitape|alt=Five men in light-coloured uniforms standing in front of a military aircraft]]
Scherger served as [[Officer Commanding]] No.&amp;nbsp;2 Training Group at RAAF Station Wagga from July 1943 until he was appointed Air Officer Commanding of the newly formed No.&amp;nbsp;10 Operational Group (10OG) in November.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;/&gt; The Air Force's main mobile strike force, 10OG at its formation consisted of [[No. 77 Wing RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;77 Wing]], operating [[A-31 Vengeance]] dive bombers, and [[No. 78 Wing RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;78 Wing]], operating P-40 Kittyhawk fighters, as well as various ancillary units.&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/12.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp. 182&amp;ndash;183]&lt;/ref&gt; Promoted to acting Air Commodore in January 1944,&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; Scherger established his headquarters at [[Nadzab]], Papua New Guinea, in support of the US [[Fifth Air Force]]. While he was able to launch No.&amp;nbsp;78 Wing's first mission that same month, he had to deal with a number of organisational problems in order to bring all his squadrons to combat readiness, including lack of training in tropical conditions, and shortcomings in aircraft maintenance and staff rotation that resulted in the RAAF's operational rate of effort being inferior to similar [[United States Army Air Forces|USAAF]] formations. These issues were overcome later in the year and 10OG units began exceeding the rate of effort of their American counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, ''Air War Against Japan'', pp. 192&amp;ndash;194&lt;/ref&gt;

By March 1944, No.&amp;nbsp;77 Wing's Vengeances had been withdrawn from operations due to their inferiority to newer equipment.  Three squadrons from [[No. 9 Operational Group RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;9 Operational Group]]&amp;mdash;one each flying [[A-20 Havoc|Bostons]], [[Bristol Beaufighter|Beaufighters]], and [[Bristol Beaufort|Beauforts]]&amp;mdash;were assigned to the Wing as replacements, but 10OG itself was moved from Nadzab to [[Cape Gloucester]] to permit USAAF units with longer-ranged aircraft to occupy vital airfields on the Allied front line.&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, ''Air War Against Japan'', pp. 196&amp;ndash;198&lt;/ref&gt; 10OG's disappointment with its withdrawal from Nadzab was compensated for by news that it was to take part in the forthcoming attack on [[Aitape]], New Guinea, codenamed [[Operations Reckless and Persecution|Operation Reckless]]. Scherger was appointed air commander for the assault, leading US and Australian units.&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/13.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p. 206]&lt;/ref&gt;  No.&amp;nbsp;78 Wing's Kittyhawks shadowed the main task force while heavier aircraft from North West Area conducted bombing and mining sorties to indirectly support the operation.&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, ''Air War Against Japan'', p. 213&lt;/ref&gt; The landings on 22&amp;nbsp;April 1944 met little opposition, credited in part to the Allied bombardment in the days leading up to it.&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, ''Air War Against Japan'', p. 218&lt;/ref&gt; With elements of 10OG going ashore on the first day, Aitape airfield was repaired and No.&amp;nbsp;78 Wing was operating from it within three days.&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, ''Air War Against Japan'', pp. 210&amp;ndash;211&lt;/ref&gt; In June, Scherger was named commander of Australian and US air forces for the [[Battle of Noemfoor|attack on Noemfoor Island]].&lt;ref name=&quot;The Commanders p. 302&quot;&gt;Rayner, ''The Commanders'', p. 302&lt;/ref&gt; Over the course of the battle that commenced on 2&amp;nbsp;July, he controlled [[No. 71 Wing RAAF|Nos.&amp;nbsp;71]], 77, 78 and [[No. 81 Wing RAAF|81 Wing]]s RAAF, as well as the USAAF's [[58th Special Operations Wing|58th]] and [[348th Fighter Group]]s and [[307th Bombardment Wing|307th]] and [[417th Bombardment Group]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/13.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p. 237]&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Order]] for his actions at Aitape and Noemfoor,&lt;ref name=DSO&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=36713|supp=yes|startpage=4393|date=19 September 1944|accessdate=28 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; the citation noting that he &quot;operated his air forces with great skill and success&quot; and praising the way he placed himself &quot;in the forefront of the landing of the ground troops&quot;, where &quot;his personal courage and leadership proved an inspiration to all personnel&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Commanders p. 302&quot;/&gt;

A jeep accident in August left Scherger with a fractured pelvis, necessitating his evacuation to Australia for rehabilitation. In his absence, Air Commodore [[Arthur Henry Cobby|Harry Cobby]] took command of 10OG; two months later the formation was redesignated the [[Australian First Tactical Air Force]] (1TAF).&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/15.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p. 241]&lt;/ref&gt; Still recuperating, Scherger acted in the role of Air Member for Personnel at RAAF Headquarters, Melbourne from January to May 1945.&lt;ref name=&quot;Personnel file&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;/&gt; On 10&amp;nbsp;May, he was posted back to the Pacific to resume control of 1TAF following Cobby's dismissal in the wake of the &quot;[[Morotai Mutiny]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 123&amp;ndash;124&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Air War Against Japan pp.459-461&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/27.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp. 459&amp;ndash;461]&lt;/ref&gt; He returned as Operation Oboe One, the [[Battle of Tarakan (1945)|Battle of Tarakan]], was under way; 1TAF's airfield construction teams had been tasked with opening the runway on [[Tarakan Island]] within a week of Allied landings but extensive pre-invasion damage and adverse environmental conditions delayed this until the end of June.&lt;ref name=&quot;Air War Against Japan pp.459-461&quot;/&gt; He then led 1TAF in [[Operation Oboe Six]], the invasion of [[Labuan]], going ashore on the afternoon of the landings on 10&amp;nbsp;June to establish his command post.&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/28.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp. 470&amp;ndash;471]&lt;/ref&gt; By July, when the final Allied offensive of the [[Borneo campaign (1945)|Borneo Campaign]] took place as [[Battle of Balikpapan (1945)|Operation Oboe Two]] in [[Balikpapan]], 1TAF had reached a strength of some 25,000 personnel; by the end of hostilities on 14&amp;nbsp;August this figure had been reduced with the transfer of units to the recently formed [[No. 11 Group RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;11 Group]].&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, ''Air War Against Japan'', pp. 477&amp;ndash;479&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-war career==
===1946&amp;ndash;57: Rise to Chief of the Air Staff===
In October 1945, Scherger led a survey team to Japan to review airfields and other facilities being considered for the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]], determining that substantial work was needed to bring them up to the required capacity.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p. 211&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, he attended the [[Royal College of Defence Studies|Imperial Defence College, London]]. From July 1947 to July 1951, he served as [[Deputy Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Deputy Chief of the Air Staff]] (DCAS), gaining promotion to temporary [[Air Vice Marshal]] in May 1950.&lt;ref name=&quot;Personnel file&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;/&gt; He was appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (CBE) in the [[King's Birthday Honours]] the same year.&lt;ref name=CBE&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=38930|supp=yes|startpage=2810|date=2 June 1950|accessdate=28 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; As DCAS, Scherger reported to [[Air Marshal]] [[George Jones (RAAF officer)|George Jones]], whose ten-year term as CAS would the longest of any incumbent in the position. The pair enjoyed a cordial working relationship, and Jones earmarked the younger officer as a leader of the future.&lt;ref&gt;Helson, ''Ten Years at the Top'', pp. 264&amp;ndash;265, 299&lt;/ref&gt; However Scherger could not persuade his conservative chief to revamp the Air Force from its wartime area command structure into a more modern service organised along functional lines; this radical change would await Jones' successor,  Air Marshal [[Donald Hardman|Sir Donald Hardman]].&lt;ref name=&quot;The Commanders pp. 304-305&quot;&gt;Rayner, ''The Commanders'', pp. 304&amp;ndash;305&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Helson, ''Ten Years at the Top'', pp. 253&amp;ndash;254&lt;/ref&gt;

After completing his tour as DCAS, Scherger was posted to [[Washington, D.C.]] to head up the Australian Joint Services Staff. Promoted to substantive Air Vice Marshal,&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;/&gt; he became AOC of RAF Air Headquarters [[Malaysia|Malaya]] in January 1953. In this role, he commanded all [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] air forces in the region and was responsible for operations against communist guerrillas during the [[Malayan emergency|emergency]].&lt;ref name=&quot;The Commanders pp. 305-307&quot;/&gt; Scherger deliberately sited his headquarters, which had been based in [[Singapore]] when he took over, next to the offices of the Director of Operations in [[Kuala Lumpur]], to more closely align air tasking with overall military planning. He expanded the use of [[helicopter]]s for troop delivery and casualty evacuation, and presided over a change in tactics that saw an earlier policy of indiscriminate [[saturation bombing]] of jungle areas replaced by one of precision strike against enemy camps.&lt;ref&gt;Dennis; Grey, ''Emergency and Confrontation'', pp. 39&amp;ndash;41&lt;/ref&gt; He also pioneered [[psychological warfare]] in the form of &quot;voice&quot; aircraft broadcasting propaganda, close cooperation between light aircraft spotters and ground forces to aid bombing missions, and [[Defoliant|defoliation]] to clear jungle cover.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Commanders pp. 305-307&quot;/&gt;

Appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] on 30&amp;nbsp;April 1954 for his service in Malaya,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/AWM192/00201/002010175.pdf Recommended:  Companion of the Order of the Bath] at [[Australian War Memorial]].

This led to a policy of cadets undertaking academic degrees, in line with similar institutions in the other armed services; the College was subsequently renamed RAAF Academy.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p. 188&lt;/ref&gt; Promoted Air Marshal, he became [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]] in March 1957, succeeding Air Marshal [[John McCauley (RAAF officer)|Sir John McCauley]]. Long identified as a strong contender for the RAAF's senior role,&lt;ref&gt;Helson, ''Ten Years at the Top'', p. 291&lt;/ref&gt; Scherger was described by Air Marshal Hardman as &quot;easily the best material on offer&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; He declared that as an administrator he was &quot;not going to allow myself to be bogged down with minor matters of detail&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;Broad policy comes from the top. These decisions have to be implemented in the commands&amp;mdash;and that's the way it's going to be.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Commanders pp. 307-311&quot;/&gt;

===1957&amp;ndash;61: Chief of the Air Staff===
[[File:Frederick Scherger.jpg|thumb|200px|Official RAAF portrait of Air Marshal Scherger as Chief of the Air Staff|alt=Half-portrait of uniformed man in peaked cap, with pilot's wings on left-breast pocket, clasping hands together]]
As CAS, one of Scherger's first tasks was investigating the feasibility of a [[nuclear weapon|nuclear arsenal]] for the Air Force. During visits to Britain and the US he explored the possibility of weapons being delivered by the RAAF's [[CAC Sabre|Sabre]] fighters or its [[English Electric Canberra|Canberra]] bombers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens, pp. 224-225&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 224&amp;ndash;225&lt;/ref&gt; In 1958, he held discussions with the [[Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force|Chief of Staff of the USAF]], General [[Thomas D. White]], about storing nuclear weapons in Australia under USAF control. In 1959 and 1960, Scherger had information sent out, including manuals and maintenance instructions, regarding equipping the Canberras with [[Mark 7 nuclear bomb]]s, the same type that the British Canberras used.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, ''Australia's Bid for the Atomic Bomb'', p. 206&lt;/ref&gt; For a time, Scherger championed the purchase of a force of British-built [[Avro Vulcan|Vulcan]] heavy bombers but excessive cost and a governmental determination to remain &quot;under the shelter of the American nuclear umbrella&quot; put paid to the proposal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens, pp. 224-225&quot;/&gt; Instead, in 1963, the decision was taken to purchase the [[General Dynamics F-111]] swing-wing bomber &quot;on the understanding that it could carry nuclear weapons&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, ''Australia's Bid for the Atomic Bomb'', p. 210&lt;/ref&gt;

Turning to fighters, Scherger succeeded in reversing a publicly announced decision to purchase the [[F-104 Starfighter]] as a replacement for the Sabre, in favour of the [[Dassault Mirage III]], a type better suited for Australia's requirements.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Commanders pp. 307-311&quot;&gt;Rayner, ''The Commanders'', pp. 307&amp;ndash;311&lt;/ref&gt; During trials he had taken the controls of a Starfighter, reportedly becoming the first Australian to fly at twice the [[speed of sound]].&lt;ref&gt;Personal correspondence at National Archives of Australia, p.5&lt;/ref&gt;  He was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) in the 1958 Queen's Birthday Honours.&lt;ref name=KBE&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=41405|supp=yes|startpage=3550|date=3 June 1958|accessdate=28 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An advocate of helicopters since his experience in Malaya, Scherger influenced purchase of the [[UH-1 Iroquois]] for Australia.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Commanders pp. 307-311&quot;/&gt; He also played a key role in the acquisition of the [[C-130 Hercules]] transport in 1959, over the Federal treasury's &quot;bureaucratic hand-wringing&quot;; the type soon proved itself vital to defence force activity in the region, being described as second only to the F-111 as &quot;the most significant aircraft the RAAF has ever operated&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 416&amp;ndash;417&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, harking back to his experience in 1942, Scherger proposed a second airfield in the Darwin area, which led to the establishment of [[RAAF Base Tindal|RAAF Tindal]] near [[Katherine, Northern Territory|Katherine]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 55&amp;ndash;57&lt;/ref&gt; He transferred funding already in place for extension of the runway at Laverton to effect this, signalling a fundamental shift in the Air Force's &quot;centre of gravity&quot; to the north of Australia.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Commanders pp. 307-311&quot;/&gt; The first edition of ''RAAF News'' (now ''Air Force News''), which had been sponsored by Scherger, appeared in January 1960 and carried a message from the CAS concerning current defence policy, as well as announcing that [[AIM-9 Sidewinder|Sidewinder]] air-to-air missiles would begin equipping the Air Force's Sabres.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Commanders pp. 307-311&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p. 114&lt;/ref&gt; Scherger also oversaw introduction of [[Bristol Bloodhound|Bloodhound]] surface-to-air missiles to the RAAF's arsenal.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Commanders pp. 307-311&quot;/&gt; Towards the end of his term as CAS, he expressed interest in Britain's supersonic [[BAC TSR-2]] as a replacement for the Canberra, but noted that it was &quot;many years&quot; from production.&lt;ref name=&quot;Solo pp.369-374&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'' pp. 369&amp;ndash;374&lt;/ref&gt;

===1961&amp;ndash;66: Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee===
Scherger became [[Chief of the Defence Force (Australia)|Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee]] (COSC), the senior Australian military position at the time, in May 1961, taking over from Vice Admiral [[Roy Dowling|Sir Roy Dowling]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CDF&quot;&gt;[http://www.defence.gov.au/cdf/past_chiefs.htm Chief of the Defence Force] at [http://www.defence.gov.au/index.cfm Department of Defence]. Retrieved on 6 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Keen as ever to see a supersonic bomber replace the Canberra, he visited Britain in April 1963 to investigate progress of the TSR-2. Using back-channel sources of information, he satisfied himself that the RAF's pronouncements on the bomber's development were overly optimistic, and later that year began supporting selection of the F-111 as the aircraft best suited to supplant the Canberra.&lt;ref name=&quot;Solo pp.369-374&quot;/&gt; 

[[File:RAAF TFV (HD-SN-99-02052).jpg|thumb|240px|left|RAAF Caribous and personnel on arrival in South Vietnam, August 1964|alt=Uniformed personnel marching on airfield with two twin-engined transport aircraft in background]]
During the [[Indonesiaâ€“Malaysia confrontation]], Scherger acted as military liaison between the British and Australian governments. Openly sceptical about the cease-fire announced by [[Sukarno|President Sukarno]] on 25&amp;nbsp;January 1964, he supported British requests for Australian combat forces in [[Borneo]] but was in the short term &quot;overruled by 'political cross-currents'&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Dennis; Grey, ''Emergency and Confrontation'', pp. 193&amp;ndash;194&lt;/ref&gt; Towards the end of the year, he advocated bombing Indonesian air bases using RAAF Canberras in Malaya, but in this instance the British held back.&lt;ref&gt;Dennis; Grey, ''Emergency and Confrontation'', pp. 228&amp;ndash;229&lt;/ref&gt; Although Australia eventually deployed [[battalion]]s of the [[Royal Australian Regiment]] from March 1965, Scherger's earlier optimistic estimation of the speed and level of his government's readiness to commit troops was said to have confused the British.&lt;ref&gt;Dennis; Grey, ''Emergency and Confrontation'', pp. 237,319&lt;/ref&gt;

The latter part of Scherger's tour as Chairman COSC coincided with the beginning of large-scale [[Military history of Australia during the Vietnam War|Australian involvement in the Vietnam War]].&lt;ref name=&quot;100 Years of Australians at War&quot;&gt;Odgers, ''100 Years of Australians at War'', pp. 310&amp;ndash;312&lt;/ref&gt;  By mid-1964, the Commonwealth had already sent a small team of military advisors, plus a detachment of newly acquired [[DHC-4 Caribou]] transports, to the region at the request of the [[South Vietnam]]ese government.&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, ''100 Years of Australians at War'', pp. 300&amp;ndash;306&lt;/ref&gt; At a joint US, Australian and New Zealand conference from 30&amp;nbsp;March to 1&amp;nbsp;April 1965, however, and with instructions only to ascertain America's objectives in the conflict, Scherger indicated that Australia would be prepared to commit a sizeable ground force, of around battalion size. Within a week, Prime Minister [[Robert Menzies]]' Federal cabinet had ratified the proposal, which was formally announced on 19&amp;nbsp;April.&lt;ref name=&quot;100 Years of Australians at War&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McNeill, ''To Long Tan'', pp. 63&amp;ndash;65&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment]] deployed to Vietnam in May 1965,&lt;ref name=&quot;100 Years of Australians at War&quot;/&gt; and two squadrons of the RAAF were committed by mid-1966.&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, ''100 Years of Australians at War'', p. 318&lt;/ref&gt; With the formation of Australian Forces Vietnam (AFV) at this time, Scherger recommended that Air Force units effectively serve under Army control &quot;to convey an image of all Australian forces fighting together, as one unit&quot;. However the Minister for Air, [[Peter Howson (Australian politician)|Peter Howson]], felt that this made Scherger and the Army guilty of &quot;exaggerated national pride&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The RAAF in Vietnam'', pp. 78&amp;ndash;79&lt;/ref&gt;

Promoted to [[Air Chief Marshal]] in March 1965, Scherger became not only the first RAAF officer to attain four-star rank,&lt;ref name=&quot;The Commanders&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;/&gt; but also the first Duntroon graduate to do so.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Commanders&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moore, ''Duntroon'', p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; Already considered &quot;a particularly assertive Chairman&quot; of COSC,&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The RAAF in Vietnam'', pp. 28&amp;ndash;29&lt;/ref&gt; his role was further strengthened by the promotion as he now out-ranked the three service heads. His predecessors in the position had not advanced beyond three-star rank.&lt;ref&gt;Horner, ''Making the Australian Defence Force'', p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; Scherger remained as Chairman until retiring from military life on 18&amp;nbsp;May 1966,&lt;ref name=&quot;Personnel file&quot;/&gt; having twice had his term extended by unanimous vote of Federal cabinet.&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt;

==Later life==

After leaving the military, Scherger became Chairman of the Australian National Airlines Commission (ACAC), the controlling body of the Federal government's domestic carrier [[Trans Australia Airlines]] (TAA), on 1&amp;nbsp;July 1966.&lt;ref&gt;Gunn, ''Contested Skies'', pp. 211&amp;ndash;212&lt;/ref&gt; Considered as bringing to TAA &quot;the dash and leadership the new air age demanded&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Sabey, ''Challenge in the Skies'', p. 122&lt;/ref&gt; he presided over delivery of its first [[McDonnell Douglas DC-9|Douglas DC-9]] twin-jet transport in 1967. The government's [[Two Airlines Policy]], designed to ensure even competition between TAA and Australia's private domestic carrier, [[Ansett Australia|Ansett]], meant that the decision of which airline would land the first DC-9 in the country came down to the toss of a coin, which Scherger won.&lt;ref&gt;Gunn, ''Contested Skies'', pp. 200, 221&lt;/ref&gt; He augmented his role at ACAC with Chairmanship of the [[Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation]] (CAC) from 1968, and joined an Australian defence industries mission to the US the following year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;/&gt;

Scherger continued to lead ACAC and CAC until retiring to live in Melbourne in 1975.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;/&gt; He also served as director on the boards of a number of other firms including electronics companies [[Plessey|Plessey Pacific]] and [[International Computers Limited|International Computers (Australia) Limited]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Draper&quot;&gt;Draper, ''Who's Who in Australia 1983'', p. 761&lt;/ref&gt;  His wife Thelma died in a car accident in 1974. On 3&amp;nbsp;March 1975, at the age of seventy, he married Joy Robertson, a widow he had known three months.&lt;ref name=&quot;Draper&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Personnel File p.276&quot;&gt;Personnel file at National Archives, p. 276&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, he was quoted as saying, &quot;In the Air Force you have to move quickly or someone else will shoot you down&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Personnel File p.276&quot;/&gt; In retirement he attracted some controversy by continuing to advocate for the Australian military to acquire a nuclear capability.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;/&gt; Sir Frederick Scherger died in Melbourne on 16&amp;nbsp;January 1984, having been ill following a [[stroke]] the previous year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SMH&quot;/&gt;

Described by Air Force historian Alan Stephens as one of &quot;the outstanding officers of the post-war area&quot; and &quot;among the RAAF's better chiefs&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Stephens. ''Going Solo'', p. 173&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p. 221&lt;/ref&gt; Scherger is credited with helping to shift Australia's defence posture to the north by developing the concept of a series of [[RAAF Bare Bases|front-line air bases]] in the continent's top end, beginning with plans for RAAF Tindal in 1959.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Royal Australian Air Force pp.283-284&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 283&amp;ndash;284&lt;/ref&gt;  From the time of his command of No.&amp;nbsp;10 Operational Group, he had an easy rapport&amp;mdash;and worked to foster relations&amp;mdash;with the US military, presaging closer defence ties with the Americans that he pursued as CAS. Among other things this manifested itself in the purchase of more and more US equipment for the Air Force, and far less from the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Commanders pp. 304-305&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/12.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp. 184&amp;ndash;185]&lt;/ref&gt;  Once elevated to the position of Chairman of COSC, he further severed ties with Britain by removing senior [[Royal Australian Navy]] officers from the ''[[Royal Navy|Royal Navy List]]'', and dropping the words &quot;...&amp;nbsp;and Chief of the Australian Section of the [[Imperial General Staff]]&quot; from the title of [[Chief of Army (Australia)|Chief of the General Staff]] in the ''Australian Army List''.&lt;ref&gt;Rayner, ''The Commanders'', p. 300&lt;/ref&gt;

As Chairman of COSC, Scherger played a leading role in the large-scale commitment of Australian forces to Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, ''Crises and Commitments'', pp. 358&amp;ndash;360&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last=Woodward|first=Gary| title=Asian alternatives: Going to war in the 1960s| url=http://www.naa.gov.au/Images/Woodard_tcm16-35766.pdf| date=30 May 2003 | work=Frederick Watson Fellowship Papers| publisher=National Archives of Australia|accessdate=on 2 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an address at the [[Australian War Memorial]] in 2005, journalist [[Paul Kelly (journalist)|Paul Kelly]] referred to him as &quot;Australia's most prominent military hawk&quot; at the time, who &quot;exceeded his brief&quot; by promising a battalion to the Americans before a formal request had been made.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last= Kelly| first=Paul |title=Vietnam &amp;ndash; 30 years on| url=http://www.awm.gov.au/events/talks/oration2005.asp| date=11 November 2005| work=Talks and Speeches| publisher=Australian War Memorial|accessdate=on 15 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historians Peter Edwards and Gregory Pemberton have written that &quot;no official could have done more to press Australia into a military commitment in Vietnam than its most highly ranked serviceman, Air Chief Marshal Scherger&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, ''Crises and Commitments'', p. 383&lt;/ref&gt; Reflecting later on Australia's involvement in the war, Scherger said &quot;If you want allies, you've got to support allies&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;It was never conceivable to us that America could lose&amp;mdash;no way.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Rayner, ''The Commanders'', p. 311&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with [[Athol Townley]], [[Minister for Defence (Australia)|Minister for Defence]] from 1958 to 1963, Scherger urged the establishment of an Australian Joint Services Staff College (JSSC), to further inter-service knowledge and cooperation against an indigenous background instead of sending officers to overseas colleges; the JSSC opened in 1970 as the Joint Services Wing of a proposed Australian Services Staff College, later being subsumed by the [[Australian Defence College]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p. 143&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defence.gov.au/adc/docs/adc/history%20of%20the%20adc.pdf A History of the Australian Defence College] at Department of Defence.

Scherger was also an early advocate for &quot;one [[Australian Defence Force]]&quot; comprising three branches, under one Minister for Defence, rather than three competing services, each with its own minister.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Commanders pp. 311-313&quot;&gt;Rayner, ''The Commanders'', pp. 311&amp;ndash;313&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andrews, ''The Department of Defence'', p. 183&lt;/ref&gt; According to his biographer, Harry Rayner, he bequeathed to his successor as Chairman of COSC, Lieutenant General [[John Wilton (Australian Army officer)|Sir John Wilton]], a position much invigorated and respected by the service chiefs and the government, and contributing to a more cohesive Australian defence organisation.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Commanders pp. 311-313&quot;/&gt;  In 1973, the single-service ministries were abolished in favour of an all-encompassing [[Department of Defence (Australia)|Department of Defence]]; by 1984, the Chairman COSC position had evolved to become the [[Chief of the Defence Force (Australia)|Chief of the Defence Force]], directly commanding all three armed services through their respective chiefs.&lt;ref&gt;Horner, &quot;The Evolution of Australian Higher Command Arrangements&quot;, pp. 24&amp;ndash;27&lt;/ref&gt;

Rayner described Scherger as &quot;the most quoted and best known of contemporary military leaders&quot; in Australia from 1957 to 1966, recognised and admired by civilian and soldier alike.&lt;ref&gt;Rayner, ''The Commanders'', p. 313&lt;/ref&gt; Detractors accused him of cunning and excessive politicking, Air Marshal Williams declaring that Scherger favoured his friends in the service and later in TAA and CAC, while [[John Gorton]] famously called him &quot;a politician in uniform&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rayner, ''The Commanders'', p. 349&lt;/ref&gt; Scherger was also labelled a self-publicist,&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; but argued &quot;...&amp;nbsp;you can't sell your ideas unless you can sell yourself, and if you can sell yourself you're half way to selling the ideas that you've got&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Commanders pp. 307-311&quot;/&gt; The newest of the northern air bases he proposed while CAS, near [[Weipa, Queensland|Weipa]] in [[Cape York Peninsula|Cape York]], was opened in 1998 and named [[RAAF Scherger]] in his honour.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Royal Australian Air Force pp.283-284&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade | date=27 September 1999| title=Defence Sub-Committee Visit to Defence Establishments in Northern Australia 26&amp;ndash;29 July 1999
