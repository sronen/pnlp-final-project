[[Air Vice Marshal]] '''Ian Dougald McLachlan''' [[Companion of the Order of the Bath|CB]], [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire|CBE]], [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|DFC]] (23 July 1911&amp;nbsp;– 14 July 1991) was a senior commander in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF). Born in Melbourne, he was a cadet at the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]], before joining the Air Force in December 1930. After serving in [[Flight instructor|instructional]] and general flying roles, he took command of [[No. 3 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;3 Squadron]] in December 1939, leading it into action in the [[Middle East Theatre of World War II|Middle East]] less than a year later. Awarded the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross]], he returned to Australia in 1942 to command air bases in [[Canberra]] and Melbourne. The following year he was posted to the [[South West Pacific theatre of World War II|South West Pacific]], where he led [[No. 71 Wing RAAF|Nos.&amp;nbsp;71]] and [[No. 73 Wing RAAF|73 Wings]]. Having been promoted to [[Group Captain]], he took charge of RAAF Southern Area in 1944, and [[No. 81 Wing RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;81 Wing]] in the  [[Dutch East Indies]] the following year.

Raised to acting [[Air Commodore]] in 1946, McLachlan served as Senior Air Staff Officer for the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force|British Commonwealth Air Group]] in Japan until 1948. After leading [[North-Eastern Area Command (RAAF)|RAAF North-Eastern Area]] in 1951–53, he was appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] and posted to Britain, where he attended the [[Royal College of Defence Studies|Imperial Defence College]]. Promoted Air Vice Marshal, he returned to Australia in 1957 as Air Officer Commanding [[Air Force Training Group RAAF|Training Command]]; in this role he carried out two major reviews focussing on the RAAF's educational and command systems. He was [[Deputy Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Deputy Chief of the Air Staff]] from 1959 to 1961, and then Head of the Australian Joint Services Staff in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington, DC]] until 1963. Appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in 1966, McLachlan's final post before retiring in 1968 was as Air Member for Supply and Equipment. He was a consultant to [[Northrop Corporation|Northrop]] after leaving the RAAF, and lived in [[Darling Point, New South Wales|Darling Point]], Sydney, until his death in 1991.

==Early career==
The son of Dugald and Bertha McLachlan, Ian McLachlan was born in the Melbourne suburb of [[South Yarra, Victoria|South Yarra]], Victoria, on 23&amp;nbsp;July 1911.&lt;ref name=&quot;Who's Who&quot;&gt;Howie, ''Who's Who in Australia 1992'', p. 793&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/05.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', p. 110]&lt;/ref&gt; Following education at [[Melbourne High School (Victoria)|Melbourne High School]], he entered the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]], in 1928.&lt;ref name=&quot;AVM&quot;&gt;[http://airpower.airforce.gov.au/Contents/About-APDC/About-APDC/Office-of-Air-Force-History/Air-Marshals-of-the-RAAF/137/Air-Vice-Marshals-L-Z.aspx Air Vice-Marshals (L–Z)] at [[Royal Australian Air Force]].

By June 1943, McLachlan had been promoted [[Group Captain]] and given command of [[No. 73 Wing RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;73 Wing]]. He established his headquarters at [[Goodenough Island]], where he was responsible for organising the wing into a fighter formation consisting of [[No. 76 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;76 Squadron]] (Kittyhawks), No.&amp;nbsp;77 Squadron (Kittyhawks) and [[No. 79 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;79 Squadron]] ([[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfires]]). As well as providing local air defence, and fighter escort for Australian bombers, the Kittyhawks were armed with [[Incendiary device|incendiary]] and general-purpose bombs so that they could engage in [[close air support|ground attack]] missions, a practice that had already been employed by Commonwealth forces in the Middle Eastern theatre.&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, ''Air War Against Japan'', pp. 33–36&lt;/ref&gt; In August, the wing transferred to [[Kiriwina]], while No.&amp;nbsp;9 Group's other combat formation, No.&amp;nbsp;71 Wing, took over responsibility for Goodenough.&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/05.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p. 69]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/08.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p. 124]&lt;/ref&gt; Appointed Senior Air Staff Officer (SASO) at No.&amp;nbsp;9 Group, McLachlan handed over command of No.&amp;nbsp;73 Wing to Wing Commander Gordon Steege in October 1943.&lt;ref name=&quot;AVM&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Steege&quot;&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/units/people_8291.asp Air Commodore Gordon Henry Steege] at Australian War Memorial.

He feared that Australian fighter pilots especially would be &quot;increasingly restless if the Americans took all the fighting plums&quot;.

As AOC Training Command, McLachlan undertook two reviews that would have &quot;a significant effect on the Air Force of the 1960s&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens, Going Solo, p. 78&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; In 1957, at the instigation of the Air Member for Personnel, Air Vice Marshal [[Frederick Scherger]], he formed a committee to review the effectiveness of the syllabus at [[Air Force Training Group RAAF#RAAF College|RAAF College]] for meeting the future needs of the Air Force in an age of [[Missile guidance|guided missile]]s and nuclear weaponry. This led to a policy of cadets undertaking academic degrees, in line with similar institutions in the other armed services; the College was subsequently renamed RAAF Academy. The result has been considered only partially successful however, for while it turned out more highly educated officers, that education was solely in a rigid scientific discipline suited to an Air Force that never came into existence, namely one relying on missiles rather than manned aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p. 188&lt;/ref&gt; In 1959, McLachlan chaired a committee to review the change in the RAAF's command structure that had taken place in 1953–54, from a geographically based &quot;area&quot; system to a functional system consisting of Home, Maintenance, and Training Commands. Concluding that this had reduced duplication and improved efficiency, he proposed further rationalisation by amalgamating Training and Maintenance Commands to form a new organisation, Support Command. His plan was duly implemented, as was his recommendation that Home Command, responsible for air operations, be renamed [[RAAF Air Command|Operational Command]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens, Going Solo, p. 78&quot;/&gt;

Despite what was touted as a firm timetable and cost schedule for the order, McLachlan confided to a colleague that he had serious concerns about when and if the RAAF would actually get the F-111, and what the final cost would be. According to Air Force historian Alan Stephens, &quot;even for such a shrewd and sardonic man as McLachlan, that was to prove a painfully prescient observation&quot;, as the new bomber was delivered six years late and massively over budget.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p. 376&lt;/ref&gt; Following his return from Washington, McLachlan became Air Member for Supply and Equipment (AMSE) in February 1964.&lt;ref name=&quot;Solo&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p. 500&lt;/ref&gt; As AMSE he sat on the Air Board, the service's controlling body that consisted of its most senior officers, chaired by the Chief of the Air Staff. In this position he worked to increase the proportion of tertiary educated Supply Officers, following similar achievements among Engineering Officers in the RAAF's Technical Branch.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 66, 76, 140&lt;/ref&gt; He was appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in the 1966 New Year's Honours, the citation noting particularly his chairmanship of the two &quot;historic&quot; committees that reorganised RAAF College and the Air Force's command structure in the late 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=43855|supp=yes|startpage=37|date=1 January 1966|accessdate=on 18 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=QUEEN HONOURS 20|work=RAAF News Vol. 8, No. 1|date=January–February 1966|page=p. 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of [[Electronic Data Processing]] became more widespread during McLachlan's tenure as AMSE, and by 1968 the RAAF's supply system had been computerised.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 185–186&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
McLachlan completed his term as Air Member for Supply and Equipment on 23&amp;nbsp;July 1968 and retired from the Air Force; he was divorced from his wife the same year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Who's Who&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WW2&quot;/&gt; Upon leaving the military, he became an aeronautical consultant to the [[Northrop Corporation]], and chairman of [http://www.eoas.info/biogs/A001142b.htm Information Electronics Pty Ltd] from 1983, serving in both positions until 1987.&lt;ref name=&quot;Who's Who&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AVM&quot;/&gt; He was also chairman of [[Pokolbin, New South Wales|Pokolbin Winemakers]] from 1970 through 1975.&lt;ref name=&quot;Who's Who&quot;/&gt; In retirement he continued to exercise his interest in Australia's defence, joining in 1975 a group of [[Pundit (expert)|pundit]]s, including former Chief of the Air Staff [[Alister Murdoch|Sir Alister Murdoch]], who promoted the addition of nuclear weapons to the country's arsenal.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Power Plus Attitude'', p. 149&lt;/ref&gt; A resident of Sydney's [[Darling Point, New South Wales|Darling Point]], Ian McLachlan died on 14&amp;nbsp;July 1991.&lt;ref name=&quot;AVM&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p. 523&lt;/ref&gt;
