[[Air Vice Marshal]] '''Brian Alexander Eaton''' [[Order of the Bath|CB]], [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]], [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]] [[Medal bar|&amp; Bar]], [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|DFC]] (15&amp;nbsp;December 1916 – 17&amp;nbsp;October 1992) was a senior commander in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF). Born in [[Tasmania]] and raised in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], he joined the RAAF in 1936 and was promoted to [[Flight Lieutenant]] on the outbreak of World War&amp;nbsp;II. He held training positions before being posted to [[No. 3 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;3 Squadron]] at the beginning of 1943, flying [[Curtiss P-40|P-40 Kittyhawk]] fighter-bombers in [[North African Campaign|North Africa]]. Despite being shot down three times within ten days soon after arriving, Eaton quickly rose to become the unit's Commanding Officer, and by year's end had been awarded the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross]]. To this he added the [[Distinguished Service Order]] and [[Medal bar|Bar]] in 1944–45, gaining promotion to [[Group Captain]] and command of [[List of Royal Air Force wings|No.&amp;nbsp;239 Wing RAF]] in [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italy]]. His war service also earned him the US [[Silver Star]] in 1946. 

In the decade following World War II, Eaton led [[No. 81 Wing RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;81 Wing]] in Japan, and [[No. 78 Wing RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;78 Wing]] in [[Malta]]. He commanded [[RAAF Base Williamtown]] from 1957 to 1959, after which he was appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]]. As Director-General of Operational Requirements in 1965, Eaton argued for increased RAAF co-operation with the [[Australian Army]] in light of growing involvement in the [[Military history of Australia during the Vietnam War|Vietnam War]]. He was promoted to [[Air Vice Marshal]] the next year, and became [[Deputy Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Deputy Chief of the Air Staff]]. Posted to [[Singapore]] as [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) [[List of Royal Air Force groups|No.&amp;nbsp;224 Group RAF]] in 1967, he was appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] for his work as Chief of Staff at Headquarters [[Far East Air Force (Royal Air Force)|RAF Far East Air Force]] in 1969. He then served as Air Member for Personnel, before being selected as AOC [[RAAF Air Command|Operational Command]] in 1973. Eaton retired from the RAAF in December that year, and became an executive for [[Rolls-Royce plc|Rolls-Royce]] in [[Canberra]]. He died in 1992 at the age of 75.

His early ambition to be a doctor was curtailed when his father died and he had to leave school early.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herald&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|title='The Boss' packs it in|journal=[[The Herald (Melbourne)|The Herald]] |page=p. 25|date=12 January 1974|accessdate=on 14 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He enlisted as an air cadet in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) on 20&amp;nbsp;January 1936, undergoing flying training at [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Point Cook Base|RAAF Point Cook]].&lt;ref name=&quot;WW2&quot;&gt;[http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/script/veteran.asp?ServiceID=R&amp;VeteranID=1204686 Eaton, Brian Alexander] at [http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/ World War 2 Nominal Roll].

Eaton was commissioned as a [[Pilot Officer]] upon graduation from flying school in January 1937, and posted to [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron]]. Within six months he was promoted to [[Flying Officer]] and joined [[No. 21 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;21 Squadron]] at [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Laverton Base|RAAF Laverton]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AWM&quot;/&gt; In 1938, he became an [[flight instructor|instructor]] at Point Cook's [[No. 1 Flying Training School RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School]], where he also took part in the RAAF's early long navigation exercises.&lt;ref name=&quot;Air Marshals&quot;&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''Air Marshals of the RAAF'', p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp. 207–208&lt;/ref&gt; He was promoted to [[Flight Lieutenant]] on [[Invasion of Poland|1&amp;nbsp;September 1939]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AWM&quot;/&gt;

==World War II==
===Early war service===
[[File:MED0687Kittyhawk3Sqn1942.jpg|thumb|left|240px|P-40 Kittyhawk of No.&amp;nbsp;3 Squadron RAAF during the North African Campaign|alt=Single-engined military monoplane on desert airfield]]
In April 1940, Eaton was assigned to the newly re-formed [[Central Flying School RAAF|Central Flying School]] at [[Camden, New South Wales|Camden]], New South Wales, as an instructor. Promoted to temporary [[Squadron Leader]] in September 1940, he became Staff Officer Flying Training at the Department of Air in [[Canberra]]. He was transferred as Fighter Controller to No.&amp;nbsp;5 Fighter Sector Headquarters at [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], Northern Territory in March 1942.&lt;ref name=&quot;AWM&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Air Marshals&quot;/&gt; In October that year, he departed Australia for [[North African Campaign|North Africa]] via India and the United Kingdom, fearful that the fighting would be over before he arrived. He posted in to No.&amp;nbsp;1 Middle East Training School in January 1943 prior to taking up duties with [[No.&amp;nbsp;3 Squadron RAAF]], then engaged in the [[Tunisia Campaign|Battle of Tunisia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AWM&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Herald&quot;/&gt; 
  
Eaton's combat career began inauspiciously, when he was shot down three times in the space of ten days. On the first occasion, his [[Curtiss P-40|P-40 Kittyhawk]] was hit by 20&amp;nbsp;mm cannon shells from an enemy fighter that he never saw. He later recalled, &quot;I was too busy getting the kite down to be frightened. But my God was I surprised.&quot; Eaton brought his crippled aircraft in for a forced landing at [[El Hamma]]—in the midst of a tank battle between German and New Zealand forces. Making his way over to the New Zealanders after the fighting had died down, he requested and received a lift back to his air base. The second time he was shot down, his plane was struck by [[8.8 cm FlaK 18/36/37/41|88&amp;nbsp;mm]] anti-aircraft fire, necessitating another crash landing, this time behind enemy lines. Sympathetic Arab tribesmen smuggled him past the Germans and back to his airfield. Two days later, his P-40 was hit by fire from an [[Messerschmitt Bf 109|Me 109]] that dived at him from out of the sun. He was able to glide back to base, {{convert|80|mi|km}} away, but on arriving found that it was under attack by German bombers. He decided he had no other option than to land the damaged plane among the exploding bombs, and managed to do so without mishap. His series of narrow escapes engendered a spirit of fatalism, and a habit of keeping his emotions severely in check while on duty: &quot;I just couldn't see myself living when so many were dying. It was something which, at the time, didn't bear much dwelling on.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Herald&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mordike&quot;&gt;Mordike, ''The RAAF in Europe and North Africa 1939–1945'', pp. 105–107&lt;/ref&gt;

===Squadron and wing command===

Despite his early setbacks in combat, Eaton soon rose to command No.&amp;nbsp;3 Squadron, taking over from Squadron Leader [[Bobby Gibbes]] on 21&amp;nbsp;April 1943. He led the unit as it relocated to [[Malta]] the following month, in preparation for the [[Allied invasion of Sicily]].&lt;ref name =&quot;Herald&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Herington, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/28/chapters/21.pdf ''Air War Against Germany and Italy'', p. 567]&lt;/ref&gt; Illness forced him to hand over command in June–July, but he returned to take charge of the squadron in August as it continued to fly escort and [[interdiction]] missions in Sicily with other units of [[List of Royal Air Force wings|No.&amp;nbsp;239 Wing RAF]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Herington&quot;&gt;Herington, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/29/chapters/03.pdf ''Air Power Over Europe'', p. 57]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Units of the Royal Australian Air Force.

He repeated the exercise on 7&amp;nbsp;November, when the squadron scored hits on vessels in two separate raids in the harbour at [[Split (city)|Split]]. On 19&amp;nbsp;November, when the rest of No.&amp;nbsp;239 Wing was unable to complete any missions due to adverse weather, Eaton found a hole in the clouds and led eight Kittyhawks in a successful attack on [[Opi (town)|Opi]] in central Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Herington, ''Air Power Over Europe'', pp. 68–69&lt;/ref&gt; He was promoted to temporary [[Wing Commander (rank)|Wing Commander]] on 1&amp;nbsp;December.&lt;ref name=&quot;AWM&quot;/&gt; On 14&amp;nbsp;December, he was awarded the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] for pressing home a night attack on [[Axis powers|Axis]] armour at [[Termoli]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/AWM192/00311/003110019.pdf Recommendation: Distinguished Flying Cross] at Australian War Memorial.

On 16&amp;nbsp;February 1944, the day after the contentious destruction of [[Monte Cassino]], Eaton took No.&amp;nbsp;3 Squadron through a break in the bad weather to attack the ruined monastery, the only one of No.&amp;nbsp;239 Wing’s units to successfully bomb its target that day.&lt;ref&gt;Herington, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/29/chapters/04.pdf ''Air Power Over Europe'', p. 104]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, ''The Brotherhood of Airmen'', pp. 101–102&lt;/ref&gt; He handed over command of No.&amp;nbsp;3 Squadron later that month, and was transferred to No.&amp;nbsp;1 Mobile Operations Room Unit as forward air controller for the final [[Battle of Monte Cassino|assault on Monte Cassino]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AWM&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Herald&quot;/&gt; The run of luck that Eaton experienced in his first weeks of air combat in Tunisia continued on the ground in Italy. He survived three months of constant artillery fire, including an occasion when a shell exploded directly above his observation post, striking down a British officer standing next to him. He also came under machine-gun fire when he took a wrong turn one day and drove into the German lines, but again escaped unhurt.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herald&quot;/&gt; He was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Order]] on 7&amp;nbsp;April, in recognition of his leadership of No.&amp;nbsp;3 Squadron in North Africa, Malta, Sicily and Italy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/AWM192/00311/003110017.pdf Recommendation: Distinguished Service Order] at Australian War Memorial.

Raised to acting [[Group Captain]],&lt;ref name=&quot;AWM&quot;/&gt; Eaton was given command of No.&amp;nbsp;239 Wing on 3&amp;nbsp;August 1944, taking responsibility for No.&amp;nbsp;3 Squadron and [[No.&amp;nbsp;450 Squadron RAAF]], [[No. 112 Squadron RAF|No.&amp;nbsp;112 Squadron]] and [[List of Royal Air Force aircraft squadrons|No.&amp;nbsp;260 Squadron RAF]], No.&amp;nbsp;5 Squadron of the [[South African Air Force]], and No.&amp;nbsp;250 Squadron of the [[Royal Rhodesian Air Force]]. Credited with leading &quot;many outstanding raids&quot;, he was known to his staff as &quot;The Boss&quot;, and often flew twice a day with a different squadron on each mission; when his superiors found out how many sorties he was personally undertaking and ordered him to cut back, he simply ceased recording his flying hours.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herald&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Herington, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/29/chapters/14.pdf ''Air Power Over Europe'', p. 351]&lt;/ref&gt; The wing's two RAF squadrons had already re-equipped with [[P-51 Mustang]]s when Eaton took over; No.&amp;nbsp;5 converted in September and No.&amp;nbsp;3 in November. As well as supporting the [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|Eighth Army]] in Italy, the Mustang units carried out missions in Yugoslavia in concert with the [[Balkan Air Force]], prior to Axis forces surrendering on 2&amp;nbsp;May.&lt;ref&gt;Herington, ''Air Power Over Europe'', pp. 353–356&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scutts, ''Mustang Aces of the Ninth &amp; Fifteenth Air Forces &amp; the RAF'', pp. 48–51&lt;/ref&gt; Eaton was unofficially credited with shooting down as many as seven enemy aircraft during the Mediterranean campaigns, but was never listed among Australian [[flying ace]]s. Many of the missions that he undertook with No.&amp;nbsp;3 Squadron and in command of No.&amp;nbsp;239 Wing were ground attack or anti-shipping sorties, rather than air-to-air combat. In addition, he was known as a leader who, when opportunities did arise to engage other aircraft, would attempt to manoeuvre his rookie pilots into position to make a &quot;kill&quot;, rather than take the shot himself.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mordike&quot;/&gt; On 12&amp;nbsp;June, he was awarded a [[Medal bar|Bar]] to his Distinguished Service Order for &quot;Outstanding skill and leadership against heavy odds&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/AWM192/00311/003110018.pdf Recommendation: Bar to Distinguished Service Order] at Australian War Memorial.

Eaton was posted to Britain following the end of World War&amp;nbsp;II, and attended [[RAF Staff College, Andover|RAF Staff College]] the following year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Air Marshals&quot;/&gt;  In 1947, he was appointed Officer Commanding [[No. 81 Wing RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;81 (Fighter) Wing]] in Japan, as part of the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]] (BCOF). The Australian contingent initially comprised three combat squadrons: [[No. 77 Squadron RAAF|Nos.&amp;nbsp;76]], [[No. 77 Squadron RAAF|77]] and [[No. 82 Squadron RAAF|82]]. By mid-1949, it had been reduced to No.&amp;nbsp;77 Squadron alone, and Headquarters BCOF had been disbanded; Eaton served as &quot;RAAF Component&quot; commander for the remainder of his tenure in Japan.&lt;ref name=&quot;Air Marshals&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 214–216&lt;/ref&gt; Returning to Australia in November, he became Deputy Director of Training at the Department of Air, Canberra, where he remained until 1951. Later that year, he was appointed Officer Commanding [[No. 78 Wing RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;78 (Fighter) Wing]] at [[RAAF Base Williamtown]], New South Wales.&lt;ref name=&quot;AWM&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, ''The Brotherhood of Airmen'', p. 144&lt;/ref&gt; He had reverted to a substantive rank of Wing Commander since leaving Japan, as the RAAF shrank dramatically with demobilisation and many senior officers lost the temporary or acting ranks they had gained in wartime.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 24–25&lt;/ref&gt; On 15&amp;nbsp;September, he landed a [[De Havilland Vampire|Vampire]] jet fighter at Point Cook with one flat tyre and one wheel retracted, after its undercarriage had become jammed.

Completing his tour with No.&amp;nbsp;78 Wing in mid-1954, Eaton joined Air Vice Marshal [[Alister Murdoch]] on an international mission to examine potential new fighter, bomber, transport and training aircraft for the RAAF.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 38–39&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Power Plus Attitude'', pp. 142, 160&lt;/ref&gt; The team's report advocated the [[F-104 Starfighter]] as a replacement for the [[CAC Sabre]],&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p. 354&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear-capable]] British [[V bomber|V-bomber]] strike aircraft to augment Australia's [[English Electric Canberra|Canberra]] bombers, and [[C-130 Hercules]] transports to replace the [[C-47 Skytrain|C-47 Dakota]]. While the proposals for V-bombers and the F-104 were not taken up, the Australian Government acquired the C-130 in 1958. Described as second only to the [[General Dynamics F-111]] as the &quot;most significant&quot; purchase by the RAAF, the Hercules gave the Air Force its first [[Airlift#Strategic airlift|strategic airlift]] capability, which in years to come would provide a &quot;lifeline&quot; to Australian forces deployed to [[Malayan Emergency|Malaya]], [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]], and other parts of the South-West Pacific.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 416–18&lt;/ref&gt; The mission also recommended the locally built Vampire T35 as a jet trainer for No.&amp;nbsp;1 Applied Flying Training School; sixty-nine were later delivered by the [[de Havilland]] factory in [[Bankstown, New South Wales|Bankstown]], New South Wales.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 160–161&lt;/ref&gt; Eaton served as RAAF Director of Operations during 1955–56, and as Officer Commanding RAAF Base Williamtown and Commandant of the co-located School of Land-Air Warfare from March 1957 until February 1959.&lt;ref name=&quot;Air Marshals&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Units of the Royal Australian Air Force: Bases'', p. 171&lt;/ref&gt; He was appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (CBE) in the 1959 [[Queen's Birthday Honours]].&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=41728|supp=yes|startpage=3736|date=13 June 1959|accessdate=10 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Following his tour at Williamtown, Eaton spent two years as Director of Joint Services Plans before attending the [[Royal College of Defence Studies|Imperial Defence College, London]] in 1961. Raised to [[Air Commodore]], he was appointed Director-General of Operational Requirements in 1962. Concurrently he became an Honorary [[Aide-de-Camp]] to the [[Queen Elizabeth of the United Kingdom|Queen]], in which capacity he served until 1965.&lt;ref name=&quot;Air Marshals&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Who's Who&quot;/&gt; As the Army reorganised to deal with [[Military history of Australia during the Vietnam War|Australia's increasing commitments to the Vietnam War]] in the mid-1960s, it sought to procure a dozen twin-engined aircraft of a size hitherto only operated by the RAAF, and also proposed a joint review of [[close air support]]. RAAF senior command chose to deal with the Army's proposals by ignoring them. As Director-General of Operational Requirements, Eaton argued that if the RAAF did not more fully satisfy the ground support requirements of the Army, then the Army itself would seek to take control of this sphere of operations, undermining the RAAF's position as the main provider of Australia's air power. Pointing out to the [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]], Air Marshal Murdoch, that it was &quot;clearly the Army's intention to have complete command and control&quot; of air-to-ground assets, he warned of a parallel situation in America, where the [[United States Army|US Army]] was looking to take over all battlefield air support in response to the [[United States Air Force|USAF]] failing to keep up to date in the provision of basic attack aircraft. The RAAF's refusal to adequately deal with its ground support responsibilities led to long-running inter-service enmity, and contributed to the Australian government's decision twenty years later to transfer control of battlefield helicopters to the Army.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 317–322&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p. 298&lt;/ref&gt; At this time, Eaton also led the acquisition team that selected the [[Aermacchi MB-326|Macchi MB-326]] as the RAAF's new jet trainer, as it met all requirements, could be licence-built in Australia, and was relatively inexpensive. The first of ninety-seven was delivered by the [[Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation]] in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 161–163&lt;/ref&gt;

Promoted to [[Air Vice Marshal]], Eaton became [[Deputy Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Deputy Chief of the Air Staff]] in 1966. In December that year, with Australian [[de Havilland Canada DHC-4 Caribou|Caribou]] transports and [[UH-1 Iroquois|Iroquois]] helicopters already serving in Vietnam, Eaton advocated building up the RAAF's &quot;sharp end&quot; there, increasing air support for ground troops. He preferred deploying Sabre or [[Dassault Mirage III|Mirage]] fighters rather than the mooted Canberra bombers, which he saw as more suitable for a strategic role. Above all, he accepted the &quot;[[domino theory]]&quot; and believed that if Australia did not aid South Vietnam, &quot;we'd lose the lot&quot;. In the event, Canberras were despatched rather than fighters.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Power Plus Attitude'', pp. 124, 132&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The RAAF in Vietnam'', pp. 90–91&lt;/ref&gt; In 1967, Eaton became the last AOC of [[List of Royal Air Force groups|No.&amp;nbsp;224 Group RAF]] under the British Far East Air Force (FEAF) in [[Singapore]], as permanent squadrons were dropped from its strength. This reorganisation led to him taking over as Chief of Staff at Headquarters FEAF the following year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Air Marshals&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p. 255&lt;/ref&gt; In this capacity, he was appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] (CB) in the 1969 Queen's Birthday Honours.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue= 44864 |supp=yes|startpage=5995|date=14 June 1969|accessdate=10 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Returning to Australia, Eaton became Air Member for Personnel (AMP) in October 1969. As AMP, he sat on the Air Board, the RAAF's controlling body, which consisted of its most senior officers and was chaired by the Chief of the Air Staff.&lt;ref name=&quot;Solo&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p. 500&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1973, he succeeded to the post of AOC Operational Command (now [[RAAF Air Command|Air Command]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Herald&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Solo&quot;/&gt; He served in this position until retirement, his tenure witnessing the introduction of the F-111 [[Variable-sweep wing|swing-wing]] bomber to service in Australia, when the first machines touched down at [[RAAF Base Amberley]], Queensland in July. Leaving the military on 15&amp;nbsp;December 1973,&lt;ref name=&quot;WW2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p. 290&lt;/ref&gt; Eaton became Regional Executive for [[Rolls Royce plc|Rolls Royce Australia]] in [[Canberra]]. He remained with the company for the next decade, continuing to live in Canberra until his death on 17&amp;nbsp;October 1992, at the age of 75.&lt;ref name=&quot;Air Marshals&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Who's Who&quot;/&gt; In 1996, his widow Josephine donated funding for the Air Vice-Marshal B.A.&amp;nbsp;Eaton 'Airman of the Year' Award to the RAAF, to annually recognise &quot;significant contribution to both the Service and the community&quot; by [[Ranks of the RAAF#Airmen|airmen and airwoman]] ranked [[corporal]] or below.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.airforce.gov.au/Awards/ Air Vice-Marshal B.A. Eaton Award (Airman of the year)] at [[Royal Australian Air Force]].
