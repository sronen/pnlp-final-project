'''Thomas Charles Richmond Baker''' [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|DFC]], [[Military Medal|MM]] [[Medal bar|&amp; Bar]] (2 May 1897 &amp;ndash; 4 November 1918) was an [[Australia]]n soldier, aviator and [[flying ace]] of the [[First World War]]. Born in [[Smithfield, South Australia|Smithfield]], [[South Australia]], he was an active sportsman in his youth and developed a keen interest in aviation. He was employed as a clerk with the [[Bank of New South Wales]], before he enlisted in the [[First Australian Imperial Force|Australian Imperial Force]] in July 1915, for service in the First World War. Posted to an artillery unit on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]], he was awarded the [[Military Medal]] for carrying out numerous repairs on a communications line while subject to severe artillery fire. In June 1917, Baker was awarded a [[Medal bar|bar]] to his decoration, for his part in quelling a fire in one of the artillery gun pits that was endangering approximately 300 rounds of [[Shrapnel shell|shrapnel]] and [[Explosive material#High explosives|high explosive]]. 

In September 1917, Baker applied for a position as a mechanic in the [[Royal Australian Air Force|Australian Flying Corps]]. He was instead selected for flight training, and was posted to courses in the United Kingdom. He graduated as a pilot and was commissioned a [[second lieutenant]] in March 1918. Posted for active duty in France that June, Baker joined the ranks of [[No. 4 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;4 Squadron AFC]]. Over the next four months, he rose to the rank of [[Captain (land)|captain]] and was credited with bringing down twelve German aircraft. He was shot down and killed on 4 November 1918. In February 1919, he was posthumously awarded the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross]].

==Early life==
Thomas Charles Richmond Baker was born in [[Smithfield, South Australia|Smithfield]], [[South Australia]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Camel&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Franks|2003|p=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Snipe&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Franks|2002|p=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; on 2&amp;nbsp;May 1897, the eldest son of Richmond Baker, a [[schoolmaster]] and farmer, and his wife Annie Martha (n√©e Gardner). He was educated at [[St Peter's College, Adelaide|St Peter's College]] in [[Adelaide]]. During his school years Baker was an active sportsman, taking part in rowing, tennis and football, in addition to being a member of the cadet corps. In his youth, he acquired an avid interest in aviation, and the construction of model aeroplanes became &quot;his chief hobby&quot;. Graduating from secondary school in 1914, he gained employment as a clerk with the Adelaide branch of the [[Bank of New South Wales]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;&gt;{{Australian Dictionary of Biography|last=McCarthy|first=John|year=1979|id=A070157b|title=Baker, Thomas Charles Richmond (1897 &amp;ndash; 1918)|accessdate=8 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, he joined the [[Royal Australian Engineers|11th Royal Australian Engineers]] of the [[Citizens Military Force]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Aces&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Garrisson|1999|pp=79&amp;ndash;80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==First World War==
===Australian Imperial Force===
On 29 July 1915, Baker enlisted in the [[First Australian Imperial Force|Australian Imperial Force]] for service during the First World War. Allocated as a reinforcement to the 6th Field Artillery Brigade with the rank of [[Gunner (rank)|gunner]], he embarked from [[Melbourne]] aboard HMAT ''Persic'' on 22 November, bound for [[Egypt]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/awm8/13_34_2/pdf/0058.pdf|title=Thomas Charles Richmond Baker|accessdate=8 December 2009|format=PDF|work=First World War Embarkation Roll|publisher=Australian War Memorial}}&lt;/ref&gt; On arrival, Baker was posted to the 16th Battery before moving to [[France]] for service on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Disembarking in France on 1 July 1916,&lt;ref name=&quot;Aces&quot;/&gt; Baker took part in the [[Battle of the Somme|Somme offensive]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;

On 11 December 1916, Baker was engaged in battle with his unit near [[Gueudecourt]]. During the action, he was posted as a telephonist with the forward observation team sent to record the fall of the artillery and secure the range for a bombardment. Their position during this time was on a forward slope of the Australian frontline, which was subject to constant observation and the attention of German snipers. Attempting to maintain communications, Baker ventured out on four occasions during the engagement, each time subject to the heavy artillery barrage from the German forces, and repaired the telephone line in thirty separate places. As a consequence, the 6th Battery was able to align its artillery barrage and destroy the Germans' forward trench. Commended for his &quot;great gallantry&quot; as well as &quot;good service and&amp;nbsp;... great devotion to duty&quot;, Baker was awarded the [[Military Medal]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MM&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/AWM28/1/79/0007.pdf|title=Recommendation for Thomas Charles Richmond Baker to be awarded a Military Medal|accessdate=8 December 2009|format=PDF|work=Recommendations: First World War|publisher=Australian War Memorial}}&lt;/ref&gt; The announcement for the decoration was published in a supplement to the ''[[London Gazette]]'' on 19 February 1917.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=29953|date=19 February 1917|startpage=1756|supp=yes|accessdate=8 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1917, the 16th Battery was relocated to the [[Messen|Messines]] sector of the frontline in [[Belgium]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bar to MM&quot;/&gt; On 16 March, Baker was admitted to hospital suffering from an illness; he returned to his unit six days later.&lt;ref name=&quot;ServRec&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://naa12.naa.gov.au/scripts/imagine.asp?B=3010111&amp;I=1&amp;SE=1|title=Baker, Thomas Charles|accessdate=8 December 2009|work=Records Search|publisher=[[National Archives of Australia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the afternoon of 21 June, the unit's position was subject to a severe bombardment of artillery shelling, resulting in an order for all men to evacuate the gun pits and seek cover. As a consequence of the barrage, the camouflage covering one of the gun pits caught fire, endangering approximately 300&amp;nbsp;rounds of [[Shrapnel shell|shrapnel]] and [[Explosive material#High explosives|high explosives]]. The [[Company Sergeant Major|battery sergeant major]] immediately called for men to assist him in quelling the blaze; Baker and three others volunteered. Despite the continuous shellfire, the four men promptly set about retrieving water from a nearby well and shellholes with buckets &quot;at great personal risk&quot;, dousing the fire. The camouflage had been completely destroyed, several sand bags had caught fire, and a few rounds of ammunition were charred. As a result of their actions, Baker's three companions were recommended for the Military Medal, and Baker for a [[Medal bar|bar]] to his.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bar to MM&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/AWM28/2/192/0009.pdf|title=Recommendation for Thomas Charles Richmond Baker to be awarded a Bar to the Military Medal|accessdate=8 December 2009|format=PDF|work=Recommendations: First World War|publisher=Australian War Memorial}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/AWM28/2/192/0008.pdf|title=Recommendation for John Brown, Raymond Bishop and John McSweeney to be awarded the Military Medal|accessdate=8 December 2009|format=PDF|work=Recommendations: First World War|publisher=Australian War Memorial}}&lt;/ref&gt; The announcement of the decorations was promogulated in a supplement to the ''London Gazette'' on 21 August 1917.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=30243|date=21 August 1917|startpage=8641|endpage=8647|supp=yes|accessdate=8 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1917, Baker followed his ambition of joining the [[Australian Flying Corps]] and applied for a transfer to become an air mechanic when the opportunity arose. His application proved successful, though he was instead selected to become a pilot and was posted for flight training.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Embarking for the [[United Kingdom]] the following month, he was posted to No. 5 Training Squadron as a cadet pilot for his initial aviation instruction. On 27&amp;nbsp;March, Baker graduated as a pilot in the Australian Flying Corps and was [[Officer (armed forces)|commissioned]] as a [[second lieutenant]];&lt;ref name=&quot;ServRec&quot;/&gt; he had completed his first solo flight earlier that month.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; In May, he was posted for a course at No. 2 School of Aerial Fighting and Gunnery.&lt;ref name=&quot;ServRec&quot;/&gt;

Baker proceeded overseas to France on 15 June 1918 and, on arrival the following day, was posted to [[No. 4 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;4 Squadron AFC]] piloting [[Sopwith Camel]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aces&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ServRec&quot;/&gt; On 23 June, he flew his first operational sortie over the German lines;&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; he was promoted to [[lieutenant]] four days later.&lt;ref name=&quot;ServRec&quot;/&gt; On 31 July, Baker was among a formation of seven Camels tasked with carrying out a patrol over German-held territory. The group crossed over into German lines near [[Nieppe|Nieppe Forrest]], and flew towards [[Estaires]]. The Camels soon intercepted a formation of seven [[Fokker D.VII]]s, and the entire patrol immediately dived at the German aircraft. In the ensuing melee, Baker managed to force one of the aircraft down to the ground, thus scoring his first aerial victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cutlack|1941|p=304}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout August 1918, No. 4 Squadron &quot;maintained a high operational tempo&quot; as the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] [[Hundred Days Offensive|launched a new offensive]] on the Western Front.&lt;ref name=&quot;No. 4&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/units/unit_10842.asp|title=No. 4 Squadron AFC|accessdate=8 December 2009|work=Australian military units|publisher=Australian War Memorial}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 August, Baker and two others took off from their squadron aerodrome at [[Reclinghem]]; all three machines were carrying a heavy load of bombs. Airborne over Pont-du-Hem, the trio released their bombs over German [[billet]]s in the area, before spotting two [[Albatros D.V]]s. The three Australians closed in on the two aircraft. Baker engaged an Albatros, his fire severing the left wing of the aircraft, effectively destroying the machine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cutlack|1941|p=340}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nine days later, a formation of 65 aircraft was assembled from [[No. 88 Squadron RAF|No.&amp;nbsp;88 Squadron RAF]], [[No. 92 Squadron RAF|No.&amp;nbsp;92 Squadron RAF]], [[No. 2 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;2 Squadron AFC]] and Baker's No. 4 Squadron AFC to execute a mass raid on the German aerodrome at [[Haubourdin]]. The fleet of aircraft was equipped with a range of incendiary and explosive bombs, in addition to machine gun ammunition. Led by Captain [[Arthur Henry Cobby|Harry Cobby]], the aircraft from No.&amp;nbsp;4 Squadron were the first to sweep down and assault the target. At one point, Baker pursued a staff car until the vehicle ran up an embankment and flipped over. He later reported that &quot;No one left the car&quot;. The raid, which was the largest aerial attack by Allied forces to that date, was highly successful; British estimates concluded that 37 German aeroplanes had been destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cutlack|1941|pp=346&amp;ndash;348}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/people/142.asp|title=Air Commodore Arthur Henry (Harry) Cobby|accessdate=21 February 2009|work=Who's who|publisher=Australian War Memorial}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 August, Baker led a patrol of six aircraft over [[Lys (department)|Lys]]. Five days later, he shot down a German [[Observation balloon|balloon]] while on a lone mission in poor weather, scoring his third aerial victory. At dawn on 30&amp;nbsp;August, Baker took off on a sortie with Lieutenants [[Elwyn King]] and Oscar Ramsay. Over [[Laventie]], the trio encountered three [[DFW C.V]]s; Baker and King each disposed of one of the aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cutlack|1941|pp=349&amp;ndash;351}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baker was granted two weeks' leave to the United Kingdom in early September.&lt;ref name=&quot;ServRec&quot;/&gt; Towards the end of that month, No.&amp;nbsp;4 Squadron relocated to Serny and was soon after re-equipped with the [[Sopwith Snipe]].&lt;ref name=&quot;No. 4&quot;/&gt; By the time of the conversion, Baker had achieved [[flying ace]] status on the Sopwith Camel, having been credited with shooting down six German aircraft by early October.&lt;ref name=&quot;Camel&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Snipe&quot;/&gt;

Baker was promoted to temporary [[Captain (land)|captain]] and made a flight commander in No.&amp;nbsp;4 Squadron on 24 October.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aces&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ServRec&quot;/&gt; Two days later, Baker and Lieutenant [[Thomas Barkell]] led a formation of nine Snipes. As the patrol drew near [[Tournai]] in the afternoon, they intercepted a group of 15 Fokker D.VIIs. The Snipes swept towards the German aircraft, and Baker attempted to engage the formation leader, but the machine guns on his Snipe jammed. He brought in his aircraft for a second attempt, and managed to shoot the Fokker down out of control.&lt;ref name=&quot;Snipe&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cutlack375&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Cutlack|1941|p=375}}&lt;/ref&gt; In all, the Australians destroyed five of the Fokkers before the engagement ended.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cutlack375&quot;/&gt;

On 28 October, Baker was credited with the destruction of a further three German aircraft from two separate patrols into [[Belgium]] that day.&lt;ref name=&quot;Snipe&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cutlack377&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;DFC&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/AWM28/2/120/0015.pdf|format=PDF|title=Recommendation for Thomas Charles Richmond Baker to be awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross|accessdate=8 December 2009|work=Recommendations: First World War|publisher=Australian War Memorial}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the second excursion, he brought one Fokker down out of control, before shooting the other down over [[Ath]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Snipe&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cutlack377&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Cutlack|1941|pp=377&amp;ndash;378}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was airborne again on an offensive patrol the next day. Fifteen Snipes from No.&amp;nbsp;4 Squadron were detailed for the patrol, and as the party drew near Tournai they encountered approximately 60 Fokker planes already engaged with several British aircraft. Baker led five of the Snipes into the assault, but confusion reigned for several minutes before the men could gain their bearings in the fight. Baker assailed two Fokkers that had been pursuing another Snipe, and was able to destroy one of the aircraft.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cutlack377&quot;/&gt; On 30 October, &quot;considerable activity&quot; was observed at the German aerodrome in Rebaix, and a formation of aircraft from No.&amp;nbsp;2 Squadron were detailed to bomb the area; an escort of eleven Snipes&amp;mdash;including Baker&amp;mdash;from No.&amp;nbsp;4 Squadron was provided. As the bombing was taking place, several Fokker aircraft appeared and were intercepted by the Snipes. In the ensuing battle, Baker critically damaged one of the Fokkers, resulting in the aircraft dropping towards the ground tail-first on its back.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cutlack|1941|p=379}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Fokker proved to be Baker's twelfth, and final, aerial victory of the war; he had scored his last five victories in a period of three days.&lt;ref name=&quot;Snipe&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Aces&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;DFC&quot;/&gt;

On 4 November 1918, the whole of No.&amp;nbsp;80 Wing RAF&amp;mdash;of which No.&amp;nbsp;4 Squadron was part&amp;mdash;took to the sky in an effort to &quot;harass the German retreat on the Leuze-Ath road&quot; and to bomb the aerodrome to the east of [[Leuze, Aisne|Leuze]]. A formation of Sopwith Snipes from No.&amp;nbsp;4 Squadron had been utilised as an escort when the initial raid was carried out, and then to protect the bombers as they returned to the Allied lines. However, when the Australians had executed the latter duty, they were tailed by a patrol of twelve Fokkers. After seeing the bombers off, the Snipes wheeled around to confront the German aircraft. The battle raged for two or three minutes before dying out. As the Snipes re-grouped, they discovered that three pilots were missing; Baker was among the three.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cutlack|1941|pp=381&amp;ndash;383}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baker and fellow ace Lieutenant [[Arthur Palliser (aviator)|Arthur Palliser]] were initially recorded as missing, but were later found to have fallen victim to ''Rittmeister'' [[Karl Bolle]] during the battle.&lt;ref name=&quot;Camel&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ServRec&quot;/&gt;
