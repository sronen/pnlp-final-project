[[Air Commodore]] '''Arthur Henry (Harry) Cobby''' [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]], [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]], [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|DFC]] &amp; [[Medal bar|Two Bars]], [[George Medal|GM]] (26&amp;nbsp;August 1894 – 11&amp;nbsp;November 1955) was an [[Australia]]n [[air force|military aviator]]. He was the leading [[flying ace|fighter ace]] of the [[Royal_Australian_Air_Force#World_War_I|Australian Flying Corps]] during World War&amp;nbsp;I, with 29 victories, in spite of the fact that he saw active service for less than a year.

Born and educated in [[Melbourne]], Cobby was a bank clerk when war broke out, and was prevented by his employer from enlisting in the [[First Australian Imperial Force|Australian Imperial Force]] until 1916. After completing flight training in England, he served on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] with [[No. 4 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;4 Squadron AFC]], operating [[Sopwith Camel]]s. His achievements as a fighter pilot were recognised with the [[Distinguished Service Order]], the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] and [[Medal bar|two bars]], and a [[Mentioned in Despatches|mention in despatches]].

Acclaimed a national hero, Cobby transferred to the newly formed [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) in 1921 and rose to the rank of [[Wing Commander (rank)|wing commander]]. He left the Permanent Air Force in 1936 to join the [[Airservices Australia|Civil Aviation Board]], but re-joined at the outbreak of World War&amp;nbsp;II in 1939. He held senior Air Force posts, including Director of Recruiting and [[Air Officer Commanding]] North-Eastern Area. In 1943, Cobby was awarded the [[George Medal]] for rescuing fellow survivors of an aircraft crash. He was appointed Air Officer Commanding No.&amp;nbsp;10 Operational Group (later [[Australian First Tactical Air Force]]) the following year, but was relieved of his post in the wake of the &quot;[[Morotai Mutiny]]&quot; of April 1945. Retiring from the Air Force in 1946, Cobby served with the [[Airservices Australia|Department of Civil Aviation]] until his death on [[Armistice Day]] in 1955.

==Early career==
Arthur Henry Cobby was born in the [[Melbourne]] suburb of [[Prahran, Victoria|Prahran]] to Arthur Edward Stanley Cobby, a [[tram]] conductor, and his wife Alice. Known as Harry, the young Cobby completed his senior-level education at University College, [[Armadale, Victoria|Armadale]], before being commissioned into the 46th Infantry (Brighton Rifles), a [[Australian Army Reserve|militia]] unit, in 1912.&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;&gt;Stephens; Isaacs, ''High Fliers'', pp.23–26&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;&gt;Isaacs, ''Australian Dictionary of Biography'', pp.41–42&lt;/ref&gt; He later transferred to the 47th Infantry.&lt;ref&gt;Gration, &quot;Cobby – an exemplary warrior&quot;, p.5&lt;/ref&gt;

When World War I broke out, Cobby attempted to enlist in the [[First Australian Imperial Force|Australian Imperial Force]] but his employer, the [[Commonwealth Bank]], refused to release him as his position of [[clerk (position)|clerk]] was considered an essential occupation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Newton&quot;&gt;Newton, ''Australian Air Aces'', pp.25–28&lt;/ref&gt; He eventually managed to join the Australian Flying Corps (AFC) on 23&amp;nbsp;December 1916, despite a professed lack of interest in flying. He became a founding member of [[No. 4 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;4 Squadron AFC]], and embarked for England aboard [[SS Omrah|RMS ''Omrah'']] on 17&amp;nbsp;January 1917.&lt;ref name=&quot;AWM&quot;&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/people/142.asp Air Commodore Arthur Henry (Harry) Cobby] at [[Australian War Memorial]].

==World War I combat service==

No.&amp;nbsp;4 Squadron arrived in England in March 1917 to undergo training in preparation for service on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]. Equipped with [[Sopwith Camel]]s, the unit was sent to France in December.&lt;ref name=&quot;AWM&quot; /&gt; Cobby later admitted to being so nervous about the prospect of going into battle that &quot;if anything could have been done by me to delay that hour, I would have left nothing undone to bring it about&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;AWM AFC&quot;&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/atwar/ww1_flying.asp Australian Military History: The Australian Flying Corps] at Australian War Memorial.

Cobby claimed an early victory, over a [[DFW C.V|DFW]] [[reconnaissance]] plane, in February 1918,&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot; /&gt; however this was credited only as &quot;driven down&quot; and not confirmed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Newton&quot; /&gt; Based in the [[Pas-de-Calais]] area, No.&amp;nbsp;4 Squadron supported Allied forces during the German [[Spring Offensive]] that commenced the following month. Cobby's aerial opponents included members of [[Manfred von Richthofen|Baron von Richthofen's]] &quot;[[Jagdgeschwader 1 (World War I)|Flying Circus]]&quot;. On 21&amp;nbsp;March he shot down two of the formation's [[Albatros D.V]]s, which were confirmed as his first official victories.&lt;ref name=&quot;Newton&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cutlack, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/9/chapters/16.pdf ''The Australian Flying Corps'', pp.226–227]&lt;/ref&gt;

Having proved himself a talented and aggressive pilot, Cobby's leadership abilities were recognised with his appointment as a flight commander on 14&amp;nbsp;May 1918,&lt;ref name=&quot;Newton&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.20-21&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.20–21&lt;/ref&gt; and promotion to [[Captain (land)|captain]] on 25&amp;nbsp;May.&lt;ref name=&quot;AWM&quot; /&gt; Described as being an &quot;an imp of mischief&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot; /&gt; he personalised his Sopwith Camel by fitting it with aluminium cutouts of comic actor [[Charlie Chaplin]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Franks&quot;&gt;Franks, ''Sopwith Camel Aces of World War 1'', p.94&lt;/ref&gt; Cobby again scored two kills in one day on 30&amp;nbsp;May near [[Estaires]], when he destroyed an Albatros and an [[observation balloon]], and repeated this feat the next day in the same area. He had been responsible for downing No.&amp;nbsp;4 Squadron's first balloon at [[Merville, Nord|Merville]] earlier in May; although vulnerable to attack with [[Incendiary device|incendiary bullets]], these large observation platforms, nicknamed ''Drachen'' (Dragons), were generally well protected by enemy fighters and [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft defences]], and were thus considered a dangerous but valuable target.&lt;ref&gt;Cutlack, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/9/chapters/20.pdf ''The Australian Flying Corps'', pp.284–286]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Guttman, ''Balloon-Busting Aces of World War 1'', pp.6–8,29–30&lt;/ref&gt; Cobby was recommended for the [[Military Cross]] on 3&amp;nbsp;June 1918 in recognition of his combat success and for being a &quot;bold and skilful Patrol Leader, who is setting a fine example to his Squadron&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/AWM28/2/115/0014.pdf Recommendation: Military Cross] at Australian War Memorial.

By the end of his active service, Cobby was in charge of Allied formations numbering up to 80 aircraft. Fellow No.&amp;nbsp;4 Squadron ace, [[George Jones (RAAF officer)|George Jones]] (later [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]]), described him as the unit's &quot;natural leader in the air and in all off-duty activities&quot;; his exploits made him a national hero.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.20-21&quot; /&gt; No.&amp;nbsp;4 Squadron was recognised as the most successful fighter squadron in France,&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, ''100 Years of Australians at War'', p.98&lt;/ref&gt; accounting for as many as 220&amp;nbsp;victories.&lt;ref name=&quot;Franks&quot;&gt;Franks, ''Sopwith Camel Aces of World War 1'', pp.71–72&lt;/ref&gt;  In September 1918, Cobby was transferred to a training unit in England, where he found the strain of instructing pupils &quot;much worse than flying in France&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p.17&lt;/ref&gt; He continued applying for a return to the front until the war ended in November,&lt;ref name=&quot;AWM&quot; /&gt; and was [[mentioned in despatches]] by Field Marshal [[Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig|Sir Douglas Haig]] the same month (gazetted 27&amp;nbsp;December).&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|supp=yes|issue=31089|startpage=15217|endpage=15224|date=27 December 1918|accessdate=18 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though Cobby's final tally for the war is often given as 29 aircraft and 13 observation balloons destroyed,&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AWM&quot; /&gt; claim-by-claim analyses of his victories credit him with 24 aircraft and five balloons, for a grand total of 29,&lt;ref name=&quot;Newton&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shores et al., ''Above the Trenches'', p.110&lt;/ref&gt; making him the highest-scoring member of the AFC, as well as the service's only [[Balloon buster|&quot;balloon-busting&quot; ace]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Franks&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Guttman&quot;&gt;Guttman, ''Balloon-Busting Aces of World War 1'', pp.29–30&lt;/ref&gt; His proudest boast, however, was that as a flight commander he never lost a pilot over enemy territory.&lt;ref name=&quot;Newton&quot; /&gt;

Still instructing in England following the end of the war, Cobby was chosen to lead the AFC's [[Anzac Day]] flypast over London before the [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|Prince of Wales]] on 25&amp;nbsp;April 1919, in concert with a parade by Australian soldiers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Newton&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AWM&quot; /&gt; By 2:30 in the afternoon, he was taking his 50-strong aerial formation through a series of wild stunts over the alarmed Prince's head, and later told the story that he flew so close to the marching soldiers that their bayonets almost pierced his undercarriage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Newton&quot; /&gt; It was, said Cobby, &quot;probably the most foolish thing I have ever done&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, ''Air Force Australia'', p.43&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to Australia in May 1919,&lt;ref name=&quot;AIF Project&quot; /&gt; and married Hilda Maude Urban in [[Caulfield, Victoria|Caulfield]], Victoria, on 24&amp;nbsp;April 1920; the couple had a son and a daughter. Following the disbandment of the AFC, Cobby transferred to the short-lived Australian Air Corps before joining the newly formed [[Royal Australian Air Force]] in 1921.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot; /&gt; Ranked [[flying officer]] (honorary [[flight lieutenant]]), he was one of the original 21 officers on the air force's strength at its formation that March.&lt;ref&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/01.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', p.16]&lt;/ref&gt; His first posting, along with most of his colleagues, was to a mixed squadron equipped primarily with [[Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5|S.E.5s]] and [[Airco DH.9|DH.9s]] at [[No. 1 Flying Training School RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School]], based at [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Point Cook Base|RAAF Point Cook]].&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp.42–43&lt;/ref&gt;  Flight Lieutenant Cobby became [[Commanding Officer]] (CO) of [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron]] when it was reformed at Point Cook on 1&amp;nbsp;July 1925, serving in the position until August 1926.&lt;ref&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Units of the Royal Australian Air Force'', p.5&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1927, Cobby had been promoted to [[squadron leader]], and the following year went to England to attend [[RAF Staff College, Andover]].&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.318&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;RAAF in SWPA&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The RAAF in the Southwest Pacific Area'', pp. 40–43&lt;/ref&gt;  Returning to Australia, he took over as CO of [[No. 3 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;3 Squadron]] at [[RAAF Base Richmond|RAAF Station Richmond]], New South Wales, from Squadron Leader [[Frank Lukis]] on 13&amp;nbsp;January 1930. At this time, the position of No.&amp;nbsp;3 Squadron commander doubled as CO of the base.&lt;ref name=&quot;Air Base Richmond&quot;&gt;Roylance, ''Air Base Richmond'', pp.46,123&lt;/ref&gt; Though popular with his staff, Cobby was not known for his attention to detail.&lt;ref&gt;Sutherland, ''Command and Leadership'', p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1930, the Chief of the Air Staff, Air Commodore [[Richard Williams (RAAF officer)|Richard Williams]], arrived for an inspection and found the base to be in such a state of untidiness that he ordered every man on parade and gave them what was described as &quot;an almighty dressing down&quot;, threatening that Christmas leave would be cancelled unless the place was cleaned up.&lt;ref&gt;Roylance, ''Air Base Richmond'', pp.36–37&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.363&lt;/ref&gt; Having handed over to Squadron Leader [[William Bostock|Bill Bostock]] on 22&amp;nbsp;November 1931,&lt;ref name=&quot;Air Base Richmond&quot; /&gt; Cobby was promoted to [[Wing Commander (rank)|wing commander]] on 1&amp;nbsp;May 1933 and subsequently served as RAAF Director of Intelligence.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, [http://unsworks.unsw.edu.au/vital/access/services/Download/unsworks:3183/SOURCE02?view=true ''The Eagle and the Albatross'', p.35]&lt;/ref&gt;  In this position he headed an interdepartmental committee that was formed in August 1933 to examine the possibilities of air survey and aerial photography to further national development. The committee's findings, presented in April 1934, favoured employing government agencies for such work and ultimately led to the formation of the North Australian Survey Flight from staff and aircraft of No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron in April 1935. The resulting surveys of [[Queensland]] and the [[Northern Territory]] provided valuable input for the establishment of military airfields and other installations following the outbreak of World War&amp;nbsp;II.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp.428–429&lt;/ref&gt; Restless in the inter-war years, however, Cobby retired from the Air Force to join the Civil Aviation Board as Controller of Operations in 1936; he also contributed to aviation magazines such as ''Australian Airmen'' and ''Popular Flying''.&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot; /&gt; His civil aviation duties included aircraft inspection, the issuing of licences and airworthiness certificates, maintenance of radio and meteorological services, and RAAF liaison.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.310&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1944, Cobby became AOC of No.&amp;nbsp;10 Operational Group (No.&amp;nbsp;10 OG), soon to be renamed the [[Australian First Tactical Air Force]] (1st TAF).&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Air War Against Japan p.241&quot; /&gt; In this role he commanded 20,000 personnel in the RAAF's major mobile strike force in the [[South West Pacific theatre of World War II|South West Pacific]], consisting of [[fighter aircraft|fighter]], [[close air support|close support]], and airfield construction units.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.168-169&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.168–169&lt;/ref&gt; Cobby expressed misgivings concerning the command arrangements that saw RAAF Headquarters in Melbourne responsible for No.&amp;nbsp;10 OG's administration, while its operational tasking was to be passed down through [[RAAF Command]], the United States [[Thirteenth Air Force]] and Headquarters South West Pacific Area. He believed this required him to &quot;try and serve two masters&quot;, a situation he found &quot;unworkable&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Air War Against Japan Ch.17&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/17.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.297–298]&lt;/ref&gt; In the period 22–25 December 1944, 1st TAF flew 513 [[Curtiss P-40 Warhawk|Kittyhawk]] and [[Beaufighter]] sorties against targets in [[Halmahera]]. The following month, it undertook a further 661 sorties against targets in Halmahera, [[Sulawesi|Celebes]], Morotai and the [[Vogelkop]].&lt;ref name=&quot;100 Years of Australians at War&quot;&gt;Odgers, ''100 Years of Australians at War'', pp.214–215&lt;/ref&gt; By early 1945, Japanese air power in the South West Pacific had been virtually destroyed, and 1st TAF was increasingly assigned to garrison duties and harassing enemy bases on islands bypassed by US forces in their [[Philippines Campaign (1944–45)|advance on the Philippines]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.123-125&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.123–125&lt;/ref&gt;  During March and April, 1st TAF prepared for the [[Battle of Tarakan (1945)|invasion of Tarakan]], an operation based around a mistaken judgement made by officers at Cobby's headquarters that the island's airstrip could be rapidly repaired and used to support the [[Borneo Campaign (1945)|Borneo Campaign]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Stanley_60&quot;&gt;Stanley, ''Tarakan.

The relegation of fighter units to what appeared to be strategically unimportant ground attack missions led to a crisis in morale that precipitated the so-called &quot;[[Morotai Mutiny]]&quot; in April 1945, when eight of Cobby's senior pilots, including Australia's leading ace in the war, Group Captain [[Clive Caldwell]], tendered their resignations in protest.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.123-125&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Helson&quot;&gt;Helson, ''Ten Years at the Top'', pp.207–213&lt;/ref&gt; Although one of the &quot;mutineers&quot;, Group Captain [[Wilfred Arthur|Wilf Arthur]], had earlier voiced his concerns to Cobby and his headquarters staff regarding the efficacy of 1st TAF's tasking, the AOC was taken aback by the resignations.&lt;ref name=&quot;100 Years of Australians at War&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, &quot;Cleaning the Augean stables&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; He spoke to the officers individually and as a group, asking them, &quot;Is this something against me, or having a go against me in this, because if so, if you feel that I have fallen down in my job, I will straight away ask to be recalled,&quot; to which they replied, &quot;It has nothing to do with you.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/26.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.444–445]&lt;/ref&gt; Cobby reported the incident to his immediate superior, Air Vice Marshal Bill Bostock, who informed the Chief of the Air Staff, Air Vice Marshal Jones, and the Allied Air Forces Commander, Lieutenant General [[George Kenney]]. All made their way to Morotai and interviewed the pilots involved, and all concluded that Cobby should be relieved of his command.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers pp.443-450&quot; /&gt;

Bostock held Cobby responsible for the &quot;dangerously low level&quot; of morale in 1st TAF, but also noted &quot;it is clear that he has been badly served by his senior staff&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers pp.443-450&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/26.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.443–450]&lt;/ref&gt; In the event, Jones transferred not only Cobby but also his staff officers, Group Captains Gibson and Simms, and Air Commodore [[Frederick Scherger]] took over command on 10&amp;nbsp;May.&lt;ref name=&quot;Air War Against Japan Ch.27&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/27.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.456–459]&lt;/ref&gt; Cobby's departure was greeted with relief by [[Australian Army]] commanders, who were frustrated by the poor working relationship between 1st TAF and the Army units at Tarakan.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stanley_96&quot;&gt;Stanley, ''Tarakan. An Australian Tragedy'', p.96&lt;/ref&gt; Cobby defended his leadership of 1st TAF at the subsequent inquiry before Judge [[John Vincent Barry]]. During his testimony he declared that while his officers &quot;wished to do more in the war than they were doing&amp;nbsp;... it was not within the power of 1st T.A.F. to give them that more important or more interesting work&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/26.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p.449]&lt;/ref&gt; He believed that his forces had played a significant part in making safe General [[Douglas MacArthur|MacArthur]]'s flank during the Philippines Campaign.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Power Plus Attitude'', p. 69&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Barry found that Cobby had &quot;failed to maintain proper control over his command&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot; /&gt; and that his removal as 1st TAF commander was justified. Air Force historian Alan Stephens later described it as &quot;a personal and institutional tragedy that a genuinely great figure in RAAF history had to end his career in such circumstances&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.123-125&quot; /&gt; Similarly, ''The Oxford Companion to Australian Military History'' contends that Cobby's &quot;gallant service flying career ... became another victim of the weaknesses and feuding within the RAAF's senior leadership during the Pacific War&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot; /&gt; Stephens summed up Cobby's military career by saying &quot;No Australian airman's experience better illustrates the tensions between 'command', 'leadership' and 'heroism'&quot;, concluding that &quot;the qualities that make a hero do not easily translate into those needed by a commander, although they are likely to engender leadership&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Sutherland, ''Command and Leadership'', p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-war career and legacy==
Cobby was officially discharged from the Air Force on 19&amp;nbsp;August 1946.&lt;ref name=&quot;AWM&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WW2&quot; /&gt; He was awarded the American [[Medal of Freedom]] on 15&amp;nbsp;April 1948, in recognition of his war service.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/research/people/honours_and_awards/person.asp?p=379209 Awarded: US Medal of Freedom] at Australian War Memorial.

He was appointed Director of Flying Operations early the following year.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Newton&quot; /&gt; 

On [[Armistice Day]], 11&amp;nbsp;November 1955, Cobby collapsed in his Melbourne office and died later that day of hypertensive [[cerebrovascular disease]] at [[Austin Hospital, Melbourne|Heidelberg Repatriation General Hospital]]. His wife and children survived him.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article71779648 |title=A hero's grandson honors the fallen... |newspaper=[[The Argus (Australia)|The Argus]] |location=Melbourne |date=12 November 1955 |accessdate=10 November 2011 |page=1 |publisher=[[National Library of Australia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 15&amp;nbsp;November, he was given a military funeral at St Mary's Church of England, [[Caulfield, Victoria|Caulfield]], and [[cremation|cremated]] at [[Springvale, Victoria|Spring Vale]] Crematorium.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article71779905 |title=Family Notices |newspaper=The Argus |location=Melbourne |date=14 November 1955 |accessdate=10 November 2011 |page=11 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;
