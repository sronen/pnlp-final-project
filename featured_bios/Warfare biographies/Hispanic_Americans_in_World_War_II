==Terminology==
[[Hispanics in the United States|Hispanic American]] is an [[ethnicity|ethnic]] term used to categorize any citizen or resident of the United States, of any racial background, and of any religion, who has at least one ancestor from the people of Spain or any of the Spanish-speaking countries of the [[Americas]]. The three largest Hispanic groups in the United States are the [[Mexican American]]s, [[Puerto Rican American|Puerto Ricans]], and [[Cuban Americans]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.census.gov/population/www/socdemo/hispanic/hispdef.html Hispanic Population of the United States Current Population Survey Definition and Background], [[United States Census Bureau]], Population Division,

==Prelude to World War II==
Before the United States entered World War II, Hispanic Americans were already fighting on European soil in the [[Spanish Civil War]]. The Spanish Civil War was a major conflict in Spain that started after an attempted ''[[coup d'état]]'' by parts of the [[Spanish Army|army]], led by the [[Franquism|Nationalist]] [[Francisco Franco|General Francisco Franco]], against the government of the [[Second Spanish Republic]]. Hispanic Americans fought on behalf of both of the factions involved, the &quot;Nationalists&quot; as members of the Spanish Army and the &quot;Loyalists&quot; (Republicans) either as members of the [[Abraham Lincoln Brigade|Abraham Lincoln International Brigade]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://groups.yahoo.com/group/la-mano/message/3099 Latinos who fought in Spain].

General [[Manuel Goded Llopis]] (1882–1936), who was born in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]], was a high-ranking officer in the Spanish Army. Llopis was among the first generals to join [[Francisco Franco|General Francisco Franco]] in the uprising against the government of the [[Second Spanish Republic]]. Llopis led the fight against the Anarchists in [[Catalonia]], but his troops were outnumbered. He was captured and sentenced to die by firing squad.&lt;ref&gt;Richard A. H.

==European Theatre==
The [[European Theatre of World War II]] was an area of heavy fighting between the [[Allied forces]] and the [[Axis powers]] from September 1, 1939, to May 8, 1945.  The majority of Hispanic Americans served in regular units; some active combat units recruited from areas of high Hispanic population, such as the 65th Infantry Regiment from Puerto Rico and the [[36th Infantry Division (United States)|141st Regiment of the 36th Texas Infantry]], were made up mostly of Hispanics.

Hispanics of the 141st Regiment of the 36th Infantry Division were some of the first American troops to [[Salerno landings|land on Italian soil at Salerno]]. Company E of the 141st Regiment was entirely Hispanic.  The 36th Infantry Division fought in Italy and France, enduring heavy casualties during the crossing of the [[Rapido River]] near [[Cassino, Italy]].  This was a controversial event over which military analysts have argued.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20071026112331/http://www.hispaniconline.com/hh02/history_heritage_on_the_battlefront.html History &amp; Heritage.

===65th Infantry Regiment===
[[File:Puerto Ricans in WWII.jpg|right|thumb|Soldiers of the 65th Infantry training in [[Salinas, Puerto Rico]], August 1941]]
A small detachment of insular troops from Puerto Rico was sent to Cuba in late March as a guard for Batista Field. In 1943, the 65th Infantry was sent to [[Panama]] to protect the Pacific and the Atlantic sides of the [[Isthmus of Panama|isthmus]] and the [[Panama Canal]], critical to oceangoing ships.  An increase in the Puerto Rican induction program was immediately authorized.

At the outbreak of World War II, Calero was reassigned to the 3rd U.S. Infantry Division and sent to Europe.

In 1945, Calero's company engaged in combat against a squad of German soldiers in what is known as the [[Colmar Pocket|Battle of Colmar Pocket]] in the vicinity of [[Colmar]], France. Calero attacked the enemy squad, killing 10 and capturing 21 before being wounded. For these actions, he was awarded the [[Silver Star|Silver Star Medal]] and nicknamed &quot;One-Man Army&quot; by his comrades. Calero was wounded four times during combat in Europe.  He was awarded 22 decorations and medals for his actions, making him one of the most decorated Hispanic soldiers in the U.S. military during World War II. Among his many decorations were the [[Silver Star Medal]], four [[Purple Heart]]s and the [[French Croix de guerre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2007-06-27|url=http://www.prsoldier.com/17-aug2005.pdf |title=Who was Agustín Ramos Calero?|format=PDF |publisher=The Puerto Rican Soldier |date=August 17, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Pacific Theatre of Operations]] (PTO) is the term used in the United States for all military activity between the Allies and Japan, from 1937 to 1945, in the Pacific Ocean and the countries bordering it, during World War II.  Three units of mostly Hispanic Americans served in the Pacific Theatre battlefields: the [[200th Coast Artillery (United States)|200th Coast Artillery]] and the 515th [[Anti-Aircraft Artillery]] Battalions from [[New Mexico]], whose members participated in the infamous [[Bataan Death March]], and the 158th Regimental Combat Team from [[Arizona]].

===Bataan Death March===
Two [[United States National Guard|National Guard]] units: the 200th and the 515th Battalions, were activated in New Mexico in 1940.  Made up mostly of Spanish-speaking Hispanics from New Mexico, Arizona and Texas, the two battalions were sent to [[Clark Field]] in the [[Philippine Islands]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.houstonculture.org/hispanic/memorial.html Hispanic contributions to America's defense].

General [[Douglas MacArthur]] moved his forces, which included the 200th and 515th, to the [[Bataan Peninsula]], where they fought alongside [[Filipino people|Filipinos]] in a three-month stand against the invading forces.

By April 9, 1942, rations, medical supplies, and ammunition became scarce; officers ordered the starving and outnumbered troops of the 200th and 515th Battalions to lay down their arms and surrender to the Japanese.  These Hispanic and non-Hispanic soldiers endured the 12-day, {{convert|85|mi|km|sing=on}} [[Bataan Death March]] from Bataan to the Japanese prison camps.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cabq.gov/veterans/worldwarii.html NM Veterans' Memorial - History: World War II from a New Mexican Perspective] Retrieved on August 4, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  They were force-marched in scorching heat through the Philippine jungle.

[[Private (rank)|Private]] (Pvt.) Ralph Rodriguez, age 25, of the 200th Coast Artillery Battalion was a Bataan Death March survivor.  According to Rodriguez, the Japanese ordered the American soldiers to begin marching. Soldiers who faltered during the march were prodded with bayonets, while those unable to continue were killed.  He remembered a sense of brotherhood among the Hispanic soldiers who marched together in groups, and assisted each other along the way.
When the soldiers reached their detention center, they were forced into a 30-by-100 foot fenced area.  Later, the soldiers were forced into boxcars.  One hundred soldiers were crammed into a car built to hold 40 or 50 men.  The train took the soldiers on a four-hour ride to Camp O’Donnell where they became prisoners of war.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lib.utexas.edu/ww2latinos/template-stories-indiv.html?work_urn=urn%3Autlol%3Awwlatin.220&amp;work_title=Rodriguez%2C+Ralph Ralph Rodriguez was a witness to history in the Pacific; he survived Bataan’s brutality to rebuild his life] By Sara Kunz.

Corporal Agapito E. &quot;Gap&quot; Silva (1919–2007), was another member of the 200th Coast Artillery Battalion who survived the Bataan Death March. He was held at [[Cabanatuan]] prison camp in the Philippines and assigned to the &quot;burial details&quot; when hundreds of prisoners were dying each month of disease and starvation.  He was later transported to [[Fukuoka, Fukuoka|Fukuoka]] POW Camp #17, a [[List of Japanese POW camps during World War II|Japanese prison camp]] near [[Ōmuta, Fukuoka|Omuta, Japan]].

===158th Regimental Combat Team===
The 158th Regimental Combat Team, an [[Arizona National Guard]] unit of mostly Hispanic soldiers, also fought in the Pacific Theatre.  Early in the war, the 158th, nicknamed the &quot;[[Bushmasters]]&quot;, had been deployed to protect the Panama Canal and had completed jungle training.  The unit later fought the Japanese in the [[New Guinea]] area in heavy combat and was involved in the [[Philippines campaign (1944–45)|liberation of the Philippine Islands]].  General MacArthur referred to them as &quot;the greatest fighting combat team ever deployed for battle.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilga.gov/house/journals/95/2007/HJ095037R.pdf House Journals] (PDF).

===PFC Guy Gabaldon===
[[Private First Class]] [[Guy Gabaldon]] was a young Marine who single-handedly persuaded more than 1,000 enemy civilians and troops to surrender.
[[File:Gabaldon 1944.jpg|right|thumb|Guy Gabaldon (right) poses in a group that includes Japanese prisoners in 1944]]
PFC Guy Gabaldon (1926–2006) was adopted at the age of 12 by parents of [[Japanese-American]] heritage. At the outbreak of World War II, his adoptive family was placed in a [[Japanese American internment|relocation camp]]. Gabaldon joined the Marines when he was only 17 years old; he was a Private First Class (PFC) when his unit was engaged in the [[Battle of Saipan]] in 1944.  Gabaldon, who acted as the Japanese interpreter for the Second Marines, working alone in front of the lines, entered enemy caves, pillboxes, buildings, and jungle brush, frequently in the face of hostile fire, and succeeded not only in obtaining vital military information, but in convincing well over 1,000 enemy civilians and troops to surrender. He was nominated for the [[Medal of Honor]], but was awarded the Silver Star instead.  His medal was later upgraded to the [[Navy Cross]], the Marines second-highest decoration for heroism. He turned in more enemy soldiers than Sergeant [[Alvin York]], who was awarded the Medal of Honor during World War I for having captured 132 enemy German soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cmohs.org/medal/history_links/a_york.htm Alvin C.

When 19 year old Zaragoza, a native of  Los Angeles, California, joined the Coast Guard, he was sent on patrols in the Pacific coast of the United States defending against sabotage and invasion from the Japanese. Later he received instructions in the then-emerging and secretive field of Loran navigation and sent to Ulithi atoll, located between [[Guam]] and the [[Philippines]] where he worked in Long Range Aids to Navigation, which is akin to radar work. He served on Ulithi Island for 15 months.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lib.utexas.edu/ww2latinos/template-stories-indiv.html?work_urn=urn%3Autlol%3Awwlatin.115&amp;work_title=Zaragoza%2C+Jose++Robert Jose Robert Zaragoza; By D.J.

==Aviators==
Hispanics not only served in ground and seabound combat units, they also distinguished themselves as [[fighter pilot]]s and as [[Bombardier (air force)|bombardiers]]. In 1944, Puerto Rican aviators were sent to the Tuskegee Army Air Field in [[Tuskegee, Alabama]] to train the famed 99th Fighter Squadron of the [[Tuskegee Airmen]]. The Tuskegee Airmen were the first African-American military aviators in the United States armed forces. By the end of the war, the Tuskegee Airmen were credited with 109 Luftwaffe aircraft shot down, a patrol boat run aground by machine-gun fire, and destruction of numerous fuel dumps, trucks and trains.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.redtailreborn.com/Red_Tail_Reborn/History.html History of the Tuskegee Airmen]&lt;/ref&gt;

A &quot;[[flying ace]]&quot; or fighter ace is a military aviator credited with shooting down five or more enemy aircraft during aerial combat. The term &quot;ace in a day&quot; is used to designate a fighter pilot who has shot down five or more enemy aircraft in a single day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20071118113811/http://www.78thfightergroup.com/history/78thFGAces.html Aces of the 78th.] 78thfightergroup.com.

[[File:Perdomo2.jpg|left|thumb|130px|Lt. Oscar Francis Perdomo]]
First Lieutenant Perdomo, (1919–1976), the son of Mexican parents, was born in [[El Paso, Texas]]. When the war broke out, Perdomo joined the [[United States Army Air Force]] (USAAF) as an aviation cadet and was trained to pilot the [[P-47 Thunderbolt]]. After receiving his pilot training, he was assigned to the 464th Fighter Squadron, which was part of the 507th Fighter Group that was sent to the Pacific Island of [[Ie Shima]] off the west coast of [[Okinawa]].

The [[atomic bomb]] was dropped on [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]], Japan on August 9, 1945, but while the Allies awaited Japan's response to the demand to surrender, the war continued. On August 13, 1945, 1st Lt. Perdomo shot down four [[Nakajima Ki-43|Nakajima Ki-43 &quot;Oscar&quot;]] fighters and one [[Yokosuka K5Y|Yokosuka K5Y &quot;Willow&quot;]] Type 93 biplane trainer. This action took place near [[Seoul, Korea|Keijo/Seoul, Korea]] when 38 Thunderbolts of the 507th Fighter Wing encountered approximately 50 enemy aircraft. This action was Lt. Perdomo's tenth and final combat mission, and the five confirmed victories made him an &quot;Ace in a Day&quot; and earned him the distinction of being the last &quot;Ace&quot; of World War II. He was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Cross (United States)|Distinguished Service Cross]] for extraordinary heroism in action and the [[Air Medal]] with one [[oak leaf cluster]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Perdomo&quot;/&gt;

==Servicewomen==
[[File:Eva Romero Jacques.jpg|right|thumb|130px|Staff Sergeant Eva Romero Jacques]]
Prior to World War II, traditional Hispanic cultural values expected women to be homemakers, thus they rarely left the home to earn an income. As such, women were discouraged from joining the military. Only a small number of Hispanic women joined the military before World War II.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hispanic ServiceWomen&quot;/&gt; However, with the outbreak of World War II, cultural prohibitions began to change. With the creation of the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps (WAAC), predecessor of the [[Women's Army Corps]] (WAC), and the U.S. Navy [[Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service]] (WAVES), women could attend to certain administrative duties left open by the men who were reassigned to combat zones.&lt;ref name=&quot;McIntyre&quot;&gt;McIntyre, Hannah.

One of the first Hispanic women to serve in the USAAF was Staff Sergeant Eva Romero Jacques. Romero Jacques, who spoke Spanish and English and had three years of college spent two years in the Pacific Theater, 1944 in New Guinea and 1945 in the Philippines, as an administrative aide. She survived a plane disaster when the craft in which she was on crashed in the jungles of [[New Guinea]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EW&quot;&gt;[http://www.loc.gov/vets//stories/ex-war-hispanicveterans.html Experiencing War]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1944, the Army recruited women in Puerto Rico for the Women's Army Corps (WAC). Over 1,000 applications were received for the unit, which was to be composed of only 200 women. After their basic training at [[Fort Oglethorpe, Georgia|Fort Oglethorpe]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], the Puerto Rican WAC unit, Company 6, 2nd Battalion, 21st Regiment of the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps, a segregated Hispanic unit, was assigned to the Port of Embarkation of New York City to work in military offices that planned the shipment of troops around the world.  Among them was PFC [[Carmen García Rosado]], who in 2006, authored and published a book titled &quot;LAS WACS-Participacion de la Mujer Boricua en la Segunda Guerra Mundial&quot; (The WACs-The participation of the Puerto Rican women in the Second World War), the first book to document the experiences of the first 200 Puerto Rican women who participated in said conflict.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;LAS WACS&quot;-Participacion de la Mujer Boricua en la Seginda Guerra Mundial; by: Carmen Garcia Rosado; page 60; 1ra.

Contreras joined the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps (WAAC) in 1942 and was sent to [[Fort Lee, Virginia]] for training. Contreras volunteered to be part of the 149th WAAC Post Headquarters Company, thus becoming the first Hispanic to serve as an interpreter and in numerous administrative positions. The unit was the first WAAC unit to go overseas, setting sail from New York Harbor for Europe on January 1943.

Contreras' unit arrived in Northern Africa on January 27, 1943, and rendered overseas duties in [[Algiers]] within General Dwight D. Eisenhower's theatre headquarters, dealing with nightly [[Strategic bombing during World War II|German air raids]]. Contreras remembers that the women who served abroad were not treated like the regular Army servicemen. They did not receive overseas payment nor could they receive government life insurance. They had no protection if they became ill, wounded or captured.

===Female nurses===
[[File:PRNT.jpg|right|thumb|Puerto Rican Army nurses, 296th Station Hospital, Camp Tortuguero, Vega Baja, PR.]]
When the United States entered World War II, the military was in need of nurses. Hispanic female nurses wanted to volunteer for service, however they were not accepted into the [[Army Nurse Corps (United States)|Army Nurse Corps]] or [[Navy Nurse Corps]]. As a result, many women went to work in the factories which produced military equipment. As more Hispanic men joined the armed forces, a need for bilingual nurses became apparent and the Army started to recruit Hispanic nurses. In 1944, the Army Nurse Corps (ANC) decided to accept Puerto Rican nurses. Thirteen women submitted applications, were interviewed, underwent physical examinations, and were accepted into the ANC. Eight of these nurses were assigned to the Army Post at [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]] where they were valued for their bilingual abilities. Five nurses were assigned to work at the hospital at Camp Tortuguero in Puerto Rico.&lt;ref name=&quot;PR Women&quot;/&gt; One of these nurses was Second Lieutenant Carmen Lozano Dumler.

Second Lieutenant [[Carmen Lozano Dumler]] was born and raised in San Juan, Puerto Rico, where she also received her primary and secondary education. After graduating from high school, she enrolled in the Presbyterian Hospital School of Nursing in San Juan where she became a certified nurse in 1944. On August 21, 1944, she was sworn in as a Second Lieutenant and assigned to the 161st General Hospital in San Juan, where she received further training. Upon completing her advanced training, she was sent to Camp Tortuguero where she also assisted as an interpreter.

In 1945, Lozano Dumler was reassigned to the 359th Station Hospital of Ft. Read, [[Trinidad]] and [[Tobago]], [[British West Indies]], where she attended wounded soldiers who had returned from [[Normandy]], France. After the war, Lozano, like so many other women in the military, returned to civilian life. She continued her nursing career in Puerto Rico until she retired in 1975.&lt;ref name=&quot;PR Women&quot;/&gt;

Another Hispanic nurse who distinguished herself in service was Lieutenant Maria Roach. Roach, a recipient of two Bronze Star Medals and an Air Medal, served as a flight nurse with the Army Nurse Corps in the [[China-Burma-India Theater]] of Operations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hispanic ServiceWomen&quot;/&gt;

==Senior Officers==
Most of the Hispanics serving as senior military officers during World War II were graduates of the [[United States Naval Academy]]. The three highest ranking Hispanic officers who played an instrumental role in the war were [[Major General]] (later [[Lieutenant General]]) [[Pedro Augusto del Valle]]—the first Hispanic to reach the rank of General in the [[U.S. Marine Corps]]—, [[Brigadier General]] (later Lieutenant General) [[Elwood Richard Quesada|Elwood R. &quot;Pete&quot; Quesada]] of the Army Air Forces and Army [[Major General]] [[Terry de la Mesa Allen (Major General)|Terry de la Mesa Allen]].

;Major General del Valle
[[File:Pedro del Valle.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Lieutenant General [[Pedro del Valle]]]]
Lieutenant General [[Pedro del Valle|Pedro Augusto del Valle]] (1893–1978), as a Colonel was the Commanding Officer of the [[U.S. 11th Marine Regiment|11th Marine Regiment]] (artillery). Upon the outbreak of World War II, del Valle led his regiment during the seizure and defense of [[Guadalcanal]], providing artillery support for the [[1st Marine Division (United States)|1st Marine Division]]. In the [[Battle of the Tenaru]], the firepower provided by del Valle's artillery units killed many assaulting Japanese soldiers—almost to the last man—before they reached the Marine positions. As a result of the outcome of the battle Japanese commander, Colonel Ichiki Kiyonao, committed [[seppuku]] shortly afterwards. General [[Alexander Vandegrift]], impressed with del Valle's leadership, recommended his promotion and on October 1, 1942, del Valle became a Brigadier General. Vandegrift retained del Valle as head of the 11th Marines, the only time that the 11th Marines has ever had a general as their commanding officer. In 1943, he served as Commander of Marine Forces overseeing Guadalcanal, [[Tulagi]], and the [[Russell Islands|Russell]] and [[Florida Islands]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Valle&quot;&gt;Alexander, Joseph H.

On April 1, 1944, del Valle, as Commanding General of the Third Corps Artillery, [[III Marine Amphibious Corps]], took part in the [[Battle of Guam (1944)|Battle of Guam]] and was awarded a [[Gold Star]] in lieu of a second [[Legion of Merit]]. The men under his command did such a good job with their heavy artillery that no one man could be singled out for commendation. Instead each man was given a letter of commendation by del Valle, which was carried in his record books.&lt;ref name=&quot;Valle&quot;/&gt;

In late October 1944, del Valle succeeded Major General [[William Rupertus]] as Commanding General of the 1st Marine Division, being personally greeted to his new command by [[Chesty Puller|Colonel Lewis Burwell &quot;Chesty&quot; Puller]]. At the time, the 1st Marine Division was training on the island of [[Pavuvu]] for the [[Battle of Okinawa|invasion of Okinawa]]. On May 29, 1945, del Valle participated in one of the most important events that led to victory in Okinawa. After five weeks of fighting, del Valle ordered Company A of the [[1st Battalion 5th Marines]] to capture [[Shuri Castle]], a medieval fortress of the ancient [[Ryukyuan Kingdom|Ryukyuan kings]].

[[File:Pete Quesada.jpg|left|thumb|150px|Brig. Gen. Elwood R. Quesada]]
Lieutenant General [[Elwood R. Quesada|Elwood R. &quot;Pete&quot; Quesada]], (1904–1993) was assigned as a [[Brigadier General]] in October 1940 to [[military intelligence|intelligence]] in the Office of the Chief of Air Corps. He became commanding general of the 9th Fighter Command where he established advanced headquarters on the [[Normandy Landings|Normandy beachhead]] on [[D-Day]] plus one, and directed his planes in aerial cover and air support for the Allied invasion of the European continent. He was the foremost proponent of &quot;the inherent flexibility of air power&quot;, a principle he helped prove during World War II.&lt;ref name=&quot;Quesada&quot;&gt;[http://www.arlingtoncemetery.net/erquesada.htm Elwood Richard Quesada: Lieutenant General, United States Air Force.] Arlington National Cemetery. Retrieved on July 10, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1942, Quesada took the First Air Defense Wing to North Africa. Shortly thereafter, he was given command of the XII Fighter Command and in this capacity would work out the mechanics of [[close air support]] and Army-Air Force cooperation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Quesada&quot;/&gt;

The successful integration of air and land forces in the [[Tunisia campaign]] forged by Quesada and the Allied leaders became a blueprint for operations incorporated into Army Air Forces field regulations—FM 100-20, &quot;Command and Employment of Air Power&quot;, first published on July 21, 1943—and provided the Allies with their first victory in the European war. Principles such as the co-equality of ground and air force commanders, centralized command of tactical aircraft to exploit &quot;the inherent flexibility of air power&quot;, and the attainment of air superiority over the battlefield as a prerequisite for successful ground operations formed the core of tactical air doctrine. In October 1943, Quesada assumed command of the IX Fighter Command in England, and his forces provided air cover for the [[Normandy Landings|landings on Normandy Beach]]. Among Quesada's many military decorations were the [[Distinguished Service Medal (United States)|Distinguished Service Medal]] with [[oak leaf cluster]]; [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United States)|Distinguished Flying Cross]]; Purple Heart and an Air Medal with two silver star devices.&lt;ref name=&quot;Quesada&quot;/&gt;

The [[Medal of Honor]], sometimes referred to as the Congressional Medal of Honor, is the highest military decoration in the United States bestowed &quot;for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of life, above and beyond the call of duty, in actual combat against an armed enemy force.&quot; The medal is awarded by the President of the United States on behalf of the Congress. [[Joe P. Martinez]] was the first of 13 Hispanic Medal of Honor recipients during World War II. His posthumous award was the first for combat heroism on American soil (other than Pearl Harbor) since the [[Indian Wars|Indian Campaigns]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cmohs.org/medal/medal_history.htm The Medal's History.] Congressional Medal of Honor Society.

[[File:Joe P.jpg|left|thumb|100px|Pvt. Joseph Pantillion Martinez]]
Pvt. [[Joe P. Martinez]], whose birth name was Joseph Pantillion Martinez, was one of nine children born to a family of Mexican immigrants. His family moved to [[Ault, Colorado]] and on August 1942, he was drafted into the United States Army and sent to [[Camp Roberts, California]], where he received his basic training.

On May 26, 1943, the [[32d Infantry Regiment (United States)|32nd Infantry Regiment]] was pinned down by enemy fire in the vicinity of Fish Hook Ridge, in the [[Aleutian Islands]]. On his own account, Pvt. Martinez led two assaults, firing into the Japanese foxholes and occasionally stopping to urge on his comrades. His example inspired the men of his unit to follow. Martinez was shot in the head as he approached one final foxhole after the second assault, dying of the wound the following day. Because of his actions the pass was taken, and its capture was an important preliminary to the end of organized hostile resistance. Martinez was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neta.com/~1stbooks/defen11c.htm Aleutian Islands World War II.] Hispanics in Americas Defense.

Hispanics were recipients of every major U.S. military decoration during World War II; they have also been honored with military awards from other countries. Thirty-one Hispanic-Americans were awarded the [[Croix de guerre|Belgium Croix de guerre]] and three Hispanic-Americans received the [[French Croix de guerre]]. The figures in the following table were derived from the book ''Undaunted Courage Mexican American Patriots Of World War II'' published in 2005 by Latino Advocates for Education, Inc. and according to Rogelio C.

===Hero Street, USA===
In the Midwest town of [[Silvis, Illinois]], the former Second Street is now known as Hero Street USA. The muddy block and a half long street was home to Mexican immigrants who worked for the Rock Island Railroad. The 22 families who lived on the street were a close-knit group. From this small street, 84 men served in World War II, [[Korean War|Korea]], and [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]]. The street contributed more men to military services in World War II and Korea than any other street of comparable size in the U.S. In total, eight men from Hero Street gave their lives during World War II—Joseph Gomez, Peter Macias, Johnny Muños, Tony Pompa, Frank Sandoval, Joseph &quot;Joe&quot; Sandoval, William &quot;Willie&quot; Sandoval and Claro Solis. Second Street's name was changed to Hero Street in honor of these men and their families.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neta.com/~1stbooks/hero.htm Hispanics in Americas Defense: Hero Street U.S.A.] The Hero Street Monument Committee.

Eduvigis and Angelina Sandoval immigrated to the U.S. from Romita, Mexico. Their son, Frank, was a combat engineer assigned to help build the Ledo Road in Burma. He was killed when his unit was sent unexpectedly to the front to fight for control of a key airbase. His older brother, Joe, was assigned to the 41st Armored Infantry Division in Europe. He was killed in April 1944, just days before the war ended.&lt;ref name=&quot;Navy&quot;/&gt;

Joseph and Carmen Sandoval also immigrated to the United States from Mexico. When the war broke out, their son Willie asked for permission to enlist in the Army and both parents consented to their son's request. Willie Sandoval was trained as a paratrooper and was assigned to the [[82nd Airborne Division (United States)|82nd Airborne Division]]. He fought in Italy and Germany, and was killed on October 6, 1944, during a combat mission related to [[Operation Market-Garden]], the largest airborne operation of all time.

Other families like the Sandovals had multiple members join the Armed Forces. The Banuelo family, originally from Mexico and who resided in [[Los Angeles, California]], the Garcia family from Los Angeles, California, and the Mora family from [[Laredo, Texas]], each had six siblings who served in the military during the war.

Josephine Ledesma, from [[Austin, Texas]], was 24 when the war broke out and worked as an airplane mechanic from 1942 to 1944. When her husband, Alfred, was drafted she decided to volunteer to work as an airplane mechanic. Even though the Army waived her husband's duty, she was sent to train at [[Randolph Air Force Base]], Texas, where she was the only Mexican-American woman on the base. After her training, she was sent to Bergstrom Air Field. There were two other women, both non-Hispanic, at Bergstrom Air Field, and several more in Big Spring, all working in the sheet metal department. At Big Spring, she was the only woman working in the hangar. She worked as a mechanic between from 1942 to 1944.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rivera&quot;&gt;Rivera, Monica.

The majority of the Puerto Ricans from the island served in Puerto Rico's segregated units, like the 65th Infantry and the Puerto Rico National Guard's 285th and 296th regiments.

Discrimination against Hispanics has been documented in several first-person accounts by Hispanic soldiers who fought in World War II. PFC Raul Rios Rodriguez, a Puerto Rican, said that one of his [[drill instructor]]s was particularly harsh on the Hispanic and black soldiers in his unit during his basic training at [[Fort Bragg, North Carolina|Fort Bragg]].&lt;ref name=&quot;RaulRios&quot;&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2007-06-27|url= http://www.lib.utexas.edu/ww2latinos/template-stories-indiv.html?work_urn=urn%3Autlol%3Awwlatin.290&amp;work_title=Rodriguez%2C+Raul+Rios|title= Despite war's end and brother's horror stories, man was intent on joining military|author= Kerschen, D'Arcy|publisher= U.S. Latinos and Latinas &amp; WWII Oral History Project, University of Texas}}&lt;/ref&gt; PFC Felix Lopez-Santos, another Puerto Rican, said that he observed some racial discrimination against African Americans, but that he never experienced discrimination himself because of his light eyes and fair complexion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2007-03-18|url=http://www.lib.utexas.edu/ww2latinos/template-stories-indiv.html?work_urn=urn%3Autlol%3Awwlatin.272&amp;work_title=Lopez+-+Santos%2C+Felix+Angel|title=Man survived jungle fever, suicide attacks and kangaroos during service in Pacific|author=de la Cruz, Juan|publisher= U.S. Latinos and Latinas &amp; WWII Oral History Project, University of Texas}}&lt;/ref&gt; PFC Norberto Gonzalez, a Cuban-born New Yorker, experienced discrimination in his all-white battalion, where he was frequently asked about his name and place of birth, and found he was treated differently once fellow soldiers learned he was Hispanic.

===After returning home===

After returning home, Hispanic soldiers experienced the same discrimination felt by other Hispanic Americans. According to one former Hispanic soldier, &quot;There was the same discrimination in Grand Falls (Texas), if not worse&quot; than when he had departed. While Hispanics could work for $2 per day, whites could get jobs working in petroleum fields that earned $18 per day. In his town, signs read &quot;No Mexicans, whites only&quot;, and only one restaurant would serve Hispanics.&lt;ref&gt;Farias, Claudia.

Discrimination also extended to those killed during the war. In one notable case, the owner of a funeral parlor refused to allow the family of Pvt. [[Felix Longoria]], a soldier killed in action in the Philippines, to use his facility because &quot;whites would not like it&quot;. Then-U.S. Senator [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] and [[Hector P. Garcia]], the Mexican-American World War II veteran who founded the [[American G.I. Forum]], intervened on Longoria's behalf. Johnson, [[Lady Bird Johnson]], Congressman John Lyle, and President [[Harry S. Truman|Truman]]'s military aide Gen. Harry H.

==Post-war commemoration==
The memory of Hispanic American heroes has been honored in various ways: some of their names can be found on ships, in parks and inscribed on monuments. Captain [[Linda Garcia Cubero]] (USAF), while serving as Special Assistant to the Deputy [[Secretary of Defense]], supervised the development of a United States [[Commemorative stamps|commemorative stamp]] to honor Hispanics who served in America's defense. The stamp was designed to honor the ten Hispanic Medal of Honor recipients still alive and was unveiled on October 31, 1984.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reagan.utexas.edu/archives/speeches/1984/103184c.htm Remarks at a White House Ceremony To Unveil a Commemorative Stamp Honoring Hispanic Americans.] Ronald Reagan Presidential Library.
