'''Aaron Benjamin Sorkin''' (born June 9, 1961) is an [[Academy Award|Academy]] and [[Emmy Award|Emmy]] award winning American screenwriter, producer, and playwright, whose works include ''[[A Few Good Men (play)|A Few Good Men]]'', ''[[The American President]]'', ''[[The West Wing]]'', ''[[Sports Night]]'', ''[[Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip]]'', ''[[Charlie Wilson's War]]'', ''[[The Social Network]]'', and ''[[Moneyball (film)|Moneyball]]''.

After graduating from [[Syracuse University]] with a [[Bachelor of Fine Arts]] degree in [[Musical Theatre]] in 1983, Sorkin spent much of the 1980s in New York as a struggling, sporadically employed actor.&lt;ref name =syracuse-interview&gt;&quot;[http://sumagazine.syr.edu/archive/summer01/features/spotlight/ In the Spotlight: Script Sensation]&quot;, Brad Herzog, ''Syracuse University Magazine'', Summer 2001. Retrieved on May 9, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; He found his passion in writing plays, and quickly established himself as a promising young playwright. His stage play ''[[A Few Good Men (play)|A Few Good Men]]'' caught the attention of Hollywood producer [[David Brown (producer)|David Brown]], who bought the film rights before the play even premiered.&lt;ref name=MovieMoguls/&gt;

[[Castle Rock Entertainment]] hired Sorkin to adapt ''A Few Good Men'' for the big screen. The film, directed by [[Rob Reiner]], became a box office success. Sorkin spent the early 1990s writing two other screenplays at Castle Rock, ''[[Malice (film)|Malice]]'' and ''[[The American President]]''. In the mid-1990s he worked as a [[script doctor]] on films such as ''[[Bulworth]]''. In 1998 his television career began when he created the comedy series ''[[Sports Night]]'' for the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] network. The second season of ''Sports Night'' was its last and in 1999 overlapped with the debut of Sorkin's next TV series, the political drama ''[[The West Wing]]'', this time for the [[NBC]] network. ''The West Wing'' won multiple [[Emmy Award]]s, and continued for three more seasons after he left the show at the end of its fourth season in 2003. He returned to television in 2006 with the [[dramedy]] ''[[Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip]]'', about the backstage drama at a late-night sketch comedy show, once again for the NBC network. While Sorkin's return was met with high expectations and a lot of early online buzz before ''Studio 60'''s premiere, NBC did not renew it after its first season in which it suffered from low ratings and mixed reception in the press and on the Internet. He also wrote the feature film screenplay for ''[[The Social Network]]'', winning the [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Writing (Adapted Screenplay)|Best Adapted Screenplay]].

After more than a decade away from the theatre, Sorkin returned to adapt for the stage his screenplay ''[[The Farnsworth Invention]]'', which started a workshop run at [[La Jolla Playhouse]] in February 2007 and which opened on [[Broadway Theatre|Broadway]] in December 2007.&lt;ref name=Back-to-Broadway/&gt;

He was a cocaine addict for many years, but after a highly publicized arrest in 2001 he received treatment in a drug diversion program and is reported to have recovered.&lt;ref name=FarnsworthAndBio&gt;{{cite news |title=Prodigal Returns, Bearing Dialogue |author=Bruce Weber |date=November 4, 2007 |work=The New York Times |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/04/theater/04webe.html |accessdate=September 31, 2008 |quote='I’ve been healthy for six and a half years,' he said. 'But like any addict I’m one phone call away from that not being true.'}}&lt;/ref&gt; In television, Sorkin is known as a controlling writer, who rarely shares the credit of penning [[Teleplay|screenplay]]s.&lt;ref name=DeJonge-interview/&gt; His writing staff are more likely to do research and come up with stories for him to tell. His trademark rapid-fire dialogue and extended [[monologues]] are complemented, in television, by frequent collaborator [[Thomas Schlamme]]'s characteristic directing technique called the &quot;[[walk and talk]]&quot;. These sequences consist of single [[tracking shot]]s of long duration involving multiple characters engaging in conversation as they move through the set; characters enter and exit the conversation as the shot continues without any cuts.

==Early years==
Sorkin was born in [[Manhattan]] to Jewish parents and was raised in the wealthy suburb of [[Scarsdale, New York]].&lt;ref name=SeattlePI/&gt;&lt;ref name=USWeekly-Jones&gt;{{cite news |title=A Troubled Genius |author=Oliver Jones |date=May 28, 2001 |work=US Weekly |url=http://b4a.healthyinterest.net/news/000083.html |accessdate=January 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother was a school teacher and his father a copyright lawyer who had fought in WWII and put himself through college on the [[G.I.

Before he reached his teenage years, his parents were taking him to the theatre to see shows such as ''[[Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?]]'' and ''[[That Championship Season]]''.&lt;ref name=FarnsworthAndBio/&gt;

Sorkin attended [[Scarsdale High School]] where he became involved in his high school drama and theatre club. In eighth grade he played General Bullmoose in the musical ''[[Li'l Abner (musical)|Li'l Abner]]''.&lt;ref name=syracuse-interview/&gt; In the Scarsdale High School senior class play Once Upon a Mattress, Sorkin played Sir Harry. 

In 1979, Sorkin attended [[Syracuse University]]. In his [[freshman year]] he failed a class that was a core requirement. It was a devastating setback because he wanted to be an actor, and the Drama department did not allow students to take the stage until they completed all the core freshman classes. He returned in his sophomore year determined to do better, and graduated in 1983 with a bachelor of fine arts degree in musical theatre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Creation of the Future: The Role of the American University |author=Frank Harold Trevor Rhodes |year=2001 |month=October |publisher=Cornell University Press |pages=75–76 |isbn=978-0-8014-3937-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduation, Sorkin moved to New York City where he worked odd jobs including delivering [[singing telegram]]s,&lt;ref name=syracuse-interview/&gt; driving a limousine, touring Alabama with the children’s theatre company Traveling Playhouse,&lt;ref name=DeJonge-interview&gt;{{cite news |title=Aaron Sorkin Works His Way Through the Crisis |author=Peter De Jonge |date=October 28, 2001 |work=The New York Times |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B01EFD81F3EF93BA15753C1A9679C8B63 |accessdate=January 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; handing out fliers promoting a hunting-and-fishing show,&lt;ref name=syracuse-interview/&gt; and bartending on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] at theatres such as the [[Palace Theatre, New York|Palace Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Encounter with Peter Krause | author = Ernio Hernandez |url=http://www.playbill.com/celebritybuzz/article/87365.html |work=Playbill |accessdate=December 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; One weekend, while house sitting at a friend's place he found an [[IBM Selectric typewriter]], started typing, and &quot;felt a phenomenal confidence and a kind of joy that [he] had never experienced before in [his] life.&quot;&lt;ref name=DeJonge-interview/&gt;

He continued writing and eventually put together his first play ''Removing All Doubt'' which he sent to his old theatre teacher, [[Arthur Storch]], who was impressed. In 1984, ''Removing All Doubt'' was staged for drama students at his alma mater, Syracuse University. After that, he wrote ''[[Hidden in This Picture]]'' which debuted [[Off-Off-Broadway|off-off-Broadway]] at Steve Olsen's [[Laurie Beechman Theatre|West Bank Cafe Downstairs Theatre Bar]] in New York City in 1988. The contents of his first two plays got him a [[Literary agent|theatrical agent]].&lt;ref name=Weiss-seminar&gt;{{cite web |title=Three days, 15 seminars, one great experience |author=Valerie Weiss, PhD |year=2003 |month=December |publisher=ImagineNews.com |url=http://www.imaginenews.com/Archive/2003/DEC_2003/01_FEATURES/12_THREE_DAYS.html |accessdate=January 12, 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20061220170153/http://www.imaginenews.com/Archive/2003/DEC_2003/01_FEATURES/12_THREE_DAYS.html| archivedate= 20 December 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Producer John A. McQuiggan saw the production of ''Hidden in This Picture'' and commissioned Sorkin to turn the one-act into a full-length play called ''Making Movies''.&lt;ref name=NYT-review3/&gt; His reputation as a playwright was quickly gaining stature on the New York theatre scene.

===''A Few Good Men''===
[[Image:A Few Good Men at Haymarket Theatre London.jpg|thumb|''A Few Good Men'' at London's [[Haymarket Theatre|Theatre Royal Haymarket]] on August 31, 2005.]]
Sorkin got the inspiration to write his next play, a courtroom drama called ''[[A Few Good Men (play)|A Few Good Men]]'', from a phone conversation with his sister Deborah, who had graduated from [[Boston University School of Law|Boston University Law School]] and signed up for a 3-year stint with the [[Judge Advocate General's Corps, U.S. Navy|U.S. Navy Judge Advocate General's Corps]]. She was going to [[Guantanamo Bay Naval Base|Guantanamo Bay]] to defend a group of [[Marine corps|Marines]] who came close to killing a fellow Marine in a [[hazing]] ordered by a superior officer. Sorkin took that information and wrote much of his story on cocktail napkins while bartending at the Palace Theatre on Broadway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A Few Good Men London theatre tickets and information |publisher=ThisIsTheatre.com |url=http://www.thisistheatre.com/londonshows/afewgoodmen.html |accessdate=January 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He and his roommates had purchased a [[Macintosh 512K]] so when he returned home he would empty his pockets of the cocktail napkins and type them into the computer, forming a basis from which he wrote many drafts for ''A Few Good Men''.&lt;ref name=CharlieRose-2003/&gt;

In 1988 Sorkin sold the film rights for his play ''A Few Good Men'' to producer [[David Brown (producer)|David Brown]] before it premiered, in a deal reportedly &quot;well into six figures.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Marine Life |date=November 27, 1989 |author=William A.

It starred [[Tom Hulce]] and was directed by [[Don Scardino]]. After opening in late 1989, it ran for 497 performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Aaron Sorkin Working on A Few Good Men for London and New Play for Dublin's Abbey |author=Ernio Hernandez |date=June 18, 2004 |work=Playbill |url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/86900.html |accessdate=January 20, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sorkin continued writing ''Making Movies'' and in 1990 it debuted [[Off-Broadway]] at the Promenade Theatre, produced by John A. McQuiggan and directed by Don Scardino.&lt;ref name=NYT-review3/&gt; Meanwhile, David Brown was producing a few projects at [[TriStar Pictures]] and tried to interest them in making ''A Few Good Men'' into a film but his proposal was declined due to the lack of star actor involvement. Brown later got a call from Alan Horn at [[Castle Rock Entertainment]] who was anxious to make the film. [[Rob Reiner]], a producing partner at Castle Rock, opted to direct it.&lt;ref name=MovieMoguls&gt;{{cite book |title=Movie Moguls Speak: Interviews with Top Film Producers |last=Prigge |first=Steven |year=2004 |month=October |publisher=McFarland &amp; Company |pages=12–13 |isbn=978-0-7864-1929-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Screenwriting career (1991–98)==
===Working under contract for Castle Rock Entertainment===
In the early 1990s, Sorkin worked under contract for [[Castle Rock Entertainment|Castle Rock Entertainment, Inc.]]&lt;ref name=Reiner&gt;{{cite news |title= Rob Reiner's March To 'A Few Good Men' |author=Bernard Weinraub |date=December 6, 1992 |work=The New York Times |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE6D71738F935A35751C1A964958260 |accessdate=September 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote the scripts for ''A Few Good Men'', ''Malice'', and ''The American President'': the three films grossed about $400 million worldwide.&lt;ref name=SeattlePI/&gt; While writing for Castle Rock he became friends with colleagues such as [[William Goldman]] and [[Rob Reiner]] and met his future wife, Julia Bingham, who was one of Castle Rock's business-affairs lawyers.&lt;ref name=Prayer&gt;{{cite news |title=On a Wing and a Prayer |author=Patrick Goldstein |date=October 10, 1999 |work=Los Angeles Times |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1999/oct/10/entertainment/ca-20753 |accessdate=September 26, 2008 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081002040237/http://articles.latimes.com/1999/oct/10/entertainment/ca-20753| archivedate= 2 October 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sorkin wrote several drafts of the script for ''[[A Few Good Men]]'' in his New York apartment,&lt;ref name=Reiner/&gt; learning the craft of screenwriting from a book about [[Screenwriting#Screenwriting formats|screenplay format]].&lt;ref name=Weiss-seminar/&gt; He then spent several months at the Los Angeles offices of Castle Rock, working on the script with Rob Reiner.&lt;ref name=Reiner/&gt; William Goldman (who regularly worked under contract at Castle Rock) became his mentor and helped him to adapt his stageplay into a screenplay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |last=Sorkin |first=Aaron |interviewer=[[Katie Couric]] |program=[[Today (NBC program)|The Today Show]] |callsign=[[NBC]] |city=New York |date=May 22, 2002|url=http://b4a.healthyinterest.net/news/000124.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movie was directed by Rob Reiner, starring Tom Cruise, Jack Nicholson, Demi Moore, and Kevin Bacon, and was produced by David Brown. ''A Few Good Men'' was released in 1992 and was a box office success.&lt;ref name=Buchanan&gt;{{cite web |title=Aaron Sorkin Biography |author=Jason Buchanan |publisher=[[Allmovie]] |url=http://www.allmovie.com/cg/avg.dll?p=avg&amp;sql=2:112161~T1 |accessdate=September 31, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Goldman also approached Sorkin with a story premise, which Sorkin developed into the script for ''[[Malice (film)|Malice]]''. Goldman oversaw the project as [[creative consultant]] while Sorkin wrote the first two drafts of ''Malice''. Sorkin had to leave the project to finish up the script for ''A Few Good Men'', and screenwriter [[Scott Frank]] wrote two drafts of the ''Malice'' screenplay. When production on ''A Few Good Men'' wrapped up, Sorkin took over and continued working on the script for ''Malice'' through until the final [[shooting script]]. Harold Becker directed the film, a medical thriller released in 1993, which starred Nicole Kidman and Alec Baldwin. ''Malice'' had mixed reviews. [[Vincent Canby]] in ''The New York Times'' described the film as &quot;deviously entertaining from its start through its finish&quot;. [[Roger Ebert]] panned it, and [[Peter Travers]] in a 2000 ''Rolling Stone'' review summarized it as having &quot;suspense but no staying power&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=An Idyll Shattered By Rape and Murder |author=Vincent Canby |date=October 1, 1993 |work=The New York Times |url=http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?_r=2&amp;res=9F0CEEDD103CF932A35753C1A965958260 |accessdate=September 26, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=''Malice'' |author=[[Roger Ebert]] |date=October 1, 1993 |work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19931001/REVIEWS/310010306/1023 |accessdate=September 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=''Malice'' |author=[[Peter Travers]] |date=December 8, 2000 |work=Rolling Stone |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/movies/reviews/malice-19931001 |accessdate=March 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sorkin fought with the ABC network during the first season over the use of a [[laugh track]] and a [[live studio audience]].

{{Main|The West Wing}}
Sorkin conceived the [[political]] TV drama ''The West Wing'' in 1997 when he went unprepared to a lunch with producer [[John Wells (TV producer)|John Wells]] and in a panic pitched to Wells a show centered on the senior staff of the White House,&lt;ref name=SeattlePI/&gt; using leftover ideas from his script for ''The American President''.&lt;ref name=&quot;miller&quot;/&gt; He told Wells about his visits to the White House while doing research for ''The American President'', and they found themselves discussing [[Civil service|public service]] and the passion of the people who serve. Wells took the concept and pitched it to the [[NBC]] network, but was told to wait because the facts behind the [[Lewinsky scandal]] were breaking and there was concern that an audience would not be able to take a show about the White House seriously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Pilot episode |publisher=The West Wing Episode Guide |url=http://www.westwingepguide.com/S1/Episodes/1_PILOT.html |accessdate=January 23, 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070122122105/http://www.westwingepguide.com/S1/Episodes/1_PILOT.html| archivedate= 22 January 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a year later some other networks started showing interest in ''The West Wing'', NBC decided to greenlight the series despite their previous reluctance.&lt;ref name=&quot;miller&quot;/&gt; The [[Television pilot|pilot]] debuted in the fall of 1999 and was produced by [[Warner Bros.

In 2001, after wrapping up the second season of ''The West Wing'', Sorkin had a drug relapse, only two months after receiving a Phoenix Rising Award for drug recovery; this became public knowledge when he was arrested at [[Burbank Airport]] for possession of hallucinogenic mushrooms, marijuana, and crack cocaine. He was ordered by a judge to attend a drug diversion program.&lt;ref name=CreatorDiverted/&gt; His drug addiction was highly publicized, most notably when ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' did a parody called &quot;The West Wing&quot;,&lt;ref name=SNL_sketch/&gt; though he did recover.&lt;ref name=FarnsworthAndBio/&gt;

In 2002, Sorkin criticized NBC news anchor [[Tom Brokaw]]'s TV special about a day in the life of a president, &quot;The Bush White House: Inside the Real West Wing&quot;, comparing it to the act of sending a valentine to President George W. Bush instead of real news reporting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=West Wing Watch: Snookered by Bush |date=February 25, 2002 |work=The New Yorker |url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2002/03/04/020304ta_talk_friend |accessdate=January 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sorkin's TV series ''The West Wing'' aired on the same network, and so at the request of NBC's Entertainment President [[Jeff Zucker]] he apologized, but would later say &quot;there should be a difference between what [[NBC News]] does and what ''The West Wing'' TV series does.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='West Wing' Creator Defends Comments |author=Lynn Elber |date=March 5, 2002 |agency=Associated Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Hollywood's New Radicalism: War, Globalisation and the Movies from Reagan to George W.

In 2003 Sorkin divulged to the American television interviewer [[Charlie Rose]] on ''[[Charlie Rose (talk show)|The Charlie Rose Show]]'' that he was developing a TV series based on a late-night sketch comedy show like ''Saturday Night Live''.&lt;ref name=CharlieRose-2003/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Inside Move: Sorkin scripting play, pic: Return to TV on hold |author=Scott Hettrick |date=September 11, 2003 |work=Variety |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117892324.html?categoryid=1236&amp;cs=1 |accessdate=January 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early October 2005 a pilot script dubbed ''Studio 7 on the Sunset Strip'' for a new TV series, written by him and with Tommy Schlamme attached as producer, started circulating around Hollywood and generating interest on the web.

In September 2006, the pilot for ''Studio 60'' aired on NBC, directed by Schlamme. The pilot was critically acclaimed and had high [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]],{{Says who|date=March 2012}} but ''Studio 60'' experienced a significant drop in audience by mid-season.

In 2003, Sorkin was writing a screenplay [[Spec script|on spec]] about the story of inventor and television pioneer [[Philo Farnsworth]], a topic he had first become familiar with back in the early 1990s when producer [[Fred Zollo]] approached him with the idea of adapting a memoir by Elma Farnsworth into a [[biographical film|biopic]].&lt;ref name=FarnsworthAndBio/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Inside 'The Alamo' |author=Army Archerd |date=October 29, 2003 |work=Variety |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117894813.html?categoryid=2&amp;cs=1 |accessdate=January 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next year he completed the screenplay under the title &quot;[[The Farnsworth Invention]]&quot;, and it was picked up by [[New Line Cinema]] with [[Thomas Schlamme]] signed on to direct.

In August 2008, Sorkin announced that he had agreed to write a script for Sony and producer [[Scott Rudin]] about how [[Facebook]] was founded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Coming soon: 'Facebook: The Movie'? |author=Jessica Guynn |date=August 28, 2008 |work=Los Angeles Times |url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-techblog28-2008aug28,0,4670260.story }}&lt;/ref&gt; The film, ''[[The Social Network]]'', based on Ben Mezrich's novel ''[[The Accidental Billionaires]]'', was  [[film release|released]] on October 1, 2010. Sorkin won the [[Academy Award for Best Writing (Adapted Screenplay)|Academy]], [[BAFTA Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|BAFTA]] and [[Golden Globe Award for Best Screenplay|Golden Globe]] Awards for ''The Social Network''. One year later, Sorkin received nominations for the same awards for co-writing the screenplay to the film ''[[Moneyball (film)|Moneyball]]''.

===Future projects===
In March 2007, it was reported that Sorkin had signed on to write a musical adaptation of the hit 2002 record ''[[Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots]]'' by psychedelic-rock band [[The Flaming Lips]], collaborating with director [[Des McAnuff]] who has been developing the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Sorkin Will Script Flaming Lips Musical |author=Michael Endelman |date=March 20, 2007 |work=Entertainment Weekly |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20015535,00.html |accessdate=June 9, 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070611102419/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20015535,00.html| archivedate= 11 June 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=McAnuff tries northern exposure: After B'way boom, helmer sets sights on Shakespeare |author=Gordon Cox |date=August 13, 2006 |work=Variety |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117948337.html |accessdate=September 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Sorkin eyes Lips show: Writer mulls 'Yoshimi' musical |author=Gordon Cox |date=June 24, 2007 |work=Variety |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117961571.html |accessdate=September 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 12, 2007, ''Variety'' reported that Sorkin had signed a deal with DreamWorks to write three scripts.

In 2010, Sorkin reportedly obtained the film rights to [[Andrew Young (political operative)|Andrew Young]]'s book, ''The Politician'' (about Sen. [[John Edwards]]), and announced that he would make his debut as a film director while also adapting the book for the screen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | date = July 16, 2010 | work = Marquee Blog | publisher =CNN | title='West Wing' creator takes on John Edwards

In November 2010, it was reported that he is writing a musical based on the life of [[Harry Houdini|Houdini]], with music by [[Danny Elfman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Vozick-Levinson |first=Simon |title=Aaron Sorkin writing Hugh Jackman's Houdini musical: Composer Danny Elfman has 'high hopes' |work=Popwatch.EW.com |date=November 2, 2010 | url = http://popwatch.ew.com/2010/11/02/hugh-jackman-houdini-musical/ |accessdate = December 4, 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20101205014923/http://popwatch.ew.com/2010/11/02/hugh-jackman-houdini-musical/| archivedate= 5 December 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2012, it is reported that [[Stephen Schwartz (composer)|Stephen Schwartz]] is now writing the music and lyrics, while Sorkin is making his debut as a librettist. The musical is expected to come out in 2013-14, with Sorkin saying &quot;The chance to collaborate with Stephen Schwartz, (the director) [[Jack O'Brien]], and Hugh Jackman on a new Broadway musical is a huge gift.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thewrap.com/media/article/hugh-jackman-aaron-sorkin-teaming-houdini-musical-34065&lt;/ref&gt;

Sorkin returned to television in 2011 with two [[HBO]] projects. He is teaming with ''[[The Office (U.S. TV series)|The Office]]'' star [[John Krasinski]] to develop a miniseries about the [[Chateau Marmont Hotel]] based on ''Life at the Marmont'', a book by the hotel’s co-owner Raymond R.

==Writing process and style==
Sorkin has written for the theatre, film and television, and in each medium his level of collaboration with other creators has varied. He began in theatre which involved a largely solitary writing process, then moved into film where he collaborated with director Rob Reiner and screenwriter William Goldman, and eventually worked in television where he collaborated very closely with director Thomas Schlamme for nearly a decade on the shows ''Sports Night'', ''The West Wing'', and ''Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip''; he now moves between all three media. He has a habit of [[chain smoking]] while he spends countless hours cooped up in his office plotting out his next scripts.&lt;ref name=USWeekly-Jones/&gt; He describes his writing process as physical because he will often stand up and speak the dialogue he is developing.&lt;ref name=ryan/&gt;

{{quote box|width=35%|quote=&quot;For me, the [[writing]] experience is very much like a date. It's not unusual that I'm really funny here and really smart here and maybe showing some anger over here so she sees maybe I have this dark side. I want it to have been worth it for everyone to sit through it for however long I ask them to.&quot;|source=—Aaron Sorkin, on his writing as characterized by mentor [[William Goldman]].&lt;ref name=SeattlePI/&gt;|style=padding:8px}}

A ''New York Times'' article by Peter De Jonge explained that &quot;''The West Wing'' is never plotted out for more than a few weeks ahead and has no major story lines&quot;, which De Jonge believed was because &quot;with characters who have no flaws, it is impossible to give them significant arcs&quot;.&lt;ref name=DeJonge-interview/&gt; Sorkin has stated: &quot;I seldom plan ahead, not because I don’t think it’s good to plan ahead, there just isn’t time.&quot;&lt;ref name=WGA_East&gt;{{cite web |title=Interview with Aaron Sorkin |publisher=The Writers Guild of America, East, Inc. |accessdate=January 10, 2007 |format=PDF |page=6 |work=On Writing Magazine, Issue 18|year=2003 |month=February |url=http://www.wgaeast.org/newsletter_and_publications/pdf/onwriting18.pdf | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070128072902/http://www.wgaeast.org/newsletter_and_publications/pdf/onwriting18.pdf

{{quote box|width=35%|quote=&quot;You almost never see how anyone travels from point A to point C [in most TV shows]. I wanted the audience to witness every journey these people took.

Sorkin's nearly decade-long collaboration in television with director [[Thomas Schlamme]] began in early 1998 when they found they shared common creative ground on the soon to be produced ''Sports Night''.&lt;ref name=CC-interview/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Interview with Thomas Schlamme, Director and Executive Producer, &quot;Sports Night&quot; |author=Elif Cercel |date=November 11, 1999 |work=Directors World |url=http://b4a.healthyinterest.net/news/archives/1999/11/interview_with.html |accessdate=January 21, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their successful partnership in television is one in which Sorkin focuses on writing the scripts while Schlamme [[Executive producer#Motion pictures and television|executive produces]] and occasionally directs; they have worked together on ''Sports Night'', ''The West Wing'', and ''Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip''. Schlamme will create the look of the shows, work with the other directors, discuss the scripts with Sorkin as soon as they are turned in, make design and casting decisions, and attend the budget meetings; Sorkin tends to stick strictly to writing.&lt;ref name=CC-interview/&gt;

{{quote box|width=35%|quote=&quot;[T]he trick is to follow the rules of classic storytelling.

Sorkin is known for writing memorable lines and fast-paced dialogue, such as the &quot;You can't handle the truth!&quot; piece from ''[[A Few Good Men (play)|A Few Good Men]]'' and the partly Latin tirade against God in ''The West Wing'' episode &quot;[[Two Cathedrals]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=DeJonge-interview/&gt; For television, one [[hallmark]] of Sorkin's [[writer's voice]] is the repartee that his characters engage in as they small talk and banter about whimsical events taking place within an episode, and interject obscure popular culture references into conversation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=West Wing votes in new writers |date=July 25, 2003 |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3095619.stm |accessdate=January 25, 2007 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20061211125311/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3095619.stm| archivedate= 11 December 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
