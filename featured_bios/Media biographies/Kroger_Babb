'''Howard W. &quot;Kroger&quot; Babb''' (December 30, 1906 – January 28, 1980)  was an [[United States|American]] [[Cinema of the United States|film]] and [[Television in the United States|television]] [[film producer|producer]] and [[showman]]. His [[film marketing|marketing]] techniques were similar to a travelling salesman's, with roots in the [[medicine show|medicine-show]] tradition. Self-described as &quot;America's Fearless Young Showman,&quot;&lt;ref name=BDST&gt;[[Eric Schaefer]], ''Bold! Daring! Shocking! True!: A History of Exploitation Films, 1919–1959'' (Durham, N.C.: Duke University Press, 1999; ISBN 0-8223-2374-5).&lt;/ref&gt; he is best known for his presentation of the 1945 [[exploitation film]] ''[[Mom and Dad]]'', which was added to the [[National Film Registry]] of the [[Library of Congress]] in 2005.

Babb was involved in the production and marketing of many films and television shows, promoting each according to his favorite marketing [[motto]]: &quot;You gotta tell 'em to sell 'em.&quot;&lt;ref name=Babylon&gt;David F. Friedman, ''A Youth in Babylon: Confessions of a Trash-Film King'' (Buffalo, N.Y.: Prometheus Books, 1990; ISBN 0-87975-608-X).&lt;/ref&gt;  His films ranged from [[sexual education|sex education]]&amp;ndash;style dramas to &quot;[[documentary film|documentaries]]&quot; on foreign cultures, intended to titillate audiences rather than to educate them, maximizing profits via marketing gimmicks.

==Youth==
Babb was born in 1906 in [[Lees Creek, Ohio|Lees Creek]], [[Ohio]], USA&lt;ref name=LATimes1977&gt;Kenneth Turan, &quot;Kroger Babb: Superhuckster&quot;, ''Los Angeles Times''; reprinted in ''The Washington Post'', November 11, 1977, p.23.&lt;/ref&gt; (near [[Wilmington, Ohio|Wilmington]]&lt;ref name=Babylon/&gt;). He earned the nickname &quot;Kroger&quot; either from his childhood job at the [[Kroger|grocer of the same name]]&lt;ref name=PD&gt;[[Joe Bob Briggs]], ''Profoundly Disturbing: Shocking Movies That Changed History!'' (New York: Universe Publishing, 2003; ISBN 0-7893-0844-4).&lt;/ref&gt; or from his father's preference for [[B.H. Kroger]] coffee.&lt;ref name=LATimes1977/&gt; Babb held a number of jobs during his youth, gaining a mention in ''[[Ripley's Believe It Or Not]]'' for [[referee]]ing a record number of youth sports games.&lt;ref name=Babylon/&gt; He started out with jobs in [[sports journalism|sportswriting]] and reporting at a local newspaper in his 20s, and even showed signs of his later work while showcasing [[&quot;Digger&quot; O'Dell]], the &quot;living corpse,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Felicia Feaster and Bret Wood, ''Forbidden Fruit: The Golden Age of the Exploitation Film'' (Baltimore, Maryland: Midnight Marquee Press, 1999; ISBN 1-887664-24-6).&lt;/ref&gt; but first achieved success after his promotion to publicity manager for the Chakeres-Warners [[movie theater]]s, where he would create different kinds of stunts to lure audiences&lt;ref name=PD/&gt; &amp;ndash; for example, giving two bags of groceries to ticket holders in the theaters.&lt;ref name=Babylon/&gt; These experiences led him to the exploitation film business.

In the early 1940s Babb joined [[Cox and Underwood]], a company that obtained the rights to poorly made or otherwise unmarketable films of subjects that were potentially controversial or shocking. It would often remove entire sections of these films and add material such as [[medical education|medical reel]]s that lent itself to sensational promotion.&lt;ref name=BDST/&gt; Babb went on the road with a Cox and Underwood concoction titled ''Dust to Dust'', a reworking of ''High School Girl'' with a [[childbirth]] scene added to the end. Its profits allowed Cox and Underwood to retire from the business, leaving Babb to start his own company, [[Hygienic Productions]].&lt;ref name=Babylon/&gt; He opened it near his childhood home in Wilmington, Ohio, and hired booking agents and advance salesmen along with out-of-work actors and comedians to present repackaged films and new features.&lt;ref name=BDST/&gt;

==Film promotion==
:{{further2|[[Mom and Dad]]}}

[[Image:Babbpressbook-b.jpeg|right|thumb|A pressbook Babb sent to theaters in advance of ''Mom and Dad,'' with cast information, newspaper reviews, photos and other [[promotion (marketing)|promotional material]]]]
Babb is best known for his presentation of [[exploitation film]]s, a term many in the business would embrace.&lt;ref name=Babylon/&gt; According to ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'', his success came from picking topics that would be easily sensationalized, such as [[religion]] and sex. His expenses were estimated at 5% for selling, and his distribution overhead near 7%, resulting in some of the largest per-dollar returns in the film industry.&lt;ref name=HollywoodReporter1951&gt;''Hollywood Reporter,'' August 20, 1951.&lt;/ref&gt;

Babb's biggest success was ''Mom and Dad,'' which he conceived and produced and which [[William Beaudine]] [[film director|directed]] in six days. Babb headed the promotion of this film following its premiere in early [[1945 in film|1945]], often going on the road with it himself.&lt;ref name=BDST/&gt;  The film, a [[morality tale]] about a young girl who becomes pregnant and struggles to find someone to turn to,&lt;ref name=PD/&gt; cost [[United States dollar|$]]62,000 and was presented via over 300 prints,&lt;ref name=LOC&gt;[http://www.loc.gov/film/nfr2005.html National Film Registry 2005 Press Release], Library of Congress (URL accessed August 27, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; and the presenter would stir up his own controversy in the weeks preceding the film's arrival by writing protest letters to local churches and newspapers and fabricating letters from the [[mayor]]s of nearby cities about young women encouraged by it to discuss similar predicaments.&lt;ref name=BDST/&gt;

The third highest grossing film of its decade,&lt;ref name=LOC/&gt; ''Mom and Dad'' was claimed by Babb to have made $63,000 for every $1,000 the original investors contributed,&lt;ref name=Variety&gt;Kroger Babb obituary, ''Variety,'' January 30, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' estimated that it grossed anywhere between $40 million and $100 million.&lt;ref name=LATimes1977/&gt; Its success spawned a number of imitations, such as ''[[Street Corner (1948 film)|Street Corner]]'' and ''[[The Story of Bob and Sally]]'', that eventually flooded the market,&lt;ref name=BDST/&gt; but it was still being shown around the world decades later&lt;ref name=PressEnterprise&gt;* Dennis McDougal, &quot;Filmmaker Babb let promotion offset low budgets.&quot; ''[[The Press-Enterprise (California)|The Press-Enterprise, (Riverside, CA)]]'', unknown date.&lt;/ref&gt; and ultimately was added to the National Film Registry in [[2005 in film|2005]].&lt;ref name=LOC/&gt;

[[Image:MomAndDad.jpg|right|thumb|Poster for Babb's production of ''Mom and Dad,'' showing some of the [[rhetorical device]]s Babb would use to stir up controversy]]The success of ''Mom and Dad'' was mostly due to Babb's marketing strategy of overwhelming a small town with ads and generating controversy. Eric Schaefer explains:

:Acknowledging that his films were unknown quantities, Babb advocated a &quot;100% saturation campaign.&quot; In his sample situation — The Deadwood Theater in Movie-hater, Missouri, with a potential audience base of twenty-four thousand — Babb suggested sending tabloid heralds to all seven thousand homes in the area at a cost of $196, spending $65 for newspaper ads, $50 on radio, plus an additional $65 for three hundred window cards, hand-out teaser cards, pennants, and posters. The total came to almost $400, or the same amount the theater owner would normally spend on advertising in the course of an entire month. Babb always claimed that with his formula the profit would outweigh the investment...&lt;ref name=BDST/&gt;

The film became so ubiquitous that ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' said its presentation &quot;left only the livestock unaware of the chance to learn the facts of life.&quot;&lt;ref name=LOC/&gt; Babb also made sure that each showing of the film followed a similar format: adults-only screenings segregated by gender, and live lectures by &quot;Fearless Hygiene Commentator Elliot Forbes&quot; during an intermission. At any one time, hundreds of Elliot Forbeses would be giving a lecture at the same time in a variety of locations.&lt;ref name=BDST/&gt; (In some predominantly [[African American|African-American]] areas, [[1936 Summer Olympics|Olympic]] [[gold medal]]ist [[Jesse Owens]] appeared instead,&lt;ref name=PD/&gt; a trend he'd continue with films like ''&quot;She Shoulda Said 'No'!&quot;''&lt;ref name=D&amp;D&gt;Mike Quarles, ''Down and Dirty: Hollywood's Exploitation Filmmakers and Their Movies'' ([[Jefferson, North Carolina]], [[McFarland &amp; Company|McFarland]], 2001;  ISBN 0-7864-1142-2). p56.&lt;/ref&gt;) According to entertainer [[Card Mondor]], an Elliot Forbes in the 1940s who later purchased the Australian and New Zealand rights for ''Mom and Dad,'' the Forbeses were &quot;mostly local men (from Wilmington, Ohio) who were trained to give the lecture...[I]t was a cross-section of the male population, mostly clean-cut young guys.  ...The whole concept would have never worked with a trashy look.&quot;&lt;ref name=CardMondor&gt;Card Mondor, letter to Michael Zengel, February 5, 1994 (available from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences archives).&lt;/ref&gt;

During the intermission and after the showing, books relevant to the subject of the film were sold. ''Mom and Dad''&lt;nowiki&gt;'s&lt;/nowiki&gt; distributor [[Modern Film Distributors]] sold over forty-five thousand copies of ''Man and Boy'' and ''Woman and Girl'', written by Babb's wife,&lt;ref name=PressEnterprise/&gt; netting an estimated $31,000.&lt;ref name=BDST/&gt; According to Babb, these cost about eight [[Cent (currency)|cents]] to produce, and were sold for $1 apiece. While Modern Film was able to sell forty-five thousand on its own, Babb estimates sales of 40 million, citing &quot;[[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] figures.&quot;&lt;ref name=PressEnterprise/&gt; This sort of companion selling would become common practice for Babb: with the religious film ''The Prince of Peace'', he would sell [[Bible]]s and other spiritual literature; and with his fidelity film ''Why Men Leave Home,'' books featuring beauty tips.&lt;ref name=BDST/&gt;

With other films, Babb would try different approaches. For ''&quot;She Shoulda Said 'No'!&quot;'', an anti-[[marijuana]] film of the 1950s, he highlighted the sexual scenes and arranged &quot;one-time-only&quot; midnight showings, claiming that his company was working with the United States [[United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury Department]] to release the film &quot;in as many towns and cities as possible in the shortest possible length of time&quot; as a public service.&lt;ref name=BDST/&gt; [[David F. Friedman]], another successful exploitation filmmaker of the era, has attributed the &quot;one-time-only&quot; distribution to a quality so low that Babb wanted to cash in and move to his next stop as fast as possible.&lt;ref name=Babylon/&gt;  At each showing of a film, a singing of &quot;[[The Star Spangled Banner]]&quot; was also required.&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;John Windsor, &quot;[http://observer.guardian.co.uk/cash/story/0,6903,1567009,00.html Shot in glorious sexploitation.]&quot;  ''The Guardian'', September 11, 2005.  URL accessed January 11, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as being at the forefront of the battles over [[censorship]] and the [[Production Code|motion picture censorship system]], the exploitation genre faced numerous challenges during the 1940s and 1950s.&lt;ref name=BDST/&gt; It was estimated that Babb was [[lawsuit|sued]] over 400 times just for ''Mom and Dad''&lt;ref name=Babylon/&gt; (Babb himself claimed 428&lt;ref name=LATimes1977/&gt;). He would often use the supposed educational value of the films as a defense, also recommending it to theater owners; in his [[pressbook]] for ''[[Karamoja (film)|Karamoja]]'', he wrote, &quot;When a stupid jerk tries to outsmart proven facts, he should be in an asylum, not a theater.&quot;&lt;ref name=BDST/&gt;

Despite the criticism that Babb drew for ''Mom and Dad,'' in 1951 he received the first annual [[Sid Grauman]] Showmanship Award, presented by the Hollywood [[Rotary International|Rotary Club]] in honor of his accomplishments over the years.&lt;ref name=HollywoodReporter&gt;&quot;Kroger Babb to Get Showmanship Award,&quot; ''The Hollywood Reporter,'' January 31, 1951.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later films==
Following the success of ''Mom and Dad,'' Babb renamed his company [[Hallmark Productions]], continuing the marketing approaches of Hygienic Productions while going beyond health and sex education films. He would later set up a larger distribution company, named Hallmark's Big-6.&lt;ref name=VarietyDist&gt;&quot;Babb, 5 Others Form New Indie Distribution Outfit,&quot; ''Variety,'' 23 May issue, year unknown (c. 1960).&lt;/ref&gt;

Babb cheaply acquired the rights to what would become ''&quot;[[She Shoulda Said No!]]&quot;'' shortly after [[Robert Mitchum]] and [[Lila Leeds]] were arrested for marijuana use. Its original producer had struggled to get it distributed as ''Wild Weed'', and Babb quickly presented it as ''The Story of Lila Leeds and Her Exposé of the Marijuana Racket'', hoping that the title would draw audiences. When it failed to stir up much interest, Babb instead focused on the one scene of female nudity, using a photo of Leeds in a [[showgirl]] outfit, and retitled it ''&quot;She Shoulda Said 'No'!&quot;'', with [[tagline]]s such as &quot;How Bad Can a Good Girl Get...without losing her virtue or respect???&quot;&lt;ref name=BDST/&gt; According to Friedman, Babb's midnight presentation of the film twice a week made more money than any other film at the same theater would earn over a full run; Friedman proceeded to use the film in his own roadshow double features.&lt;ref name=Babylon/&gt;

Babb's associates agreed with his belief that &quot;Nothing's hopeless if it's advertised right&quot;, stating that he &quot;could take any piece of junk and sell it.&quot;&lt;ref name=LATimes1977/&gt; One film Babb presented in the 1950s was a [[passion play]] and the story behind putting it on, filmed in 1948 in [[Lawton, Oklahoma]].  Initially called ''The Lawton Story'' and filmed in [[Cinecolor]], the quality of the film was considered so poor that [[telephone pole]]s could be seen behind the [[crucifix]] and upon release, it was described as &quot;the only film that had to be dubbed from English to English.&quot;&lt;ref name=LATimes1977/&gt; He recut and [[dubbing (filmmaking)|redubbed]] this, retitling it as ''The Prince of Peace''; it was so successful that the ''[[New York Daily News]]'' called it &quot;the Miracle of [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]].&quot;&lt;ref name=LATimes1977/&gt;

Another film, ''[[Karamoja (film)|Karamoja]]'', was marketed as a shocking portrayal of a tribe from [[Uganda]] who wore &quot;only the wind and live[d] on blood and beer.&quot;&lt;ref name=Babylon/&gt; Scenes included &quot;the bleeding of cattle and drinking of the warm blood, and [[self-mutilation]] as a form of ornamentation,&quot;&lt;ref name=BDST/&gt; as well as a full-color [[circumcision]] scene.&lt;ref name=Babylon/&gt; ''Karamoja'' proved less controversial than many of Babb's other films and grossed less.&lt;ref name=BDST/&gt;

[[Image:monikamovie.JPG|right|thumb|Two small promotional flyers for Babb's ''[[Summer with Monika|Monika, the Story of a Bad Girl]]'', focusing on sexual aspects to draw audiences]]Babb never repeated the overwhelming success of ''Mom and Dad'', and he followed much of the exploitation industry in turning to [[burlesque]] features in an attempt to make more money. One notorious attempt was his acquisition of the American theatrical rights for [[Ingmar Bergman]]'s ''Sommaren med Monika'' (''[[Summer with Monika]]''). About one third of the film was cut, and the remaining sixty-two minutes emphasized nudity by retaining a [[skinny dipping|skinny-dipping]] scene; the result was titled ''Monika, the Story of a Bad Girl.''  Suggestive advertising art, including promotional postcards, portrayed the nude rear of [[Harriet Andersson]].&lt;ref name=BDST/&gt;

Babb's final film was his presentation of a European version of [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]]'s book ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]''. This was described by Friedman as one of the most &quot;unintentionally funny exploitation films ever made,&quot; filled with &quot;second rate Italian actors who could barely speak English.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;John McCarty, ''The Sleaze Merchants: Adventures in Exploitation Filmmaking'' (New York: St. Martin's Press, 1995; ISBN 0-312-11893-7).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other ventures==
After the success of ''Mom and Dad'', Babb talked of an &quot;unrealized&quot; project called ''[[Father Bingo]]'', which he advertised in ''[[Boxoffice (magazine)|BoxOffice]]'' magazine as &quot;An Expose of Gambling in the Parish Halls&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Father Bingo'' onesheet (Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences Library).&lt;/ref&gt; and described as a comedy with an anti-[[gambling]] message about a corrupt [[priest]] who runs a &quot;controlled&quot; [[Bingo (U.S.)|bingo]] night at his [[parish]]. Babb called it &quot;the best 'snow-job' of my life,&quot; and it has been speculated that he never intended to make it, despite the trade ads that appeared for years.&lt;ref name=Babylon/&gt;

Babb was involved with many film production companies along with his own, including [[Southwestern Productions]].&lt;ref name=Leading&gt;[[Virginia Kelley]]. ''Leading With My Heart''.  Simon &amp; Schuster, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;  On the strength of his past successes, Babb joined [[John Miller (film)|John Miller]]'s [[film production]] company, [[Miller-Consolidated Pictures]], as [[vice president]] and [[general manager]] in 1959. Babb advocated the use of the [[soft sell|hard-selling]] technique he had perfected as a presenter: &quot;selling the sizzle instead of the steak&quot;, according to an interview.&lt;ref name=BoxOffice&gt;&quot;$1 million Movie I.Q. Contest Tops MCP Exploitation Plan,&quot; ''BoxOffice,'' November 9, 1959, pp.28–29, 180.&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote a column for ''BoxOffice'' at the same time. His personal anecdotes provided advice for selling films, such as writing off expenses as [[tax deduction]]s, and using [[List of women's organizations|women's club]]s to expand advertising and revenues cheaply. He noted that there were &quot;over 30,000 women's clubs,&quot; and that &quot;practically every women's club has a [[16 mm film|16mm]] [[movie projector|projector]].&quot;&lt;ref name=BoxOffice/&gt;

In 1963, Babb formed another distribution company, [[Studio 10,001 Inc.|Studio 10,001]]. Operating in [[Beverly Hills, California|Beverly Hills]] (and claiming representation in Canada, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand&lt;ref name=BoxOffice63&gt;&quot;Kroger Babb Forms New Distributing Co,&quot;  ''BoxOffice,'' July 24, 1963.&lt;/ref&gt;), it used similar roadshow techniques to market television programs such as ''[[Ern Westmore|The Ern Westmore Show]]''.&lt;ref name=VarietyHC&gt;''Variety and Daily Variety Television Reviews,'' vol. 18, ''1993–1994'' (New York: Garland, 1996; ISBN 0-8240-3797-9).&lt;/ref&gt; Babb also acted as a showman for hire, promoting others' films when not working on his own. Among them was a [[nudie-cutie]] picture titled ''Kipling's Women'', a [[peep show]],&lt;ref name=Babylon/&gt; and ''Five Minutes to Love'', a reworking of a [[Rue McClanahan]] film.&lt;ref name=BoxOffice63/&gt;

Babb began creating promotion kits in an attempt to teach his craft to would-be presenters. Marketing himself as &quot;MR. PIHSNAMWOHS&quot; (&quot;showmanship&quot; backwards), he advertised in ''BoxOffice''.&lt;ref name=Babylon/&gt; He also dabbled in other areas, writing tirades against pay television and creating a [[pyramid scheme]] titled &quot;[[The Idea Factory]].&quot;&lt;ref name=BDST/&gt; One of his schemes was the &quot;Astounding Swedish Ice Cream Diet&quot;: overweight throughout his life, Babb claimed to have eaten [[ice cream]] three times a day, yet to have lost one hundred pounds in forty-five days.&lt;ref name=Babylon/&gt;

==Personal life==
Babb met [[Mildred Horn]] in 1944&lt;ref name=MHIMDB&gt;&quot;[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0394890/ Mildred Horn]&quot;, [[Internet Movie Database]] (URL accessed October 16, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; during a showing of ''Dust to Dust'' in [[Indianapolis, Indiana|Indianapolis]], where she was working as a [[film criticism|movie critic]]; her review of the film called it a &quot;cheap, mislabeled [[morality play]],&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[John Waters (filmmaker)|John Waters]], &quot;[http://www.movienet.com/dirtyshame.html My Kind of Guy]&quot; (URL accessed October 16, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; but the two struck up a conversation about it. They stayed together in a [[common-law marriage]]; Horn wrote a number of Babb's screenplays, including ''Mom and Dad'', as well as companion books.&lt;ref name=Babylon/&gt;

In November 1953, Babb was arrested on a [[drunk driving|drunk-driving]] charge after running a red [[traffic light]] and refusing a [[Field Sobriety Test#Field sobriety tests|sobriety test]]. His $250 bail was [[continuance|continued]], and he was not convicted, although this mishap to the recent creator of the anti-alcohol film ''One Too Many'' was widely covered in the press.&lt;ref name=LAExaminer&gt;&quot;Producer of Film ''One Too Many'' Denies Being Tipsy,&quot; ''Los Angeles Examiner,'' 30 November 1953; &quot;TV Producer Arrested in Drunk Driving Case,&quot; ''Los Angeles Times,'' November 30, 1953; &quot;Producer Arrested on Drunk Charge,&quot; ''Citizen News,'' November 30, 1953.&lt;/ref&gt;

Babb had tax troubles in the years after his success with ''Mom and Dad''. He suggested to the ''Press-Enterprise'' that his operation was so diffuse that sales of his one-dollar sex education [[pamphlet]]s were too difficult to track accurately.&lt;ref name=PressEnterprise/&gt; Babb eventually sold the rights to ''Mom and Dad'' and his stake in Modern Film Distributors to Erwin Joseph and Floyd Lewis — former partners in Modern Film&lt;ref name=Babylon/&gt; who would continue to showcase ''Mom and Dad'' across the United States.&lt;ref name=LATimes1986&gt;Mildred A. Babb, letter in ''Los Angeles Times,'' May 4, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

Babb suffered from various ailments toward the end of his life, including a [[stroke]].&lt;ref name=LATimes1977/&gt; He retired in 1977, at 70,&lt;ref name=HG&gt;&quot;Death: Kroger Babb,&quot; ''Hollywood Gazette,'' January 30, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; and died of [[heart failure]] (due to complications from [[diabetes]]) on January 29, 1980, in [[Palm Springs, California]]. He was survived by his wife, a son, and five grandchildren.&lt;ref name=Variety/&gt; Babb is buried in [[Centerville, Clinton County, Ohio|Centerville, Ohio]]. His gravestone reads, &quot;His many trips around and all over the world began in Centerville and end here in Lees Creek.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Photo from the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences Library.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
Babb worked in various areas of the entertainment industry, in both traditional and exploitation genres. He claimed to have made twenty films,&lt;ref name=LATimes1977/&gt; and produced for television,&lt;ref name=Mirror&gt;&quot;Better Read That TV Script a Leetle Closer, Mr. Babb,&quot; ''Mirror,'' November 30, 1953.&lt;/ref&gt; radio,&lt;ref name=NYT1951&gt;&quot;Specialist&quot;, ''The New York Times,'' March 18, 1951.&lt;/ref&gt; and even the stage.&lt;ref name=BabbTalk&gt;Copy of talk by Kroger Babb, introducing himself to Hollywood producers (Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences Library).&lt;/ref&gt; This is an incomplete collection of works owing to the nature of the exploitation genre. The titles are as they were finally presented by Babb, with earlier titles noted in parentheses.&lt;ref name=IMDB&gt;&quot;[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0044784/ Kroger Babb],&quot; Internet Movie Database (URL accessed September 30, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BoxOffice65&gt;&quot;Kroger Babb to Handle ''Kwaheri'' in 11 States,&quot; ''BoxOffice,'' April 26, 1965.&lt;/ref&gt;
