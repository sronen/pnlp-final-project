'''John Douglas''' (11 April 1830{{spaced ndash}}23 May 1911) was an [[England|English]] [[architect]] who designed about 500&amp;nbsp;buildings in [[Cheshire]], [[North Wales]], and northwest England, in particular in the estate of [[Eaton Hall (Cheshire)|Eaton Hall]]. He was trained in [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] and practised throughout his career from an office in [[Chester]], [[Cheshire]]. Initially he ran the practice on his own, but from 1884 until two years before his death he worked in partnerships with two of his former assistants.

Douglas's output included new churches, [[Victorian restoration|restoring]] and renovating existing churches, church furnishings, new houses and alterations to existing houses, and a variety of other buildings, including shops, banks, offices, schools, memorials and public buildings. His architectural styles were [[Eclecticism in art|eclectic]]. Douglas worked during the period of the [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]], and many of his works incorporate elements of the [[English Gothic architecture|English Gothic]] style. He was also influenced by architectural styles from the mainland of Europe and included elements of French, German and Dutch architecture. However he is probably best remembered for his incorporation of [[Vernacular architecture|vernacular]] elements in his buildings, in particular [[Timber framing|half-timbering]], influenced by the [[Black-and-white Revival architecture|black-and-white revival]] in Chester. Other vernacular elements he incorporated include tile-hanging, [[pargeting]], and the use of decorative brick in [[Diaper (architecture)|diapering]] and the design of tall chimney stacks. Of particular importance is Douglas's use of [[joiner]]y and highly detailed wood carving.

Throughout his career he attracted commissions from wealthy landowners and industrialists, especially the [[Duke of Westminster|Grosvenor]] family of Eaton Hall. Most of his works have survived, particularly his churches. The city of Chester contains a number of his structures, the most admired of which are his half-timbered black-and-white buildings and [[Eastgate and Eastgate Clock|Eastgate Clock]]. The highest concentration of his work is found in the Eaton Hall estate and the surrounding villages of [[Eccleston, Cheshire|Eccleston]], [[Aldford]] and [[Pulford]].

==Biography==
===Early life and training===
[[File:Sandiway 2a.jpg|thumb|left|Park Cottage, Sandiway, the birthplace of John Douglas|alt=A cobbled courtyard with brick buildings on three sides, some of them timber-framed. On the gatepost on the right is a blue commemorative plaque]]
John Douglas was born at Park Cottage, [[Sandiway]], [[Cheshire]], on 11&amp;nbsp;April 1830 and baptised on 16&amp;nbsp;May 1830 at [[St Mary's Church, Weaverham]].&lt;ref name=dnb&gt;Howell, Peter (2004) '[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/52372 Douglas, John (1830-1911)]', ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', [[Oxford University Press]], Retrieved on 22&amp;nbsp;January 2008. {{ODNBsub}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the second of the four children, and the only son, of John Douglas and his wife Mary née Swindley (1792{{spaced ndash}}1863). John Douglas senior was born in [[Northampton]] about 1798{{spaced ndash}}1800 and his wife was born in [[Aldford]], a village on the [[Eaton Hall, Cheshire|Eaton]] estate in Cheshire; her father was the village [[blacksmith]] at [[Eccleston, Cheshire|Eccleston]], another village in the Eaton estate. John Douglas senior was by trade a builder and [[joiner]], and also described himself as a [[Construction surveying|surveyor]] and a timber merchant. In 1835 he acted as architect for a house at [[Hartford, Cheshire|Hartford]], a village between Sandiway and [[Northwich]]. At the time of the [[United Kingdom Census 1851|1851 census]] he was employing 48&amp;nbsp;men. He owned land in Sandiway, and a house and land in the neighbouring village of [[Cuddington, Vale Royal|Cuddington]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hubbard|1991|pp=1–2.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nothing is known of John Douglas junior's school education. He gained knowledge and experience in his father's building yard and workshop which were attached to the family house. In the mid or late 1840s he was [[Articled clerk|articled]] to [[Edward Graham Paley|E. G. Paley]], of [[Sharpe, Paley and Austin#Sharpe and Paley, Architects|Sharpe and Paley]], architects in [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]], [[Lancashire]]. When his articles were completed, Douglas became Paley's chief assistant. In either 1855 or 1860 he established his own office at No.&amp;nbsp;6&amp;nbsp;Abbey Square, Chester.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hubbard|1991|pp=3–4.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Family and personal life===
[[File:Walmoor Hill 1.jpg|thumb|[[Walmoor Hill]], the house Douglas built for himself|alt=Seen from a low angle through the branches of trees is a substantial stone house with two-three storeys, bay windows and some castellation.]]
Douglas's elder sister, Elizabeth, was born in 1827. His younger sisters were Mary Hannah and Emma, who were born in 1832 and 1834 respectively. Mary Hannah died five months before Emma's birth, and Emma herself died in 1848.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hubbard|1991|p=1.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Douglas married Elizabeth Edmunds, a farmer's daughter from [[Bangor-on-Dee|Bangor-is-y-Coed]], [[Flintshire]], on 25&amp;nbsp;January 1860 in [[St Dunawd's Church, Bangor Is-coed|St&amp;nbsp;Dunawd's Church]] in the village, a church he was later to restore. Initially the couple lived over the office at 6&amp;nbsp;Abbey Square, and later they moved next door to No.&amp;nbsp;4. Their five children were born in these houses, John Percy in 1861, Colin Edmunds in 1864, Mary Elizabeth in 1866, Sholto Theodore the following year, and Jerome in 1869. Only two of the children survived to adulthood; Mary Elizabeth died from [[scarlet fever]] in 1868, Jerome lived for only a few days, and John Percy died aged 12 in 1873.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hubbard|1991|pp=4–5.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 1876 the family moved to live at [[31 and 33 Dee Banks, Chester|31&amp;nbsp;and 33&amp;nbsp;Dee Banks]], Chester, one of a pair of semi-detached houses overlooking the [[River Dee, Wales|River Dee]], which were built by Douglas. His wife died in 1878 from [[laryngitis]] after a year's illness. Douglas did not remarry. His son Colin trained as an architect and worked in Douglas's office but died in 1887 at the age of 23 from [[Tuberculosis|consumption]]. His other son Sholto is not known to have had any profession but he was a heavy drinker of alcohol. During the 1890s Douglas built a large house for himself, [[Walmoor Hill]], also at Dee Banks overlooking the river. Here he lived until his death on 23&amp;nbsp;May 1911 at the age of 81. His funeral was held at Overleigh old cemetery, Chester, where he was buried. The following Sunday a memorial service was held at [[St John the Evangelist's Church, Sandiway]]. His [[Estate (law)|estate]] amounted to a little over £32,000 (£{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|32000|1911|{{CURRENTYEAR}}|r=-4}}}} as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}).{{Inflation-fn|UK}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hubbard|1991|pp=5–9.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from his surviving buildings, only two memorials remain to his memory. One is a tablet in [[St Paul's Church, Boughton]], the church in which he worshipped and which he had rebuilt.&lt;ref name=h13&gt;{{Harvnb|Hubbard|1991|p=13.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other is a plaque placed on one of his [[2–18 St Werburgh Street, Chester|buildings in St&amp;nbsp;Werburgh Street]], Chester, in 1923 by his pupils and assistants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hubbard|1991|p=17.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practice and personality==

Douglas practised on his own until 1884, when his son, Colin, became ill. He then took Daniel Porter Fordham into partnership and practised as Douglas &amp; Fordham. Fordham was born around 1846 and had been an assistant in Douglas's office since at least 1872. In 1898, having developed consumption, Fordham retired from the practice and went to live in [[Bournemouth]] where he died the following year. He was replaced as partner by Charles Howard Minshull, who had been born in Chester in 1858 and who became articled to Douglas in 1874; the practice became Douglas &amp; Minshull. During the first decade of the 20th&amp;nbsp;century, Douglas became less active but, for reasons which are unknown, the partnership was dissolved in 1909. The practice returned to the title of John Douglas, Architect. Minshull went into partnership with E.&amp;nbsp;J.&amp;nbsp;Muspratt in Foregate Street, Chester. When Douglas died, this partnership worked from the Abbey Square address as Douglas, Minshull &amp; Muspratt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hubbard|1991|pp=6–7.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Little is known about Douglas's private life and personality. Only two images of him are known to survive. One is a photograph taken in later middle age. The other is a caricature sketch made by an assistant in his office. This shows him in old age, bowed, bent and bespectacled, carrying a [[Briefcase|portfolio]] and an [[Hearing aid|ear trumpet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hubbard|1991|pp=10–11.}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to architectural historian [[Edward Hubbard]], Douglas's life &quot;seems to have been one of thorough devotion to architecture&amp;nbsp;... which may well have been intensified by the death of his wife and other domestic worries&quot;.&lt;ref name=hub11&gt;{{Harvnb|Hubbard|1991|p=11.}}&lt;/ref&gt; His obituary in the ''[[Chester Chronicle]]'' stated that he &quot;lived heart and soul in his profession&quot;.&lt;ref name=hub11/&gt; 

Douglas was a dedicated Christian who regularly attended his local church, [[St Paul's Church, Boughton]], a church he rebuilt. His house, Walmoor Hill, included an [[Oratory (worship)|oratory]]. He also had a &quot;strong sense of national loyalty&quot;, incorporating statues of [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] in [[Niche (architecture)|niches]] at Walmoor Hill and in his buildings in St&amp;nbsp;Werburgh Street, Chester.&lt;ref name=hub11/&gt; Douglas was not good at handling the financial matters of his practice. The [[Hugh Grosvenor, 1st Duke of Westminster|Duke of Westminster's]] secretary wrote of him in 1884, &quot;A good architect but a poor hand at accounts!&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hubbard|1991|p=15.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Delay in presenting his accounts often led to difficulties and confusion; such delay sometimes amounted to as much as ten years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hubbard|1991|pp=15–16.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Otherwise very little is known about his personal life. No family papers have survived and none of the documents from the office at 6&amp;nbsp;Abbey Square has been found.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hubbard|1991|p=29.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Styles and practice==
===Output and patronage===

Douglas designed some 500 buildings.&lt;ref name=&quot;h74&quot;/&gt; He built at least 40&amp;nbsp;new churches or chapels, [[Victorian restoration|restored]], altered or made additions to many other churches, and designed fittings and furniture for the interiors of churches. He designed new houses, altered or made additions to others, and built various structures associated with those houses. Douglas's works also included farms, shops, offices, hotels, a hospital, drinking fountains, clocks, schools, public baths, a library, a bridge, an [[obelisk]], cheese factories, and public conveniences. As his office was in Chester, most of his works were in Cheshire and North Wales, although some were further afield, in [[Lancashire]], [[Staffordshire]], [[Warwickshire]] and Scotland.&lt;ref name=hworks&gt;{{Harvnb|Hubbard|1991|pp=238–279.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Vale-Royal-Abbey-Douglas.jpg|thumb|left|[[Vale Royal Abbey]] showing the part of the south wing added by Douglas|alt=An irregularly shaped red-brick house with slate roofs with an orangery on the ground floor and gables, chimneys and a clock tower above.

Throughout his career Douglas attracted commissions from wealthy and important patrons. His first-known independent work was an ornament, which is no longer in existence, for the garden of the Honourable Mrs&amp;nbsp;Cholmondeley. She was the sister-in-law of [[Hugh Cholmondeley, 2nd Baron Delamere]], and it was from the 2nd&amp;nbsp;Baron that Douglas received his first major commission, a considerable rebuilding of the south wing of his seat at [[Vale Royal Abbey]] in 1860. Around the same time, Lord Delamere commissioned him to build the church of [[St John the Evangelist's Church, Winsford|St John the Evangelist]] at [[Over, Cheshire|Over]], [[Winsford]], as a memorial to his first wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hubbard|1991|p=27.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Douglas's most important patrons were the [[Duke of Westminster|Grosvenor]] family of [[Eaton Hall, Cheshire|Eaton Hall]], Cheshire. In 1865 he was commissioned to design the [[Grosvenor Park, Chester#Grosvenor Park Lodge|entrance lodge]] and other structures for [[Grosvenor Park, Chester|Grosvenor Park]] in Chester, and [[St John the Baptist's Church, Aldford|St&amp;nbsp;John's Church]] in the village of Aldford in the Eaton Hall estate for [[Richard Grosvenor, 2nd Marquess of Westminster]].&lt;ref name=h28&gt;{{Harvnb|Hubbard|1991|p=28.}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the marquess died in 1869 he was succeeded by his son [[Hugh Grosvenor, 1st Duke of Westminster|Hugh Grosvenor, 1st&amp;nbsp;Duke of Westminster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hubbard|1991|p=60.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Douglas received a large number of commissions from the 1st Duke and from his son, the [[Hugh Grosvenor, 2nd Duke of Westminster|2nd Duke]], throughout his career. It is estimated that for the 1st&amp;nbsp;Duke alone he designed four churches and chapels, eight parsonages and large houses, about 15&amp;nbsp;schools, around 50&amp;nbsp;farms (in whole or in part), about 300&amp;nbsp;cottages, lodges and [[Forge|smithies]], two factories, two inns and about 12&amp;nbsp;commercial buildings on the Eaton Hall estate alone. He also designed buildings on the duke's [[Halkyn]] estate in [[Flintshire]], including another church.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hubbard|1991|pp=63–64.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other wealthy landowners who commissioned work from Douglas included [[William Molyneux, 4th Earl of Sefton]], [[Francis Egerton, 3rd Earl of Ellesmere]], [[George Cholmondeley, 5th Marquess of Cholmondeley]], [[Rowland Egerton-Warburton]] of [[Arley Hall]], Cheshire, and in Wales, the family of [[Baron Kenyon|Lord Kenyon]], and the Gladstone family, including [[William Ewart Gladstone|W. E Gladstone]].&lt;ref name=hworks/&gt; He also received commissions from industrialists, including [[John &amp; Thomas Johnson|John&amp;nbsp;&amp;&amp;nbsp;Thomas Johnson]], soap and [[alkali]] manufacturers from [[Runcorn]],&lt;ref name=king&gt;{{citation | last =King | first =Roger | title =John Douglas 1830–1911 |edition= | publisher =Northwich and District Heritage Society | date = | location = Northwich| page = 6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Muspratt]], a chemical industrialist from [[Flint]], Flintshire,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hubbard|1991|p=254.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[William Lever, 1st Viscount Leverhulme|W.&amp;nbsp;H.&amp;nbsp;Lever]], soap manufacturer and creator of the village of [[Port Sunlight]].&lt;ref name=h28/&gt;

Although the firm where Douglas received his training was in a provincial city in the north of England, it was at the forefront of the [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] in the country. The Gothic Revival was a reaction against the [[neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] style, which had been popular in the 18th and early 19th&amp;nbsp;centuries, and it incorporated features of the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] style of the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Smith| first = Edwin| author-link = Edwin Smith (photographer)| last2 = Hutton| first2 = Graham| last3 = Cook | first3 = Olive| publication-date = | date = | year = 1979| title = English Parish Churches | edition = | volume = | series = | publication-place = London| place = | publisher = [[Thames &amp; Hudson]] | pages = 211–214 | page = | id = | isbn = 978-0-500-20139-8| doi = | oclc = | url = | accessdate =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both [[Edmund Sharpe]] and E. G. Paley had been influenced by the [[Cambridge Camden Society]] and, more specifically, by [[Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin|A. W. N Pugin]] who believed that &quot;Gothic was the only correct and Christian way to build&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hubbard|1991|p=19.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sharpe had also been influenced by [[Thomas Rickman]], and he had written papers on medieval scholarship himself. Paley had been influenced by his brother, [[Frederick Apthorp Paley]], who was enthusiastic about Gothic architecture, and who had also been influenced by Rickman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hubbard|1991|pp=19–21.}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the time Douglas was working in Lancaster the firm was responsible for building and restoring churches in Gothic Revival style, one of which was [[St Wilfrid's Church, Davenham|St&amp;nbsp;Wilfrid's Church]] in the Cheshire village of [[Davenham]], some {{convert|3|mi|km|0}} from Sandiway.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hubbard|1991|p=22.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Douglas's first church, that of [[St John the Evangelist's Church, Winsford|St&amp;nbsp;John the Evangelist]] at [[Over, Cheshire|Over]], [[Winsford]], was entirely [[English Gothic architecture|English Gothic]] in style, more specifically [[English Gothic architecture#Decorated Gothic|Early Decorated]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hubbard|1991|p=41.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Douglas's influences were not from England alone. Although he never travelled abroad, he incorporated Gothic styles from continental countries, especially Germany and France. This combination of Gothic styles contributed to what has come to be known as the [[Victorian Gothic|High Victorian]] style. Its features include a sense of massiveness, steep roofs which are frequently [[Hip roof|hipped]], round [[turret]]s with conical roofs, [[pinnacle]]s, heavy [[corbel#Corbel tables|corbel tables]], and the use of [[Polychrome|polychromism]]. Many of Douglas's works, especially his earlier ones, are High Victorian in style, or incorporate High Victorian features.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hubbard|1991|pp=38–58.}}&lt;/ref&gt; One characteristic feature of Douglas's work is the inclusion of [[Dormer|dormer windows]] rising through the [[eaves]] and surmounted by hipped roofs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hubbard|1991|p=47.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Grosvenor Park Lodge.jpg|thumb|left|[[Grosvenor Park, Chester|Grosvenor Park]] Lodge|alt=A two-storey house, the lower storey being in sandstone and the upper timber framed and gabled. To the right of the house are the entry gates to the park and in front of it are formal flower beds.]]
Another major influence in his work was the rise of interest in [[vernacular architecture]]. By the time Douglas moved to Chester, the black-and-white revival using [[timber framing|half-timbering]] was well under way, and Douglas came to incorporate this style in his buildings in Chester and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=19219 |title=The City of Chester: General History and Topography: Topography 900–1914: Victorian and Edwardian, 1840–1914 |accessdate=22&amp;nbsp;January 2008 |last=Lewis |first=C.

Other early Chester architects involved in the revival were T.&amp;nbsp;A.&amp;nbsp;Richardson and [[James Harrison (architect)|James Harrison]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hubbard|1991|pp=25–26.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it came to be developed mainly by [[Thomas Lockwood|T. M. Lockwood]] and by Douglas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pevsner|Hubbard|2003|p=39.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part of Douglas's earliest work for the Grosvenor family, the entrance lodge to Grosvenor Park, used half-timbering in its upper storey; this is the first known use by Douglas of black-and-white.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hubbard|1991|pp=47–48.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other vernacular motifs were taken from earlier styles of English architecture, in particular, the [[Tudor style architecture|Tudor]] style. These include tile-hanging, [[Pargeting|pargetting]] and massive brick ribbed chimney stacks. In this style, Douglas was influenced by the architects [[William Eden Nesfield|Nesfield]] and [[Richard Norman Shaw|Shaw]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hubbard|1991|pp=77–80.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Douglas also used vernacular elements from the continent, especially the late medieval brickwork of Germany and the [[Low Countries]].&lt;ref name=h74&gt;{{Harvnb|Hubbard|1986|p=74.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A characteristic of Douglas's work is his attention to both external and internal detailing. Such detailing was not derived from any particular style and Douglas chose elements from whichever style suited his purpose for each specific project. His detailing applied particularly to his [[joiner]]y, perhaps inspired by his experience in his father's workshop, and was applied both to wooden fittings and to the furniture he designed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hubbard|1991|pp=82–88.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A further Continental influence was his use of a [[Dutch gable]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hubbard|1991|p=93.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most important and consistently used element in Douglas's vernacular buildings was his use of half-timbering, which was usually used for parts of the building.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hubbard|1991|p=95.}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the cases of Rowden Abbey and [[St Michael and All Angels Church, Altcar|St&amp;nbsp;Michael and All Angels Church, Altcar]], the entire buildings were timber-framed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hubbard|1991|pp=109, 126–127.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Douglas's earliest significant commissions were for the [[Hugh Cholmondeley, 2nd Baron Delamere|2nd Baron Delamere]] and were very different in type and style from each another. The addition of a wing to Vale Royal Abbey (1860) was in [[Elizabethan architecture|Elizabethan]] style while [[St John the Evangelist's Church, Winsford|St John's Church]] at [[Over, Cheshire|Over]] (1860–63) was of the [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] in [[English Gothic architecture#Decorated Gothic|Early Decorated]] style.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hubbard|1991|pp=40–42.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pevsner|Hubbard|2003|p=368.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ph389&gt;{{Harvnb|Pevsner|Hubbard|2003|p=389.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Over United Reformed Church|Congregational Chapel]], also at Over (1865) was again different, being built in [[Polychrome|polychromic]] brick in [[Victorian Gothic|High Victorian]] style.&lt;ref name=ph389/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hubbard|1991|pp=43–44.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile Douglas had designed a shop at [[19–21 Sankey Street, Warrington|19–21 Sankey Street]], [[Warrington]] (1864) with [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] [[Arcade (architecture)|arcades]] and detailed stone carving which Hubbard considers to be his &quot;first building of real and outstanding quality...in its way one of the best things he ever did&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hubbard|1991|pp=44–46.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after this came the first commissions for the [[Duke of Westminster|Grosvenor]] family, consisting of a lodge and other structures in [[Grosvenor Park, Chester]] (1865–67),&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hubbard|1991|pp=46–48.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pevsner|Hubbard|2003|p=160.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[St John the Baptist's Church, Aldford]] (1865–66).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hubbard|1991|p=48.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pevsner|Hubbard|2003|pp=57–58.}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first commission for a large house was [[Oakmere Hall]] (1867) for [[John &amp; Thomas Johnson]], industrialists of [[Runcorn]]. It is in High Victorian style and includes a main block and a service wing, a large tower on the south face, a small tower with [[turret]]s, a [[Porte-cochere|porte-cochère]], steep roofs and [[dormer]] windows.&lt;ref name=king/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hubbard|1991|pp=50–53.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pevsner and Hubbard 2003 p=333&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Pevsner|Hubbard|2003|p=333.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another early church was [[Old St Ann's Church, Warrington|St Ann's]] at Warrington (1868–69), again High Victorian in style, which is described as being &quot;quite startlingly bold&quot; and &quot;a prodigy church in Douglas's output&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hubbard|1991|pp=55–56.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pollard|Pevsner|2006|p=621.}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1869–70 Douglas had started to design buildings on the [[Eaton Hall, Cheshire|Eaton Hall]] estate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hubbard|1991|p=62.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around this time he also re-modelled [[St Mary's Church, Dodleston]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hubbard|1991|pp=129–130, 241.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early mature buildings (1870–84)===
====Secular====
[[File:Shotwick Park.jpg|thumb|[[Shotwick House|Shotwick Park]] around 1879; image taken from ''[[Building (magazine)|The Builder]]''|alt=A large irregular house with two wings, each with a small square turret. The house is in two storeys plus attics, has gables, some of which are timber-framed, and tall brick chimney stacks. At the rear can be seen the top of a larger square turret and a spire.]]
Many of the secular buildings in this period were smaller-scale structures. These include cottages in [[Great Budworth]], and cottages, houses, schools and farms in the Eaton Hall estate and its associated villages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hubbard|1991|pp=79–101.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1872 he designed [[Shotwick House|Shotwick Park]], a large house in [[Saughall|Great Saughall]], built in brick with some half-timbering; it has steep roofs, tall ribbed chimneys and turrets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hubbard|1991|pp=114–115, 243.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pevsner|Hubbard|2003|p=229.}}&lt;/ref&gt; About the same time he reconstructed [[Broxton Old Hall|Broxton Higher Hall]], incorporating much half-timbering.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hubbard|1991|pp=105, 107.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pevsner|Hubbard|2003|p=117.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commissions for more large houses came in the late 1870s and 1880s. [[The Gelli]] (1877) is a house in three [[Ell (architecture)|ranges]] designed for the Kenyon sisters in the village of Tallarn Green, [[Flintshire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hubbard|1991|pp=104–105.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hubbard|1986|p=445.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also built for the Kenyon family is [[Tudor Court, Penley|Llannerch Panna]] in [[Penley]], Flintshire (1878–79), which is &quot;competent in its handling of timberwork&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hubbard|1991|pp=107–109.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hubbard|1986|p=416.}}&lt;/ref&gt; An entirely black-and-white house with [[jettying]] is Rowden Abbey (1881) in [[Hertfordshire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hubbard|1991|p=109.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Back in North Wales, [[Plas Mynach]] (1883) in [[Barmouth]] includes much detailed woodwork internally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hubbard|1991|pp=109–111.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Barrowmore Hall.jpg|thumb|left|Borrowmore Hall about 1881; also from ''The Builder''|alt=An elaborate house with three storeys, including some timber-framing, brick diapering, gables and a castellated tower. To the left is a lower wing which contains an archway surmounted by a spire and lantern.]]
In about 1879–81 Douglas built a terrace of houses on his own land in Chester, [[6–11 Grosvenor Park Road, Chester|6–11 Grosvenor Park Road]], the road leading to the main entrance to Grosvenor Park, in High Victorian style.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hubbard|1991|pp=112–114.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pevsner|Hubbard|2003|p=164.}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 1883 he designed Barrowmore Hall (or Barrow Court) at [[Barrow, Cheshire|Great Barrow]] (since demolished) which was one of his largest houses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hubbard|1991|pp=116–118.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also around this time he designed buildings on the Eaton Hall estate, including [[Eccleston Hill]] (1881–82), a large house for the Duke's secretary, the [[Stud Lodge, Eaton Hall|Stud Lodge]], a smaller building of the same dates, [[Eccleston Hill Lodge]] (1881), a three-storey gatehouse at the main entrance to the park, with a high hipped roof and turrets, and [[Eccleston Paddocks|The Paddocks]] (1882–83), another large house, this time for the Duke's land agent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hubbard|1991|pp=118–120.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Chester city centre his designs included the [[Grosvenor Club and North and South Wales Bank]] (1881–83) in Eastgate Street, built in stone and brick, with a turret and a stepped gable, and [[142 Foregate Street, Chester|142 Foregate Street]] for the [[Cheshire Constabulary|Cheshire County Constabulary]] (1884), with a shaped gable in Flemish style.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hubbard|1991|pp=120–123.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Churches====
[[File:Church of St Michael and All Angels, Great Altcar.JPG|thumb|[[St Michael and All Angels Church, Altcar]]|alt=A small black and white half-timbered church showing the nave with a porch, a small chancel beyond and a small spire on the nearside of the roof; some gravestones visible in the churchyard.]]
[[St Mary's Church, Whitegate]] was restored in 1874–75 for the [[Hugh Cholmondeley, 2nd Baron Delamere|2nd Baron Delamere]], retaining much of the medieval interior but rebuilding the exterior, adding a short chancel, and incorporating half-timbering.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hubbard|1991|pp=124–125.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pevsner|Hubbard|2003|pp=381–382.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[St Paul's Church, Boughton|St&amp;nbsp;Paul's Church, Boughton]] in Chester was Douglas's own parish church which he rebuilt in 1876 incorporating parts of the pre-existing building.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hubbard|1991|pp=125–126.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pevsner|Hubbard|2003|pp=172–173.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Douglas's only church built entirely in half-timbering is the small church of [[St Michael and All Angels Church, Altcar|St Michael and All Angels]] at [[Great Altcar]] in [[Lancashire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hubbard|1991|pp=126–127.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pollard|Pevsner|2006|pp=179–180.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A church built in brick with half-timbering is [[St Chad's Church, Hopwas|St Chad's]] (1881) at [[Hopwas]] in [[Staffordshire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hubbard|1991|p=127.}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period Douglas built or restored a series of churches entirely in stone, incorporating mainly Gothic features together with vernacular elements. These include [[St John the Baptist's Church, Hartford]] (1873–75), St Paul's, [[Marston, Cheshire|Marston]] (1874, now demolished), the Presbyterian Chapel (1875) at [[Rossett]], [[Denbighshire]], [[St Stephen's Church, Moulton|St Stephen's]], [[Moulton, Cheshire|Moulton]] (1876), the rebuilding of [[Christ Church, Chester|Christ Church]], Chester (also in 1876), the [[Church of St Mary the Virgin, Halkyn|Church of St Mary the Virgin]] (1877–78) at [[Halkyn]], [[Flintshire]], and the Welsh Church of [[St John the Evangelist's Church, Mold|St John the Evangelist]] (1878) in [[Mold, Flintshire|Mold]], also in Flintshire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hubbard|1991|pp=130–137.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in this period he built [[St Mary's Church, Pulford|St&amp;nbsp;Mary's Church]], at [[Pulford]] in 1881–84 for the Duke of Westminster and in 1882–85 [[St Werburgh's Church, Warburton#New church|St Werburgh's New Church]] at [[Warburton, Greater Manchester|Warburton]] for [[Rowland Egerton-Warburton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hubbard|1991|pp=137–139.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pevsner|Hubbard|2003|p=317.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pevsner|Hubbard|2003|p=376.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Partnerships===
====Douglas &amp; Fordham (1884–98)====
[[File:Vakwerkhuizen in Chester.jpg|thumb|[[2–18 St Werburgh Street, Chester|St Werburgh Street, Chester]], showing the range of Douglas's buildings|alt=The corner of a street with a range of shops running up the right side of the street; the shops have stone lower storeys and highly detailed timber-framed upper storeys that include oriel windows and gables. To the right of the range of shops is another shop with a modern shop front; it is taller than the others, and is timber-framed above the ground floor.]]
In 1885–87 the partnership designed [[Abbeystead House]] for the [[William Molyneux, 4th Earl of Sefton|4th Earl of Sefton]] in North Lancashire. Hubbard describes this as &quot;the finest of Douglas's Elizabethan houses, and one of the largest which he ever designed&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hubbard|1991|p=149.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pevsner|2002|p=186.}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time additions were made to [[Jodrell Hall]] in Cheshire and [[Halkyn Castle]] in Flintshire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hubbard|1991|p=151.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1885 the Castle Hotel at [[Conwy]], [[Caernarfonshire]], was remodelled,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hubbard|1991|p=155.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1887–88 a strongroom was added to [[Hawarden Castle (18th century)|Hawarden Castle]], followed by a porch in 1890.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hubbard|1991|p=157.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hubbard|1986|pp=362–364.}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period more buildings were added to the Eaton Hall estate, and these included houses and cottages, such as [[Eccleston Hill]], and [[Eccleston Ferry House]], and farms such as [[Saighton Lane Farm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hubbard|1991|pp=158–166.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1890–91 an [[obelisk]] was built in the Belgrave Avenue approach to Eaton Hall.&lt;ref name=h166&gt;{{Harvnb|Hubbard|1991|p=166.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pevsner|Hubbard|2003|p=212.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last house designed by Douglas on a large scale was [[Brocksford Hall]] (1893) in Derbyshire. This was a country house in Elizabethan style using [[Diaper (architecture)|diapered]] brick and stone dressings with a clock tower.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hubbard|1991|pp=155–156.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Chester city centre, [[38 Bridge Street, Chester|38&amp;nbsp;Bridge Street]] (1897) is a timber-framed shop that incorporates a section of [[Chester Rows]] and contains heavily decorated carving.&lt;ref name=h166/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pevsner|Hubbard|2003|p=167.}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1892 the partnership designed houses and cottages in [[Port Sunlight]] for [[Lever Brothers]]. Also in the village they designed the [[Dell Bridge, Port Sunlight|Dell Bridge]] (1894), and the school (1894–96), which is now called the [[Lyceum, Port Sunlight|Lyceum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hubbard|1991|pp=168–171.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pevsner|Hubbard|2003|pp=307, 312–313.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In&amp;nbsp;1896 Douglas designed a house for himself, [[Walmoor Hill]] in Dee Banks, Chester, in Elizabethan style.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hubbard|1991|p=188.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pevsner|Hubbard|2003|pp=173–174.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1895 and 1897 he designed a range of buildings on the [[2–18 St Werburgh Street, Chester|east side of St&amp;nbsp;Werburgh Street]] in the centre of Chester. At its south end, on the corner of Eastgate Street, is a bank whose ground storey is built in stone, and behind this leading up St&amp;nbsp;Werburgh Street, the ground storey consists of shop fronts. Above this the range consists of two storeys plus an attic, which are covered in highly ornamented timber-framing. On the first floor is a series of [[oriel window]]s, the second floor is [[Jettying|jettied]], and at the top are eleven gables.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hubbard|1991|pp=189–190.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=470384 |title=Images of England: 2–18&amp;nbsp;St&amp;nbsp;Werburgh&amp;nbsp;St, Chester |publisher=[[English Heritage]] | accessdate= 17&amp;nbsp;May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nikolaus Pevsner|Pevsner]] considers that this range of buildings is &quot;Douglas at his best (though also at his showiest)&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pevsner|Hubbard|2003|p=162.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hubbard expresses the opinion that &quot;in this work, the city's half-timber revival reached its very apogee&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hubbard|1991|p=189.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Stjohnbarmouthfrombeach.jpg|thumb|left|[[St John's Church Barmouth]]|alt=A large church standing before a hillside, with a clerestory and, to the left a tower with a pyramidal roof.]]
During the partnership, work continued on designing new churches and restoring older ones. In 1884–85 a chapel was built at Carlett Park at [[Eastham, Merseyside|Eastham]] in the [[Wirral Peninsula|Wirral]] and in 1884–87 St Deiniol's Church was built in [[Criccieth]], [[Caernarfonshire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hubbard|1991|p=173.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christ Church, Rossett]] (1886–92), [[St Paul's Church, Colwyn Bay]] (1887–88 with later additions), and [[St Andrew's Church, West Kirby]] (1889–91) followed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hubbard|1991|pp=173–177.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pevsner|Hubbard|2003|p=379.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[St John's Church Barmouth|St&amp;nbsp;John's Church]] in [[Barmouth]], [[Merionethshire]] was built between 1889 and 1895. It is one of the largest of Douglas's churches, although in 1891, during its construction, the tower collapsed and had to be rebuilt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hubbard|1991|pp=177–178.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other churches built in North Wales were [[Christ Church, Bryn-y-Maen|Christ Church]] in Bryn-y-Maen, Colwyn Bay, and [[All Saints Church, Deganwy|All Saints]], [[Deganwy]] (both 1897–99).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hubbard|1991|pp=179–181.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In about 1891–92 the [[Church of St James the Great, Haydock|Church of St James the Great]], [[Haydock]], was built.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hubbard|1991|pp=181–182.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was constructed in half-timber to give protection against possible mining subsidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pollard|Pevsner|2006|pp=195–196.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other new churches built during this partnership were [[St Wenefrede's Church, Bickley]] (1892),&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hubbard|1991|p=182.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[St David's Welsh Church, Rhosllannerchrugog|St David's Welsh Church]] in [[Rhosllannerchrugog]], [[Denbighshire]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hubbard|1991|p=262.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[All Saints Church, Higher Kinnerton]] (1893),&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hubbard|1991|p=263.}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Crosby United Reformed Church|Congregational Church]] in [[Great Crosby]] (1897–98),&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hubbard|1991|pp=184, 268.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[St John the Evangelist's Church, Weston]], [[Runcorn]] (1897–1900).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hubbard|1991|pp=183–184.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pevsner|Hubbard|2003|pp=380–381.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A spire was added to [[St Peter's Church, Chester]] in 1886–87 and a tower was added to [[Holy Trinity Church, Capenhurst]] in about 1889–90.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hubbard|1991|p=184.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1886–87 Douglas added a bell tower to [[St John the Baptist's Church, Chester]] and this was followed by the rebuilding of its north aisle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hubbard|1991|pp=184–185.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other restorations, embellishments, and additions of monuments and furniture were carried out in churches during this partnership.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hubbard|1991|pp=185–186.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Douglas &amp; Minshull (1898–1909) and Douglas alone (1909–11)====
[[File:Sandiway St John 1.jpg|thumb|[[St John the Evangelist's Church, Sandiway]]|alt=A church see from the south with a castellated tower at the left, roses and a grassed area in the foreground and trees to the left and beyond]]
In 1898 the firm designed [[St Oswald's Chambers, Chester|St&amp;nbsp;Oswald's Chambers]] in St&amp;nbsp;Werburgh Street, Chester,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hubbard|1991|p=192.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this was followed by further buildings in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hubbard|1991|pp=192–196.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1902–03 Douglas built [[St John the Evangelist's Church, Sandiway|St John the Evangelist's Church]], in the village of his birth, [[Sandiway]]. It was built on land owned by Douglas and he paid for the cost of the chancel and the [[lych gate]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Pevsner and Hubbard 2003 p=333&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hubbard|1991|pp=194–195.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1899 the [[Eastgate and Eastgate Clock|Diamond Jubilee Memorial Clock]], constructed in open [[wrought iron]], was erected on the Eastgate in Chester to commemorate [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria's]] [[Diamond Jubilee]] in 1897.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hubbard|1991|p=196.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1898–1901 [[Public baths, Chester|Chester's public baths]] were built; this was an unusual work for Douglas as it involved specialist engineering work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hubbard|1991|pp=196–197.}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period one of Douglas's most important secular buildings was designed, [[St Deiniol's Library]], at [[Hawarden]], [[Flintshire]], for [[William Ewart Gladstone|W.&amp;nbsp;E.&amp;nbsp;Gladstone]] and his family. The first phase was constructed between 1899 and 1902, and the library was completed in 1904–06.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hubbard|1991|pp=198–200.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around this time the practice was commissioned to work on two churches in association with Gladstone; [[St Ethelwold's Church, Shotton|St&amp;nbsp;Ethelwold's]] (1898–1902) was a new church at [[Shotton, Flintshire|Shotton]] in Flintshire, and additions were made to [[St Matthew's Church, Buckley|St&amp;nbsp;Matthew's]] at [[Buckley]], also in Flintshire, between 1897 and 1905.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hubbard|1991|pp=200–202.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other new churches built during this period were Douglas's only Scottish church, the Episcopal Church (1903) in [[Lockerbie]], [[Dumfriesshire]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hubbard|1991|p=274.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and St&amp;nbsp;Matthew's Church (1910–11) in [[Saltney]], Flintshire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hubbard|1991|pp=202, 276.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hubbard|1986|p=443.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alterations were made and furniture was designed for other churches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hubbard|1991|pp=202–204.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Douglas's last major project was the addition of a tower to his church of [[St Paul's Church, Colwyn Bay|St&amp;nbsp;Paul's]] at Colwyn Bay, but he died before this could be completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hubbard|1991|p=204.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hubbard|1986|p=135.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Publication===

Douglas published no writings of his own and left no records of his ideas and thoughts. The only publication with which he was associated was the ''Abbey Square Sketch Book'', which he edited. The book appeared in three volumes, the first dated 1872 and the others undated; it consisted of sketches and drawings (with some photographs in the third volume) by many contributors. The pictures depicted buildings and furniture, mainly dating from the late medieval period and the 16th and 17th&amp;nbsp;centuries, and mostly from Cheshire and northwest England. Douglas's only contribution was a jointly ascribed plate in the third volume. It is likely that he designed the title pages, or at least the drawing incorporated in it, of the [[Abbey Gateway, Chester|Abbey Gateway]] in [[Chester]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hubbard|1991|pp=11–13.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Douglas practised for the whole of his career in a provincial county town, and most of his works were concentrated in Cheshire and North Wales, yet he &quot;conducted a practice which achieved national renown&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hubbard|1991|p=23.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was never a member of the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]], but his works featured frequently in national publications, including ''Building News'', ''[[Building (magazine)|The Builder]]'', ''The Architect'', and ''The British Architect'', the last of which particularly praised many of his works. A number of Douglas's works were exhibited at the [[Royal Academy]] and appeared in ''Academy Architecture''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hubbard|1991|pp=32–34.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Douglas's obituary in ''The British Architect'' referred to him as having &quot;achieved a reputation which has long placed him in the front rank of living architects&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hubbard|1991|p=34.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the series ''[[Pevsner Architectural Guides|The Buildings of England]]'', [[Nikolaus Pevsner]] described him, without reservation, as &quot;the best Cheshire architect&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pevsner|Hubbard|2003|p=35.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the companion series ''The Buildings of Wales: Clwyd'', [[Edward Hubbard|Hubbard]] expressed the opinion that he was &quot;the most important and active local architect of the period&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hubbard|1986|p=73.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critical praise was not confined to Britain; Douglas's works were acclaimed by the French architect [[Paul Sédille]], and the German architect and writer [[Hermann Muthesius]]. Despite this, the only official recognition he received in his lifetime was a medal for [[Abbeystead House]], which was shown at an exhibition in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hubbard|1991|pp=34, 36.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the architects training and working in Douglas's office were influenced by him. Perhaps the best known of these were [[Edmund Kirby]] and [[Edward Ould]]. Kirby is best remembered for his [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] churches. Ould went on to design a number of buildings in Chester and further afield in a Douglas-like style, including notably [[Wightwick Manor]] and various buildings at [[Port Sunlight]]. Other architects who did not work in his office were also influenced by him; these include [[Thomas Lockwood]], Richard Thomas Beckett, Howard Hignett, A. E. Powers, James Strong and the Cheshire County Architect, Henry Beswick.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hubbard|1991|pp=205–207.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A large proportion of Douglas's buildings still exist, many of them being [[listed building]]s, in a wide variety of types and styles. Douglas is not remembered for any one building type; his churches and houses are considered to be of equal importance. He was not a pioneer of any particular new development, but instead followed national stylistic trends while still retaining his individuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hubbard|1991|pp=209–210.}}&lt;/ref&gt; His buildings are &quot;anything but copyist&quot; and they &quot;bear a highly individual and nearly always recognisable stamp&quot;.&lt;ref name=h74/&gt; The major characteristics of his buildings are &quot;sure proportions, imaginative massing and grouping&amp;nbsp;... immaculate detailing and a superb sense of craftsmanship and feeling for materials&quot;. His work is &quot;architecture which can be enjoyed as well as admired&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hubbard|1991|p=210.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
