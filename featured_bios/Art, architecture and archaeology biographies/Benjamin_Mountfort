'''Benjamin Woolfield Mountfort''' (13 March 1825 – 15 March 1898) was an English emigrant to New Zealand, where he became one of that country's most prominent 19th century architects. He was instrumental in shaping the city of [[Christchurch]]'s unique architectural identity and culture, and was appointed the first official Provincial Architect of the developing province of [[Canterbury, New Zealand|Canterbury]]. Heavily influenced by the [[Anglo-Catholicism|Anglo-Catholic]] philosophy behind early Victorian architecture, he is credited with importing the [[Gothic revival]] style to New Zealand. His Gothic designs constructed in both wood and stone in the province are considered unique to New Zealand. Today he is considered the founding architect of the province of Canterbury.

==Early life==
Mountfort was born in [[Birmingham]], an industrial town in the [[English Midlands|Midlands]] of England, the son of perfume manufacturer and jeweller Thomas Mountfort and his wife Susanna (née Woolfield). As a young adult he moved to London, where he was an early pupil of [[George Gilbert Scott]] (from 1841–46). He also studied architecture under the Anglo-Catholic&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Art of the Sublime|last=Homan|first=Roger|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|year=2006|isbn=978-0-7546-5073-7|page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt; architect [[Richard Cromwell Carpenter]], whose medieval [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] style of design was to have a lifelong influence on Mountfort.&lt;ref name=&quot;Christchurch&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://christchurchcitylibraries.com/heritage/earlychristchurch/benjaminmountfortandthegothicrevival.asp|title=Benjamin Mountfort and the Gothic Revival|publisher=Christchurch Libraries}} Retrieved on 11 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  After completion of his training in 1848, Mountfort practised architecture in London. He married Emily Elizabeth Newman on 20 August 1850, and 18 days later the couple emigrated to New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;Lochhead 1999, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; They were some of the first settlers to the province of Canterbury, arriving on one of the famed [[First Four Ships]], the ''[[Charlotte-Jane]]'' on 16 December 1850.&lt;ref name=&quot;dnzb&quot;&gt;Lochhead 1990&lt;/ref&gt;  These first settlers, known as &quot;The Pilgrims&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://christchurchcitylibraries.com/heritage/earlychristchurch/firstfourships.asp|title=The First Four Ships|publisher=Christchurch Libraries}} Retrieved on 12 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; have their names engraved on marble plaques in [[Cathedral Square, Christchurch|Cathedral Square]], Christchurch, in front of the cathedral that Mountfort helped to design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccc.govt.nz/Parks/FountainsStatues/plaques_9.asp|title=Cathedral Square First Four Ships Commemorative Plaques|publisher=Christchurch City Council}} Retrieved on 13 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mountfort arrived in Canterbury full of ambition and drive to begin designing in 1850 as one of a wave of settlers encouraged to immigrate to the new colony of New Zealand by the British Government.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The 1966 Encyclopedia of New Zealand claims that he studied with [[George Gilbert Scott]] before this.&lt;/ref&gt; With him and his wife from England came also his brother Charles, his sister Susannah, and Charles' wife, all five of them aged between 21 and 26. Life in New Zealand at first was hard and disappointing: Mountfort found that there was little call for architects. Christchurch was little more than a large village of basic wooden huts on a windswept plain. The new émigré's architectural life in New Zealand had a disastrous beginning. His first commission in New Zealand was the Church of the Most Holy Trinity in [[Lyttelton, New Zealand|Lyttelton]], built in 1852. The building proved vulnerable to high winds and was considered unsafe. It was demolished in 1857.&lt;ref&gt;Lochhead 1999, pp. 66–76&lt;/ref&gt; This calamity was attributed to the use of unseasoned wood and his lack of knowledge of the local building materials. Whatever the cause, the result was a crushing blow to his reputation.&lt;ref name=&quot;dnzb&quot; /&gt; A local newspaper called him &quot;...&amp;nbsp;a half-educated architect whose buildings... have given anything but satisfaction, he being evidently deficient in all knowledge of the principles of construction, though a clever draughtsman and a man of some taste.&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Christchurch&quot; /&gt;

Due to this blow to his reputation, he began running a stationery shop, working as a newspaper agent, and giving drawing lessons until 1857 to supplement his architectural work.&lt;ref name=&quot;dnzb&quot; /&gt; It was during this period in the architectural wilderness that he developed a lifelong interest in photography and supplemented his meagre income by taking photographic portraits of his neighbours.&lt;ref name=&quot;encynz1966&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/1966/M/MountfortBenjaminWoolfield/MountfortBenjaminWoolfield/en|editor=Pascoe, Paul; McLintock, A.

Mountfort was a [[Freemasonry|Freemason]] and an early member of the Lodge of Unanimity,&lt;ref name=&quot;freem&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|year=2002|publisher=New Zealand Freemasons|journal=Freemasons' Gazette|volume=30|issue=1|url=http://www.freemasons.co.nz/news/gazette/Vol30_1/feb%20p1-18.pdf|format=PDF|title=Unamity's Jewel|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; the main building of which he designed in 1863.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archived.ccc.govt.nz/HeritageWeek/2002/Saturday19October.asp|title=Christchurch City Council Archives – 18–25 October 2000 Heritage Week|publisher=Christchurch City Council}} Retrieved on 12 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archived.ccc.govt.nz/HeritageWeek/2000/ToursOpenDays.asp|title=Christ Church City Council Archives – 13–20 October 2000 Heritage Week|publisher=Christchurch City Council}} Retrieved on 12 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The Lodge of Unanimity was the first [[Masonic Lodge]] in the [[South Island]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sifreemasons.org.nz/SStPublish/sstar1.htm|publisher=Freemason Southern Star Lodge|title=Celebrating 150 years of English Constitution Freemasonry in New Zealand}} Retrieved on 12 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Return to architecture==
In 1857 he returned to architecture and entered into a business partnership with his sister Susannah's new husband, [[Isaac Luck]]. Mountfort's career received a fillip when he was commissioned to design the St John's Anglican church at [[Waikouaiti]] in Otago. A small timber structure in the Gothic style, it was completed on December the 19th 1858 on land donated by the ex-whaler [[Johnny Jones (pioneer)|Johnny Jones]]. It is still in use as a church, the oldest such structure in southern New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;Porter, 1983, p.166; Otago Daily Times, 19 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Now within the boundaries of the city of [[Dunedin]] its simple pit-sawn timber interior successfully conjures a sense of spirituality.

Christchurch was under heavy development at this time, as it had just been granted city status and was the new administrative capital of the province of Canterbury. This provided Mountfort and Luck ample opportunity to practice their trade. In 1855 they produced a preliminary design for the new [[Canterbury Provincial Council Buildings]] in timber. The buildings were constructed from 1857–59, but in a more limited form than the original design. As the Provincial Council gained new functions with growth in the population and economy of the province, the buildings were enlarged with a North wing in stone and an [[Victoria Clock Tower|iron clock tower]] from 1859–60, and further enlarged with a stone council chamber and refreshment rooms in 1864–65.&lt;ref name=&quot;encynz1966&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lochhead 1999, pp. 93–117&lt;/ref&gt; The buildings today are regarded as one of Mountfort's most important works.&lt;ref name=&quot;dnzb&quot; /&gt; 

From the exterior, the building appears austere, as was much of Mountfort's early work: a central tower dominates two flanking gabled wings in the Gothic revival style.&lt;ref&gt;{{NZHPT|45|Canterbury Provincial Government Buildings|22 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the interior was a riot of colour and medievalism as perceived through Victorian eyes; it included stained glass windows, and a large double-faced clock, thought to be one of only five around the globe. The chamber is decorated in a rich, almost [[John Ruskin|Ruskinesque]] style, with carvings by a local sculptor [[William Brassington]]. Included in the carvings are representations of indigenous New Zealand species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccc.govt.nz/Christchurch/CanterburyProvincialCouncilChambers/History/stonechamberandbellamys.asp|title=Canterbury Provincial Council Buildings: Stone Chamber and Bellamys'|publisher=Christchurch City Council}} Retrieved on 22 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- This high-profile commission may seem surprising, bearing in mind Mountfort's history of design in New Zealand. However, the smaller buildings he and Luck had erected the previous year had impressed the city administrators and there was a dearth of available architects. The resultant acclaim of the building's architecture marked the beginning of Mountfort's successful career. --&gt;

==Gothic architecture==
[[Image:St Augustine's. Waimate. NZ.jpg|thumb|left|300px|St Augustine's Church in [[Waimate]]. Mountfort's Gothic in wood, designed in 1872, has the [[campanile]] of a [[medieval]] cathedral in miniature, neighboured by the roof of a [[Château|chateau]], entered by the [[lychgate]] of an English [[parish church]], all successfully harmonised into a New Zealand landscape.]] 

The Gothic revival style of architecture began to gain in popularity from the late 18th century as a [[Romanticism|romantic]] backlash against the more [[Classicism|classical]] and formal styles which had predominated the previous two centuries.&lt;ref name=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;Lochhead 1999, &quot;Introduction&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of 16, Mountfort acquired two books written by the Gothic revivalist [[Augustus Pugin]]: ''The True Principles of Christian or Pointed Architecture'' and ''An Apology for the Revival of Christian Architecture.'' From this time onwards, Mountfort was a disciple of Pugin's strong Anglo-Catholic architectural values.&lt;ref name=&quot;cent&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christchurchartgallery.org.nz/Exhibitions/1998/Mountfort/|title=B.W. Mountfort and the Gothic Revival: a Centennial Exhibition|publisher=Christchurch Art Gallery}} Retrieved on 25 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  These values were further cemented in 1846, at the age of 21, Mountfort became a pupil of Richard Cromwell Carpenter.&lt;ref name=&quot;dnzb&quot; /&gt;

Carpenter was, like Mountfort, a devout Anglo-Catholic and subscribed to the theories of Tractarianism, and thus to the [[Oxford Movement|Oxford]] and [[Cambridge Movement]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scholars.nus.edu.sg/victorian/religion/tractarian.html|title=The Nineteenth-Century High Church: Tractarianism, the Oxford Movement, and Ritualism|publisher=National University of Singapore}} Retrieved on 26 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  These conservative theological movements taught that true spirituality and concentration in prayer was influenced by the physical surroundings, and that the medieval church had been more spiritual than that of the early 19th century. As a result of this theology, medieval architecture was declared to be of greater spiritual value than the classical [[Palladian architecture|Palladian]]-based styles of the 18th and early 19th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Modern Christian Thought|last=Livingston|first=James C., et al.|publisher=Fortress Press|year=2006|isbn=978-0-8006-3795-8|page=163}}&lt;/ref&gt; Augustus Pugin even pronounced that medieval architecture was the only form suitable for a church and that Palladianism was almost heretical. Such theory was not confined to architects, and continued well into the 20th century. This school of thought led intellectuals such as the English poet [[Ezra Pound]] to prefer [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] buildings to [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] on the grounds that the latter represented an abandonment of the world of intellectual clarity and light for a set of values that centred around hell and the increasing dominance of society by bankers, a breed to be despised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pound|first=Ezra|coauthors=Harriet Zinnes|publisher=New Directions Publishing|year=1980|isbn=978-0-8112-0772-0|title=Ezra Pound and the Visual Arts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whatever the philosophy behind the Gothic revival, in London the 19th-century rulers of the British Empire felt that Gothic architecture was suitable for the colonies because of its then strong Anglican connotations, representing hard work, morality and conversion of native peoples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Architectural Theory|last=Kruft|first=Hanno-Walter|coauthors=Ronald Taylor|publisher=Princeton Architectural Press|year=1996|isbn=978-1-56898-010-2|page=330}}&lt;/ref&gt; The irony of this was that many of Mountfort's churches were for Roman Catholics, as so many of the new immigrants were of Irish origin.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 81&lt;/ref&gt;  To the many middle-class English empire builders, Gothic represented a nostalgic reminder of the parishes left behind in Britain with their true medieval architecture; these were the patrons who chose the architects and designs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Scase|first=Wendy|coauthors=Rita Copeland, David Lawton|title=New Medieval Literatures|volume=1|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0-19-927365-2|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mountfort's early Gothic work in New Zealand was of the more severe Anglican variety as practised by Carpenter, with tall [[lancet window]]s and many [[gable]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;cant&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Canterbury|last=Gardner|first=W.J, et al.|year=1971|isbn=978-0-7233-0321-3|publisher=Whitcombe &amp; Tombs|page=483}}&lt;/ref&gt; As his career progressed, and he had proved himself to the employing authorities, his designs developed into a more European form, with towers, turrets and high ornamental roof lines in the French manner, a style which was in no way peculiar to Mountfort but was endorsed by such architects as [[Alfred Waterhouse]] in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ruskin &amp; Architecture|last1=Daniels|first1=Rebecca|first2=Geoff|last2=Brandwood|year=2003|publisher=Spire Books|isbn=978-0-9543615-1-8|page=172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mountfort's skill as an architect lay in adapting these flamboyant styles to suit the limited materials available in New Zealand.&lt;ref name=&quot;encynz1966&quot; /&gt; While wooden churches are plentiful in certain parts of the USA, they are generally of a simple classic design, whereas Mountfort's wooden churches in New Zealand are as much ornate Gothic fantasies as those he designed in stone. Perhaps the flamboyance of his work can be explained in a statement of principles he and his partner Luck wrote when bidding to win the commission to design Government House, Auckland in 1857:

{{blockquote|Accordingly, we see in Nature's buildings, the mountains and hills; not regularity of outline but diversity; buttresses, walls and turrets as unlike each other as possible, yet producing a graduation of effect not to be approached by any work, moulded to regularity of outline. The simple study of an oak or an elm tree would suffice to confute the regularity theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.architecture.auckland.ac.nz/common/library/1995/11/i4/thehtml/papers/walker/main.htm|last=Walker|first=Paul|title=The 'Maori House' at the Canterbury Museum|publisher=University of Auckland}} Retrieved on 11 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Provincial Architect==

[[Image:Christchurch Cathedral (1).jpg|thumb|right|200px|The construction of [[ChristChurch Cathedral, Christchurch|ChristChurch Cathedral]], designed by [[George Gilbert Scott]], was supervised by Benjamin Mountfort who designed the spire.]] 
[[Image:ChristChurchCathedral1 gobeirne.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The ChristChurch was completed in 1904. Until the 2011 earthquake and the collapse of the spire, the building remained almost unaltered.]] 

As the &quot;Provincial Architect&quot;—a newly created position to which Mountfort was appointed in 1864&lt;ref name=&quot;f1306&quot;&gt;Fletcher, p. 1306&lt;/ref&gt;—Mountfort designed a wooden church for the Roman Catholic community of the city of Christchurch. This wooden erection was subsequently enlarged several times until it was renamed a cathedral.&lt;ref name=&quot;dnzb&quot; /&gt; It was eventually replaced in 1901 by the [[Francis Petre#1904 Cathedral of the Blessed Sacrament.2C Christchurch|Cathedral of the Blessed Sacrament]], a more permanent stone building by the architect [[Francis Petre|Frank Petre]], though the [[cenotaph]] by Mountfort was preserved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christchurchartgallery.org.nz/Publications/1997/PublicArtInChristchurch/appendix5.asp|title=Appendix Five: Religious Art in Central Christchurch Accessible to the Public|publisher=Christchurch Art Gallery}} Retrieved on 4 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  Mountfort often worked in wood, a material he in no way regarded as an impediment to the Gothic style,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Jane|publisher=Grove's Dictionaries|year=1996|title=The Dictionary of Art|isbn=978-1-884446-00-9|page=230}}&lt;/ref&gt; though he was unique in this respect as Gothic buildings were often created from stone and mortar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Architecture, Gothic and Renaissance|last=Smith|first=Thomas R.|isbn=978-1-4367-8070-4|year=2008|publisher=Kessinger Publishing|page=143}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1869 and 1882 he designed the [[Canterbury Museum (New Zealand)|Canterbury Museum]] and subsequently [[University of Canterbury|Canterbury College]] and its clock tower in 1877.&lt;ref name=&quot;dnzb&quot; /&gt;

Construction on the buildings for the Canterbury College, which later became the [[University of Canterbury]], began with the construction of the clock tower block. This edifice, which opened in 1877, was the first purpose built university in New Zealand. The College was completed in two subsequent stages in Mountfort's usual Gothic style.&lt;ref name=&quot;dnzb&quot; /&gt; 

[[George Gilbert Scott]], the architect of [[ChristChurch Cathedral, Christchurch|ChristChurch Cathedral]], and an empathiser of Mountfort's teacher and mentor Carpenter, wished his former pupil Mountfort to be the [[Clerk of Works|clerk of works]] and supervising architect of the new cathedral project.&lt;ref name=&quot;cent&quot; /&gt; This proposal was originally vetoed by the Cathedral Commission.&lt;ref name=&quot;Christchurch&quot; /&gt; Nevertheless, following delays in the building work attributed to financial problems, the position of supervising architect was finally given to Mountfort in 1873. Mountfort was responsible for several alterations to the absentee main architect's design, most obviously the tower and the west [[porch]]. He also designed the [[baptismal font|font]], the Harper Memorial, and the north porch.&lt;ref name=&quot;encynz1966&quot; /&gt; The cathedral was however not finally completed until 1904, six years after Mountfort's death. The cathedral is very much in the European decorated Gothic style with an attached [[campanile]] tower beside the body of the cathedral, rather than towering directly above it in the more English tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://christchurchcitylibraries.com/heritage/Photos/Disc17/IMG0006.asp|title=The Belltower and Spire, ChristChurch Cathedral|publisher=Christchurch Libraries|accessdate=11 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1872 Mountfort became a founding member of the Canterbury Association of Architects, a body which was responsible for all subsequent development of the new city. Mountfort was now at the pinnacle of his career.&lt;ref name=&quot;intro&quot; /&gt; Mountfort notably altered the use of a segmented arch rather than one in the Romanesque style; the latter of which was considered by Augustus Pugin to be fundamentally important to the Gothic style. The college posed a challenge in its main hall; on the hall's completion in 1882, it was the largest public space in Christchurch.&lt;ref&gt;Lochhead 1999, pp. 274–277&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, a level of detail not possible in previous works was present in the hall's design due to the superior funding for the college. The completion of the first stage was met with praise and optimism, though extensions such as a biological lab were added in the early 1890s.&lt;ref&gt;Lochhead 1999, p. 283&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1880s, Mountfort was hailed as New Zealand's premier [[Church (building)|ecclesiastical]] architect, with over forty churches to his credit. 

[[Image:Canterbury Museum1.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Canterbury Museum, designed by Benjamin Mountfort. Completed in 1882, in the style of a French [[Château|chateau]].]]

In 1888, he designed St John's Cathedral in [[Napier, New Zealand|Napier]].&lt;ref name=&quot;dnzb&quot; /&gt; This brick construction was demolished in the disastrous 1931 earthquake that destroyed much of Napier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lochhead|first=Ian|title=A Pitiful Pile of Bricks|journal=Fabrications: the Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians, Australia and New Zealand|year=1997|pages=64–86|volume=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1886 and 1897, Mountfort worked on one of his largest churches, the wooden [[Holy Trinity Cathedral, Auckland#St Mary's Church|St Mary's]], the cathedral church of [[Auckland]]. Covering {{convert|9000|sqft}}, St Mary's is the largest and last timber church built by Mountfort,&lt;ref&gt;Lochhead 1999, p. 174&lt;/ref&gt; and the largest wooden Gothic church in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;dnzb&quot; /&gt; At its completion, it was said that &quot;in point of design, completeness and beauty [it] reaches a high level mark not yet approached in the diocese&quot;. The emphasis placed on the sweeping roof by the great aisle windows struck a balance to the great area the church enclosed. In 1982 the entire church, complete with its stained glass windows, was transported to a new site, across the road from its former position where a new cathedral was to be built. St Mary's church was consecrated in 1898, one of Mountfort's final grand works.&lt;ref&gt;Lochhead 1999, pp. 175–178&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside of his career, Mountfort was keenly interested in the arts and a talented artist, although his artistic work appears to have been confined to art pertaining to architecture, his first love. He was a devout member of the [[Church of England]] and a member of many Anglican church councils and [[diocese]] committees.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, p. 1308&lt;/ref&gt; 

Mountfort's later years were blighted by professional jealousies, as his position as the province's first architect was assailed by new and younger men influenced by new orders of architecture. Benjamin Mountfort died in 1898, aged 73. He was buried in the cemetery of [[Holy Trinity Avonside]], the church which he had extended in 1876.&lt;ref name=&quot;dnzb&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;encynz1966&quot; /&gt;

==Legacy==
[[Image:CanterburyProvincialCouncilBuildings1 gobeirne.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Canterbury Provincial Council Buildings]]. One of Mountfort's earliest New Zealand Gothic buildings, in the style he made his trademark.]]

Evaluating Mountfort's works today, one has to avoid judging them against a background of similar designs in Europe. In the 1860s, New Zealand was a developing country, where materials and resources freely available in Europe were conspicuous by their absence. When available they were often of inferior quality, as Mountfort discovered with the unseasoned wood in his first disastrous project. His first buildings in his new homeland were often too tall, or steeply pitched, failing to take account of the non-European climate and landscape. However, he soon adapted, and developed his skill in working with crude and unrefined materials.&lt;ref name=&quot;encynz1966&quot; /&gt;

[[Image:Sunny Side Asylum.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Sunnyside Hospital|Sunnyside Asylum]], Christchurch. Completed in 1891, this was one of Mountfort's last major works. Designed in a [[chateauesque]] Gothic, the large windows created the air of a [[country house]] rather than place of incarceration.]]

Christchurch and its surrounding areas are unique in New Zealand for their particular style of Gothic architecture, something that can be directly attributed to Benjamin Mountfort. While Mountfort did accept small private domestic commissions, he is today better known for the designs executed for public, civic bodies, and the church. His monumental Gothic stone civic buildings in Christchurch, which would not be out of place in Oxford or Cambridge, are an amazing achievement over adversity of materials. His hallmark wooden Gothic churches today epitomise the 19th-century province of Canterbury. They are accepted, and indeed appear as part of the landscape. In this way, Benjamin Mountfort's achievement was to make his favoured style of architecture synonymous with the identity of the province of Canterbury.&lt;ref name=&quot;cant&quot;/&gt; Following his death, one of his seven children, [[Cyril Mountfort|Cyril]], continued to work in his father's Gothic style well into the 20th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;encynz1966&quot; /&gt; Cyril Mountfort was responsible for the church of &quot;St. Luke's in the City&quot; which was an unexecuted design of his father's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stlukesinthecity.org.nz/building/history.shtml|title=History of St Luke's in the City|publisher=St Luke's in the City}} Retrieved on 14 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, and through the daily public use of his many buildings, Mountfort's legacy lives on. He ranks today with his contemporary [[Robert Lawson (architect)|R A Lawson]] as one of New Zealand's greatest 19th century architects.&lt;ref name=&quot;dnzb&quot; /&gt;
