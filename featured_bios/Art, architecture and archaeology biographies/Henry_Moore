''' Henry Spencer Moore''' [[Order of Merit|OM]] [[Companion of Honour|CH]] [[Fellow of the British Academy|FBA]] (30 July 1898&amp;nbsp;– 31 August 1986) was an [[English people|English]] [[Sculpture|sculptor]] and artist. He was best known for his semi-[[abstract art|abstract]] monumental bronze sculptures which are located around the world as [[Public art|public works of art]].

His forms are usually abstractions of the human figure, typically depicting mother-and-child or reclining figures. Moore's works are usually suggestive of the female body, apart from a phase in the 1950s when he sculpted family groups. His forms are generally pierced or contain hollow spaces. Many interpreters liken the undulating form of his reclining figures to the landscape and hills of his birthplace, [[Yorkshire]].

Moore was born in [[Castleford]], the son of a [[coal miner]]. He became well-known through his carved marble and larger-scale abstract cast bronze sculptures, and was instrumental in introducing a particular form of [[modernism]] to the United Kingdom. His ability in later life to fulfill large-scale commissions made him exceptionally wealthy. Yet he lived frugally and most of the money he earned went towards endowing the [[Henry Moore Foundation]], which continues to support education and promotion of the arts.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.henry-moore-fdn.co.uk/matrix_engine/content.php?page_id=418 Chronology]&quot;.

== Early life ==
Moore was born in [[Castleford]], [[West Yorkshire]], England, to Mary Baker and Raymond Spencer Moore. His father was of Irish origin and became pit deputy and then under-manager of the Wheldale [[Coal mining|colliery]] in Castleford. He was an autodidact with an interest in music and literature.  Determined that his sons would not work in the mines, he saw formal education as the route to their advancement.&lt;ref name =&quot;G15&quot;&gt;Grohmann, 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Henry was the seventh of eight children in a family that often struggled with poverty. He attended infant and elementary schools in Castleford, where he began modelling in [[clay]] and [[wood carving|carving in wood]]. He professed to have decided to become a sculptor when he was eleven after hearing of [[Michelangelo]]'s achievements at a Sunday School reading.

On his second attempt he was accepted at [[Castleford High School Technology and Sports College|Castleford Secondary School]], where his headmaster soon noticed his talent and interest in [[Gothic art|medieval sculpture]],&lt;ref&gt;Grohmann, 15.&lt;/ref&gt; and which several of his siblings had attended. His art teacher broadened his knowledge of art, and, with her encouragement, he determined to make art his career; first by sitting for examinations for a scholarship to the local art college.

Despite his early promise, Moore's parents had been against him training as a sculptor, a vocation they considered manual labour with few career prospects. After a brief introduction as a student teacher, Moore became a teacher at the school he had attended. Upon turning eighteen, Moore volunteered for army service. He was the youngest man in the [[Prince of Wales's Own Civil Service Rifles]] regiment, and was injured in 1917 in a [[Chemical warfare|gas attack]] during the [[Battle of Cambrai (1917)|Battle of Cambrai]].&lt;ref&gt;Henry Moore:Critical Essays; Beckett, Jane; Russell, Fiona. &quot;Henry Moore&quot;. Ashgate, 2003. ISBN 0-7546-0836-0&lt;/ref&gt; After recovering in hospital, he saw out the remainder of the war as a [[physical fitness|physical training]] instructor, only returning to France as the Armistice was signed. In stark contrast to many of his contemporaries, Moore's wartime experience was largely untroubled. He recalled later, &quot;for me the war passed in a romantic haze of trying to be a hero.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson, Alan G. &quot;Henry Moore: Writings and Conversations&quot;.

== Beginnings as a sculptor ==
[[File:Chac Mool1.jpg|thumb|left|A [[Chac Mool]] stone statue at [[Chichen Itza]] site, [[Yucatan Peninsula]], Mexico. This reclining [[Toltec]]-[[Maya civilization|Maya]] figure influenced Moore's sculpture.]]

After the war Moore received an ex-serviceman's grant to continue his education and in 1919 he became a student at the Leeds School of Art (now [[Leeds College of Art]]), which set up a sculpture studio especially for him. At the college, he met [[Barbara Hepworth]], a fellow student who would also become a well-known British sculptor, and began a friendship and gentle professional rivalry that lasted for many years. In Leeds, Moore also had access to the modernist works in the collection of Sir [[Michael Ernest Sadler|Michael Sadler]], the University [[Vice-Chancellor]], which had a pronounced effect on his development.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?artist_id=4071&amp;section_id=T059426 Henry Moore]&quot;. [[Museum of Modern Art]], 2007. Retrieved on 16 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1921, Moore won a scholarship to study at the [[Royal College of Art]] in London, along with Hepworth and other Yorkshire contemporaries. While in London, Moore extended his knowledge of [[primitivism|primitive art]] and sculpture, studying the [[ethnographic]] collections at the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] and the [[British Museum]].

The student sculptures of both Moore and Hepworth followed the standard romantic [[Victorian decorative arts|Victorian]] style, and included natural forms, landscapes and figurative modelling of animals. Moore later became uncomfortable with classically derived ideals; his later familiarity with primitivism and the influence of sculptors such as [[Constantin Brâncuşi]], [[Jacob Epstein]], [[Henri Gaudier-Brzeska]] and [[Frank Dobson (sculptor)|Frank Dobson]] led him to the method of [[Glossary of sculpting|direct carving]], in which imperfections in the material and marks left by tools became part of the finished sculpture. Having adopted this technique, Moore was in conflict with academic tutors who did not appreciate such a modern approach. During one exercise set by [[Francis Derwent Wood|Derwent Wood]] (the professor of sculpture at the Royal College), Moore was asked to reproduce a marble [[relief]] of [[Domenico Rosselli]]'s ''The Virgin and Child''&lt;ref&gt;Allemand-Cosneau, Claude; Fath, Manfred, Mitchinson, David. &quot;Henry Moore&quot;. Nantes: Mus'ee des Beaux Arts, 1996. 63. ISBN 3-7913-1662-1&lt;/ref&gt; by first modelling the relief in [[plaster]], then reproducing it in marble using the mechanical technique of &quot;pointing&quot;. Instead, he carved the relief directly, even marking the surface to simulate the prick marks that would have been left by the pointing machine.

In 1924, Moore won a six-month travelling scholarship which he spent in [[Northern Italy]] studying the great works of [[Michelangelo]], [[Giotto di Bondone]], [[Giovanni Pisano]] and several other [[Old Masters]]. During this period he also visited Paris, took advantage of the timed-sketching classes at the [[Académie Colarossi]], and viewed, in the [[Trocadero]], a plaster cast of a [[Toltec]]-[[Maya civilization|Maya]] sculptural form, the [[Chac Mool]], previously seen in book illustrations. The reclining figure was to have a profound effect upon Moore's work, becoming the primary motif of his sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.henry-moore-fdn.co.uk/matrix_engine/content.php?page_id=383 Henry Moore: Biography 1916-1925]&quot;.

== Hampstead ==
On returning to London, Moore undertook a seven-year teaching post at the Royal College of Art. He was required to work two days a week, which allowed him time to spend on his own work. His first public commission, ''West Wind'' (1928–29), was one of the four 'wind' reliefs high on the walls of [[London Underground]]'s headquarters at [[55 Broadway, London|55 Broadway]].&lt;ref&gt;Cork, Richard. &quot;Art Beyond the Gallery in Early 20th Century England: In Early 20th Century England&quot;. Yale University Press, 1985. 249. ISBN 0-300-03236-6&lt;/ref&gt; The other 'winds' were carved by contemporary sculptors including [[Eric Gill]] with the ground-level pieces provided by [[Epstein]]. In July 1929, Moore married Irina Radetsky, a painting student at the Royal College. Irina was born in [[Kiev]] in 1907 to Russian–Polish parents. Her father did not return from the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]] and her mother was evacuated to Paris where she married a British army officer. Irina was smuggled to Paris a year later and went to school there until she was 16, after which she was sent to live with her stepfather's relatives in [[Buckinghamshire]].

[[File:HenryMoore WestWind.jpg|thumb|''West Wind'', 1928–29; Moore's first public commission was carved from [[Portland stone]] and shows the influence of  [[Michelangelo]]'s figures for the [[Medici Chapel]] and the [[Chac Mool]] figure.]]

Irina found security in her marriage to Moore and was soon posing for him. Shortly after they married, the couple moved to a studio in [[Hampstead]] on Parkhill Road NW3, joining a small colony of [[avant-garde]] artists who were taking root there. Shortly afterward, Hepworth and her second husband [[Ben Nicholson]] moved into a studio around the corner from Moore, while [[Naum Gabo]], [[Roland Penrose]], [[Cecil Stephenson]] and the art critic [[Herbert Read]] also lived in the area (Read referred to the area as &quot;a nest of gentle artists&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;Read, Herbert.

Retrieved on 22 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; This led to a rapid cross-fertilization of ideas that Read would publicize, helping to raise Moore's public profile. The area was also a stopping-off point for many refugee artists, architects and designers from continental Europe en route to America—some of whom would later commission works from Moore.

In 1932, after six year's teaching at the Royal College, Moore took up a post as the Head of the Department of Sculpture at the [[Chelsea School of Art]].&lt;ref&gt;Grohmann, 30.&lt;/ref&gt; Artistically, Moore, Hepworth and other members of The [[Seven and Five Society]] would develop steadily more abstract work,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.tate.org.uk/collections/glossary/definition.jsp?entryId=270 Seven and Five Society]&quot;. [[Tate Britain]]. Retrieved on 4 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; partly influenced by their frequent trips to Paris and their contact with leading progressive artists, notably [[Pablo Picasso]], [[George Braque]], [[Jean Arp]] and [[Alberto Giacometti]]. Moore flirted with [[Surrealism]], joining [[Paul Nash (artist)|Paul Nash]]'s [[modern art]] movement &quot;Unit One&quot;, in 1933. Moore and Nash were on the organizing committee of the International Surrealist Exhibition, which took place in London in 1936. In 1937, [[Roland Penrose]] purchased an abstract 'Mother and Child' in stone from Moore that he displayed in the front garden of his house in Hampstead. The work proved controversial with other residents and the local press ran a campaign against the piece over the next two years. At this time Moore gradually transitioned from direct carving to casting in bronze, modelling preliminary [[maquette]]s in clay or plaster rather than making preparatory drawings.

This inventive and productive period was brought to an end by the outbreak of the Second World War. The Chelsea School of Art evacuated to Northampton and Moore resigned his teaching post. During the war, Moore was commissioned as a war artist, notably producing powerful drawings of Londoners sleeping in the London Underground while sheltering from the Blitz.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.tate.org.uk/magazine/issue2/moore.htm Insight at end of the Tunnel]&quot; [[Tate Modern]]. Retrieved on 16 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; These drawings helped to boost Moore's international reputation, particularly in America. After their Hampstead home was hit by bomb shrapnel in September 1940, he and Irina moved out of London to live in a farmhouse called Hoglands in the hamlet of [[Perry Green, Hertfordshire|Perry Green]] near [[Much Hadham]], [[Hertfordshire]]. This was to become Moore's home and workshop for the rest of his life. Despite acquiring significant wealth later in life, Moore never felt the need to move to larger premises and, apart from the addition of a number of outbuildings and studios, the house changed little over the years.

After the war and following several earlier miscarriages, Irina gave birth to their daughter, Mary Moore, in March 1946.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Henry Moore: The Human Dimension&quot;. HMF Enterprises, 1991. 83. ISBN 0-85331-610-4&lt;/ref&gt; The child was named after Moore's mother, who had died two years earlier. Both the loss of his mother and the arrival of a baby focused Moore's mind on the family, which he expressed in his work by producing many &quot;mother-and-child&quot; compositions, although reclining and internal/external figures also remained popular. In the same year, Moore made his first visit to America when a retrospective exhibition of his work opened at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;Beckett et al., 96.&lt;/ref&gt; From the late 1930s [[Kenneth Clark]] became an unlikely but influential champion of Moore's work,&lt;ref&gt;Beckett et al., 6.&lt;/ref&gt; and through his position as member of the [[Arts Council of Great Britain]] he secured exhibitions and commissions for the artist. In 1948, Moore won the International Sculpture Prize at the [[Venice Biennale]]&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://collection.britishcouncil.org/html/artist/artist.aspx?id=18427 Henry Moore]&quot;. Visual Arts Department, British Council.

Before the war, Moore had been approached by educator [[Henry Morris (education)|Henry Morris]], who was trying to reform education with his concept of the [[Village College]]. Morris had engaged [[Walter Gropius]] as the architect for his second village college at [[Impington Village College|Impington]] near [[Cambridge]], and he wanted Moore to design a major public sculpture for the site. The County Council, however, could not afford Gropius's full design, and scaled back the project when Gropius emigrated to America. Lacking funds, Morris had to cancel Moore's sculpture, which had not progressed beyond the maquette stage.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/lot_details.aspx?from=searchresults&amp;pos=8&amp;intObjectID=5075572&amp;sid= Lot 9, Sale 1994: Family Group]&quot;.

Retrieved on 4 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  Moore was able to reuse the design in 1950 for a similar commission outside a secondary school for the new town of [[Stevenage]]. This time, the project was completed and ''Family Group'' became Moore's first large-scale public bronze.

In the 1950s, Moore began to receive increasingly significant commissions, including a reclining figure&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.unesco.org/artcollection/DetailAction.do?&amp;idOeuvre=1547&amp;nouvelleLangue=en Moore, Henry]&quot;. [[UNESCO]]. Retrieved on 16 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; for the [[UNESCO]] building in Paris in 1958. With many more public works of art, the scale of Moore's sculptures grew significantly and he started to employ an increasing number of assistants to work with him at Much Hadham, including [[Anthony Caro]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/britain/exhibitions/caro/chronology.htm Anthony Caro].

The last three decades of Moore's life continued in a similar vein; several major retrospectives took place around the world, notably a very prominent exhibition in the summer of 1972 in the grounds of the [[Belvedere (fort)|Forte di Belvedere]] overlooking [[Florence]]. Following the pioneering documentary 'Henry Moore', produced by John Read in 1951, he appeared in many films. In 1964, for instance, Moore was featured in the documentary &quot;5 British Sculptors (Work and Talk)&quot; by American filmmaker [[Warren Forma]]. By the end of the 1970s, there were some 40 exhibitions a year featuring his work. The number of commissions continued to increase; he completed ''Knife Edge Two Piece'' in 1962 for [[College Green (London)|College Green]] near the [[Palace of Westminster|Houses of Parliament]] in London. According to Moore, &quot;When I was offered the site near the [[House of Lords]]&amp;nbsp;... I liked the place so much that I didn't bother to go and see an alternative site in [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]]&amp;nbsp;— one lonely sculpture can be lost in a large park.

As his wealth grew, Moore began to worry about his legacy. With the help of his daughter Mary, he set up the Henry Moore Trust in 1972, with a view to protecting his estate from [[Inheritance Tax (United Kingdom)|death duties]]. By 1977, he was paying close to a million pounds a year in [[income tax]]; to mitigate his tax burden, he established the [[Henry Moore Foundation]] as a registered charity with Irina and Mary as trustees. The Foundation was established to encourage the public appreciation of the visual arts and especially the works of Moore. It now runs his house and estate at Perry Green, with a gallery, sculpture park and studios.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, Maev. &quot;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/theguardian/1999/apr/22/features11.g23 A hush falls over Henry Moore country]&quot;.

In Germany, Henry Moore became abruptly known when - in 1979 - his sculpture &quot;Large Two Forms&quot; was installed in the forecourt of the German Chancellery (before the German reunificatioon in October 1990, [[Bonn]] was the capital city of [[Western Germany]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://germanhistorydocs.ghi-dc.org/sub_image.cfm?image_id=2498 http://germanhistorydocs.ghi-dc.org]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Moore turned down a [[knight]]hood in 1951 because he felt that the bestowal would lead to a perception of him as an establishment figure and that &quot;such a title might tend to cut me off from fellow artists whose work has aims similar to mine&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.tate.org.uk/magazine/issue6/moore.htm The Bronze Age]&quot;.

Henry Moore died on 31 August 1986, at the age of 88, in his home in [[Much Hadham]], [[Hertfordshire]] where his body is interred in Perry Green churchyard.

In December 2005, thieves entered a courtyard at the Henry Moore Foundation and stole a bronze sculpture.  Closed-circuit-television footage showed that they used a crane to lower the piece onto a stolen flatbed truck.  The 1969–70 work, known as ''Reclining Figure'' (LH 608) is 3.6 metres long, 2 metres high by 2 metres wide, and weighs 2.1 tonnes.  A substantial reward was offered by the Foundation for information leading to its recovery.  By May 2009, after a thorough investigation, British officials said they believe the work, once valued at £3 million (US$5.3 million), was probably sold for [[scrap metal]], fetching about £5,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Bowcott, Owen|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2005/dec/19/arts.arttheft|title=Lorry used to steal £3m Moore sculpture found on housing estate|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|date=19 December 2005|accessdate=9 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/beds/bucks/herts/4537670.stm|title=£3m Henry Moore sculpture stolen|publisher=[[BBC News Online]]|date=17 December 2005|accessdate=9 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The aftermath of [[World War II]], [[The Holocaust]], and the age of the atomic bomb instilled in the sculpture of the mid-1940s a sense that art should return to its pre-cultural and pre-rational origins. In the literature of the day, writers such as [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] advocated a similar reductive philosophy.&lt;ref name=&quot;C34&quot;&gt;Causey, 34.&lt;/ref&gt; At an introductory speech in New York City for an exhibition of one of the finest [[Modernism|modernist]] sculptors, [[Alberto Giacometti]], Sartre spoke of &quot;The beginning and the end of history&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, Frances. &quot;Paris Post War: Art and Existentialism 1945-55&quot;.

[[File:Stuttgart-henry-moore-liegende.jpg|thumb|left|Moore's bronze &quot;Die Liegende&quot; (located in Stuttgart) is typical of his early reclining figures.]]

Moore's signature form is a reclining figure. Moore's exploration of this form, under the influence of the Toltec-Mayan figure he had seen at the Louvre, was to lead him to increasing abstraction as he turned his thoughts towards experimentation with the elements of design. Moore's earlier reclining figures deal principally with mass, while his later ones contrast the solid elements of the sculpture with the space, not only round them but generally through them as he pierced the forms with openings.

Earlier figures are pierced in a conventional manner, in which bent limbs separate from and rejoin the body. The later, more abstract figures are often penetrated by spaces directly through the body, by which means Moore explores and alternates concave and convex shapes. These more extreme piercings developed in parallel with [[Barbara Hepworth]]'s sculptures.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.tate.org.uk/magazine/issue5/hepworth.htm The Hole of Life]&quot;. ''Tate Magazine'', Issue 5, Autumn 2005. Retrieved on 6 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Hepworth first pierced a torso after misreading a review of one of Henry Moore's early shows. The  plaster ''Reclining Figure: Festival'' (1951) in the [[Tate]], is characteristic of Moore's later sculptures: an abstract female figure intercut with voids. As with much of the post-War work, there are several bronze casts of this sculpture. When Moore's niece asked why his sculptures had such simple titles, he replied, &lt;blockquote&gt; ''&quot;All art should have a certain mystery and should make demands on the spectator. Giving a sculpture or a drawing too explicit a title takes away part of that mystery so that the spectator moves on to the next object, making no effort to ponder the meaning of what he has just seen. Everyone thinks that he or she looks but they don't really, you know.&quot;'' &lt;ref&gt;Day, Elizabeth. &quot;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2008/jul/27/1 The Moore legacy]&quot;.

Moore's early work is focused on [[Glossary of sculpting#direct carving|direct carving]], in which the form of the sculpture evolves as the artist repeatedly whittles away at the block. In the 1930s, Moore's transition into [[modernism]] paralleled that of Barbara Hepworth; the two exchanged new ideas with each other and several other artists then living in Hampstead. Moore made many preparatory [[Sketch (drawing)|sketches]] and drawings for each sculpture. Most of these sketchbooks have survived and provide insight into Moore's development. He placed great importance on drawing; even when he had arthritis, he still was able to draw.&lt;ref&gt;McCave, Lesley. &quot;[http://www.artinfo.com/news/story/25417/la-graphic/ LA Graphic]&quot;.

After the Second World War, Moore's bronzes took on their larger scale, which was particularly suited for public art commissions. As a matter of practicality, he largely abandoned direct carving, and took on several assistants to help produce the larger forms based on maquettes. By the end of the 1940s, he produced sculptures increasingly by modelling, working out the shape in clay or plaster before casting the final work in bronze using the [[Lost-wax casting|lost wax]] technique. These maquettes often began as small forms shaped by Moore's hands—a process which gives his work an organic feeling. They are from the body.
At his home in Much Hadham, Moore built up a collection of natural objects; skulls, driftwood, pebbles, rocks and shells, which he would use to provide inspiration for organic forms. For his largest works, he usually produced a half-scale, working model before scaling up for the final [[Molding (process)|moulding]] and [[casting]] at a bronze [[foundry]]. Moore often refined the final full plaster shape and added surface marks before casting.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.barth.lib.in.us/LargeArch.html Large Arch]&quot;. Bartholomew County Public Library. Retrieved on 22 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Moore produced at least three significant examples of architectural sculpture during his career.  In 1928, despite his own self-described &quot;extreme reservations&quot;, he accepted his first public commission for ''West Wind'' for the [[London Underground]] Building at [[55 Broadway]] in London, joining the company of [[Jacob Epstein]] and [[Eric Gill]].  In 1953, he completed a four-part concrete screen for the Time-Life Building in New Bond Street, London, and in 1955 Moore turned to his first and only work in carved brick, &quot;Wall Relief&quot; at the Bouwcentrum in Rotterdam.  The brick relief was sculptured with 16,000 bricks by two Dutch bricklayers under Moore's supervision.

Most sculptors who emerged during the height of Moore's fame, and in the aftermath of his death, found themselves cast in his shadow. By the late 1940s, Moore was a worldwide celebrity; he was the voice of British sculpture, and of British modernism in general. The next generation was constantly compared against him, and reacted by challenging his legacy, his &quot;establishment&quot; credentials and his position. At the 1952 [[Venice Biennale]], eight new British sculptors produced their ''Geometry of Fear'' works as a direct contrast to the ideals behind Moore's idea of ''Endurance, Continuity''.&lt;ref&gt;Causey, 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet Moore had a direct influence on several generations of sculptors of both British and international reputation. Among the artists who have acknowledged Moore's importance to their work are [[Sir Anthony Caro]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anthonycaro.org/frames-related/biography.htm Caro biography]. anthonycaro.org.

Today, the [[Henry Moore Foundation]] manages the artist's former home at Perry Green in Hertfordshire as a visitor destination, with 70 acres of sculpture grounds as well as his restored house and studios. It also runs the Henry Moore Institute in Leeds which organises exhibitions and research activities in international sculpture. Popular interest in Moore's work was perceived by some to have declined for a while in the UK  but has been revived in recent times by exhibitions including Henry Moore at Tate Britain in 2010 and Moore at Kew and Hatfield in 2007 and 2011 respectively.  The Foundation he endowed continues to play an essential role in promoting contemporary art in the United Kingdom and abroad through its grants and exhibitions programme.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.henry-moore-fdn.co.uk/matrix_engine/content.php?page_id=33 Unfinished Business: Mark Wilsher on view from 26 July]&quot;.
