'''Ima Hogg''' (July 10, 1882 – August 19, 1975),&lt;!-- PLEASE READ WP:MOS; this article does not use autoformatting on dates --&gt; known as &quot;The First Lady of Texas&quot;,&lt;ref name=FirstLady/&gt; was an American [[philanthropy|philanthropist]], patron and collector of the arts, and one of the most respected women in [[Texas]] during the 20th century.&lt;ref name=NYTPhilanthropist/&gt; Hogg was an avid art collector, and owned works by [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]], [[Paul Klee|Klee]], and [[Henri Matisse|Matisse]], among others. Hogg donated hundreds of pieces of artwork to Houston's [[Museum of Fine Arts, Houston|Museum of Fine Arts]] and served on a committee to plan the [[John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts|Kennedy Center]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]  An enthusiastic collector of early American antiques, she also served on a committee tasked with locating historical furniture for the [[White House]]. She restored and refurbished several properties, including the [[Varner–Hogg Plantation State Historical Site|Varner plantation]] and [[Bayou Bend Collection and Gardens|Bayou Bend]], which she later donated to Texas arts and historical institutions who maintain the facilities and their collections today. Hogg received numerous awards and honors, including the [[Louise E. du Pont Crowninshield]] Award from the [[National Trust for Historic Preservation]], the Santa Rita Award from the [[University of Texas System]], and an [[honorary degree|honorary doctorate]] in [[fine art]]s from [[Southwestern University]].

Hogg was the daughter of Sarah Ann &quot;Sallie&quot; Stinson and [[Jim Hogg|James Stephen &quot;Big Jim&quot; Hogg]], later [[Attorney General of Texas]] and [[List of Governors of Texas|Governor]] of the state.  Ima Hogg's first name was taken from ''The Fate of Marvin'', an epic poem written by her uncle [[Thomas Elisha Hogg|Thomas Hogg]]. She endeavored to downplay her unusual name by signing her first name illegibly and having her stationery printed with &quot;I. Hogg&quot; or &quot;Miss Hogg&quot;. Although it was rumored that Hogg had a sister named &quot;Ura Hogg&quot;, she had only brothers. Hogg's father left public office in 1895, and soon after, her mother was diagnosed with [[tuberculosis]]. When Sarah died later that year, Jim Hogg's widowed elder sister moved to [[Austin, Texas|Austin]] to care for the Hogg children. Between 1899 and 1901, Hogg attended the [[University of Texas at Austin]]; she then moved to New York City to study piano and music theory for two years. After her father's death in 1906, she traveled to Europe and spent two years studying music under [[Xaver Scharwenka]] in [[Vienna]]. When she returned to Texas, she established and managed the [[Houston Symphony|Houston Symphony Orchestra]] and served as president of the Symphony Society.

The discovery of [[Petroleum|oil]] on her family's [[plantation]] made Hogg very wealthy, and she used this income to benefit the people of Texas. In 1929, she founded the Houston Child Guidance Center, which provides counseling for disturbed children and their families. Through her brother's will, she established the Hogg Foundation for Mental Health at the University of Texas at Austin in 1940. Hogg successfully ran for a seat on the [[Houston Independent School District|Houston School Board]] in 1943, where she worked to remove gender and race as criteria for determining pay and established art education programs for black students. Hogg never married, and died in 1975. The Ima Hogg Foundation was the major beneficiary of her will, and carries on her philanthropic work today. Several annual awards have been established in her name, honoring her efforts to preserve cultural heritage in Texas.

[[Image:Jim hogg.jpg|thumb|Ima Hogg's father, [[Jim Hogg|James Stephen &quot;Jim&quot; Hogg]] (1851–1906), Governor of Texas]]
After the birth of his only daughter, [[Jim Hogg]] wrote to his brother, &quot;Our cup of joy is now overflowing! We have a daughter of as fine proportions and of as angelic mien as ever gracious nature favor a man with, and her name is Ima!&quot;&lt;ref name=bernhard17&gt;Bernhard (1984), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ima Hogg had no middle name, which was unusual for the time.&lt;ref name=bernhard18&gt;Bernhard (1984), p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;  Her first name was taken from her uncle [[Thomas Elisha Hogg|Thomas Hogg]]'s epic [[American Civil War|Civil War]] poem ''The Fate of Marvin'', which featured two young women named Ima and Leila.&lt;ref name=bernhard18/&gt;&lt;ref name=TSHA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/HH/fho16.html|title=Hogg, Ima|publisher=The Handbook of Texas Online, Texas State Historical Association | date= January 19, 2008|accessdate= March 12, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hogg, Thomas. ''The Fate of Marvin and Other Poems'' (Houston, Texas: E. H. Cushing, 1873).&lt;/ref&gt;   According to Virginia Bernhard's biography of Ima Hogg, &quot;there are some who believe that James Stephen Hogg ... named his only daughter Ima Hogg to attract the attention of Texas voters&quot; in a year when he was running in a close race for [[district attorney]] of the Seventh District in Texas,&lt;ref name=bernhard17/&gt; which he won.&lt;ref&gt;Hendrickson (1995), p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cotner|first=Robert C|title=James Stephen Hogg|publisher=[[Handbook of Texas]]|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/HH/fho17.html |accessdate= March 25, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Alternatively, correspondence from Jim Hogg indicates he may not have been conscious of the combined effect of his daughter’s first and last names.&lt;ref&gt;Kelley (2004), p. 109.  Regarding which parent chose the name, Kelley says it was &quot;given by her father&quot;.  However, an 1899 article published in several newspapers quoted Jim Hogg as saying, &quot;she was named by her mother&quot;.  E.g. see   ''Stevens Point Daily Journal'' (September 9, 1899).&lt;/ref&gt;

Ima Hogg later recounted that &quot;my grandfather Stinson lived fifteen miles [24&amp;nbsp;km] from Mineola and news traveled slowly. When he learned of his granddaughter's name he came trotting to town as fast as he could to protest but it was too late. The christening had taken place, and Ima I was to remain.&quot;&lt;ref name=bernhard18/&gt;  During her childhood, Hogg's elder brother William often came home from school with a bloody nose, the result of defending, as she later recalled, &quot;my good name&quot;.&lt;ref name=bernhard19&gt;Bernhard (1984), p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;  Throughout her adult years, Hogg signed her name in a scrawl that left her first name illegible.  Her personal stationery was usually printed &quot;Miss Hogg&quot; or &quot;I. Hogg&quot;, and she often had her stationery order placed in her secretary's name to avoid questions.  Hogg did not use a nickname until several months before her death, when she began calling herself &quot;Imogene&quot;.  Her last passport was issued to &quot;Ima Imogene Hogg&quot;.&lt;ref name=bernhard19/&gt;

Contrary to popular belief, Ima did not have a sister named Ura.&lt;ref name=hendrickson/&gt;  Texas legend insists that when Jim Hogg ran for re-election as Texas governor in 1892 he often travelled with Ima and a friend of hers and introduced them as his daughters Ima and Ura.  Ima Hogg maintained throughout her life that this never happened.&lt;ref name=bernhard35&gt;Bernhard (1984), p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;  She was frequently forced to dispel the myth; hundreds of people wrote her letters inquiring whether her name was real and if she really had a sister named Ura.&lt;ref name=bernhard19/&gt;  ''[[The Kansas City Star]]'' even invented another sister, Hoosa.&lt;ref name=time&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,753125,00.html|title=Hogg to Texas|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date = November 2, 1931}}  Retrieved on March 14, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1930s, Hogg worked on a collection of her father's papers and speeches with his biographer, historian Robert C. Cotner; she became a guardian of his place in history, often writing to clarify or refute articles published about her father.  According to Bernhard, &quot;the very fact that Ima had been burdened with a name that made a lifetime of explanations necessary also made her anxious to defend her father from all detractors. By doing so, she defended herself as well, and she did so with considerable skill and unfailing politeness.&quot;&lt;ref name=bernhard89&gt;Bernhard (1984), p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ima Hogg has been the source of &quot;unfortunate name&quot; or &quot;worst baby name&quot; jokes, lists, and contests,&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/11/science/11tier.html?em&amp;ex=1205380800&amp;en=ed5eac5a9b454406&amp;ei=5087%0A|title=A Boy Named Sue, and a Theory of Names|author=Tierney, J.

==Early years==
Ima Hogg was born in [[Mineola, Texas|Mineola]], [[Texas]] in 1882 to [[Jim Hogg]] and Sarah Ann &quot;Sallie&quot; Stinson.  She was the second of four children, including brothers William Clifford Hogg (1875–1930), Michael Hogg (1885–1941), and Thomas Elisha Hogg (1887–1949).&lt;ref name=hendrickson&gt;Hendrickson (1995), p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Hogg family had long been active in public service. Her great-grandfather, Thomas Hogg, served in the state legislatures of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Alabama]], and [[Mississippi]]. Her grandfather, Joseph Lewis Hogg, served in the [[Congress of the Republic of Texas]] and helped to write the [[Texas Constitution|Texas State Constitution]].&lt;ref name=bernhard20&gt;Bernhard (1994), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;  At the time of her birth, Hogg's father was the district attorney of the Seventh District in Texas.&lt;ref name=bernhard24/&gt; His term expired in 1884, and the family moved to [[Tyler, Texas|Tyler]], where he practiced law. Two years later, Jim Hogg was elected [[Texas Attorney General]] and the Hogg family moved to the state capital, [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], where Ima began attending [[kindergarten]].&lt;ref name=neely13&gt;Neely (1992), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;  When Jim Hogg was elected the first native-born [[Governor of Texas]] four years later,&lt;ref name=bernhard24&gt;Bernhard (1984), p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Ima accompanied her mother and elder brother to the swearing-in ceremony and inauguration ball in January 1891, thus witnessing the first inauguration in the newly erected [[Texas State Capitol]].&lt;ref name=neely16&gt;Neely (1992), p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; The family moved into the [[Texas Governor's Mansion|Governor's Mansion]]. Built in 1855, the building was in poor condition, with cracked walls and dilapidated furnishings. Ima and her siblings were expected to help renovate the building to a liveable state—she was required, among other things, to pry chewing gum from the furniture and door moldings.&lt;ref name=neely17&gt;Neely (1992), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Texas governors mansion.jpg|thumb|left|The Hogg family lived in the [[Texas Governor's Mansion]] in Austin during Jim Hogg's term as the 20th Governor of Texas.]]

Hogg and her younger brothers were rambunctious. She recalled that they particularly enjoyed sliding down the banisters in the Governor's Mansion. Hogg's parents allowed this to continue until Thomas cut his chin, after which Jim Hogg nailed tacks along the center of the railing to curb the activity through fear of bloodied posteriors; the holes from the tacks remained visible in the banister for many decades after the Hogg family moved from the home.&lt;ref name=bernhard25/&gt; Hogg's mother attempted to teach her ladylike skills such as needlework, but Hogg claimed that she &quot;never had the patience to succeed&quot;.&lt;ref name=bernhard25/&gt;  Her mother also encouraged Hogg to learn [[German language|German]].  Hogg and her siblings were frequently taken to the Millet Opera House in Austin to enjoy the performances.&lt;ref name=bernhard26&gt;Bernhard (1984), p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

The children liked animals, and their menagerie included dogs, cats, birds, raccoons, opossums, rabbits, a Shetland pony and a parrot.&lt;ref name=neely18&gt;Neely (1992), p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;  The children once used their animals to conduct a circus on the grounds of the Governor's Mansion.  Hogg charged each visitor five cents, but was forced to return the money when her father discovered the scheme.&lt;ref name=neely19&gt;Neely (1992), p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;  In later years, the family added a bear, a horse, a fawn, cockatoos, and two ostriches named Jack and Jill to their collection of animals.  In response to a challenge from her brothers, Hogg once mounted one of the ostriches, but was thrown from its back after one of the boys hit it with a slingshot.&lt;ref name=neely29&gt;Neely (1992), p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ima and her ostriches later became the protagonists of a [[picture book]], ''Ima &amp; the Great Texas Ostrich Race'', by Margaret Olivia McManis and Bruce Dupree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Micek, Kassia|url=http://www.hcnonline.com/site/index.cfm?newsid=17241497&amp;BRD=1574&amp;PAG=461&amp;dept_id=532207&amp;rfi=8 |title=Ima Hogg and Texas history are brought to life through lively tales created by a local librarian and children's author| work=The Courier|publisher=Houston Community Newspapers|date=September 25, 2006}} Retrieved on March 25, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Her mother never regained her strength after Thomas's birth, and for the remainder of her life was a semi-invalid.&lt;ref name=bernhard25&gt;Bernhard (1984), p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; Ima accompanied her to several health spas during their years in Austin.&lt;ref name=bernhard28&gt;Bernhard (1984), p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1895, Sarah was diagnosed with [[tuberculosis]], and on the recommendation of her doctor, she and Ima moved to Colorado, where they lived with Jim Hogg's elder sister, Martha Francis Davis.  Sarah Hogg died in Colorado on September 25, 1895.&lt;ref name=bernhard29&gt;Bernhard (1984), p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

Davis accompanied the family to Austin and spent several months caring for Hogg and her brothers.&lt;ref name=bernhard30/&gt; Davis, who had lost her husband to tuberculosis and watched her son fight the disease, believed that Hogg must have contracted the disease from her mother. Davis instructed Ima to never marry so as not to pass on the illness.&lt;ref name=bernhard31/&gt; By the end of 1895, the children had been enrolled in a boarding school in [[San Marcos, Texas|San Marcos]].  The following year, they returned to Austin to live with their father.&lt;ref name=bernhard30&gt;Bernhard (1984), p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the family employed a housekeeper, Hogg was considered the lady of the house and supervised the housecleaning as well as the education of her younger brothers.&lt;ref name=bernhard31&gt;Bernhard (1984), p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1898, Hogg accompanied her father to [[Hawaii]], where they met Hawaiian Queen [[Liliuokalani]] and watched the ceremony that delivered Hawaii to the United States.  The two were scheduled to sail to Seattle, but Hogg refused to board the ship.  Sobbing, she begged her father to make other arrangements because she &quot;had an awful feeling&quot;.&lt;ref name=bernhard43&gt;Bernhard (1984), p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;  He relented and they instead sailed to California, where they learned that their original ship had been lost at sea with no survivors.&lt;ref name=bernhard43/&gt;

==Education and musical interests==
Music was always present at the Hogg household, and Ima began learning to play the piano at age three.&lt;ref name=neely13/&gt; Although her younger brothers attended public school, Ima was enrolled at a private school and received private music lessons.&lt;ref name=neely23&gt;Neely (1992), p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1899, she entered the [[University of Texas at Austin]] (UT),&lt;ref name=neely31/&gt; where her favorite courses were German, Old English, and psychology.&lt;ref&gt;Iscoe (1976), p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; She later remarked that &quot;No freshman was ever more immature, more unprepared, more frightened than I.&quot;&lt;ref name=neely31&gt;Neely (1992), p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;  She joined the female social club known as the Valentine Club, and helped to inaugurate the first [[sorority]] on the UT campus, [[Pi Beta Phi]]. After two years at the university, she moved to New York City to study piano and music theory at the [[National Conservatory of Music of America|National Conservatory of Music]].&lt;ref name=neely31/&gt;

[[Image:Varner Hogg Front Entrance.JPG|thumb|right|Under Ima Hogg's supervision, a new front entrance was created for her home at the Varner plantation.]]

Near the turn of the 20th century, Hogg's father began speculating in oil. He purchased {{convert|4100|acre|km2}} of land near [[West Columbia, Texas|West Columbia]] in 1901, land that had been part of the Varner plantation.&lt;ref name=bernhard44&gt;Bernhard (1984), p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;  After two years of study in New York City, Ima Hogg returned to Texas, dividing her time between the plantation and [[Houston, Texas|Houston]], where her father had a law practice.&lt;ref name=neely32&gt;Neely (1992), p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;  Under her supervision, the house was later remodeled and a portico was added to what had been the back of the house; she made this the new front entrance, orienting the house away from Varner Creek.&lt;ref name=neely60/&gt;

On January 26, 1905, Jim Hogg suffered an injury in a train accident. For the next year Ima nursed him as he struggled to regain his health,&lt;ref name=bernhard48&gt;Bernhard (1984), p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; but on March 3, 1906, she discovered her father dead in his bed.&lt;ref name=bernhard49&gt;Bernhard (1984), p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; Ima was devastated; to quell her grief, her brother William took her to New York City. During her stay she immersed herself in concerts and museums.&lt;ref name=neely35&gt;Neely (1992), p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1907, she vacationed in Germany, and enjoyed her time so much that she chose to remain in Europe to continue her piano studies.&lt;ref name=neely36&gt;Neely (1992), p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;  For the next two years she studied music in Vienna under [[Xaver Scharwenka|Franz Xaver Scharwenka]], pianist to the court of [[Francis Joseph I of Austria]], and in Berlin under [[Martin Krause]].&lt;ref name=bernhard53&gt;Bernhard (1984), p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; After returning from Europe, Hogg settled in Houston with her brother William.&lt;ref name=bernhard54/&gt;&lt;ref name=bernhard56&gt;Bernhard (1984), p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the city had a population of about 100,000, it had no museums or parks and no professional theater, music, or ballet groups.&lt;ref name=bernhad55and56&gt;Bernhard (1984), pp. 55–56.&lt;/ref&gt;  Hogg chose to teach music and continued in this vocation for the next nine years.  One of her first pupils was [[Jacques Abram]], who later became a concert pianist.&lt;ref name = bernhard54/&gt; By 1913, Hogg had become president of the Girls' Musical Society and was on the entertainment committee of the College Women's Club, which organized a small theater group known as the Green Mask Players.&lt;ref name=bernhard56/&gt;  That year, she organized the [[Houston Symphony|Houston Symphony Orchestra]]. Hogg served as the vice-president of the Symphony Society when the first session of the Board of Directors convened.&lt;ref name=bernhard57&gt;Bernhard (1984), p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1917 the Board of Directors requested that she serve as president; she went on to serve 12&amp;nbsp;terms.&lt;ref name = bernhard58/&gt;

==Philanthropist and community leader==
[[File:Ima Hogg cropped.jpg|thumb|right|Hogg and an unidentified woman are seated in a horse-drawn carriage, decorated with flowers for the Tekram parade, part of Houston's No-Tsu-Oh festival.]]
Hogg was affectionately known as &quot;Miss Ima&quot; by those who knew her,&lt;ref name=TSHA/&gt; and widely considered to be &quot;The First Lady of Texas&quot;.&lt;ref name=FirstLady&gt;Iscoe (1976)&lt;/ref&gt; When [[John B. Connally]] was Governor of Texas, his wife [[Nellie Connally|Nellie]] declared, &quot;The Governor's wife is usually called the First Lady of the State, but Ima always has been and always will be the First Lady of Texas.&quot;&lt;ref name=NYTPhilanthropist/&gt;  In 1957, ''The New York Times'' featured prominent Texans in a series about high society, stating: &quot;But one social figure celebrated throughout the state and even beyond its border is Miss Ima Hogg. She is now about 80 but still a civic beacon of Houston.&quot;&lt;ref name=NYTStrata&gt;{{Cite news | last = Hill | first = Gladwin | title = Metropolises of State Lay Claim to All the Appurtenances of Older Traditions with Emphasis on Well-Defined Strata | work = The New York Times | pages = 31–32 | date = February 11, 1957 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After their father's death in 1906, Hogg and her brothers tried to sell the Varner plantation, but a provision in his will specified that the land be kept for 15&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref name=bernhard65&gt;Bernhard (1984), p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;  On January 15, 1918, oil was found on the Varner plantation.&lt;ref name=neely59&gt;Neely (1992), p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;  A second strike the following year provided oil income amounting to $225,000 a month shared among the four siblings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kelley&quot;&gt;Kelley (2004), pp. 49–50.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Hogg biographer Gwendolyn Cone Neely, the Hoggs did not believe that the oil money was rightfully theirs, as it had come from the land and not hard work, and they were determined to use it for the good of Texas.&lt;ref name=neely60&gt;Neely (1984), p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hogg founded the Houston Child Guidance Center in 1929 to provide counseling for disturbed children and their families.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kelley&quot; /&gt;  Hogg was convinced that if children's emotional and mental problems were treated, more serious illness could be prevented in adults.&lt;ref name=neely70&gt;Neely (1992), p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;  Her interest in mental health came from her father, who had read widely on mental health issues; during his terms as governor, Ima had often accompanied him on visits to state institutions, including charity hospitals and asylums for the mentally ill.&lt;ref name=neely24&gt;Neely (1992), p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;  She furthered her knowledge of the field while she was a student at UT, taking several courses in psychology.&lt;ref name=bernhard4&gt;Bernhard (1984), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Ima was convinced that her youngest brother, Tom, would have benefited from similar intervention, as he had reacted badly after their mother's death and as an adult was &quot;restless, impulsive, and alarmingly careless with money&quot;.&lt;ref name=bernhard88&gt;Bernhard (1984), p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; Although her ideas on mental health would be considered mainstream today, in 1929 they were pioneering.&lt;ref name=neely71&gt;Neely (1992), p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1972, she told the ''[[Houston Chronicle]]'' that, of all her activities, she had derived most pleasure from her role in establishing the Houston Child Guidance Center.&lt;ref name=bernhard3&gt;Bernhard (1984), p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hogg had previously suffered from mental health problems. In late 1918, she fell ill, probably from severe depression.&lt;ref name=bernhard59&gt;Bernhard (1984), p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;  She consulted with Dr. [[Francis Xavier Dercum]], a specialist in the treatment of nervous and mental diseases, who treated her for the next three years.&lt;ref name=bernhard60&gt;Bernhard (1984), p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt;  She was hospitalized for more than a year, and spent a further three years convalescing, primarily in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref name=bernhard54&gt;Bernhard (1984), p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = bernhard62/&gt;  By the summer of 1923 Hogg was fully recovered,&lt;ref name=bernhard62/&gt; but she permanently discarded her dream of being a concert pianist, ostensibly because of weakness after her illness.&lt;ref name=bernhard54/&gt;

Hogg joined her elder brother William on a vacation in Germany in 1930.  During their visit, he suffered a gallbladder attack and died on September 12, 1930 after emergency surgery. Ima brought her brother's body back to the United States.&lt;ref name=neely71/&gt;  His will bequeathed $2.5&amp;nbsp;million to UT; his desire was that it be used alongside money donated by his sister for &quot;far-reaching benefit to the people of Texas&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kelley&quot;/&gt; Legal challenges tied up the grant until 1939, when the University received $1.8&amp;nbsp;million. In 1940, after discussion with her brother Michael—the executor of the will—Hogg used the money to establish the Hogg Foundation for Mental Health at the University of Texas at Austin.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kelley&quot; /&gt;

The ''[[San Antonio Express-News|San Antonio Express]]'' reported in 1939 that the funds granted to the Hogg Foundation for Mental Health would be used to establish mental hygiene clinics and conduct lectures and teacher training courses across Texas, for mental health research, and to survey mental hygiene conditions in Texas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hogg Fund to Go for State Health Program, Head of College Says|work=San Antonio Express|date=July 20, 1939}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the entry of the United States into [[World War II]], the Foundation researched methods to prevent mentally unsuitable candidates from enlisting in the military, and provided counseling to those traumatized by the war. After the war, the Foundation expanded its educational and philanthropic focus, providing mental health care to the poor and the aged.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kelley2&quot;&gt;Kelley (2004), pp. 54–57.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Foundation continues to award five $5,000 annual scholarships to individuals pursuing a [[Master of Social Work|Master's degree in Social Work]].&lt;ref name=Found&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hogg.utexas.edu/funding_imascholar.html|title=Ima Hogg Scholarships in Mental Health|publisher=Hogg Foundation for Mental Health|accessdate= March 12, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1943, Hogg decided to run for a seat on the [[Houston Independent School District|Houston School Board]] so that the board would include two female members.&lt;ref name = neely75/&gt;  Hogg won with 4,350&amp;nbsp;votes, more than 1,000 ahead of the runner-up.&lt;ref name=bernhard90&gt;Bernhard (1984), p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt;  During her term, she worked to remove gender and race as criteria for determining pay.&lt;ref name=winegarten&gt;Winegarten (1993), p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; She championed a visiting teacher program for children with emotional problems&lt;ref name=bernhard90/&gt; and began art education programs in the schools for black students.&lt;ref name = neely75/&gt;  Hogg declined to run for a second term.&lt;ref name=neely75/&gt;

===Furniture and art collector===
Hogg and her brothers were avid art collectors; she owned a large collection, including [[Native Americans in the United States#Society and art|Native American art]] and works by [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]], [[Marc Chagall|Chagall]], [[Henri Matisse|Matisse]] and [[Amedeo Modigliani|Modigliani]].&lt;ref name=NYTDame/&gt;  Her interest in collecting began during her convalescence in Philadelphia.&lt;ref name=bernhard62&gt;Bernhard (1984), p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;  Her first purchase, in 1922, was a Spanish foot chair or [[Queen Anne Style architecture|Queen Anne]] maple chair with carved feet.&lt;ref name=bernhard63&gt;Bernhard (1984), p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bernhard104&gt;Bernhard (1984), p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt;  She researched the early American furniture market extensively, personally visiting [[Luke Vincent Lockwood]], the author of the standard work on the topic, for more information.&lt;ref name=bernhard104/&gt;  At the time, Hogg was one of a small number of people who believed that American antiques had value—by contrast, most collectors concentrated on furniture built in Europe.&lt;ref name=bernhard101&gt;Bernhard (1984), p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt; Other collectors soon saw the value in early American pieces.  Hogg remained one of the few collectors not located on the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]].  As her collection grew, she was often asked to loan pieces for exhibit in [[New England]]; Hogg always refused, stating &quot;they've got plenty of these things up there&quot;.&lt;ref name = bernhard9/&gt;

[[Image:BroncoBusterRemingtonSculpture.gif|thumb|left|Ima Hogg donated works she inherited from her brothers to [[Museum of Fine Arts, Houston|Houston's Museum of Fine Arts]], including one of the limited editions of ''[[Bronco Buster]]'' by [[Frederic Remington]].&lt;ref name=neely75/&gt;]]

In the 1920s, Hogg's brothers began to develop a new elite neighborhood, which they called [[River Oaks, Houston, Texas|River Oaks]], on the outskirts of Houston.&lt;ref name=bernhard77&gt;Bernhard (1984), p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt;  For their home, the Hoggs chose the largest lot, {{convert|14.5|acre|ha}}.  Ima worked closely with architect [[John F. Staub|John Staub]] to design a house that would show off the art the family had purchased.&lt;ref name=bernhard78&gt;Bernhard (1984), p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bernhard80&gt;Bernhard (1984), p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;  William and Ima moved into the house, which she christened [[Bayou Bend Collection and Gardens|Bayou Bend]], in 1928.&lt;ref name=bernhard80/&gt;  In 1939, when she restored her estate along American lines,&lt;ref name=NYTDame/&gt; she donated more than 100&amp;nbsp;works on paper to Houston's [[Museum of Fine Arts, Houston|Museum of Fine Arts]] (MFAH), including works by [[Paul Cézanne|Cézanne]], [[John Singer Sargent|Sargent]], [[Picasso]], and [[Paul Klee|Klee]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MFAH&quot;/&gt; Following the death of her brother Michael in 1941, she donated his collection of [[Frederic Remington]] works to the museum. Consisting of 53 oil paintings, 10&amp;nbsp;watercolors, and one bronze, it is known as the Hogg Brothers Collection, and is &quot;one of the most important groupings of Western paintings on display in an American museum&quot;, according to Hogg biographer Neely.&lt;ref name=neely75&gt;Neely (1992), p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; Hogg donated her collection of Native American art to MFAH in 1944,&lt;ref name=&quot;MFAH&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfah.org/archives/pdf/mfah_chronology.pdf |publisher=Houston Museum of Fine Arts |title=Chronology of Events in MFAH History |format=PDF|accessdate= March 13, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; including 168 pieces of pottery, 95 pieces of jewelry, and 81&amp;nbsp;paintings.&lt;ref name=bernhard10&gt;Bernhard (1984), p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1960, she was appointed by [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|President Eisenhower]] to serve on a committee to plan the National Cultural Center, now called the [[John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts|Kennedy Center]], in [[Washington, D.C.]]&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimes Sep 25 1960&quot;&gt;{{Cite news | work = The New York Times | title = President Names 13 To Arts Committee | page = 71 | date = September 25, 1960}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961,  [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis|Jacqueline Kennedy]] named Hogg to the 18-member advisory committee to work with the Fine Arts Committee in seeking historical furniture for the [[White House]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimes Apr 18 1961&quot;&gt;{{Cite news | work = The New York Times | title = First Lady Names A Fine Arts Group | page = 42 | date = April 18, 1961}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Restorations===
Although Hogg spent little time at the Varner plantation after Bayou Bend was constructed, she continued to purchase art and antique furniture on its behalf.&lt;ref name=bernhard98&gt;Bernhard (1984), p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1950s, she restored the plantation, and each room was given a different theme from [[history of Texas|Texas history]]: [[Mexican Texas|colonial times]], [[Texas in the Civil War|the Confederacy]], [[Napoleon]]ic times (1818), and the [[Mexican-American War|Mexican–American War]]. One room was dedicated to her father, and contained his desk and chair as well as his collection of walking sticks.&lt;ref name=bernhard99&gt;Bernhard (1984), p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; She donated the property to the state, and it was dedicated as the [[Varner–Hogg Plantation State Historical Site]] in 1958, the 107th anniversary of Jim Hogg's birth.&lt;ref name=bernhard51&gt;Bernhard (1984), p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:BayouBendHome.JPG|thumb|right|Ima Hogg helped to design [[Bayou Bend Collection and Gardens|Bayou Bend]], which is now a museum operated by the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Houston|Houston's Museum of Fine Arts]].]]

As the Varner–Hogg restoration wound to a halt, Hogg refocused her attention on her Houston home, Bayou Bend,&lt;ref name=neely82&gt;Neely (1992), p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; which housed some of her personal collection of antiques and artwork.&lt;ref name=winegarten/&gt;  ''The New York Times'' described her &quot;superb Early American furniture&quot; collection in 1953,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Louchheim | first = Aline B| |authorlink=Aline B. Louchheim |title = Art in Our Great Southwest | work = The New York Times | page = 14 | date = December 13, 1953}}&lt;/ref&gt; and she had a large collection of [[Americana]] and colonial Mexican decorative arts, some of which are still in the house.&lt;ref&gt;Warren in ''The Grandeur of Viceregal Mexico'', pp. 69–75.&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1950s she said: &quot;I had been collecting American furniture.  I collected, and collected, and collected, until I had so much of it I didn't know what to do with it.  I decided to give it to a museum.&quot;&lt;ref name=bernhard2&gt;Bernhard (1984), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;  She collaborated with the original architect John Staub on structural changes that would prepare the home to be a museum.&lt;ref name=bernhard116&gt;Bernhard (1984), p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt;  She denuded the home of personal items and items that did not meet her concept; the only piece of non-American furniture in the home was her English dining table, which had too many memories for her to remove it.&lt;ref name=neely83&gt;Neely (1992), p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several residents of River Oaks sued to prevent Bayou Bend becoming a museum, but Hogg prevailed in court.&lt;ref name = bernhard114/&gt;  To alleviate the residents' concerns over increased traffic, she asked the city of Houston to build a footbridge over [[Buffalo Bayou]] so that visitors could reach the house without having to drive through River Oaks.&lt;ref name=neely82/&gt;  In the fall of 1965, Hogg moved out of her home,&lt;ref name=neely83/&gt; telling the [[docent]]s that &quot;When you love something enough it's easy to give it up in order to see it go on.&quot;&lt;ref name=neely84&gt;Neely (1992), p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;  The MFAH opened the new museum to the public in 1966 as MFAH's Bayou Bend Collection and Gardens.&lt;ref name=MFAH&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mfah.org/bayoubend/main.asp?target=home| title=Bayou Bend: A Unique Collection of American|publisher=Museum of Fine Arts, Houston|accessdate= March 12, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  At its dedication, Charles Montgomery, a Senior Research Fellow at the [[Henry Francis DuPont Winterthur Museum]], called Bayou Bend &quot;the largest, finest collection this side of Winterthur&quot;.&lt;ref name=bernhard9&gt;Bernhard (1984), p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1963, Hogg purchased property near [[Round Top, Texas|Round Top]], hoping to move its historic building to Bayou Bend.  When that plan proved impractical, she decided to restore it in place and temporarily moved to Round Top.&lt;ref name=neely86&gt;Neely (1992), p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=neely87&gt;Neely (1992), p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;  After personally supervising the restoration of the Winedale Inn, a [[stagecoach]] inn near Round Top, Hogg donated the property to the University of Texas at Austin.  Known as the Winedale Historical Center, it is used primarily as an outdoor museum and music center,&lt;ref name=winegarten/&gt; and annually hosts [[Shakespeare at Winedale]].  In 1969, she restored her parents' house in [[Quitman, Texas|Quitman]]; the town renamed it the Ima Hogg Museum in her honor.&lt;ref&gt;Burlingame (2004), p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt; The museum holds items from the history of [[Wood County, Texas|Wood County]] and northeast Texas.&lt;ref&gt;Parent (2004), p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt;  She later restored the home of her maternal grandfather and had it moved to the park.&lt;ref name=neely81&gt;Neely (1992), p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description and disposition==
David Warren, the first curator of Bayou Bend, said Hogg was &quot;small and dainty and feminine—and smart and sharp and knowledgeable—all rolled into one&quot;.&lt;ref name=bernhard14&gt;Bernhard (1984), p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;
Her biographer Bernhard described her as &quot;elegantly and stylishly dressed&quot;, 5&amp;nbsp;feet 2&amp;nbsp;inches (157&amp;nbsp;cm) tall and of fair complexion,&lt;ref name=bernhard7&gt;Bernhard (1984), p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;independent and self-possessed&quot;&lt;ref name=bernhard58/&gt; and noted that she could &quot;sugarcoat her single-mindedness with layers of charm&quot;.&lt;ref name=bernhard12&gt;Bernhard (1984) p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;  At the age of 81, she was described by ''The New York Times'' as a &quot;blue-eyed strawberry blonde&quot;.&lt;ref name=NYTDame&gt;{{Cite news | last = Curtis  | first =  Charlotte | title = A Grande Dame Comes Here From Texas to Promote Culture | work = The New York Times | page = 32 | date = March 4, 1964}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One morning in 1914,&lt;ref name=bernhard58/&gt; Hogg was awakened by a burglar in her bedroom. She confronted the man, who was attempting to steal her jewelry, and not only convinced him to return the jewelry, but &quot;wrote down a name and address, handed it to him and told him to go there that very day to get a job&quot;.&lt;ref name=iscoe17/&gt;  When asked why she did that, Hogg responded, &quot;He didn't look like a bad man.&quot;&lt;ref name=iscoe17&gt;Iscoe (1976), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;  Later that year, she sailed to Germany, alone.  While she was en route, [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria]] was assassinated, and the day before she arrived, Britain declared war on Germany. The United States was still neutral, however, so Hogg continued her tour of Europe, not leaving until several months later.&lt;ref name=bernhard58&gt;Bernhard (1984), p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though Bernard describes Hogg as a woman of &quot;unfailing politeness&quot;,&lt;ref name=bernhard89/&gt; the biographer suggests the philanthropist was not without adversaries. For instance, at a concert arranged by the Houston Symphony for her 90th birthday featuring the elderly pianist [[Arthur Rubinstein]],&lt;ref name=winegarten/&gt; he characterized her as a &quot;tiresome old woman&quot;. Hogg, in turn, regarded the musician as &quot;a pompous old man&quot;. By contrast, Hogg said of [[Vladimir Horowitz]], whom she met backstage at a 1975 concert in Houston, &quot;Such a nice man. Not at all like that Mr. Rubinstein.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Bernhard (1984), pp. 5–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hogg was a generous benefactor, and believed that &quot;inherited money was a public trust&quot;.  She was described by the [[University of Houston]] as &quot;compassionate by nature&quot;, &quot;progressive in outlook&quot;, &quot;concerned with the welfare of all Texans&quot;, a &quot;zealous proponent of mental health care&quot; and &quot;committed to public education&quot;.&lt;ref name=uhcoe&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.fm.coe.uh.edu/comparisons/ima3a.html|title =
The Life of Ima Hogg: The Philanthropist | publisher = University of Houston, College of Education|accessdate= March 17, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hogg was a lifelong [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]].&lt;ref name=bernhard89/&gt;

==Death==
Hogg died on August 19, 1975, at the age of 93, from a heart attack resulting from [[atheroma]]. She had been vacationing in [[London]] at the time, but fell as she was getting into a taxi, and died a few days later in a London hospital. An autopsy report revealed that her death was not related to the earlier fall.&lt;ref name=NYTPhilanthropist&gt;{{Cite news | publisher = Associated Press | title = Texas's Ima Hogg, Philanthropist | work = The New York Times | url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F00D1EFD3C5A1A7493C3AB1783D85F418785F9 | page = 38 | date = August 21, 1975|accessdate= July 23, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | publisher = Associated Press | title = Ima Hogg a Heart Victim | work = The New York Times | page =  24 | date =August 23, 1975}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On receiving news of her death, the University of Texas declared two days of mourning and flew the flag at half-staff.&lt;ref name=Bernhard15&gt;Bernhard (1984), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of her death, Hogg had employed her personal maid, Gertrude Vaughn, for 56&amp;nbsp;years, and her butler-chauffeur, Lucious Broadnax, for over 40&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref name=Bernhard15/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bernhard (1984), p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;  She is buried next to her family in the [[Oakwood Cemetery (Austin, TX)|Oakwood Cemetery]] in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]].&lt;ref name=Bernhard15/&gt; Hogg's work lives on through the Ima Hogg Foundation, which she founded in 1964 and which was the major beneficiary of her will.&lt;ref name=TSHA/&gt;
Hogg never married; her biographer Bernhard reports that she told a friend &quot;she had gotten over 30 proposals of marriage but 'wouldn't have any of them'&quot;.&lt;ref name=bernhard87&gt;Bernhard (1984), p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards, recognition and legacy==
[[Image:BayouBendClioGarden.JPG|thumb|right|View of the gardens at Bayou Bend]]
Hogg received many awards for her contributions to the community. The Garden Club of America honored her in 1959 with the Amy Angell Colliers Montague Model for Civic Achievement.&lt;ref name=bernhard121&gt;Bernhard (1984), p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1966, she was honored at the 20th annual awards banquet of the [[National Trust for Historic Preservation]].  She received the seventh annual [[Louise E. du Pont Crowninshield|Louise du Pont Crowninshield]] Award&lt;ref&gt;Cramer (2005), p. 454.&lt;/ref&gt;—the highest award given by the National Trust for Historic Preservation—for &quot;superlative achievement in the preservation, restoration and interpretation of sites, buildings, architecture, districts, and objects of national historical or cultural significance&quot; in Texas.&lt;ref name=bernhard129&gt;Bernhard (1984), p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968, Hogg became the first recipient of the Santa Rita Award—the highest award given by the [[University of Texas System]]&lt;ref name=bernhard129/&gt;—for contributions to higher education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.utsystem.edu/bor/history.htm

Her restoration work was recognized by many organizations. The [[American Society of Interior Designers|National Society of Interior Designers]] named her to their International Honors List in 1965 and in 1972 presented her with their Thomas Jefferson Award for her contributions to cultural heritage.&lt;ref name=bernhard130/&gt;  The Texas State Historical Survey Committee recognized Hogg in 1967 for her &quot;meritorious service in historic preservation&quot;&lt;ref name=bernhard114&gt;Bernhard (1984), p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt;  and the American Association of State and Local History gave her an award of merit in 1969.&lt;ref name=bernhard130/&gt;

The Houston Symphony established a scholarship in Hogg's name,&lt;ref name=bernhard92&gt;Bernhard (1984), p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; honored her on her 90th birthday with a special concert,&lt;ref name=winegarten/&gt; and holds an annual Ima Hogg Young Artist Competition for musicians between the ages of 16 and 29 who perform on [[Orchestra#Instrumentation|orchestral instruments]] or the piano.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.houstonsymphony.org/education/competitions.aspx |publisher=Houston Symphony |title=Houston Symphony Ima Hogg Young Artist Competition|accessdate= March 17, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Center for American History at the University of Texas at Austin presents an annual Ima Hogg Award for Historical Achievement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cah.utexas.edu/exhibits/WinedaleStory/blue5.html |publisher=Center for American History at the University of Texas at Austin  |title=The Winedale Story|accessdate= March 17, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She was a National Patroness of [[Delta Omicron]], an international professional music fraternity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://delta-omicron.org/national/patrons.html| title= National Patrons and Patronesses |publisher= Delta Omicron |accessdate=April 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mental Health Association of Greater Houston presents an annual Ima Hogg Award &quot;to an individual or couple who have advanced mental health causes&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mhahouston.org/mha_houston.cfm?a=cms,c,44,5,28|publisher=Mental Health Association of Greater Houston |title=Treasures of Texas Gala|accessdate= March 17, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1963, former Governor of Texas [[Allan Shivers]]—when presenting Hogg with the Distinguished Alumnus Award of the [[Texas Exes|University of Texas Ex-Students Association]] (the first woman so honored)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.texasexes.org/involved/daa.asp | title = Distinguished Alumnus Award | publisher = [[Texas Exes]] | year = 2007|accessdate= March 22, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;—said of &quot;Miss Ima&quot;:&lt;center&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Some persons create history.&lt;br&gt;Some record it. &lt;br&gt;Others restore and conserve it.&lt;br&gt;She has done all three.&lt;ref name=NYTPhilanthropist/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
