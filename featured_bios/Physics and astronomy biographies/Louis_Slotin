'''Louis Alexander Slotin''' (1 December 1910 – 30 May 1946) was a [[Canadians|Canadian]]  [[physicist]] and [[chemist]] who took part in the [[Manhattan Project]], the secret US program during [[World War II]] that developed the [[atomic bomb]].

As part of the Manhattan Project, Slotin performed experiments with [[uranium]] and [[plutonium]] [[plutonium core|cores]] to determine their [[critical mass]] values. After World War II, Slotin continued his research at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]]. On 21 May 1946, Slotin accidentally began a [[fission reaction]], which released a burst of [[hard radiation]]. He was rushed to a hospital, and died of [[radiation sickness]] nine days later on 30 May, the second victim of a [[criticality accident]] in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cddc.vt.edu/host/atomic/accident/critical.html |title=Criticality Accidents |publisher=Cddc.vt.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Slotin was hailed as a hero by the United States government for reacting quickly enough to prevent the deaths of his colleagues due to the accident he caused. The accident and its aftermath have been dramatized in fictional accounts.

== Early life ==
Slotin was the first of three children born to Israel and Sonia Slotin, [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]]-speaking refugees who had fled the [[pogrom]]s of [[Russia]] to [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]].&lt;ref name=&quot;zeilig22&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Zeilig |first=Martin |year=1995 |month=August/September |title=Louis Slotin And 'The Invisible Killer' |journal=The Beaver |volume=75 |issue=4 |pages=20–27 |url=http://www.mphpa.org/classic/FH/LA/Louis_Slotin_1.htm |accessdate=2008-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; He grew up in the North End neighborhood of Winnipeg, an area with a large concentration of [[Eastern Europe]]an immigrants. From his early days at Machray Elementary School through his teenage years at [[St. John's High School (Winnipeg)|St. John's High School]], Slotin was academically exceptional. His younger brother, Sam, later remarked that his brother &quot;had an extreme intensity that enabled him to study long hours.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;zeilig22&quot;/&gt;

At the age of 16, Slotin entered the [[University of Manitoba]], to pursue a degree in science. During his undergraduate years, he received a University Gold Medal in both physics and chemistry. Slotin received a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in [[geology]] from the university in 1932 and a [[Master of Science]] degree in 1933. With the assistance of one of his mentors, he obtained a fellowship to study at [[King's College London]], under the supervision of [[Arthur John Allmand]],&lt;ref name=&quot;zeilig22&quot;/&gt; the chair of the chemistry department, who specialized in the field of applied [[electrochemistry]] and [[photochemistry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= |first= |year=1951 |month= |title=In memoriam: Arthur John Allmand, 1885–1951 |journal=[[Faraday Transactions|Journal of the Chemical Society, Faraday Transactions]] |volume=47 |issue= |pages=X001–X003 |url=http://www.rsc.org/delivery/_ArticleLinking/DisplayArticleForFree.cfm?doi=TF951470X001&amp;JournalCode=TF |doi= 10.1039/TF951470X001|accessdate= 2007-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== King's College ===
While at King's College, Slotin distinguished himself as an [[amateur boxing|amateur boxer]] by winning the college's amateur bantamweight boxing championship. Later, he gave the impression that he had fought for the [[Second Spanish Republic|Spanish Republic]] and flown experimental fighter jets with the [[Royal Air Force]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Obit&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Anderson |first=H.

=== University of Chicago ===
In 1937, after he unsuccessfully applied for a job with Canada's [[National Research Council of Canada|National Research Council]], the [[University of Chicago]] accepted him as a research associate. There, Slotin gained his first experience with nuclear chemistry, helping to build the first [[cyclotron]] in the midwestern United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;science.ca&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title = science.ca Profile: Louis Slotin| publisher = GCS Research Society | author = | date = 2007-11-07 | url = http://www.science.ca/scientists/scientistprofile.php?pID=290&amp;pg=0| accessdate = 2007-11-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The job paid poorly and Slotin's father had to support him for two years. From 1939 to 1940, Slotin collaborated with [[Earl Evans (scientist)|Earl Evans]], the head of the university's biochemistry department, to produce radiocarbon ([[carbon-14]] and [[carbon-11]]) from the cyclotron.&lt;ref name=&quot;zeilig22&quot;/&gt; While working together, the two men also used carbon-11 to demonstrate that [[animal cell]]s had the capacity to use [[carbon dioxide]] for [[carbohydrate metabolism|carbohydrate synthesis]], through [[carbon fixation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Earl Evans, 1910-1999| publisher = [[University of Chicago Medical Center]] | author = | date = 1999-10-05 | url = http://www.uchospitals.edu/news/1999/19991005-evansobit.html| accessdate = 2007-12-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Slotin may have been present at the start-up of [[Enrico Fermi]]'s &quot;[[Chicago Pile-1]]&quot;, the first [[nuclear reactor]], on 2 December 1942; however, the accounts of the event do not agree on this point.&lt;ref&gt;A 1962 University of Chicago document says that Slotin &quot;was present on 2 December 1942, when the group of 'Met Lab' [Metallurgical Laboratory] scientists working under the late Enrico Fermi achieved man's first self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction in a pile of [[graphite]] and uranium under the West Stands of [[Stagg Field]].&quot; Slotin's colleague, Henry W. Newson, recollected that he and Slotin were not present during the scientists' experimentation.&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, Slotin also contributed to a number of papers in the field of [[radiobiology]]. His expertise on the subject garnered the attention of the United States government, and as a result he was invited to join the [[Manhattan Project]], the United States' effort to develop a nuclear bomb.&lt;ref name=&quot;science.ca&quot;/&gt; Slotin worked on the production of plutonium under future [[List of Nobel laureates|Nobel laureate]] [[Eugene Wigner]] at the university and later at the [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] in [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee|Oak Ridge]], [[Tennessee]]. He moved to the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] in [[New Mexico]] in December 1944 to work in the bomb physics group of [[Robert Bacher]].&lt;ref name=&quot;zeilig22&quot;/&gt;

== Los Alamos ==
At Los Alamos, Slotin's duties consisted of dangerous [[Critical mass|criticality]] testing, first with [[uranium]] in [[Otto Robert Frisch|Otto Robert Frisch's]] experiments, and later with [[plutonium core]]s. Criticality testing involved bringing masses of [[fissile]] materials to near-critical levels in order to establish their [[critical mass]] values.&lt;ref name=&quot;Martin&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Martin |first=Brigitt |year=1999 |month=December |title=The Secret Life of Louis Slotin 1910 - 1946 |journal= Alumni Journal of the University of Manitoba |volume=59 |issue=3 |pages= | url=http://www.cns-snc.ca/history/pioneers/slotin/slotin.html |accessdate= 2007-11-22|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071007121854/http://www.cns-snc.ca/history/pioneers/slotin/slotin.html |archivedate = 7 October 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientists referred to this flirting with the possibility of a [[nuclear chain reaction]] as ''&quot;tickling the dragon's tail,&quot;'' based on a remark by physicist [[Richard Feynman]] who compared the experiments to ''&quot;tickling the tail of a sleeping dragon&quot;''.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last= Weber |first= Bruce |title=Theater Review; A Scientist's Tragic Hubris Attains Critical Mass Onstage |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE7DB1E3EF933A25757C0A9679C8B63 |publisher=New York Times |date=2001-04-10 |accessdate=2007-11-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= |first= |month=November/December |year=2002 |title=Science as Theater: The Slip of the Screwdriver |journal=[[American Scientist]] |publisher=[[Sigma Xi]] |volume=90 |issue=6 |pages=550–555 |bibcode = 2002AmSci..90..550S |doi = 10.1511/2002.6.550 |last1= Shepherd-Barr |first1= Kirsten |last2= Lustig |first2= Harry }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 July 1945, Slotin assembled the core for [[Trinity test|Trinity]], the first detonated atomic device. He became known as the &quot;chief armourer of the United States&quot; for his expertise in assembling nuclear weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Durschmied | first=Erik | title= Unsung Heroes: The Twentieth Century's Forgotten History-Makers | publisher= [[Hodder &amp; Stoughton]] | location=London, England | year = 2003|isbn=0340825197 | page=245 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--Slotin received two small circular lead and silver commemorative pins for his work on the project.&lt;ref name=&quot;zeilig22&quot;/&gt;--&gt;

On 21 August 1945, [[Harry K. Daghlian, Jr.|Harry K. Daghlian]], one of Slotin's close colleagues and a laboratory assistant, was performing a critical mass experiment when he accidentally dropped a heavy [[tungsten carbide]] brick onto a 6.2&amp;nbsp;kg [[plutonium-gallium alloy|delta phase plutonium]] bomb core.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Newtan | first=Samuel U. | title= Nuclear War I and Other Major Nuclear Disasters of the 20th Century | publisher= [[AuthorHouse]] | location=[[Bloomington, Indiana|Bloomington]], [[Indiana]] | year = 2007|isbn=1-4258-8511-4 | page=67 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 24-year old Daghlian was irradiated with 510&amp;nbsp;[[Röntgen equivalent man|rems]] (5.1&amp;nbsp;[[sievert|Sv]]) of [[neutron radiation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;la-13638&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title = LA-13638 A Review of Criticality Accidents| publisher =Los Alamos National Laboratory | author = | month = May | year = 2000 | url = http://www.orau.org/ptp/Library/accidents/la-13638.pdf| pages=74–76| accessdate = 2007-12-05 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the young man spent the next 25 days in the hospital, slowly succumbing to [[radiation poisoning]], Slotin spent many hours with him.

After the war, Slotin expressed growing disdain for his personal involvement in the project. He remarked, &quot;I have become involved in the Navy tests, much to my disgust.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;zeilig22&quot;/&gt; Unfortunately for Slotin, his participation at Los Alamos was still required because, as he said, &quot;I am one of the few people left here who are experienced bomb putter-togetherers.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;zeilig22&quot;/&gt; He looked forward to resuming his research into [[biophysics]] and radiobiology at the University of Chicago and was training a replacement, [[Alvin C. Graves]], to take over his work once he resumed his peacetime job.

=== The criticality accident ===
[[Image:Tickling the Dragons Tail.jpg|thumb|left|250px|A re-creation of the incident. The upper half of the beryllium shell is grasped by a thumbhole. The inner plutonium core (or cavity for it) is not visible.]]
On 21 May 1946, with seven other colleagues watching, Slotin performed an experiment that involved the creation of one of the first steps of a fission reaction by placing two half-spheres of [[beryllium]] (a [[neutron reflector]]) around a plutonium core. The experiment used the same {{convert|6.2|kg|lb|1|sing=on}} plutonium core that had irradiated [[Harry K. Daghlian, Jr.]], later called the &quot;[[Demon core]]&quot; for its role in the two accidents. Slotin grasped the upper beryllium hemisphere with his left hand through a thumb hole at the top while he maintained the separation of the half-spheres using the blade of a screwdriver with his right hand, having removed the [[shim (engineering)|shims]] normally used.&lt;ref name=&quot;zeilig22&quot;/&gt; Using a screwdriver was not a normal part of the experimental protocol.

At 3:20 p.m., the screwdriver slipped and the upper beryllium hemisphere fell, causing a &quot;[[prompt critical]]&quot; reaction and a burst of [[hard radiation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Martin&quot;/&gt; At the time, the scientists in the room observed the blue glow of [[Ionized air glow|air ionization]] and felt a heat wave. In addition, Slotin experienced a sour taste in his mouth and an intense burning sensation in his left hand.&lt;ref name=&quot;zeilig22&quot;/&gt; Slotin instinctively jerked his left hand upward, lifting the upper beryllium hemisphere and dropping it to the floor, ending the reaction. However, he had already been exposed to a lethal dose (around 2100&amp;nbsp;rems, or 21&amp;nbsp;Sv) of [[neutron radiation|neutron]] and [[gamma radiation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;la-13638&quot;/&gt; Slotin's [[radiation dose]] was about four times the lethal dose, equivalent to the amount that he would have been exposed to by being 1500&amp;nbsp;m (4800&amp;nbsp;ft) away from the detonation of an atomic bomb.&lt;ref name=&quot;Millerp69&quot;/&gt;

As soon as Slotin left the building, he [[Vomiting|vomited]], a common reaction from exposure to extremely intense [[ionizing radiation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;zeilig22&quot;/&gt; Slotin's colleagues rushed him to the hospital, but irreversible damage had already been done. His parents were informed of their son's inevitable death and a number of volunteers donated blood for [[blood transfusion|transfusions]], but the efforts proved futile.&lt;ref name=&quot;zeilig22&quot;/&gt;  Louis Slotin died nine days later on 30 May,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor= Chris Austell | title=Decision-Making in the Nuclear Age | publisher= Halcyon Press| location=[[Weston, Massachusetts|Weston]], [[Massachusetts]] | year = 1983 |isbn= | page= 353}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the presence of his parents. He was buried in Winnipeg on 2 June 1946.&lt;ref name=&quot;zeilig22&quot;/&gt;

At first, the incident was classified and not made known even within the laboratory; [[Robert Oppenheimer]] and other colleagues later reported severe [[Stress (medicine)|emotional distress]] at having to carry on with normal work and social activities while they secretly knew that their colleague lay dying.

The core involved was subject to a number of experiments shortly after the end of the war and was used in the [[Operation Crossroads#Test Able|ABLE detonation]], during the [[Operation Crossroads|Crossroads]] series of nuclear weapon testing. Slotin's experiment was said to be the last conducted before the core's detonation and was intended to be the final demonstration of its ability to go critical.&lt;ref name=&quot;Millerp69&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last=Miller | first=Richard L. | title=Under the Cloud: The Decades of Nuclear Testing | publisher= Two Sixty Press | location=[[The Woodlands, Texas|The Woodlands]], [[Texas]] | year = 1991|isbn=0029216206 | pages=69, 77 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The accident ended all hands-on critical assembly work at Los Alamos. Future criticality testing of fissile cores was done with special remotely controlled machines, such as the &quot;[[Godiva device|Godiva]]&quot; series, with the operator located a safe distance away in case of accidents.

== The Dollar unit of reactivity ==
According to Weinberg and Wigner,&lt;ref&gt;Alvin M. Weinberg and Eugene P. Wigner. ''The Physical Theory of Neutron Chain Reactors''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1958. Page 595.&lt;/ref&gt; Slotin was the first to propose the name &quot;dollar&quot; for the interval of reactivity between delayed and [[prompt critical]]ity. The hundredth part of a dollar is called a &quot;cent&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Hugh C. Paxton: ''A History of Critical Experiments
at Pajarito Site''. Los Alamos Dokument [http://www.atomictraveler.com/LANLPajarito.pdf LA-9685-H], 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==
[[Image:Slotin criticality drawing.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A sketch used by doctors to determine the amount of radiation to which each person in the room had been exposed during the excursion.]]
On 14 June 1946, the associate editor of the ''Los Alamos Times'', Thomas P. Ashlock, penned a poem entitled &quot;Slotin - A Tribute&quot;:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''May God receive you, great-souled scientist!''&lt;br /&gt;
''While you were with us, even strangers knew''&lt;br /&gt;
''The breadth and lofty stature of your mind''&lt;br /&gt;
''Twas only in the crucible of death&lt;br /&gt;''
''We saw at last your noble heart revealed.''&lt;ref name=&quot;zeilig22&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The official story released at the time was that Slotin, by quickly removing the upper hemisphere, was a hero for ending the critical reaction and protecting seven other observers in the room: &quot;Dr. Slotin's quick reaction at the immediate risk of his own life prevented a more serious development of the experiment which would certainly have resulted in the death of the seven men working with him, as well as serious injury to others in the general vicinity.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;zeilig22&quot;/&gt; However, Robert B. Brode, a top physicist who worked on the project, argued that the accident was avoidable and that Slotin was not using proper procedures, endangering the others in the lab along with himself.&lt;ref name=&quot;zeilig22&quot;/&gt; One of the seven observers he saved, as documented in the book &quot;Day of Trinity,&quot; was noted Soviet spy [[Klaus Fuchs]]. In 1948, Slotin's colleagues at Los Alamos and the University of Chicago initiated the ''Louis A. Slotin Memorial Fund'' for lectures on physics given by distinguished scientists such as Robert Oppenheimer and Nobel laureates [[Luis Walter Alvarez]] and [[Hans Bethe]]. The memorial fund lasted until 1962.&lt;ref name=&quot;zeilig22&quot;/&gt;

The incident was recounted in [[Dexter Masters]]' 1955 novel ''[[The Accident (1955 novel)|The Accident]]'', a fictional account of the last few days of the life of a nuclear scientist suffering from [[radiation poisoning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Schonberg |first= Harold C |title= Dexter Masters, 80, British Editor; Warned of Perils of Atomic Age |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE1D91E38F935A35752C0A96F948260 |publisher=New York Times|date=1989-01-006 |accessdate=2007-11-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first= Lawrence |last=Badash |coauthors=Joseph O.

Slotin also appears as a character in the 1987 TV mini-series ''[[Race for the Bomb]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|0149514|&quot;Race for the Bomb&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Author Paul Mullin wrote the play ''Louis Slotin Sonata'', a dramatic recreation of the events that unfolded on 21 May 1946.&lt;ref name=&quot;TST&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last= Berson |first= Misha |title=&quot;Louis Slotin Sonata&quot;: Tumultuous and bubbling drama |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/theaterarts/2003268048_slotin21.html |publisher=The Seattle Times |date=2006-09-21 |accessdate=2007-11-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The incident is also mentioned in the 1972 novel ''[[The Jesus Factor (novel)|The Jesus Factor]]'' by [[Edwin Corley]]. In [[Greg Bear|Greg Bears]] 1983 novel [[Blood Music (novel)|Blood Music]], Slotins actions immediately after the accident are also mentioned. In 1947 an MGM film, ''[[The Beginning or the End]]'', depicted a similar 'criticality' accident.
In 2002, an [[asteroid]] discovered in 1995 was named [[12423 Slotin]] in his honor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=  |first= |title=Manitobans Who Made a Difference: Louis Slotin (1910-1946) |url=http://www.gov.mb.ca/chc/hrb/events/famous_manitobans/slotin_l.html |publisher=Manitoba Culture, Heritage and Tourism |date=2007-11-05 |accessdate=2007-11-26 }} {{dead link| date=June 2010 | bot=DASHBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incident was included in the 1989 film ''[[Fat Man and Little Boy]]'', a dramatization of the Manhattan Project starring Paul Newman.  John Cusack plays a fictional character named Michael Merriman who recreates Slotin's criticality accident at the same time the first atomic bomb is being tested.  Scenes of Merriman dying of radiation sickness are intercut with scenes of the bomb test as a dramatic technique to show the horrible consequences associated with nuclear bombs.
