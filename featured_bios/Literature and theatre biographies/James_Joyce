'''James Augustine Aloysius Joyce''' (2 February 1882 – 13 January 1941) was an [[Irish people|Irish]] [[novel]]ist and [[poetry|poet]], considered to be one of the most influential writers in the [[modernist]] [[avant-garde]] of the  early 20th century. Joyce is best known for ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' (1922), a landmark work in which the episodes of [[Homer|Homer's]] ''[[Odyssey]]'' are paralleled in an array of contrasting literary styles, perhaps most prominently the [[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness]] technique he perfected. Other major works are the short-story collection ''[[Dubliners]]'' (1914), and the novels ''[[A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man]]'' (1916) and ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'' (1939). His complete oeuvre includes three books of poetry, a play, occasional journalism, and his published letters. 

Joyce was born to a middle class family in Dublin, where he excelled as a student at the Jesuit schools [[Clongowes Wood College|Clongowes]] and [[Belvedere College|Belvedere]], then at [[University College Dublin]]. In his early twenties he emigrated permanently to continental Europe, living in [[Trieste]], [[Paris]] and [[Zurich]]. Though most of his adult life was spent abroad, Joyce's fictional universe does not extend beyond [[Dublin]], and is populated largely by characters who closely resemble family members, enemies and friends from his time there; ''Ulysses'' in particular is set with precision in the streets and alleyways of the city. Shortly after the publication of ''Ulysses'' he elucidated this preoccupation somewhat, saying, &quot;For myself, I always write about Dublin, because if I can get to the heart of Dublin I can get to the heart of all the cities of the world. In the particular is contained the universal.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Ellman, p. 505, citing Power, ''From an Old Waterford House'' (London, n.d.), pp. 63-64&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
===1882–1904: Dublin===
James Augustine Aloysius Joyce was born on 2 February 1882 to [[John Joyce|John Stanislaus Joyce]] and Mary Jane Murray in the Dublin suburb of [[Rathgar]]. He was the eldest of ten surviving children; two of his siblings died of [[typhoid]]. His father's family, originally from [[Fermoy]] in [[County Cork|Cork]], had once owned a small salt and lime works. Joyce's father and paternal grandfather both married into wealthy families, though the family's purported ancestor, [[Seán Mór Seoighe]] (fl. 1680) was a stonemason from [[Connemara]]. In 1887, his father was appointed rate collector (i.e., a collector of local property taxes) by [[Dublin Corporation]]; the family subsequently moved to the fashionable adjacent small town of [[Bray]] {{convert|12|mi|km}} from Dublin. Around this time Joyce was attacked by a dog, which engendered in him a lifelong [[cynophobia]]. He also suffered from [[keraunophobia]], as an overly superstitious aunt had described thunderstorms to him as a sign of God's wrath.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;'Why are you so afraid of thunder?' asked [Arthur] Power, 'your children don't mind it.' 'Ah,' said Joyce contemptuously, 'they have no religion.' Joyce's fears were part of his identity, and he had no wish, even if he had had the power, to slough any of them off.&quot; (Ellman, p. 514, citing Power, From an Old Waterford House (London, n.d.), p. 67, and 1953 interview with Power.)&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:James Joyce age six, 1888.jpg|uprightupright|thumb|left|Joyce at age six, 1888]]
In 1891, Joyce wrote a poem, ''Et Tu Healy'' on the death of [[Charles Stewart Parnell]]. His father was angry at the treatment of Parnell by the Catholic church and at the resulting failure to secure Home Rule for Ireland. The elder Joyce had the poem printed and even sent a part to the [[Vatican Library]]. In November of that same year, John Joyce was entered in ''Stubbs Gazette'' (an official register of bankruptcies) and suspended from work. In 1893, John Joyce was dismissed with a pension, beginning the family's slide into poverty caused mainly by John's drinking and general financial mismanagement.&lt;ref&gt;Ellmann, p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt;

James Joyce had begun his education at [[Clongowes Wood College]], a [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] boarding school near [[Clane]], [[County Kildare]], in 1888 but had to leave in 1892 when his father could no longer pay the fees.  Joyce then studied at home and briefly at the [[Congregation of Christian Brothers|Christian Brothers]] [[O'Connell School]] on North Richmond Street, Dublin, before he was offered a place in the Jesuits', Dublin school, [[Belvedere College]], in 1893. In 1895, Joyce, now aged 13, was elected to join the [[Sodality of Our Lady]] by his peers at Belvedere;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.themodernword.com/joyce/joyce_chronology.html Themodernworld.com]&lt;/ref&gt; students were elected to the Sodality on account of their leadership qualities and members of the Sodality, by their positive attitudes and acts of piety, were meant to elicit religious fervour and enthusiasm for studies amongst the student body; most [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] Schools and Universities had a Sodality until the 1950s, when families and parishes became the focal point of the [[Ignatian spirituality|Ignatian]] lay movement, now called the [[Christian Life Community]]. By the age of 16 however, Joyce appears to have made a break with his [[Catholicism|Catholic]] roots, a subject of varying degrees of dispute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/24/nyregion/24avrich | last= Brozan | first= Nadine | title= Paul Avrich, 74, a Historian of Anarchism, Is Dead | work= The New York Times|date = 24 February 2006|accessdate=2 February 2012|format=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the philosophy of [[Thomas Aquinas]] continued to have a strong influence on him for most of his life.&lt;ref&gt;Ellmann, pp. 30, 55.&lt;/ref&gt;  

He enrolled at the recently established [[University College Dublin]] (UCD) in 1898, studying English, French, and Italian. He also became active in theatrical and literary circles in the city. In 1900 his review of [[Henrik Ibsen]]'s ''New Drama'' was published  in ''[[Fortnightly Review]]''; it was his first publication and he received a note of thanks from the Norwegian dramatist himself. Joyce wrote a number of other articles and at least two plays (since lost) during this period. Many of the friends he made at University College Dublin appeared as characters in Joyce's works.  Joyce was first introduced to the Irish public by [[Arthur Griffith]] in his newspaper, ''[[The United Irishman]]'', in November 1901.  Joyce had written an article on the Irish Literary Theatre and his college magazine refused to print it. Joyce had it printed and distributed locally. Griffith himself wrote a piece decrying the censorship of the student James Joyce.&lt;ref&gt;Jordan, Anthony, [http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/opinion/2012/0220/1224312050318.html &quot;An Irishman's Diary&quot;], ''Irish Times'', 20 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1901,  the National Census of Ireland lists James Joyce (19) as a scholar living with his mother and father, six sisters and three brothers at Royal Terrace, Clontarf, Dublin.

[[File:James-Joyce-Stephens-Green.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|right|Bust of James Joyce in [[St. Stephen's Green]], Dublin]]
After graduating from UCD in 1903, Joyce left for Paris to study medicine, but he soon abandoned this after finding the technical lectures in French too difficult. He stayed on for a few months, appealing for finance his family could ill afford and reading late in the [[Bibliothèque Sainte-Geneviève]]. When his mother was diagnosed with cancer, his father sent a telegraph which read, &quot;NOTHER [sic] DYING COME HOME FATHER&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;She was originally diagnosed with [[cirrhosis of the liver]], but this proved incorrect, and she was diagnosed with cancer in April 1903.  Ellman, pp. 128–129&lt;/ref&gt; Joyce returned to Ireland. Fearing for her son's impiety, his mother tried unsuccessfully to get Joyce to make his confession and to take communion. She finally passed into a coma and died on 13 August, James and [[Stanislaus Joyce|Stanislaus]] having refused to kneel with other members of the family praying at her bedside.&lt;ref&gt;Ellmann, pp. 129, 136.&lt;/ref&gt;   After her death he continued to drink heavily, and conditions at home grew quite appalling. He scraped a living reviewing books, teaching and singing—he was an accomplished [[tenor]], and won the bronze medal in the 1904 [[Feis Ceoil]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20070401041950/http://www.feisceoil.ie/history/ History of the Feis Ceoil Association.]  Siemens Feis Ceoil Association. 1 April 2007 version retrieved from the Internet archive on 9 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 7 January 1904 he attempted to publish ''A Portrait of the Artist'', an essay-story dealing with [[aesthetics]], only to have it rejected from the free-thinking magazine ''Dana''. He decided, on his twenty-second birthday, to revise the story into a novel he called ''Stephen Hero''. It was a fictional rendering of Joyce's youth, but he eventually grew frustrated with its direction and abandoned this work. It was never published in this form, but years later, in Trieste, Joyce completely rewrote it as  ''A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man''. The unfinished ''Stephen Hero'' was published after his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jamesjoyce.ie/detail.asp?ID=28|title=Joyce – Other works|publisher=The James Joyce Centre|accessdate=22 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The same year he met [[Nora Barnacle]], a young woman from [[Connemara]], County Galway who was working as a chambermaid. On 16 June 1904, they first stepped out together, an event which would be commemorated by providing the date for the action of ''Ulysses''.

Joyce remained in Dublin for some time longer, drinking heavily. After one of these drinking binges, he got into a fight over a misunderstanding with a man in [[Phoenix Park]]; he was picked up and dusted off by a minor acquaintance of his father's, Alfred H. Hunter, who brought him into his home to tend to his injuries.&lt;ref&gt;Ellmann, p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt; Hunter was rumoured to be a Jew and to have an unfaithful wife, and would serve as one of the models for [[Leopold Bloom]], the protagonist of ''Ulysses''.&lt;ref&gt;Ellmann, p. 230.&lt;/ref&gt; He took up with medical student [[Oliver St John Gogarty]], who formed the basis for the character [[Buck Mulligan]] in ''Ulysses''. After staying in Gogarty's [[James Joyce Tower and Museum|Martello Tower in Sandycove]] for six nights, he left in the middle of the night following an altercation which involved another student he lived with, Samuel Chenevix Trench (Haines in ''Ulysses''), firing a pistol at some pans hanging directly over Joyce's bed.&lt;ref&gt;Ellmann, p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt; He walked all the way back to Dublin to stay with relatives for the night, and sent a friend to the tower the next day to pack his trunk. Shortly thereafter he eloped to the continent with Nora.

===1904–20: Trieste and Zurich===
[[File:James Joyce by Alex Ehrenzweig, 1915 restored.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Joyce in 1915]]
Joyce and Nora went into self-imposed exile, moving first to [[Zurich]], where he had supposedly acquired a post to teach English at the [[Berlitz Language Schools|Berlitz Language School]] through an agent in England. It turned out that the English agent had been swindled, but the director of the school sent him on to [[Trieste]], which was part of [[Austria-Hungary]] until [[World War I]] (today part of Italy). Once again, he found there was no position for him, but with the help of Almidano Artifoni, director of the Trieste Berlitz school, he finally secured a teaching position in [[Pula|Pola]], then also part of Austria-Hungary (today part of [[Croatia]]). He stayed there, teaching English mainly to Austro-Hungarian naval officers stationed at the Pola base, from October 1904 until March 1905, when the Austrians—having discovered an [[espionage]] ring in the city—expelled all [[Alien (law)|aliens]]. With Artifoni's help, he moved back to Trieste and began teaching English there. He would remain in Trieste for most of the next ten years.&lt;ref name=&quot;mccourt&quot;&gt;McCourt 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:Joyce in Trieste.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Bronze statue of Joyce standing on a sidewalk, next to a railing. Behind the statue is a street scene with pedestrians and stores.|Joyce's statue in [[Trieste]]]]
Later that year Nora gave birth to their first child, George. Joyce then managed to talk his brother, [[Stanislaus Joyce|Stanislaus]], into joining him in Trieste, and secured him a position teaching at the school. Joyce's ostensible reasons were desire for Stanislaus's company and the hope of offering him a more interesting life than that of his simple clerking job in Dublin. In truth, though, Joyce hoped to augment his family's meagre income with his brother's earnings.&lt;ref&gt;According to Ellmann, Stanislaus allowed Joyce to collect his pay, &quot;to simplify matters&quot; (p. 213).&lt;/ref&gt; Stanislaus and Joyce had strained relations throughout the time they lived together in Trieste, with most arguments centring on Joyce's drinking habits and frivolity with money.&lt;ref&gt;The worst of the conflicts were in July, 1910 (Ellmann, pp. 311–313).&lt;/ref&gt;  

With the chronic wanderlust of Joyce's early years, he became frustrated with life in Trieste and moved to Rome in late 1906, having secured employment in a bank. He intensely disliked Rome, and moved back to Trieste in early 1907. His daughter [[Lucia Joyce|Lucia]] was born in the summer of the same year.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Bob. [http://www.themodernword.com/Joyce/joyce_chronology.html Joycean Chronology.] The Modern World, 6 November 2002, Retrieved on 9 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Joyce returned to Dublin in mid-1909 with George, in order to visit his father and work on getting ''Dubliners'' published. He visited Nora's family in [[Galway]], meeting them for the first time (a successful visit, to his relief). He also launched Ireland's first cinema, the [[Volta Cinematograph]], with backing from his Italian friends. While preparing to return to Trieste he decided to take one of his sisters, Eva, back with him to help Nora run the home. He spent only a month in Trieste before returning to Dublin, this time as a representative of some cinema owners hoping to set up a regular cinema in Dublin. The venture was successful (but quickly fell apart in Joyce's absence), and he returned to Trieste in January 1910 with another sister, Eileen, in tow. Eva became very homesick for Dublin and returned there a few years later, but Eileen spent the rest of her life on the continent, eventually marrying [[Czech people|Czech]] bank cashier Frantisek Schaurek.&lt;ref&gt;Ellman, pp. 384–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Joyce returned to Dublin again briefly in mid-1912 during his years-long fight with his Dublin publisher, George Roberts, over the publication of ''Dubliners''. His trip was once again fruitless, and on his return he wrote the poem &quot;Gas from a Burner&quot; as an invective against Roberts. After this trip, he never again came closer to Dublin than London, despite many pleas from his father and invitations from fellow Irish writer [[William Butler Yeats]].

One of his students in Trieste was Ettore Schmitz, better known by the pseudonym [[Italo Svevo]]. They met in 1907 and became lasting friends and mutual critics. Schmitz was a Catholic of Jewish origin and became the primary model for Leopold Bloom; most of the details about [[Judaism|the Jewish faith]] in ''Ulysses'' came from Schmitz's responses to queries from Joyce.&lt;ref&gt;Ellmann, p. 272.&lt;/ref&gt; While living in Trieste, Joyce was first beset with eye problems that ultimately required over a dozen surgerical operations.&lt;ref&gt;Ellman pp. 268, 417.&lt;/ref&gt;

Joyce concocted a number of money-making schemes during this period, including an attempt to become a cinema [[Business magnate|magnate]] in Dublin. He also frequently discussed but ultimately abandoned a plan to import Irish tweeds to Trieste. Correspondence relating to that venture with the [[Irish Woollen Mills]] are displayed in the windows of their premises on Aston's Quay in [[Dublin]]. His skill at borrowing money saved him from indigence. What income he had came partially from his position at the Berlitz school and partially from teaching private students.

In 1915, after most of his students were conscripted in Trieste for World War I, he moved to Zurich. Two influential private students, Baron Ambrogio Ralli and Count Francesco Sordina, petitioned officials for an exit permit for the Joyces, who in turn agreed not to take any action against the emperor of Austria-Hungary during the war.&lt;ref&gt;Ellman p. 386.&lt;/ref&gt; There, he met one of his most enduring and important friends, [[Frank Budgen]], whose opinion Joyce constantly sought through the writing of ''Ulysses'' and ''Finnegans Wake''. It was also here where [[Ezra Pound]] brought him to the attention of English feminist and publisher [[Harriet Shaw Weaver]], who would become Joyce's patron, providing him thousands of pounds over the next 25 years and relieving him of the burden of teaching in order to focus on his writing. While in Zurich he wrote ''Exiles'', published ''A Portrait...'', and began serious work on ''Ulysses''. Zurich during the war was home to exiles and artists from across Europe, and its bohemian, multilingual atmosphere suited him. Nevertheless, after four years he was restless, and after the war he returned to Trieste as he had originally planned. He found the city had changed, and some of his old friends noted his maturing from teacher to full-time  artist. His relations with his brother (who had been interned in an Austrian prison camp for most of the war due to his pro-Italian politics) were more strained than ever. Joyce headed to Paris in 1920 at an invitation from Ezra Pound, supposedly for a week, but he ended up living there for the next twenty years.

===1920–41: Paris and Zurich===

Joyce set himself to finishing ''Ulysses'' in Paris, delighted to find that he was gradually gaining fame as an avant-garde writer. A further grant from Miss Shaw Weaver meant he could devote himself full-time to writing again, as well as consort with other literary figures in the city.
During this era, Joyce's eyes began to give him more and more problems. He was treated by Dr Louis Borsch in Paris, undergoing nine operations from him until Borsch's death in 1929. Throughout the 1930s he travelled frequently to Switzerland for eye surgeries and treatments for Lucia, who, according to the Joyces, suffered from [[schizophrenia]]. Lucia was analysed by [[Carl Jung]] at the time, who after reading ''Ulysses'',  concluded that her father had schizophrenia.&lt;ref&gt;Shloss, p. 278.&lt;/ref&gt;  Jung said she and her father were two people heading to the bottom of a river, except that he was diving and she was falling.&lt;ref&gt;Pepper, Tara&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shloss p. 297.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The current heir of the Joyce estate, [[Stephen J. Joyce]], burned letters written by Lucia that he received upon Lucia's death in 1982.(Stanley, Alessandra. &quot;[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&amp;res=9D0CE2DE1730F936A25754C0A967958260 Poet Told All; Therapist Provides the Record],&quot; ''[[The New York Times]]'', July 15, 1991. Retrieved 9 July 2007). Stephen Joyce stated in a letter to the editor of ''[[The New York Times]]'' that &quot;Regarding the destroyed correspondence, these were all personal letters from Lucia to us. They were written many years after both Nonno and Nonna [i.e. Mr and Mrs Joyce] died and did not refer to them. Also destroyed were some postcards and one telegram from [[Samuel Beckett]] to Lucia. This was done at Sam's written request.&quot;{{cite news | url= http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE4DB103DF932A05751C1A96F948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=1 | last= Joyce | first= Stephen | title=  The Private Lives of Writers | work= The New York Times|date = 31 December 1989|accessdate=9 November 2009|format=Letter to the Editor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Behind the stone is a green hedge and a seated statue of Joyce holding a book and pondering.|Grave of James Joyce in Zurich-[[Fluntern]]]]
In Paris, [[Maria Jolas|Maria]] and [[Eugene Jolas]] nursed Joyce during his long years of writing ''Finnegans Wake.'' Were it not for their support (along with Harriet Shaw Weaver's constant financial support), there is a good possibility that his books might never have been finished or published. In their literary magazine &quot;''[[Transition (literary journal)|Transition]]'',&quot; the Jolases published serially various sections of Joyce's novel under the title ''Work in Progress.'' He returned to Zurich in late 1940, fleeing the [[German occupation of France during World War II|Nazi occupation of France]]. 

On 11 January 1941, he underwent surgery for a perforated ulcer. While he at first improved, he relapsed the following day, and despite several transfusions, fell into a coma. He awoke at 2&amp;nbsp;a.m. on 13 January 1941, and asked for a nurse to call his wife and son before losing consciousness again. They were still on their way when he died 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later. He is buried in the [[Fluntern Cemetery]] near Zurich Zoo.  

Although two senior Irish diplomats were in Switzerland at the time, neither attended Joyce's funeral, and the Irish government subsequently declined Nora's offer to permit the repatriation of Joyce's remains. Nora, whom Joyce had married in London in 1931, survived him by 10 years. She is buried now by his side, as is their son George, who died in 1976.  Swiss tenor [[Max Meili]] sang ''Addio terra, addio cielo'' from [[Monteverdi]]'s ''[[L'Orfeo]]'' at the funeral service.

===Joyce and religion===
[[L. A. G. Strong]], William T. Noon, Robert Boyle and others have argued that Joyce, later in life, reconciled with the faith he rejected earlier in life and that his parting with the faith was succeeded by a not so obvious reunion, and that Ulysses and Finnegans Wake are essentially Catholic expressions.&lt;ref&gt;Segall, Jeffrey [http://books.google.com/books?id=EoZ6ZhT9lBwC&amp;dq Joyce in America: cultural politics and the trials of Ulysses],  p. 140, University of California Press 1993&lt;/ref&gt;  Likewise, [[Hugh Kenner]] and [[T.S. Eliot]] saw between the lines of Joyce’s work the outlook of a serious Christian and that beneath the veneer of the work lies a remnant of Catholic belief and attitude.&lt;ref&gt;Segall, Jeffrey [http://books.google.com/books?id=EoZ6ZhT9lBwC&amp;dq Joyce in America: cultural politics and the trials of Ulysses],  p. 142, University of California Press 1993&lt;/ref&gt;  Kevin Sullivan maintains that, rather than reconciling with the faith, Joyce never left it.&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.com&quot;&gt;Segall, Jeffrey [http://books.google.com/books?id=EoZ6ZhT9lBwC&amp;dq Joyce in America: cultural politics and the trials of Ulysses],  p. 160, University of California Press 1993&lt;/ref&gt; Critics holding this view insist that Stephen, the protagonist of the semi-autobiographical [[A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man]] as well as [[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]], is not Joyce.&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.com&quot;/&gt; Somewhat cryptically, in an interview after completing Ulysses, in response to the question &quot;When did you leave the Catholic Church&quot;,  Joyce answered, &quot;That’s for the Church to say.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Davison, Neil R.,  [http://books.google.com/books?id=s_eXYzdEmxcC&amp;dq  James Joyce, Ulysses, and the Construction of Jewish Identity: Culture, , Biography, and 'the Jew' in Modernist Europe] , p. 78,  Cambridge University Press, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;  Eamonn Hughes maintains that Joyce takes a [[dialectic]]  approach, both assenting and denying, saying that Stephen’s much noted ''[[non serviam]]'' is qualified  – &quot;I will not serve ''that which I no longer believe''…&quot;, and that the ''non serviam'' will always be balanced by Stephen’s &quot;I am a servant…&quot; and Molly’s &quot;yes&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Hughs, Eamonn in Robert Welch’s [http://books.google.com/books?id=t8tKQcfn_QEC&amp;dq  Irish writers and religion] , pp.116–137, Rowman &amp; Littlefield 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Umberto Eco]] compares Joyce to the ancient ''[[episcopi vagantes]]'' (stray bishops) in the [[Middle Ages]]. They left a discipline, not a cultural heritage or a way of thinking. Like them, the writer retains the sense of [[blasphemy]] held as a liturgical ritual.&lt;ref&gt;Free translation from: Eco, Umberto. ''Las poéticas de Joyce''. Barcelona: DeBolsillo, 2011. ISBN 978-84-9989-253-5, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

In any case we have first-hand testimonies coming from the early Joyce, his brother [[Stanislaus Joyce]], and his wife: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;My mind rejects the whole present social order and Christianity -home, the recognised virtues, classes of life, and religious doctrines. […] Six years ago I left the Catholic church, hating it most fervently. I found it impossible for me to remain in it on account of the impulses of my nature. I made secret war upon it when I was a student and declined to accept the positions it offered me. By doing this I made myself a beggar but I retained my pride. Now I make open war upon it by what I write and say and do.&lt;ref&gt;Letter to Nora Barnacle. August 29, 1904. In ''Selected Letters of James Joyce''. Richard Ellmann, ed. London: Faber and Faber, 1975. ISBN 0-571-09306-X pp. 25-26&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;My brother’s breakaway from Catholicism was due to other motives. He felt it was imperative that he should save his real spiritual life from being overlaid and crushed by a false one that he had outgrown. He believed that poets in the measure of their gifts and personality were the repositories of the genuine spiritual life of their race and the priests were usurpers. He detested falsity and believed in individual freedom more thoroughly than any man I have ever known. […] The interest that my brother always retained in the philosophy of the Catholic Church sprang from the fact that he considered Catholic philosophy to be the most coherent attempt to establish such an intellectual and material stability.&lt;ref&gt;Joyce, Stanislaus. ''My Brother’s Keeper''. Faber and Faber. London, 1982. ISBN 0-571-11803-8 p. 120&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

When the arrangements for Joyce's burial were being made, a Catholic priest offered a religious service, which Joyce's wife Nora declined, saying: &quot;I couldn't do that to him.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Ellman 1982, p. 742, citing a 1953 interview with George (&quot;Giorgio&quot;) Joyce.&lt;/ref&gt; Notwithstanding their knowledge of such facts, some critics and biographers have opined along the lines of Andrew Gibson: &quot;The modern James Joyce may have vigorously resisted the oppressive power of Catholic tradition. But there was another Joyce who asserted his allegiance to that tradition, and never left it, or wanted to leave it, behind him.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Gibson, Andrew, [http://books.google.com/books?id=8v8BuCh9bbcC&amp;pg=PA41#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false James Joyce], p. 41, Reaktion Books 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major works==
===''Dubliners''===
{{Main|Dubliners}}
[[Image:Dubliners title page.jpg|right|thumb|upright|alt=Title page saying 'DUBLINERS BY JAMES JOYCE', then a colophon, then 'LONDON / GRANT RICHARDS LTD. / PUBLISHERS'.|The title page of the first edition of ''[[Dubliners]]'']]
Joyce's Irish experiences constitute an essential element of his writings, and provide all of the settings for his fiction and much of its subject matter. His early volume of short stories, ''Dubliners'', is a penetrating analysis of the stagnation and paralysis of Dublin society. The stories incorporate [[Epiphany (feeling)|epiphanies]], a word used particularly by Joyce, by which he meant a sudden consciousness of the &quot;soul&quot; of a thing. The final and most famous story in the collection, &quot;[[The Dead (short story)|The Dead]]&quot;, was directed by [[John Huston]] as his last feature film in 1987.

===''A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man''===
{{Main|A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man}}
''A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man'' is a nearly complete rewrite of the abandoned novel ''[[Stephen Hero]]''.  Joyce attempted to burn the original manuscript in a fit of rage during an argument with Nora, though to his subsequent relief it was rescued by his sister. A ''[[Künstlerroman]]'', ''Portrait'' is a heavily autobiographical&lt;ref&gt;MacBride, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; [[bildungsroman|coming-of-age novel]] depicting the childhood and adolescence of protagonist [[Stephen Dedalus]] and his gradual growth into artistic self-consciousness. Some hints of the techniques Joyce frequently employed in later works, such as [[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness]], [[interior monologue]], and references to a character's psychic reality rather than to his external surroundings, are evident throughout this novel.&lt;ref&gt;Deming, p. 749.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Strick]] directed a film of the book in 1977 starring Luke Johnston, [[Bosco Hogan]], [[T.P. McKenna]] and [[John Gielgud]].

===''Exiles'' and poetry===
{{Main|Pomes Penyeach|Chamber Music (book)}}

Despite early interest in the theatre, Joyce published only one play, ''[[Exiles (play)|Exiles]]'', begun shortly after the outbreak of World War I in 1914 and published in 1918. A study of a husband and wife relationship, the play looks back to ''The Dead'' (the final story in ''Dubliners'') and forward to ''Ulysses'', which Joyce began around the time of the play's composition.

Joyce also published a number of books of poetry. His first mature published work was the satirical broadside &quot;The Holy Office&quot; (1904), in which he proclaimed himself to be the superior of many prominent members of the [[Celtic revival]]. His first full-length poetry collection ''Chamber Music'' (referring, Joyce explained, to the sound of urine hitting the side of a chamber pot) consisted of 36 short lyrics. This publication led to his inclusion in the ''[[Imagism|Imagist Anthology]]'', edited by [[Ezra Pound]], who was a champion of Joyce's work. Other poetry Joyce published in his lifetime includes &quot;Gas From A Burner&quot; (1912), ''Pomes Penyeach'' (1927) and &quot;Ecce Puer&quot; (written in 1932 to mark the birth of his grandson and the recent death of his father). It was published by the [[Black Sun Press]] in ''Collected Poems'' (1936).

===''Ulysses''===
{{Main|Ulysses (novel)}}
[[Image:Order form for ulysses.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Page saying 'ULYSSES by JAMES JOYCE will be published in the Autumn of 1921 by &quot;SHAKESPEARE AND COMPANY&quot; — SYLVIA BEACH — 8, RUE DUPUYTREN, PARIS — VIe'|Announcement of the initial publication of ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]''.]]
As he was completing work on ''Dubliners'' in 1906, Joyce considered adding another story featuring a Jewish advertising canvasser called [[Leopold Bloom]] under the title ''Ulysses''. Although he did not pursue the idea further at the time, he eventually commenced work on a novel using both the title and basic premise in 1914. The writing was completed in October, 1921. Three more months were devoted to working on the proofs of the book before Joyce halted work shortly before his self-imposed deadline, his 40th birthday (2 February 1922).

Thanks to Ezra Pound, serial publication of the novel in the magazine ''[[The Little Review]]'' began in 1918. This magazine was edited by [[Margaret Anderson]] and [[Jane Heap]], with the backing of [[John Quinn (collector)|John Quinn]], a New York attorney with an interest in contemporary experimental art and literature. Unfortunately, this publication encountered censorship problems in the United States; serialisation was halted in 1920 when the editors were convicted of publishing obscenity.&lt;ref&gt;Gillers, pp. 251–62.&lt;/ref&gt; The novel was not published in the United States until 1933.&lt;ref&gt;The fear of prosecution for publication ended with the court decision of [[United States v. One Book Called Ulysses]], [[Case citation|5 F.Supp. 182 (S.D.N.Y. 1933)]].  Ellman, pp. 666–67.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Partly because of this controversy, Joyce found it difficult to get a publisher to accept the book, but it was published in 1922 by [[Sylvia Beach]] from her well-known [[Rive Gauche]] bookshop, ''[[Shakespeare and Company (bookshop)|Shakespeare and Company]]''. An English edition published the same year by Joyce's patron, [[Harriet Shaw Weaver]], ran into further difficulties with the United States authorities, and 500 copies that were shipped to the States were seized and possibly destroyed. The following year, [[John Rodker]] produced a print run of 500 more intended to replace the missing copies, but these were burned by English customs at [[Folkestone]]. A further consequence of the novel's ambiguous legal status as a banned book was that a number of &quot;bootleg&quot; versions appeared, most notably a number of pirate versions from the publisher [[Samuel Roth]]. In 1928, a court injunction against Roth was obtained and he ceased publication.

With the appearance of both ''Ulysses'' and [[T. S. Eliot]]'s poem, ''[[The Waste Land]]'', 1922 was a key year in the history of English-language literary modernism. In ''Ulysses'', Joyce employs stream of consciousness, parody, jokes, and virtually every other established literary technique to present his characters.&lt;ref&gt;Examined at length in [[Vladimir Nabokov]]'s ''Lectures on Ulysses. A Facsimile of the Manuscript.'' Bloomfield Hills/Columbia: Bruccoli Clark, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; The action of the novel, which takes place in a single day, 16 June 1904, sets the characters and incidents of the [[Odyssey]] of [[Homer]] in modern Dublin and represents [[Odysseus]] (Ulysses), [[Penelope]] and [[Telemachus]] in the characters of Leopold Bloom, his wife [[Molly Bloom]] and Stephen Dedalus, parodically contrasted with their lofty models. The book explores various areas of Dublin life, dwelling on its squalor and monotony. Nevertheless, the book is also an affectionately detailed study of the city, and Joyce claimed that if Dublin were to be destroyed in some catastrophe it could be rebuilt, brick by brick, using his work as a model.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, David. ''Colonial Odysseys: Empire and Epic in the Modernist Novel''. Cornell University Press, 2003, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; In order to achieve this level of accuracy, Joyce used the 1904 edition of [[Thom's Directory]]—a work that listed the owners and/or tenants of every residential and commercial property in the city. He also bombarded friends still living there with requests for information and clarification.
[[File:James Joyce with Sylvia Beach at Shakespeare &amp; Co Paris 1920.jpg|thumb|left|Joyce talking with publishers [[Sylvia Beach]] and [[Adrienne Monnier]] at [[Shakespeare and Company (bookshop)|Shakespeare &amp; Co.]], [[Paris]], 1920]]
The book consists of 18 chapters, each covering roughly one hour of the day, beginning around 8&amp;nbsp;a.m. and ending some time after 2&amp;nbsp;a.m. the following morning. Each chapter employs its own literary style, and parodies a specific episode in Homer's Odyssey.  Furthermore, each chapter is associated with a specific colour, art or science, and bodily organ. This combination of kaleidoscopic writing with an extreme formal schematic structure renders the book a major contribution to the development of 20th-century modernist literature.&lt;ref&gt;Sherry, Vincent B. ''James Joyce: Ulysses''. Cambridge University
Press, 2004, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; The use of [[classical mythology]] as an organising framework, the near-obsessive focus on external detail, and the occurrence of significant action within the minds of characters have also contributed to the development of literary modernism. Nevertheless, Joyce complained that, &quot;I may have oversystematised ''Ulysses'',&quot; and played down the mythic correspondences by eliminating the chapter titles that had been taken from Homer.&lt;ref&gt;Dettmar, Kevin J. H. ''Rereading the New: A Backward Glance at Modernism''. University of Michigan Press, 1992, p. 285.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Finnegans Wake''===
{{Main|Finnegans Wake}}
[[File:CBI - SERIES C - TEN POUND NOTE.PNG|right|frame|alt=Front and back of a specimen £10 note. Joyce's face covers the right third of the front. The back has an anonymous ancient face and says 'CENTRAL BANK OF IRELAND'.|Joyce as depicted on the [[Series C Banknotes (Ireland)|Irish £10 banknote]], issued 1993–2002]] 
Having completed work on ''Ulysses'', Joyce was so exhausted that he did not write a line of prose for a year.&lt;ref&gt;Bulson, Eric. ''The Cambridge Introduction to James Joyce''. Cambridge University Press, 2006, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 March 1923 he informed a patron, Harriet Weaver: &quot;Yesterday I wrote two pages—the first I have since the final ''Yes'' of ''Ulysses''. Having found a pen, with some difficulty I copied them out in a large handwriting on a double sheet of foolscap so that I could read them. ''Il lupo perde il pelo ma non il vizio'', the Italians say. The wolf may lose his skin but not his vice or the leopard cannot change his spots.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Joyce, James. ''Ulysses: The 1922 Text''. Oxford University Press, 1998, p. xlvii.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus was born a text that became known, first, as ''Work in Progress'' and later ''Finnegans Wake''.

By 1926 Joyce had completed the first two parts of the book. In that year, he met Eugene and Maria Jolas who offered to serialise the book in their magazine ''transition''. For the next few years, Joyce worked rapidly on the new book, but in the 1930s, progress slowed considerably. This was due to a number of factors, including the death of his father in 1931, concern over the mental health of his daughter [[Lucia Joyce|Lucia]] and his own health problems, including failing eyesight. Much of the work was done with the assistance of younger admirers, including [[Samuel Beckett]]. For some years, Joyce nursed the eccentric plan of turning over the book to his friend [[James Stephens (author)|James Stephens]] to complete, on the grounds that Stephens was born in the same hospital as Joyce exactly one week later, and shared the first name of both Joyce and of Joyce's fictional alter-ego (this is one example of Joyce's numerous superstitions).&lt;ref&gt;Ellmann, pp. 591–592.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Reaction to the work was mixed, including negative comment from early supporters of Joyce's work, such as Pound and the author's brother, [[Stanislaus Joyce]].&lt;ref&gt;Ellmann, pp. 577–585, 603.&lt;/ref&gt; In order to counteract this hostile reception, a book of essays by supporters of the new work, including Beckett, [[William Carlos Williams]] and others was organised and published in 1929 under the title ''[[Our Exagmination Round His Factification for Incamination of Work in Progress]]''. At his 57th birthday party at the Jolases' home, Joyce revealed the final title of the work and ''Finnegans Wake'' was published in book form on 4 May 1939.  Later, further negative comments surfaced from doctor and author [[Hervey M. Cleckley|Hervey Cleckley]], who questioned the significance others had placed on the work.  In his book, ''[[The Mask of Sanity]]'', Cleckley refers to ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'' as &quot;a 628-page collection of erudite gibberish indistinguishable to most people from the familiar word salad produced by hebephrenic patients on the back wards of any state hospital.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Cleckley, Hervey (1982). The Mask of Sanity. Revised Edition. Mosby Medical Library. ISBN 0-452-25341-1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Joyce's method of stream of consciousness, literary allusions and free dream associations was pushed to the limit in ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'', which abandoned all conventions of plot and character construction and is written in a peculiar and obscure language, based mainly on complex multi-level puns. This approach is similar to, but far more extensive than that used by [[Lewis Carroll]] in ''[[Jabberwocky]]''. This has led many readers and critics to apply Joyce's oft-quoted description in the ''Wake'' of ''Ulysses'' as his &quot;usylessly unreadable Blue Book of Eccles&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Finnegans Wake'', 179.26–27.&lt;/ref&gt;  to the ''Wake'' itself. However, readers have been able to reach a consensus about the central cast of characters and general plot.

Much of the wordplay in the book stems from the use of multilingual puns which draw on a wide range of languages. The role played by Beckett and other assistants included collating words from these languages on cards for Joyce to use and, as Joyce's eyesight worsened, of writing the text from the author's dictation.&lt;ref&gt;Gluck, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The view of history propounded in this text is very strongly influenced by [[Giambattista Vico]], and the metaphysics of [[Giordano Bruno]] of [[Nola]] are important to the interplay of the &quot;characters.&quot; Vico propounded a cyclical view of history, in which civilisation rose from chaos, passed through theocratic, aristocratic, and democratic phases, and then lapsed back into chaos. The most obvious example of the influence of Vico's cyclical theory of history is to be found in the opening and closing words of the book. ''Finnegans Wake'' opens with the words &quot;riverrun, past Eve and Adam's, from swerve of shore to bend of bay, brings us by a commodius vicus of recirculation back to Howth Castle and Environs.&quot; (&quot;vicus&quot; is a pun on Vico) and ends &quot;A way a lone a last a loved a long the.&quot; In other words, the book ends with the beginning of a sentence and begins with the end of the same sentence, turning the book into one great cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Alan |last=Shockley |editor1-first=Alan W. |editor1-last=Friedman |editor2-first=Charles |editor2-last=Rossman |title=De-Familiarizing Readings: Essays from the Austin Joyce Conference |publisher=Editions Rodopi |location=Amsterdam |isbn=978-90-420-2570-7 |series=European Joyce Studies |volume=18 |year=2009 |page=104 |chapter=Playing the Square Circle: Musical Form and Polyphony in the ''Wake'' |chapterurl=http://books.google.com/books?id=lW96fbBNRYsC&amp;pg=PA104 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, Joyce said that the ideal reader of the ''Wake'' would suffer from &quot;ideal insomnia&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Finnegans Wake'', 120.9–16.&lt;/ref&gt; and, on completing the book, would turn to page one and start again, and so on in an endless cycle of reading.

Some scholars, most notably [[Vladimir Nabokov]], have mixed feelings on his work, often championing some of his fiction while condemning other works. In Nabokov's opinion, ''Ulysses'' was brilliant,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;When I want good reading I reread Proust's ''A la Recherche du Temps Perdu'' or Joyce's ''Ulysses''&quot; (Nabokov, letter to Elena Sikorski, 3 August 1950, in ''Nabokov's Butterflies: Unpublished and Uncollected Writings'' [Boston: Beacon, 2000], pp. 464–465). Nabokov put ''Ulysses'' at the head of his list of the &quot;greatest twentieth century masterpieces&quot; (Nabokov, ''Strong Opinions'' [New York: McGraw-Hill, 1974] [http://www.nyt.net/books/97/03/02/lifetimes/nab-v-freud.html excerpt]).&lt;/ref&gt; ''Finnegans Wake'' horrible&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Of course, it would have been unseemly for a monarch to appear in the robes of learning at a university lectern and present to rosy youths  ''Finnigan's Wake'' [sic] as a monstrous extension of [[Striking and Picturesque Delineations|Angus MacDiarmid]]'s &quot;incoherent transactions&quot; and of [[Robert Southey|Southey]]'s Lingo-Grande. . .&quot; (Nabokov, ''Pale Fire'' [New York: Random House, 1962], p. 76).  The comparison is made by an [[unreliable narrator]], but Nabokov in an unpublished note had compared &quot;the worst parts of James Joyce&quot; to McDiarmid and to [[Jonathan Swift|Swift]]'s letters to Stella (quoted by [[Brian Boyd]], &quot;Notes&quot; in Nabokov's ''Novels 1955–1962: Lolita / Pnin / Pale Fire'' [New York: Library of America, 1996], 893).&lt;/ref&gt;—an attitude [[Jorge Luis Borges]] shared.&lt;ref&gt;Borges, p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt;

Joyce's influence is also evident in fields other than literature. The sentence &quot;Three quarks for Muster Mark!&quot; in Joyce's ''Finnegans Wake''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trentu.ca/faculty/jjoyce/fw-383.htm ''Three quarks for Muster Mark!''] Text of ''Finnegans Wake'' at Trent University, Peterborough, Ontario.

Psychoanalyst [[Jacques Lacan]] used Joyce's writings to explain his concept of the ''[[sinthome]]''.
