'''Georgette Heyer''' {{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|h|eɪ|.|ər}} (16 August 1902 &amp;ndash; 4 July 1974) was a British [[historical romance]] and [[detective fiction]] novelist.  Her writing career began in 1921, when she turned a story for her younger brother into the novel ''[[The Black Moth]]''.  In 1925 Heyer married George Ronald Rougier, a mining engineer.  The couple spent several years living in [[Tanganyika]] and [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]] before returning to England in 1929. After her novel ''[[These Old Shades]]'' became popular despite its release during the [[UK General Strike of 1926|General Strike]], Heyer determined that publicity was not necessary for good sales.  For the rest of her life, she refused to grant interviews, telling a friend: &quot;My private life concerns no one but myself and my family.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hodge&quot;&gt;Hodge (1984), p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

Heyer essentially established the historical romance genre and its subgenre [[Regency romance]].  Her Regencies were inspired by [[Jane Austen]], but unlike Austen, who wrote about and for the times in which she lived, Heyer was forced to include copious information about the period so that her readers would understand the setting.  To ensure accuracy, Heyer collected reference works and kept detailed notes on all aspects of Regency life.  While some critics thought the novels were too detailed, others considered the level of detail to be Heyer's greatest asset.  Her meticulous nature was also evident in her [[historical fiction|historical novels]]; Heyer even recreated [[William the Conqueror|William the Conqueror's]] crossing into England for her novel ''[[The Conqueror (novel)|The Conqueror]]''.

Beginning in 1932, Heyer released one romance novel and one [[thriller (genre)|thriller]] each year.  Her husband often provided basic outlines for the plots of her thrillers, leaving Heyer to develop character relationships and dialogue so as to bring the story to life.  Although many critics describe Heyer's detective novels as unoriginal, others such as Nancy Wingate praise them &quot;for their wit and comedy as well as for their well-woven plots&quot;.&lt;ref name=wingate307&gt;Wingate (1976), p. 307.&lt;/ref&gt;

Her success was sometimes clouded by problems with tax inspectors and alleged plagiarists.  Heyer chose not to file lawsuits against the suspected literary thieves, but tried multiple ways of minimizing her tax liability.  Forced to put aside the works she called her &quot;magnum opus&quot; (a trilogy covering the [[House of Lancaster]]) to write more commercially successful works, Heyer eventually created a limited liability company to administer the rights to her novels.  She was accused several times of providing an overly large salary for herself, and in 1966 she sold the company and the rights to seventeen of her novels to [[Booker-McConnell]].  Heyer continued writing until her death in July 1974.  At that time, 48 of her novels were still in print; her last book, ''[[My Lord John]]'', was published posthumously.

==Early years==
Heyer was born in [[Wimbledon, London]] in 1902.  She was named after her father, George Heyer.&lt;ref name=hodge13/&gt;  Her mother, Sylvia Watkins, studied both cello and piano and was one of the top three students in her class at the [[Royal College of Music]].  Heyer's paternal grandfather had emigrated from [[Russia]], while her maternal grandparents owned tugboats on the [[River Thames]].&lt;ref name=byatt291&gt;Byatt (1975), p. 291.&lt;/ref&gt;

Heyer was the eldest of three children; her brothers George Boris (known as Boris) and Frank were four and nine years younger than she, respectively.&lt;ref name=hodge13&gt;Hodge (1984), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;  For part of her childhood, the family lived in [[Paris, France]], but they returned to England shortly after [[World War I]] broke out in 1914.&lt;ref name=&quot;hodge15&quot;&gt;Hodge (1984), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the family's surname had been pronounced &quot;higher&quot;, the advent of war led her father to use the pronunciation &quot;hair&quot; so they would not be mistaken for Germans.&lt;ref&gt;Hodge (1984), p .14.&lt;/ref&gt;  During the war, her father served as a requisitions officer for the [[British Army]] in France. After the war ended he was appointed a [[Member of the Order of the British Empire]] (MBE).&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=31684|supp=yes|startpage=15455|date=9 December 1919|accessdate=2008-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He left the army in 1920 with the rank of [[captain (OF-2)|captain]],&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=31897|supp=yes|startpage=5452|date=11 May 1920|accessdate=2008-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; taught at [[King's College London]] and sometimes wrote for ''[[Granta|The Granta]]''.&lt;ref name=hodge13/&gt;&lt;ref name=byatt291/&gt;

George Heyer strongly encouraged his children to read and never forbade any book.  Georgette read widely and often met with her friends [[Joanna Cannan]] and [[Carola Oman]] to discuss books.&lt;ref name=&quot;hodge16&quot;&gt;Hodge (1984), p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;  Heyer and Oman later shared their works-in-progress with each other and offered criticism.&lt;ref name=byatt293&gt;Byatt (1975), p. 293.&lt;/ref&gt;

When she was 17, Heyer began a serial story to amuse her brother Boris, who suffered from a form of [[haemophilia]] and was often weak.  Her father enjoyed listening to her story and asked her to prepare it for publication.  His agent found a publisher for her book, and ''[[The Black Moth]]'', about the adventures of a young man who took responsibility for his brother's card-cheating, was released in 1921.&lt;ref name=&quot;hodge16&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=hughes38/&gt;  According to her biographer [[Jane Aiken Hodge]], the novel contained many of the elements that would become standard for Heyer's novels, the &quot;saturnine male lead, the marriage in danger, the extravagant wife, and the group of idle, entertaining young men&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Hodge (1984), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;  The following year one of her contemporary [[short story|short stories]], &quot;A Proposal to Cicely&quot;, was published in ''Happy Magazine''.&lt;ref&gt;Fahnestock-Thomas (2001), p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage==
While holidaying with her family in December 1920, Heyer met George Ronald Rougier, who was  two years her senior.&lt;ref name=&quot;hodge21&quot;&gt;Hodge (1984), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;  The two became regular dance partners while Rougier studied at the [[Royal School of Mines]] to become a mining engineer.  In the spring of 1925, shortly after the publication of her fifth novel, they became engaged.  One month later, Heyer's father died of a heart attack.  He left no pension, and Heyer assumed financial responsibility for her brothers, aged 19 and 14.&lt;ref&gt;Hodge (1984), p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;  Two months after her father's death, on 18 August, Heyer and Rougier married in a simple ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;Hodge (194), p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1925 Rougier was sent to work in the [[Caucasus Mountains]], partly because he had learned Russian as a child.&lt;ref name=&quot;hodge27&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=byatt292&gt;Byatt (1975), p. 292.&lt;/ref&gt;  Heyer remained at home and continued to write.&lt;ref name=&quot;hodge27&quot;&gt;Hodge (1984), p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1926, she released ''[[These Old Shades]]'', in which the Duke of Avon courts his own [[ward (law)|ward]]. Unlike her first novel, ''These Old Shades'' focused more on personal relationships than on adventure.&lt;ref name=hughes38&gt;Hughes (1993), p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; The book appeared in the midst of the [[UK General Strike of 1926]]; as a result, the novel received no newspaper coverage, reviews, or advertising.  Nevertheless, the book sold 190,000&amp;nbsp;copies.&lt;ref&gt;Hodge (1984), p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;  Because the lack of publicity had not harmed the novel's sales, Heyer refused for the rest of her life to promote her books, even though her publishers often asked her to give interviews.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hodge-1984&quot;&gt;Hodge (1984), p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;  She once wrote to a friend that &quot;as for being photographed At Work or In my Old World Garden, that is the type of publicity which I find nauseating and quite unnecessary.  My private life concerns no one but myself and my family.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hodge&quot;/&gt;

Rougier returned home in the summer of 1926, but within months he was sent to the East African territory of [[Tanganyika]].  Heyer joined him there the following year.&lt;ref name=hodge2730/&gt;  They lived in a hut made of elephant grass located in [[the bush]];&lt;ref name=byatt293/&gt; Heyer was the first white woman her servants had ever seen.&lt;ref name=hodge2730/&gt; While in Tanganyika, Heyer wrote ''[[The Masqueraders]]''; set in 1745, the book follows the romantic adventures of siblings who pretend to be of the opposite sex in order to protect their family, all former [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]]s.  Although Heyer did not have access to all of her reference material, the book contained only one&amp;nbsp;anachronism: she placed the opening of [[White's]] a year too early.&lt;ref name=byatt293/&gt; She also wrote an account of her adventures, titled &quot;The Horned Beast of Africa&quot;, which was published in 1929 in the newspaper ''[[The Sphere (newspaper)|The Sphere]]''.&lt;ref name=ft4&gt;Fahnestock-Thomas (2001), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1928, Heyer followed her husband to [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]], where she almost died after a dentist improperly administered an anaesthetic.&lt;ref name=hodge2730/&gt;  She insisted they return to England before starting a family.  The following year Rougier left his job, making Heyer the primary breadwinner.&lt;ref name=hodge2730/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Byatt (1975), p. 294.&lt;/ref&gt;  After a failed experiment running a gas, [[coke (fuel)|coke]], and lighting company, Rougier purchased a sports shop in [[Horsham]] with money they borrowed from Heyer's aunts.  Heyer's brother Boris lived above the shop and helped Rougier, while Heyer continued to provide the bulk of the family's earnings with her writing.&lt;ref name=hodge2730&gt;Hodge (1984), pp. 27&amp;ndash;30.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regency romances==
Heyer's earliest works were [[romance novel]]s, most set before 1800.&lt;ref name=devlin361/&gt;  In 1935, she released ''[[Regency Buck]]'', her first novel set in the [[British Regency|Regency]] period.  This bestselling novel essentially established the genre of [[Regency romance]].&lt;ref name=mcdowell&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/features/cads-wanted-for-taming-572831.html|last=McDowell|first=Lesley|title=Cads wanted for taming; Hold on to your bodices: Dorothy L. Sayers and Georgette Heyer are making a comeback this year.  Lesley McDowell can't wait.|newspaper=[[The Independent|The Independent on Sunday]]|location=London|date=11 January 2004|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Unlike other romance novels of the period, Heyer's novels used the setting as a plot device.  Many of her characters exhibited modern-day sensibilities; more conventional characters in the novels would point out the heroine's eccentricities, such as wanting to marry for love.&lt;ref&gt;Regis (2003), p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt;  The books were set almost entirely in the world of the wealthy upper class&lt;ref name=laski283&gt;Laski (1970), p. 283.&lt;/ref&gt; and only occasionally mention poverty, religion, or politics.&lt;ref&gt;Laski (1970), p. 285.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington by Robert Home cropped.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Heyer claimed that every word uttered by [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|The Duke of Wellington]] in her novel ''[[An Infamous Army]]'' was spoken or written by him in real life.]]
Although the [[British Regency]] lasted only from 1811 to 1820, Heyer's romances were set between 1752 and 1825.  As noted by literary critic Kay Mussell, the books revolved around a &quot;structured social ritual — the marriage market represented by the [[Season (society)|London season]]&quot; where &quot;all are in danger of ostracism for inappropriate behavior&quot;.&lt;ref name=mussell413&gt;Mussell (1984), p. 413.&lt;/ref&gt;  Her Regency romances were inspired by the writings of [[Jane Austen]], whose novels were set in the same era.  Austen's works, however, were contemporary novels, describing the times in which she lived. According to Pamela Regis in her work ''A Natural History of the Romance Novel'', because Heyer's stories took place amidst events that had occurred over 100&amp;nbsp;years earlier, she had to include more detail on the period in order for her readers to understand it.&lt;ref name=regis125126&gt;Regis (2003), pp. 125–126.&lt;/ref&gt;  While Austen could ignore the &quot;minutiae of dress and decor&quot;,&lt;ref name=robinson322/&gt; Heyer included those details &quot;to invest the novels&amp;nbsp;... with 'the tone of the time'&quot;.&lt;ref name=robinson323&gt;Robinson (1978), p. 323.&lt;/ref&gt;  Later reviewers, such as [[Lillian Robinson]], criticized Heyer's &quot;passion for the specific fact without concern for its significance&quot;,&lt;ref name=robinson326&gt;Robinson (1978), p. 326.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Marghanita Laski]] pointed out that &quot;these aspects on which Heyer is so dependent for her creation of atmosphere are just those which Jane Austen&amp;nbsp;... referred to only when she wanted to show that a character was vulgar or ridiculous&quot;.&lt;ref name=laski284&gt;Laski (1970), p. 284.&lt;/ref&gt;  Others, including [[A. S. Byatt]], believe that Heyer's &quot;awareness of this atmosphere — both of the minute details of the social pursuits of her leisured classes and of the emotional structure behind the fiction it produced — is her greatest asset&quot;.&lt;ref name=byatt275&gt;Byatt (1969), p. 275.&lt;/ref&gt;

Determined to make her novels as accurate as possible, Heyer collected reference works and research materials to use while writing.&lt;ref name=hodge43/&gt;  At the time of her death she owned over 1,000 historical reference books, including [[Debrett's]] and an 1808 dictionary of the [[House of Lords]].  In addition to the standard historical works about the medieval and eighteenth-century periods, her library included histories of [[Decorative boxes#Snuff box|snuff boxes]], sign posts, and [[1795–1820 in fashion|costumes]].&lt;ref name=byatt300&gt;Byatt (1975), p. 300.&lt;/ref&gt;  She often clipped illustrations from magazine articles and jotted down interesting vocabulary or facts onto note cards, but rarely recorded where she found the information.&lt;ref name=hodge43&gt;Hodge (1984), pp. 43, 46.&lt;/ref&gt;  Her notes were sorted into categories, such as  Beauty, Colours, Dress, Hats, Household, Prices, and Shops; and even included details such as the cost of candles in a particular year.&lt;ref name=byatt300/&gt;&lt;ref name=byatt301&gt;Byatt (1975), p. 301.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other notebooks contained lists of phrases, covering such topics as &quot;Food and Crockery&quot;, &quot;Endearments&quot;, and &quot;Forms of Address.&quot;&lt;ref name=byatt301/&gt;  One of her publishers, [[Max Reinhardt (publisher)|Max Reinhardt]], once attempted to offer editorial suggestions about the language in one of her books but was promptly informed by a member of his staff that no one in England knew more about Regency language than Heyer.&lt;ref&gt;Byatt (1975), p. 298.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the interests of accuracy, Heyer once purchased a letter written by [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|the Duke of Wellington]] so that she could precisely employ his style of writing.&lt;ref&gt;Hodge (1984), p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;  She claimed that every word attributed to Wellington in ''An Infamous Army'' was actually spoken or written by him in real life.&lt;ref&gt;Byatt (1969), p. 276.&lt;/ref&gt;  Her knowledge of the period was so extensive that Heyer rarely mentioned dates explicitly in her books; instead, she situated the story by casually referring to major and minor events of the time.&lt;ref&gt;Hodge (1984), p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thrillers==
[[Image:William I, Lichfield Cathedral.jpg|thumbnail|right|180px|left|[[William I of England|William the Conqueror]], depicted in this statue on the West Front of [[Lichfield Cathedral]], was featured in Heyer's first novel of [[historical fiction]].]]
In 1931, Heyer released ''[[The Conqueror (novel)|The Conqueror]]'', her first novel of  historical fiction to give a fictionalized account of real historical events.  She researched the life of [[William the Conqueror]] thoroughly, even travelling the route that William took when crossing into England.&lt;ref&gt;Hodge (1984), p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;  The following year, Heyer's writing took an even more drastic departure from her early historical romances when she released her first thriller, ''Footsteps in the Dark''.  The novel's publication coincided with the birth of her only child, [[Richard George Rougier]], whom she called her &quot;most notable (indeed peerless) work&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;hodge35&quot;&gt;Hodge (1984), p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;  Later in her life, Heyer requested that her publishers refrain from reprinting ''Footsteps in the Dark'', saying &quot;This work, published simultaneously with my son&amp;nbsp;... was the first of my thrillers and was perpetuated while I was, as any Regency character would have said, increasing.  One husband and two ribald brothers all had fingers in it, and I do not claim it as a Major Work.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hodge (1984), p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the next several years Heyer published one romance novel and one thriller each year.  The romances were far more popular: they usually sold 115,000&amp;nbsp;copies, while her thrillers sold 16,000&amp;nbsp;copies.&lt;ref&gt;Hodge (1984), p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to her son, Heyer &quot;regarded the writing of mystery stories rather as we would regard tackling a crossword puzzle &amp;ndash; an intellectual diversion before the harder tasks of life have to be faced&quot;.&lt;ref name=devlin361&gt;Devlin (1984), p. 361.&lt;/ref&gt; Heyer's husband was involved in much of her writing. He often read the proofs of her historical romances to catch any errors that she might have missed, and served as a collaborator for her thrillers.  He provided the plots of the detective stories, describing the actions of characters &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;hodge40&quot;&gt;Hodge (1984), p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;  Heyer would then create the characters and the relationships between them and bring the plot points to life.  She found it difficult at times to rely on someone else's plots; on at least one occasion, before writing the last chapter of a book, she asked Rougier to explain once again how the murder was really committed.&lt;ref name=&quot;hodge40&quot;/&gt;

Her detective stories, which, according to critic Earl F. Bargainnier, &quot;specialize[d] in upper-class family murders&quot;, were known primarily for their comedy, melodrama, and romance.&lt;ref&gt;Bargainnier (1982), pp. 342, 343.&lt;/ref&gt; The comedy derived not from the action but from the personalities and dialogue of the characters.&lt;ref&gt;Bargainnier (1982), p. 352.&lt;/ref&gt;  In most of these novels, all set in the time they were written,&lt;ref&gt;Devlin (1984), p. 360.&lt;/ref&gt; the focus relied primarily on the hero, with a lesser role for the heroine.&lt;ref&gt;Bargainnier (1982), p. 350.&lt;/ref&gt;  Her early mystery novels often featured athletic heroes; once Heyer's husband began pursuing his lifelong dream of becoming a [[barrister]], the novels began to feature solicitors and barristers in lead roles.&lt;ref&gt;Hodge (1984), p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1935, Heyer's thrillers began following a pair of detectives named Superintendent Hannasyde and Sergeant (later Inspector) Hemingway.  The two were never as popular as other contemporary fictional detectives such as Agatha Christie's [[Hercule Poirot]] and Dorothy L. Sayers's [[Lord Peter Wimsey]].&lt;ref&gt;Hodge (1984), p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the books featuring Heyer's characters, ''Death in the Stocks'', was dramatized in New York City in 1937 as ''Merely Murder''.  The play focused on the comedy rather than the mystery,&lt;ref&gt;Devlin (1984), p. 371.&lt;/ref&gt; and it closed after three nights.&lt;ref name=&quot;hodge43&quot;&gt;Hodge (1984), p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to critic Nancy Wingate, Heyer's detective novels, the last written in 1953,&lt;ref&gt;Wingate (1976), p. 311.&lt;/ref&gt; often featured unoriginal methods, motives, and characters, with seven of them using inheritance as the motive.&lt;ref name=wingate307/&gt; The novels were always set in London, a small village, or at a houseparty.&lt;ref name=wingate308&gt;Wingate (1976), p. 308.&lt;/ref&gt; Critic Erik Routley labelled many of her characters clichés, including the uneducated policeman, an exotic Spanish dancer, and a country [[vicar]] with a neurotic wife. In one of her novels, the characters' surnames were even in alphabetical order according to the order they were introduced.&lt;ref name=routley&gt;Routley (1972), pp. 286&amp;ndash;287.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Wingate, Heyer's detective stories, like many of the others of the time, exhibited a distinct snobbery towards foreigners and the lower classes.&lt;ref&gt;Wingate (1976), p. 309.&lt;/ref&gt; Her middle-class men were often crude and stupid, while the women were either incredibly practical or exhibited poor judgement, usually using poor grammar that could become vicious.&lt;ref name=robinson3301331&gt;Robinson (1978), pp. 330&amp;ndash;331.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the stereotypes, however, Routley maintains that Heyer had &quot;a quite remarkable gift for reproducing the brittle and ironic conversation of the upper middle class Englishwoman of that age (immediately before 1940)&quot;.&lt;ref name=routley/&gt;&lt;!--Note, the (immediately before 1940) part was in the original quotation --&gt;  Wingate further mentions that Heyer's thrillers were known &quot;for their wit and comedy as well as for their well-woven plots&quot;.&lt;ref name=wingate307/&gt;

==Financial problems==
In 1939, Rougier was [[called to the Bar]], and the family moved first to [[Brighton]], then to [[Hove]], so that Rougier could easily commute to London.  The following year, they sent their son to a preparatory school, creating an additional expense for Heyer.  During World War II, her brothers served in the [[British Armed Forces|armed forces]], alleviating one of her monetary worries.  Her husband, meanwhile, served in the [[Home Guard (United Kingdom)|Home Guard]].&lt;ref&gt;Hodge (1984), pp. 56, 57, 61.&lt;/ref&gt;  As he was new to his career, Rougier did not earn much money, and paper rationing during the war caused lower sales of Heyer's books.  To meet their expenses Heyer sold the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] rights for ''These Old Shades'', ''[[Devil's Cub]]'', and ''Regency Buck'' to her publisher, [[Heinemann (book publisher)|Heinemann]], for £750. A contact at the publishing house, her close friend A.S. Frere, later offered to return the rights to her for the same amount of money she was paid.  Heyer refused to accept the deal, explaining that she had given her word to transfer the rights.&lt;ref&gt;Hodge (1984), pp. 61, 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

After having lunch with a representative from [[Hodder &amp; Stoughton]], who published her detective stories, Heyer felt that her host had patronized her.  The company had an option on her next book; to make them break her contract,&lt;ref name=hodge63/&gt; she wrote ''Penhallow'', which the 1944 ''Book Review Digest'' described as &quot;a murder story but not a mystery story&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;1944 Book Review Digest, p. 374.&lt;/ref&gt;  Hodder &amp; Stoughton turned the book down, thus ending their association with Heyer, and Heinemann agreed to publish it instead.  Her publisher in the United States, [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]], also disliked the book and ended their relationship with Heyer after its publication.&lt;ref name=hodge63&gt;Hodge (1984), p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Blitz]] bombing of 1940&amp;ndash;41 disrupted train travel in Britain, prompting Heyer and her family to move to London in 1942 so that Rougier would be closer to his work.  To earn more money,  Heyer reviewed books for Heinemann, earning 2&amp;nbsp;[[guinea (British coin)|guineas]] for each review.&lt;ref&gt;Hodge (1984), pp. 66&amp;ndash;67.&lt;/ref&gt;  She also allowed her novels to be serialized in ''Women's Journal'' prior to their publication as hardcover books.  The appearance of a Heyer novel usually caused the magazine to sell out completely, but she complained that they &quot;always like[d] my worst work&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hodge-1984&quot;/&gt;

To minimize her tax liability, Heyer formed a [[limited liability company]] called Heron Enterprises around 1950.  Royalties from new titles would be paid to the company, which would then furnish Heyer's salary and pay directors' fees to her family.  She would continue to receive royalties from her previous titles, and foreign royalties – except for those from the United States – would go to her mother.&lt;ref&gt;Hodge (1984), p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; Within several years, however, a tax inspector found that Heyer was withdrawing too much money from the company.  The inspector considered the extra funds as undisclosed dividends, meaning that she owed an additional £3,000 in taxes.   To pay the tax bill, Heyer wrote two articles, &quot;Books about the Brontës&quot; and &quot;How to be a Literary Writer&quot;, that were published in the magazine ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]''.&lt;ref name=ft4/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hodge (1984), p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt;  She once wrote to a friend, &quot;I'm getting so ''tired'' of writing books for the benefit of the Treasury and I can't tell you how utterly I resent the squandering of ''my'' money on such fatuous things as Education and Making Life Easy and Luxurious for So-Called Workers.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Byatt (1975), p. 302.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:John of Lancaster Arms.svg|thumb|upright|right|This coat of arms belonged to [[John of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Bedford|John, Duke of Bedford]], who Heyer intended to feature in her &quot;magnum opus&quot;.]]

In 1950, Heyer began working on what she called &quot;the magnum opus of my latter years&quot;, a medieval trilogy intended to cover the [[House of Lancaster]] between 1393 and 1435.&lt;ref name=devlin390/&gt;  She estimated that she would need five years to complete the works.  Her impatient readers continually clamored for new books; to satisfy them and her tax liabilities, Heyer interrupted herself to write Regency romances.  She only completed volume one of the series, ''[[My Lord John]]'', which was published posthumously.&lt;ref name=devlin390&gt;Devlin (1984), p. 390.&lt;/ref&gt;

The limited liability company continued to vex Heyer, and in 1966, after tax inspectors found that she owed the company £20,000, she finally fired her accountants.  She then asked that the rights to her newest book, ''[[Black Sheep (novel)|Black Sheep]]'', be issued to her personally.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hodge-1984_2&quot;&gt;Hodge (1984), p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike her other novels, ''Black Sheep'' did not focus on members of the aristocracy.  Instead, it followed &quot;the moneyed middle class&quot;, with finance a dominant theme in the novel.&lt;ref&gt;Hodge (1984), p. 174.&lt;/ref&gt;

Heyer's new accountants urged her to abandon Heron Enterprises; after two&amp;nbsp;years, she finally agreed to sell the company to [[Booker-McConnell]], which already owned the rights to the estates of novelists [[Ian Fleming]] and [[Agatha Christie]].  Booker-McConnell paid her approximately £85,000 for the rights to the 17 Heyer titles owned by the company.  This amount was taxed at the lower capital transfer rate, rather than the higher income tax rate.&lt;ref&gt;Hodge (1984), pp. 180&amp;ndash;181.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Imitators==
As Heyer's popularity increased, other authors began to imitate her style.  Around 1950, one of her readers notified her that another author had written several novels in a style similar to Heyer's.  The offending novelist even reused names and character traits from her books.  Heyer seriously considered filing a lawsuit but dismissed the idea when no new works by the other author were announced.&lt;ref&gt;Hodge (1984), pp. 86&amp;ndash;87.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1974, however, this author released a new novel which combined plot elements and proper names from multiple Heyer novels and duplicated much of her phrasing.  Heyer's lawyers again counseled restraint.  Rather than file a lawsuit, they suggested that she leak the copying to the press.  Heyer refused.&lt;ref&gt;Hodge (1984), p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1961, another reader wrote of similarities found in a different author's works.  The novels borrowed plot points, characters, surnames, and plentiful Regency slang.  After fans accused Heyer of &quot;publishing shoddy stuff under a pseudonym&quot;, Heyer wrote to the other publisher to complain.&lt;ref name=&quot;hodge1401&quot;&gt;Hodge (1984), pp. 140&amp;ndash;141.&lt;/ref&gt;  The author denied the accusations, so Heyer made a thorough list of the borrowings and historical mistakes in the books.  Among these were repeated use of the phrase &quot;to make a cake of oneself&quot;, which Heyer had discovered in a privately printed memoir unavailable to the public.  In another case, the author referenced a historical incident that Heyer had invented in an earlier novel.  Heyer sought a lawyer's opinion but ultimately chose not to sue.&lt;ref name=&quot;hodge1401&quot;/&gt;

==Later years==
In 1959, Rougier became a [[Queen's Counsel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=41676|startpage=2264|date=7 April 1959|accessdate=2008-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The following year, their son Richard fell in love with the estranged wife of an acquaintance.  Richard assisted the woman, Susanna Flint, in leaving her husband, and the couple married after her divorce was finalized.  Heyer was shocked at the impropriety but soon came to love her daughter-in-law, later describing her as &quot;the daughter we never had and thought we didn't want&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Hodge (1984), pp. 141, 151.&lt;/ref&gt;  Richard and his wife raised her two sons from her first marriage and provided Heyer with her only biological grandchild in 1966, when their son Nicholas Rougier was born.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hodge-1984_2&quot;/&gt;

As Heyer aged she began to suffer more frequent health problems.   In June 1964, she underwent surgery to remove a kidney stone.  Although the doctors initially predicted a six-week recovery, after two months they predicted that it might be a year or longer before she felt completely well. The following year, she suffered a mosquito bite which turned septic, prompting the doctors to offer skin grafts.&lt;ref&gt;Hodge (1984), pp. 163, 165.&lt;/ref&gt;  In July 1973 she suffered a slight stroke and spent three weeks in a nursing home.  When her brother Boris died later that year, Heyer was too ill to travel to his funeral.  She suffered another stroke in February 1974.  Three months later, she was diagnosed with lung cancer, which her biographer attributed to the 60&amp;ndash;80 cork-tipped cigarettes that Heyer smoked each day (although she claimed not to inhale).   On 4 July 1974, Heyer died.  Her fans learned her married name for the first time from her obituaries.&lt;ref&gt;Hodge (1984), pp. 175, 204&amp;ndash;206.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
[[Image:Edmund Blair Leighton - On the Threshold.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[Edmund Blair Leighton]] painted &quot;On the Threshold (of a Proposal)&quot;.  It depicts a courtship in [[Regency England]], similar to those described in Heyer's [[historical romance]]s.]]
Besides her success in the United Kingdom, Heyer's novels were very popular in the United States and Germany and achieved respectable sales in [[Czechoslovakia]].&lt;ref name=hebert/&gt; A first printing of one of her novels in the Commonwealth often consisted of 65,000&amp;ndash;75,000 copies,&lt;ref name=reinhardt&gt;Reinhardt (1974), pp. 257&amp;ndash;258.&lt;/ref&gt; and her novels collectively sold over 100,000&amp;nbsp;copies in hardback each year.&lt;ref name=hebert&gt;Hebert (1974), pp. 254&amp;ndash;255.&lt;/ref&gt;  Her paperbacks usually sold over 500,000&amp;nbsp;copies each.&lt;ref name=byatt297/&gt;  At the time of her death 48 of her books were still in print, including her first novel, ''The Black Moth''.&lt;ref name=hartdavis&gt;Hart-Davis (1974), pp. 258&amp;ndash;259.&lt;/ref&gt;

Her books were very popular during the [[Great Depression]] and World War II.  Her novels, which journalist Lesley McDowell described as containing &quot;derring-do, dashing blades, and maids in peril&quot;, allowed readers to escape from the mundane and difficult elements of their lives.&lt;ref name=mcdowell/&gt;  In a letter describing her novel ''Friday's Child'', Heyer commented, &quot;'I think myself I ought to be shot for writing such nonsense. ... But it's unquestionably good escapist literature and I think I should rather like it if I were sitting in an air-raid shelter or recovering from flu.&quot;&lt;ref name=mcdowell/&gt;

Heyer essentially invented the historical romance&lt;ref name=hisromance&gt;A historical romance is a [[romance novel]] set in the past.  This is not to be confused with historical fiction that was influenced by [[romanticism]].&lt;/ref&gt;  and created the subgenre of the [[Regency romance]].&lt;ref name=regis125126/&gt;  When first released as mass market paperbacks in the United States in 1966, her novels were described as being &quot;in the tradition of Jane Austen&quot;.&lt;ref name=robinson322&gt;Robinson (1978), p. 322.&lt;/ref&gt;  As other novelists began to imitate her style and continue to develop the Regency romance, their novels have been described as &quot;following in the romantic tradition of Georgette Heyer&quot;.&lt;ref name=robinson322/&gt;  According to Kay Mussell, &quot;virtually every Regency writer covets [that] accolade&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Mussell (1984), p. 412.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite her popularity and success, Heyer was ignored by critics.  Although none of her novels were ever reviewed in a serious newspaper,&lt;ref name=byatt297&gt;Byatt (1975), p. 297.&lt;/ref&gt; according to [[Duff Hart-Davis]], &quot;the absence of long or serious reviews never worried her.  What mattered was the fact that her stories sold in ever-increasing numbers&quot;.&lt;ref name=hartdavis/&gt;  Heyer was also overlooked by the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''.  The 1974 edition of the encyclopædia, published shortly after her death, included entries on popular writers Agatha Christie and Dorothy Sayers, but did not mention Heyer.&lt;ref&gt;Fahnestock-Thomas (2001), p. 261.&lt;/ref&gt;
