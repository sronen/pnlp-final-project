'''Jorge Mario Pedro Vargas Llosa, 1st Marquis of Vargas Llosa''' ({{IPA-es|ˈmaɾjo ˈbaɾɣas ˈʎosa}}; born March 28, 1936) is a Peruvian-Spanish writer, politician, journalist, essayist, and recipient of the 2010 [[Nobel Prize in Literature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/perus-mario-vargas-llosa-wins-nobel-literature-prize-2100592.html|title=Peru's Mario Vargas Llosa wins Nobel Literature Prize|publisher=[[The Independent]] | location=London|date=October 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vargas Llosa is one of Latin America's most significant novelists and essayists, and one of the leading authors of his generation. Some critics consider him to have had a larger international impact and worldwide audience than any other writer of the [[Latin American Boom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Boland|Harvey|1988|p=7}} and {{Harvnb|Cevallos|1991|p=272}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon announcing the 2010 Nobel Prize in Literature, the [[Swedish Academy]] said it had been given to Vargas Llosa &quot;for his cartography of structures of power and his trenchant images of the individual's resistance, revolt, and defeat&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Nobel Prize in Literature 2010|publisher=Nobelprize|date=October 7, 2010|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/2010/|accessdate=October 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vargas Llosa rose to fame in the 1960s with novels such as ''[[The Time of the Hero]]'' (''La ciudad y los perros'', literally ''The City and the Dogs'', 1963/1966&lt;ref&gt;The first year given is the original publication date; the second is the year of English publication.&lt;/ref&gt;), ''[[The Green House]]'' (''La casa verde'', 1965/1968), and the monumental ''[[Conversation in the Cathedral]]'' (''Conversación en la catedral'', 1969/1975). He writes prolifically across an array of [[literary genre]]s, including [[literary criticism]] and journalism.  His novels include comedies, murder mysteries, historical novels, and political thrillers. Several, such as ''[[Captain Pantoja and the Special Service]]'' (1973/1978) and ''[[Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter]]'' (1977/1982), have been adapted as feature films.

Many of Vargas Llosa's works are influenced by the writer's perception of [[Peru]]vian society and his own experiences as a native Peruvian.  Increasingly, however, he has expanded his range, and tackled themes that arise from other parts of the world.  Another change over the course of his career has been a shift from a style and approach associated with literary modernism, to a sometimes playful postmodernism.

Like many Latin American authors, Vargas Llosa has been politically active throughout his career; over the course of his life, he has gradually moved from the [[political left]] towards [[liberalism]] or [[neoliberalism]], a definitively more [[conservative]] political position. While he initially supported the Cuban revolutionary government of [[Fidel Castro]], Vargas Llosa later became disenchanted with the Cuban [[dictator]] and his [[authoritarian regime]]. He ran for the [[List of Presidents of Peru|Peruvian presidency]] in 1990 with the center-right ''[[Democratic Front (Peru)|Frente Democrático]]'' (FREDEMO) coalition, advocating [[neoliberal]] reforms, but lost the election to [[Alberto Fujimori]]. He has subsequently supported moderate conservative candidates until the [[Two-round system|run-off]] to the [[Peruvian general election, 2011|2011 presidential election]] in which he supported the left-wing [[Ollanta Humala]] rather than his right-wing rival [[Keiko Fujimori]].

==Early life and family==
Mario Vargas Llosa was born to a middle-class family&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Williams|2001|pp=15–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; on March 28, 1936, in the [[Peru]]vian provincial city of [[Arequipa]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Williams17&quot;/&gt; He was the only child of Ernesto Vargas Maldonado and Dora Llosa Ureta (the former a radio operator in an aviation company, the latter the daughter of an old [[Criollo (people)|criollo]] family), who separated a few months before his birth.&lt;ref name=&quot;Williams17&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Williams|2001|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after Mario's birth, his father revealed that he was having an affair with a German woman; consequently, Mario has two younger half-brothers: Enrique and Ernesto Vargas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Morote|1998|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Mario vargas llosa tesis universidad de san marcos 1.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Mario Vargas Llosa's [[thesis]] «Bases para una interpretación de [[Rubén Darío]]», presented to his ''alma mater'', the [[National University of San Marcos]] ([[Peru]]), in 1958.]]
Vargas Llosa lived with his maternal family in Arequipa until a year after his parents' divorce, when his maternal grandfather was named [[honorary consul]] for Peru in [[Bolivia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Williams17&quot;/&gt; With his mother and her family, Vargas Llosa then moved to [[Cochabamba]], Bolivia, where he spent the early years of his childhood.&lt;ref name=&quot;Williams17&quot;/&gt; His maternal family, the Llosas, were sustained by his grandfather, who managed a cotton farm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Morote|1998|pp=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a child, Vargas Llosa was led to believe that his father had died—his mother and her family did not want to explain that his parents had separated.&lt;ref name=&quot;Williams24&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Williams|2001|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the government of Peruvian President [[José Bustamante y Rivero]], Vargas Llosa's maternal grandfather obtained a diplomatic post in the Peruvian coastal city of [[Piura]] and the entire family returned to Peru.&lt;ref name=&quot;Williams24&quot;/&gt; While in Piura, Vargas Llosa attended elementary school at the religious academy ''Colegio [[Salesian]]o''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Williams30&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Williams|2001|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1946, at the age of ten, he moved to [[Lima]] and met his father for the first time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Williams30&quot;/&gt; His parents re-established their relationship and lived in [[Magdalena del Mar]], a middle-class Lima suburb, during his teenage years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb |Williams|2001|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; While in Lima, he studied at the ''Colegio La Salle'', a Christian middle school, from 1947 to 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Williams|2001|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Vargas Llosa was fourteen, his father sent him to the [[Leoncio Prado Military Academy]] in Lima.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Vincent|2007|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; A year before his graduation, Vargas Llosa began working as an amateur journalist for local newspapers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Castro9&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Castro-Klarén|1990|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; He withdrew from the military academy and finished his &lt;!--high school?--&gt;studies in Piura, where he worked for the local newspaper, ''La Industria'', and witnessed the theatrical performance of his first dramatic work, ''La huida del Inca''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Williams|2001|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1953, during the government of [[Manuel A. Odría]], Vargas Llosa enrolled in Lima's [[National University of San Marcos]], the oldest university of the Americas, to study law and literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Williams|2001|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; He married [[Julia Urquidi]], his maternal uncle's sister-in-law&lt;!--that's his aunt's sister, right?--&gt;, in 1955 at the age of 19; she was 10&amp;nbsp;years older.&lt;ref name=&quot;Castro9&quot; /&gt; Vargas Llosa began his literary career in earnest in 1957 with the publication of his first short stories, &quot;The Leaders&quot; (&quot;Los jefes&quot;) and &quot;The Grandfather&quot; (&quot;El abuelo&quot;), while working for two Peruvian newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;The newspapers were ''El Mercurio Peruano'' and ''El Comercio''. {{Harvnb|Castro-Klarén|1990|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon his graduation from the National University of San Marcos in 1958, he received a scholarship to study at the [[Complutense University of Madrid]] in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Williams|2001|p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1960, after his scholarship in Madrid had expired, Vargas Llosa moved to France under the impression that he would receive a scholarship to study there; however, upon arriving in Paris, he learned that his scholarship request was denied.&lt;ref name=&quot;Williams45&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Williams|2001|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite Mario and Julia's unexpected financial status, the couple decided to remain in Paris where he began to write prolifically.&lt;ref name=&quot;Williams45&quot; /&gt; Their marriage lasted only a few more years, ending in divorce in 1964.&lt;ref name=&quot;Williams54&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Williams|2001|p=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; A year later, Vargas Llosa married his first cousin, Patricia Llosa,&lt;ref name=&quot;Williams54&quot; /&gt; with whom he had three children: [[Álvaro Vargas Llosa]] (born 1966), a writer and editor; Gonzalo (born 1967), a businessman; and Morgana (born 1974), a photographer.

==Writing career==
===Beginning and first major works===
Vargas Llosa's first novel, ''[[The Time of the Hero]]'' (''La ciudad y los perros''), was published in 1963.  The book is set among a community of cadets in a Lima military school, and the plot is based on the author's own experiences at Lima's [[Leoncio Prado Military Academy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Kristal32&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Kristal|1998|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; This early piece gained wide public attention and immediate success.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cevallos273&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Cevallos|1991|p=273}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its vitality and adept use of sophisticated literary techniques immediately impressed critics,&lt;ref name=&quot;Kristal33&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Kristal|1998|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it won the ''[[Premio de la Crítica Española]]'' award.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cevallos273&quot; /&gt; Nevertheless, its sharp criticism of the Peruvian military establishment led to controversy in Peru. Several Peruvian generals attacked the novel, claiming that it was the work of a &quot;degenerate mind&quot; and stating that Vargas Llosa was &quot;paid by Ecuador&quot; to undermine the prestige of the Peruvian Army.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cevallos273&quot; /&gt;

In 1965, Vargas Llosa published his second novel, ''[[The Green House]]'' (''La casa verde''), about a brothel called &quot;The Green House&quot; and how its quasi-mythical presence affects the lives of the characters. The main plot follows Bonifacia, a girl who is about to receive the vows of the church, and her transformation into ''la Selvatica'', the best-known prostitute of &quot;The Green House&quot;.  The novel was immediately acclaimed, confirming Vargas Llosa as an important voice of Latin American narrative.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kristal xi&quot;/&gt; ''The Green House'' won the first edition of the [[Rómulo Gallegos Prize|Rómulo Gallegos International Novel Prize]] in 1967, contending with works by veteran [[Uruguay]]an writer [[Juan Carlos Onetti]] and by [[Gabriel García Márquez]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Armas Marcelo|2002|p=102}}.  See also {{citation|title=I Edition of the International Novel Prize Rómulo Gallegos| publisher = Gobierno Bolivariano de Venezuela Ministerio del Poder Popular para La Cultura | url=http://www.celarg.org.ve/Ingles/Premio%20Romulo%20Gallegos%201%20Edicion.htm|accessdate=April 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This novel alone accumulated enough awards to place the author among the leading figures of the [[Latin American Boom]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Booker6&quot; /&gt; Some critics still consider ''The Green House'' to be Vargas Llosa's finest and most important achievement.&lt;ref name=&quot;Booker6&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Booker|1994|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, Latin American literary critic [[Gerald Martin]] suggests that ''The Green House'' is &quot;one of the greatest novels to have emerged from Latin America&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Booker6&quot; /&gt;

Vargas Llosa's third novel, ''[[Conversation in the Cathedral]]'' (''Conversación en la catedral''), was published in 1969, when he was 33. This ambitious narrative is the story of Santiago Zavala, the son of a government minister, and Ambrosio, his chauffeur.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb| Kristal |1998|p=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; A random meeting at a [[dog pound]] leads the pair to a riveting conversation at a nearby bar known as &quot;The Cathedral&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Castro-Klarén|1990|p=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the encounter, Zavala searches for the truth about his father's role in the murder of a notorious Peruvian underworld figure, shedding light on the workings of a dictatorship along the way. Unfortunately for Zavala, his quest results in a dead end with no answers and no sign of a better future.&lt;ref name=&quot;Castro106&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Castro-Klarén|1990|p=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; The novel attacks the dictatorial government of Odría by showing how a dictatorship controls and destroys lives.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cevallos273&quot; /&gt; The persistent theme of hopelessness makes ''Conversation in the Cathedral'' Vargas Llosa's most bitter novel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Castro106&quot;/&gt;

===1970s and the &quot;discovery of humor&quot;===
In 1971, Vargas Llosa published ''García Márquez: Story of a Deicide'' (''García Márquez: historia de un deicidio''), which was his doctoral thesis for the Complutense University of Madrid.&lt;ref&gt;Jaime Perales Contreras, review of Mario Vargas Llosa, ''Obras Completas'', Vol. VI, Tomo. I, in ''Americas Magazine'' ,Organization of American States, July–August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Shaw431&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Shaw|1973|p=431}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Vargas Llosa wrote this book-length study about his then friend, [[Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel prize]]-winning Colombian author Gabriel García Márquez, they have not spoken to each other in more than 30&amp;nbsp;years. In 1976, Vargas Llosa punched García Márquez in the face in [[Mexico City]] at the ''[[Palacio de Bellas Artes]]'', ending the friendship.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Todo occurrió en 1976, en el Palacio de Bellas Artes de la ciudad de México.  [. . .]  todos los presentes quedaron impresionados y sorprendidos por el puñetazo que MVLL propinó a García Márquez cuando el escritor colombiano venía a abrazar al novelista peruano.&quot; {{Harvnb|Armas Marcelo|2002|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--  Journalist Francisco Igartua, Vargas Llosa’s friend, witnessed the event. In his book, ''Huellas de un Destierro'', Igartua states that after knocking García Márquez out, leaving him on the floor, Vargas Llosa said: &quot;That’s for what you did to Patricia in Barcelona.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Esto es por lo que le hiciste a Patricia en Barcelona.&quot; {{Harvnb|Igartua|1998|p=??}}. See also {{Harvnb|Coca|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;   --&gt; Neither writer has publicly stated the underlying reasons for the quarrel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dammann|2007|}}&lt;/ref&gt; A photograph of García Márquez sporting a black eye was published in 2007, reigniting public interest in the feud.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cohen&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Cohen|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the decades of silence, in 2007, Vargas Llosa agreed to allow part of his book to be used as the introduction to a 40th-anniversary edition of García Márquez's ''[[One Hundred Years of Solitude]]'', which was re-released in Spain and throughout Latin America that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Vincent|2007|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Historia de un Deicidio'' was also reissued in that year, as part of Vargas Llosa's complete works.

Following the monumental work ''Conversation in the Cathedral'', Vargas Llosa's output shifted away from more serious themes such as politics and problems with society. Latin American literary scholar Raymond L. Williams describes this phase in his writing career as &quot;the discovery of humor&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;QC273&quot;&gt;Qtd. in {{Harvnb|Cevallos|1991|p=273}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first attempt at a satirical novel was ''Captain Pantoja and the Special Service'' (''Pantaleón y las visitadoras''), published in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Castro-Klarén|1990|p=136}}&lt;/ref&gt; This short, comic novel offers vignettes of dialogues and documents about the Peruvian armed forces and a corps of prostitutes assigned to visit military outposts in remote jungle areas.&lt;ref name=&quot;Booker33&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Booker|1994|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; These plot elements are similar to Vargas Llosa's earlier novel ''The Green House'', but in a different form.  As such, ''Captain Pantoja and the Special Service'' is essentially a [[parody]] of both ''The Green House'' and the literary approach that novel represents.&lt;ref name=&quot;Booker33&quot; /&gt; Vargas Llosa's motivation to write the novel came from actually witnessing prostitutes being hired by the Peruvian Army and brought to serve soldiers in the jungle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Setti|1989|p=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1974 to 1987, Vargas Llosa focused on his writing, but also took the time to pursue other endeavors.&lt;ref name=&quot;Williams60&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Williams|2001|p=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975, he co-directed an unsuccessful motion-picture adaptation of his novel, ''Captain Pantoja and the Secret Service''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Williams60&quot;/&gt; Following this he was elected President of the [[International PEN]], a worldwide association of writers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Williams60&quot;/&gt; During this time, Vargas Llosa constantly traveled to speak at conferences organized by internationally renowned institutions, such as the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] and the [[University of Cambridge]], where he was Simón Bolívar Professor and an Overseas Fellow of [[Churchill College]] in 1977–78.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Williams|2001|pp=60–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Simón Bolívar Chair|url=http://www.latin-american.cam.ac.uk/staff/bolivar.html|publisher=Centre of Latin American Studies, University of Cambridge|accessdate=January 16, 2012|date=December 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nobel Prizes in Medicine, Economics, and Literature for Churchill Fellows|url=http://www.chu.cam.ac.uk/about/news/robert_edwards.php|publisher=[[Churchill College, Cambridge]]|accessdate=February 22, 2011|date=October 12, 2010}} {{Dead link|date=March 2012|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977, Vargas Llosa was elected as a member of the [[Academia Peruana de la Lengua|Peruvian Academy of Language]], a membership he still holds today. That year, he also published ''[[Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter]]'' (''La tía Julia y el escribidor''), based in part on his marriage to his first wife, Julia Urquidi, to whom he dedicated the novel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kristal|1998|p=91}}&lt;/ref&gt; She later wrote a memoir, ''Lo que Varguitas no dijo'' (''What Little Vargas Didn't Say''), in which she gives her personal account of their relationship. She states that Vargas Llosa's account exaggerates many negative points in their courtship and marriage while minimizing her role of assisting his literary career.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kristal|1998|p=221}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter'' is considered one of the most striking examples of how the language and imagery of popular culture can be used in literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Booker|1994|p=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; The novel was adapted in 1990 into a Hollywood feature film, ''[[Tune in Tomorrow]]''.

===Later novels===
[[Image:Mariovargasllosa.jpg|thumb|Vargas Llosa in 1982]]
Vargas Llosa's fourth major novel, ''[[The War of the End of the World]]'' (''La guerra del fin del mundo''), was published in 1981 and was his first attempt at a [[historical novel]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Kristal140&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Kristal|1998|p=140}}&lt;/ref&gt; This work initiated a radical change in Vargas Llosa's style towards themes such as [[messianism]] and irrational human behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Campos|1981|p=299}}&lt;/ref&gt; It recreates the [[War of Canudos]], an incident in 19th-century [[Brazil]] in which an armed [[millenarian]] cult held off a siege by the national army for months.&lt;ref name=&quot;Booker75&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Booker|1994|p=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; As in Vargas Llosa's earliest work, this novel carries a sober and serious theme, and its tone is dark.&lt;ref name=&quot;Booker75&quot; /&gt; Vargas Llosa's bold exploration of humanity's propensity to idealize violence, and his account of a man-made catastrophe brought on by fanaticism on all sides, earned the novel substantial recognition.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kristal124&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Kristal|1998|p=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Because of the book's ambition and execution, critics have argued that this is one of Vargas Llosa's greatest literary pieces.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kristal124&quot; /&gt;
[[Image:Mario Vargas Llosa 1985.jpg|thumb|left|Mario Vargas Llosa at the [[Miami Book Fair International]] of 1985]]
Even though the novel has been acclaimed in Brazil, it was initially poorly received because a foreigner was writing about a Brazilian theme.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Setti|1989|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was also criticized as revolutionary and anti-socialist.&lt;ref name=Setti42/&gt; Vargas Llosa says that this book is his favorite and was his most difficult accomplishment.&lt;ref name=Setti42&gt;{{Harvnb|Setti|1989|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After completing ''The War of the End of the World'', Vargas Llosa began to write novels that were significantly shorter than many of his earlier books. In 1983, he finished ''The Real Life of Alejandro Mayta'' (''Historia de Mayta'', 1984).&lt;ref name=&quot;Kristal140&quot;/&gt; The novel focuses on a leftist insurrection that took place on May 29, 1962 in the [[Andes|Andean]] city of [[Jauja]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Kristal140&quot;/&gt; Later the same year, during the [[Sendero Luminoso]] uprising, Vargas Llosa was asked by the Peruvian President [[Fernando Belaúnde Terry]] to join the Investigatory Commission, a task force to inquire into the massacre of eight journalists at the hands of the villagers of [[Uchuraccay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kristal|1998|pp=150–151}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Commission's main purpose was to investigate the murders in order to provide information regarding the incident to the public.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kristal151&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Kristal|1998|p=151}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following his involvement with the Investigatory Commission, Vargas Llosa published a series of articles to defend his position in the affair.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kristal151&quot;/&gt; In 1986, he completed his next novel, ''Who Killed Palomino Molero'' (''¿Quién mató a Palomino Molero?''), which he began writing shortly after the end of the Uchuraccay investigation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kristal151&quot;/&gt; Though the plot of this [[Mystery (fiction)|mystery novel]] is similar to the tragic events at Uchuraccay, literary critic Roy Boland points out that it was not an attempt to reconstruct the murders, but rather a &quot;literary exorcism&quot; of Vargas Llosa's own experiences during the commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Boland|Harvey|1988|p=164}}&lt;/ref&gt; The experience also inspired one of Vargas Llosa's later novels, ''[[Death in the Andes]]'' (''Lituma en los Andes''), originally published in 1993 in Barcelona.&lt;ref name=&quot;franco56&quot; /&gt;

It would be almost 20&amp;nbsp;years before Vargas Llosa wrote another major work: ''[[The Feast of the Goat]]'' (''La fiesta del chivo''), a [[political thriller]], was published in 2000 (and in English in 2001). According to Williams, it is Vargas Llosa's most complete and most ambitious novel since ''The War of the End of the World''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Williams267&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb| Williams |2001|p=267}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critic Sabine Koellmann sees it in the line of his earlier novels such as &quot;Conversación en la catedral&quot; depicting the effects of authoritarianism, violence and the abuse of power on the individual.&lt;ref name=&quot;Koellmann239ff&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb| Koellmann |2002|p=239ff}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the dictatorship of [[Rafael Trujillo]], who governed the [[Dominican Republic]] from 1930 until his assassination in 1961, the novel has three main strands: one concerns Urania Cabral, the daughter of a former politician and Trujillo loyalist, who returns for the first time since leaving the Dominican Republic after Trujillo's assassination 30&amp;nbsp;years earlier; the second concentrates on the assassination itself, the conspirators who carry it out, and its consequences; and the third and final strand deals with Trujillo himself in scenes from the end of his regime.&lt;ref name=&quot;Williams267&quot;/&gt; The book quickly received positive reviews in Spain and Latin America,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb| Williams |2001|p=268}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has had a significant impact in Latin America, being regarded as one of Vargas Llosa's best works.&lt;ref name=&quot;Williams267&quot;/&gt;

In 2006, Vargas Llosa wrote ''[[The Bad Girl]]'' (''Travesuras de la niña mala''), which journalist Kathryn Harrison argues is a rewrite (rather than simply a recycling) of [[Gustave Flaubert]]'s ''[[Madame Bovary]]'' (1856).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Harrison|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Vargas Llosa's version, the plot relates the decades-long obsession of its narrator, a Peruvian expatriate in Paris, with a woman with whom he first fell in love when both were teenagers.

==Later life and political involvement==

Like many other Latin American intellectuals, Vargas Llosa was initially a supporter of the [[Cuban Revolution|Cuban revolutionary]] government of [[Fidel Castro]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Kristal xi&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Kristal|1998|p=xi}}&lt;/ref&gt; He studied [[Marxism]] in depth as a university student and was later persuaded by [[communism|communist]] ideals after the success of the Cuban Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Setti|1989|p=140}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gradually, Vargas Llosa came to believe that Cuban [[socialism]] was incompatible with what he considered to be general liberties and freedoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Setti|1989|p=141}}&lt;/ref&gt; The official rupture between the writer and the policies of the Cuban government occurred with the so-called 'Padilla Affair', when the Castro regime imprisoned the poet [[Heberto Padilla]] for a month in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=  Bohlen, Celestine |url= http://www.nytimes.com/2000/09/28/arts/heberto-padilla-68-cuban-poet-is-dead.html |title=Heberto Padilla, 68, Cuban Poet, Is Dead |work= The New York Times |date= September 28, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vargas Llosa, along with other intellectuals of the time, wrote to Castro protesting the Cuban political system and its imprisonment of the artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Setti|1989|p=142}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vargas Llosa has identified himself with liberalism rather than extreme left-wing political ideologies ever since.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Morote|1998|p=234}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since he relinquished his earlier leftism, he has opposed both left- and right-wing [[authoritarian]] regimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Vincent|2007|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With his appointment to the Investigatory Commission in 1983 he experienced what literary critic [[Jean Franco]] calls &quot;the most uncomfortable event in [his] political career&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;franco56&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Franco|2002|p=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately for Vargas Llosa, his involvement with the Investigatory Commission led to immediate negative reactions and defamation from the Peruvian press; many suggested that the massacre was a conspiracy to keep the journalists from reporting the presence of government paramilitary forces in Uchuraccay.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kristal151&quot;/&gt; The commission concluded that it was the indigenous villagers who had been responsible for the killings; for Vargas Llosa the incident showed &quot;how vulnerable democracy is in Latin America and how easily it dies under dictatorships of the right and left&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. {{Harvnb|Kirk|1997|pp=183–184}}&lt;/ref&gt; These conclusions, and Vargas Llosa personally, came under intense criticism: anthropologist Enrique Mayer, for instance, accused him of &quot;paternalism&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. {{Harvnb|Kokotovic|2007|p=172}}&lt;/ref&gt; while fellow anthropologist Carlos Iván Degregori criticized him for his ignorance of the Andean world.&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. {{Harvnb|Kokotovic|2007|p=177}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vargas Llosa was accused of actively colluding in a government cover-up of army involvement in the massacre.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kristal151&quot;/&gt; US [[Latin American literature]] scholar Misha Kokotovic summarizes that the novelist was charged with seeing &quot;indigenous cultures as a 'primitive' obstacle to the full realization of his Western model of modernity&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kokotovic|2007|p=177}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Shocked both by the atrocity itself and then by the reaction his report had provoked, Vargas Llosa responded that his critics were apparently more concerned with his report than with the hundreds of peasants who would later die at the hands of the Sendero Luminoso guerrilla organization.&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. {{Harvnb|Kristal|1999|p=231}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Acto fundacional UPD3.jpg|thumb|left|Vargas Llosa at the founding act of [[Union, Progress and Democracy|UPD]], September 2007]]
Over the course of the decade, Vargas Llosa became known for his staunch [[neoliberal]] views.  In 1987, he helped form and soon became a leader of the [[Liberty Movement|Movimiento Libertad]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bolland8&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Boland|Harvey|1988|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The following year his party entered a coalition with the parties of Peru's two principal conservative politicians at the time, ex-president [[Fernando Belaúnde Terry]] (of the [[Popular Action (Peru)|Popular Action]] party) and [[Luis Bedoya Reyes]] (of the ''[[Partido Popular Cristiano (Peru)|Partido Popular Cristiano]]''), to form the tripartite center-right coalition known as ''[[Democratic Front (Peru)|Frente Democrático]]'' (FREDEMO).&lt;ref name=&quot;Bolland8&quot;/&gt;  He ran for the [[List of Presidents of Peru|presidency of Peru]] in 1990 as the candidate of the FREDEMO coalition. He proposed a drastic economic [[austerity]] program that frightened most of the country's poor; this program emphasized the need for privatization, a market economy, free trade, and most importantly, the dissemination of private property.&lt;ref name=emilyparker&gt;{{Harvnb|Parker|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he won the first round with 34% of the vote, Vargas Llosa was defeated by a then-unknown agricultural engineer, [[Alberto Fujimori]], in the subsequent run-off.&lt;ref name=emilyparker/&gt; Vargas Llosa included an account of his run for the presidency in the memoir ''[[A Fish in the Water]]'' (''El pez en el agua'', 1993).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Larsen|2000|p=155}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since his political defeat, he has focused mainly on his writing, with only occasional political involvement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Williams|2001|p=82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A month after losing the election, at the invitation of [[Octavio Paz]], Vargas Llosa attended a conference in Mexico entitled, &quot;The 20th Century: The Experience of Freedom&quot;. Focused on the collapse of communist rule in central and eastern Europe, it was broadcast on Mexican television. In an address to the conference, Vargas Llosa condemned the Mexican system of power based on the rule of the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party]], which had been in power for 61 years. He declared, &quot;Mexico is the perfect dictatorship. The perfect dictatorship is not communism, not the USSR, not Fidel Castro; the perfect dictatorship is Mexico. Because it is a camouflaged dictatorship.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Terra, 7 October 2010&quot;&gt;''Terra'', 7 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''El País'', 1 September 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

Vargas Llosa has mainly lived in Madrid since the 1990s,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.esmadrid.com/es/portal.do?IDM=204&amp;NM=4&amp;TR=C&amp;IDR=1763&lt;/ref&gt; but spends roughly three months of the year in Peru with his extended family.&lt;ref name=emilyparker/&gt; He also frequently visits London where he occasionally spends long periods. Vargas Llosa acquired Spanish citizenship in 1993, though he still holds [[Peruvian nationality law|Peruvian nationality]]. The writer often reiterates his love for both countries. In his Nobel speech he observed: &quot;I carry Peru deep inside me because that is where I was born, grew up, was formed, and lived those experiences of childhood and youth that shaped my personality and forged my calling&quot;. He then added: &quot;I love Spain as much as Peru, and my debt to her is as great as my gratitude. If not for Spain, I never would have reached this podium or become a known writer&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/2010/vargas_llosa-lecture_en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994 he was elected a member of the ''[[Real Academia Española]]'' (Royal Spanish Academy)&lt;ref name=&quot;Williams83&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Williams|2001|p=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been involved in the country's political arena. In February 2008 he stopped supporting the [[People's Party (Spain)|People's Party]] in favor of the recently created [[Union, Progress and Democracy]], claiming that certain conservative views held by the former party are at odds with his classical liberal beliefs. His political ideologies appear in the book ''[[Política razonable]]'', written with [[Fernando Savater]], [[Rosa Díez]], [[Álvaro Pombo]], [[Albert Boadella]] and [[Carlos Martínez Gorriarán]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://actualidad.terra.es/articulo/escritor_mario_vargas_llosa_pp_2277630.htm|title=Escritor Mario Vargas Llosa retira su apoyo al PP y pide el voto para UPyD|accessdate=March 22, 2008|journal=Terra Actualidad|date = February 25, 2008}}.

{{Es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; He continues to write, both journalism and fiction, and to travel extensively.  He has also taught as a visiting professor at a number of prominent universities.&lt;ref&gt;These include [[Queen Mary, University of London]] and [[King's College London]], both part of the [[University of London]], the Pullman campus of [[Washington State University]], the [[University of Puerto Rico]] at [[Río Piedras]], [[Columbia University]], [[Harvard University]], [[Princeton University]], [[Georgetown University]], and the [[City University of New York]].

Princeton University Library. Retrieved on April 14, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 18, 2010, Vargas Llosa received the honorary degree Degree of Letters from the [[City College of New York]] of the [[City University of New York]], where he also delivered the President's Lecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nobel Laureate Mario Vargas Llosa Speaks at CCNY November 18|url=http://www1.ccny.cuny.edu/advancement/news/Mario-Vargas-Llosa-Presidents-Lecture.cfm|publisher=The City College of New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 February 2011, Vargas Llosa was raised into the [[Spanish nobility]] by [[Juan Carlos I of Spain|King Juan Carlos I]] with the hereditary title of ''[[Marquessate of Vargas Llosa|Marqués de Vargas Llosa]]'' ([[English language|English]]: Marquis of Vargas Llosa).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.boe.es/diario_boe/txt.php?id=BOE-A-2011-2137|title=Real Decreto 134/2011, de 3 de febrero, por el que se concede el título de Marqués de Vargas Llosa a don Jorge Mario Vargas Llosa}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rpp.com.pe/2011-02-04-mario-vargas-llosa-jamas-imagine-que-me-harian-marques-noticia_333516.html Declaraciones de Mario Vargas Llosa al enterarse de la concesión del título nobiliario de Marqués de Vargas Llosa.

In April 2011, the writer took part in the [[Peruvian general election, 2011]] by saying he was going to vote for [[Alejandro Toledo]] (Peruvian former president 2001-2006). After cast his vote, he said his country should stay in the path of legality and freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elcomercio.pe/politica/739288/noticia-mario-vargas-llosa-votare-alejandro-toledo|title=Vargas Llosa votará por Alejandro Toledo en elecciones peruanas|publisher=[[Elcomercio.pe]]|accessdate=2011-04-07}} | Source in Spanish: &quot;Vargas Llosa will vote for Alejandro Toledo in Peruvian elections&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.andina.com.pe/ingles/Noticia.aspx?id=zsdtuw6005M=|title=Vargas Llosa: Peru should maintain legality, freedom and economic development|publisher=andina|accessdate=2011-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As for hobbies, Vargas Llosa is very fond of [[Association football|football]], and is a renowned supporter of [[Universitario de Deportes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.conmebol.com/conmebol/mainMedia.html?id=16969&amp;viewpage='full'|title=Mario Vargas Llosa a Nobel football fan and supporter of Universitario de Deportes|accessdate=December 30, 2010|journal=South American Football Confederation |date = October 7, 2010}} {{Dead link|date=March 2012|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; The writer himself has confessed in his book ''[[A Fish in the Water]]'' since childhood he has been a fan of the 'cream colored' team from [[Peru]], which was first seen in the field one day in 1946 when he was only 10 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://depor.pe/noticia/650743/como-pez-agua-dia-que-vargas-llosa-debuto=|title=Como pez en el agua: El dia en que Vargas Llosa debutó con la U|publisher=[[Depor.pe]]|accessdate=2010-12-30}} | Source in Spanish: &quot;As a fish in the water: The day Vargas Llosa played with Universitario&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2011, Vargas Llosa was awarded with an honorary life membership of this football club, in a ceremony which took place in the [[Estadio Monumental &quot;U&quot;|Monumental Stadium]] of [[Lima]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elmundo.es/america/2011/02/03/deportes/1296773898.html|title=Vargas Llosa protagonista de la 'noche crema' de Universitario de Deportes|publisher=[[Elmundo.es]]|accessdate=2011-02-14}} | Source in Spanish: &quot;Vargas Llosa in 'cream nigth' of Universitario&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elcomercio.pe/deportes/707923/noticia-mario-vargas-llosa-u-mito-leyenda|title=Vargas Llosa: La 'U' es un mito, una leyenda, una tradición|publisher=[[elcomercio.pe]]|accessdate=2011-02-14}} | Source in Spanish: &quot;Vargas Llosa: La 'U' is a myth, a legend, a tradition&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style of writing==
===Plot, setting, and major themes===
Vargas Llosa's style encompasses historical material as well as his own personal experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Booker|1994|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in his first novel, ''The Time of the Hero'', his own experiences at the Leoncio Prado military school informed his depiction of the corrupt social institution which mocked the moral standards it was supposed to uphold.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kristal32&quot;/&gt; Furthermore, the corruption of the book's school is a reflection of the corruption of Peruvian society at the time the novel was written.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kristal33&quot;/&gt; Vargas Llosa frequently uses his writing to challenge the inadequacies of society, such as demoralization and oppression by those in political power towards those who challenge this power. One of the main themes he has explored in his writing is the individual's struggle for freedom within an oppressive reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Morote|1998|pp=66–67}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, his two-volume novel ''Conversation in the Cathedral'' is based on the tyrannical dictatorship of Peruvian President [[Manuel A. Odría]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kristal|1998|p=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; The protagonist, Santiago, rebels against the suffocating dictatorship by participating in the subversive activities of leftist political groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kristal|1998|p=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to themes such as corruption and oppression, Vargas Llosa's second novel, ''The Green House'', explores &quot;a denunciation of Peru's basic institutions&quot;, dealing with issues of abuse and exploitation of the workers in the brothel by corrupt military officers.&lt;ref name=&quot;QC273&quot;/&gt;

Many of Vargas Llosa's earlier novels were set in Peru, while in more recent work he has expanded to other regions of Latin America, such as Brazil and the Dominican Republic.&lt;ref name=castro-klaren19&gt;{{Harvnb|Castro-Klarén|1990|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; His responsibilities as a writer and lecturer have allowed him to travel frequently and led to settings for his novels in regions outside of Peru.&lt;ref name=&quot;Williams60&quot;/&gt;  ''The War of the End of the World'' was his first major work set outside Peru.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cevallos273&quot;/&gt; Though the plot deals with historical events of the [[Canudos]] revolt against the Brazilian government, the novel is not based directly on historical fact; rather, its main inspiration is the non-fiction account of those events published by Brazilian writer [[Euclides da Cunha]] in 1902.&lt;ref name=&quot;Booker75&quot; /&gt; ''The Feast of the Goat'', based on the dictatorship of [[Rafael Trujillo]], takes place in the [[Dominican Republic]];&lt;ref name=&quot;Williams267&quot;/&gt; in preparation for this novel, Vargas Llosa undertook a comprehensive study of Dominican history.&lt;ref name=&quot;Williams270&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Williams|2001|p=270}}&lt;/ref&gt; The novel was characteristically [[literary realism|realist]], and Vargas Llosa underscores that he &quot;respected the basic facts, [. . .] I have not exaggerated&quot;, but at the same time he points out &quot;It's a novel, not a history book, so I took many, many liberties.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in {{Harvnb|Gussow|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Vargas Llosa's more recent novels, ''The Way to Paradise'' (''El paraíso en la otra esquina''), is set largely in France and [[Tahiti]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Vargas Llosa|2003|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the biography of former social reformer [[Flora Tristan]], it demonstrates how Flora and [[Paul Gauguin]] were unable to find paradise, but were still able to inspire followers to keep working towards a socialist [[utopia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Heawood|2003|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, Vargas Llosa was not as successful in transforming these historical figures into fiction. Some critics, such as Barbara Mujica, argue that ''The Way to Paradise'' lacks the &quot;audacity, energy, political vision, and narrative genius&quot; that was present in his previous works.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mujica|2004|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modernism and postmodernism===
The works of Mario Vargas Llosa are viewed as both [[modernist]] and [[postmodernist]] novels.&lt;ref name=&quot;Booker32&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Booker|1994|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though there is still much debate over the differences between modernist and postmodernist literature, literary scholar M. Keith Booker claims that the difficulty and technical complexity of Vargas Llosa's early works, such as ''The Green House'' and ''Conversation in the Cathedral'', are clearly elements of the modern novel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Booker6&quot;/&gt; Furthermore, these earlier novels all carry a certain seriousness of attitude—another important defining aspect of modernist art.&lt;ref name=&quot;Booker32&quot;/&gt; By contrast, his later novels such as ''Captain Pantoja and the Special Service'', ''Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter'', ''The Real Life of Alejandro Mayta'', and ''[[The Storyteller (novel)|The Storyteller]]'' (''El hablador'') appear to follow a postmodernist mode of writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Booker|1994|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; These novels have a much lighter, [[farce|farcical]], and comic tone, characteristics of postmodernism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Booker33&quot;/&gt; Comparing two of Vargas Llosa's novels, ''The Green House'' and ''Captain Pantoja and the Special Service'', Booker discusses the contrast between modernism and postmodernism found in the writer's works: while both novels explore the theme of prostitution as well as the workings of the Peruvian military, Booker points out that the former is gravely serious whereas the latter is ridiculously comic.&lt;ref name=&quot;Booker33&quot;/&gt;

===Interlacing dialogues===
Literary scholar M. Keith Booker argues that Vargas Llosa perfects the technique of interlacing dialogues in his novel ''The Green House''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Booker33&quot;/&gt; By combining two conversations that occur at different times, he creates the illusion of a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]]. Vargas Llosa also sometimes uses this technique as a means of shifting location by weaving together two concurrent conversations happening in different places.&lt;ref name=&quot;Booker14&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Booker|1994|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; This technique is a staple of his repertoire, which he began using near the end of his first novel, ''The Time of the Hero''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Booker|1994|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he does not use interlacing dialogues in the same way in all of his novels. For example, in ''The Green House'' the technique is used in a serious fashion to achieve a sober tone and to focus on the interrelatedness of important events separated in time or space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Booker|1994|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, ''Captain Pantoja and the Special Service'' employs this strategy for comic effects and uses simpler spatial shifts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Booker|1994|pp=35–36}}&lt;/ref&gt; This device is similar to both [[Virginia Woolf]]'s mixing of different characters' soliloquies and Gustave Flaubert's [[counterpoint]] technique in which he blends together conversation with other events, such as speeches.&lt;ref name=&quot;Booker14&quot;/&gt;

===Literary influences===
Vargas Llosa's first literary influences were relatively obscure Peruvian writers such as [[Martín Adán]], [[Carlos Oquendo de Amat]], and [[César Moro]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Castro3&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Castro-Klarén|1990|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a young writer, he looked to these revolutionary novelists in search of new narrative structures and techniques in order to delineate a more contemporary, multifaceted experience of urban Peru. He was looking for a style different from the traditional descriptions of land and rural life made famous by Peru's foremost novelist at the time, [[José María Arguedas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb |Castro-Klarén|1990|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vargas Llosa wrote of Arguedas's work that it was &quot;an example of old-fashioned regionalism that had already exhausted its imaginary possibilities&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Castro3&quot; /&gt; Although he did not share Arguedas's passion for indigenous reality, Vargas Llosa admired and respected the novelist for his contributions to Peruvian literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb |Kristal|1998|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Indeed, he has published a book-length study on his work, ''La utopía arcaica'' (1996).

Rather than restrict himself to Peruvian literature, Vargas Llosa also looked abroad for literary inspiration. Two French figures, [[existentialist]] [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] and novelist [[Gustave Flaubert]], influenced both his technique and style.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Castro-Klarén|1990|pp=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sartre's influence is most prevalent in Vargas Llosa's extensive use of conversation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Castro6&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Castro-Klarén|1990|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The epigraph of ''The Time of the Hero'', his first novel, is also taken directly from Sartre's work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Castro-Klarén|1990|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flaubert's artistic independence—his novels' disregard of reality and morals—has always been admired by Vargas Llosa,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kristal|1998|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; who wrote a book-length study of Flaubert's [[aesthetics]], ''[[The Perpetual Orgy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Castro-Klarén|1990|p=115}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his analysis of Flaubert, Vargas Llosa questions the revolutionary power of literature in a political setting; this is in contrast to his earlier view that &quot;literature is an act of rebellion&quot;, thus marking a transition in Vargas Llosa's aesthetic beliefs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kristal81&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Kristal|1998|p=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Vargas Llosa's favourite novelists, and arguably the most influential on his writing career, is the American [[William Faulkner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kristal|1998|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vargas Llosa considers Faulkner &quot;the writer who perfected the methods of the modern novel&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kristal26&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Kristal|1998|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both writers' styles include intricate changes in time and narration.&lt;ref name=&quot;Castro6&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kristal26&quot;/&gt; In ''The Time of the Hero'', for example, aspects of Vargas Llosa's plot, his main character's development and his use of narrative time are influenced by his favourite Faulkner novel, ''[[Light in August]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kristal|1998|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the studies of Arguedas and Flaubert, Vargas Llosa has written literary criticisms of other authors that he has admired, such as García Márquez, [[Albert Camus]], [[Ernest Hemingway]], and [[Jean-Paul Sartre]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Castro116&quot;/&gt; The main goals of his non-fiction works are to acknowledge the influence of these authors on his writing, and to recognize a connection between himself and the other writers;&lt;ref name=&quot;Castro116&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Castro-Klarén|1990|p=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; critic Sara Castro-Klarén argues that he offers little systematic analysis of these authors' literary techniques.&lt;ref name=&quot;Castro116&quot;/&gt; In ''The Perpetual Orgy'', for example, he discusses the relationship between his own aesthetics and Flaubert's, rather than focusing on Flaubert's alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Castro-Klarén|1990|p=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==

Mario Vargas Llosa is considered a major Latin American writer, alongside other authors such as [[Octavio Paz]], [[Julio Cortázar]], [[Jorge Luis Borges]], [[Gabriel García Márquez]] and [[Carlos Fuentes]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Castro1&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Castro-Klarén|1990|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his book ''The New Novel in Latin America'' (''La Nueva Novela''), Fuentes offers an in-depth literary criticism of the positive influence Vargas Llosa's work has had on Latin American literature.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lamb102&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Lamb|1971|p=102}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, for the literary critic [[Gerald Martin]], writing in 1987, Vargas Llosa was &quot;perhaps the most successful [. . . and] certainly the most controversial Latin American novelist of the past twenty-five years&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb |Martin|1987|p=205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of Vargas Llosa's narratives have been translated into multiple languages, marking his international critical success.&lt;ref name=&quot;Castro1&quot; /&gt;  Vargas Llosa is also noted for his substantial contribution to journalism, an accomplishment characteristic of few other Latin American writers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb |Castro-Klarén|1990|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is recognized among those who have most consciously promoted literature in general, and more specifically the novel itself, as avenues for meaningful commentary about life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Muñoz|2000|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his career, he has written more than a dozen novels and many other books and stories, and, for decades, he has been a voice for Latin American literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Williams|2001|p=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has won numerous awards for his writing, from the 1959 ''[[Premio Leopoldo Alas]]'' and the 1962 ''[[Premio Biblioteca Breve]]'' to the 1993 ''[[Premio Planeta]]'' (for ''Death in the Andes'') and the [[Jerusalem Prize]] in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE5DD1539F934A25752C0A963958260 |title=Vargas Llosa Wins The Jerusalem Prize|accessdate=March 20, 2008 |date=January 17, 1995|journal=The New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt; The literary critic [[Harold Bloom]] has included his novel ''[[The War of the End of the World]]'' in his list of essential literary works in the [[Western Canon]]. An important distinction he has received is the 1994 [[Miguel de Cervantes Prize]], considered the most important accolade in Spanish-language literature and awarded to authors whose &quot;work has contributed to enrich, in a notable way, the literary patrimony of the Spanish language&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;cuya obra haya contribuido a enriquecer de forma notable el patrimonio literario en lengua española.&quot; {{citation|url=http://www.mcu.es/premios/CervantesPresentacion.html|title=Premio &quot;Miguel de Cervantes&quot;|accessdate=April 12, 2008|publisher=Gobierno de España – Ministerio de Cultura}} {{Es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, Vargas was the recipient of the [[PEN/Nabokov Award]]. Vargas Llosa also received the 2005 [[Irving Kristol Award]] from the [[American Enterprise Institute]] and was the 2008 recipient of the Harold and Ethel L. Stellfox Visiting Scholar and Writers Award at [[Dickinson College]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dickinson.edu/news-and-events/publications/extra-features/2008-09/Honoring-the-Storyteller/ |title=Honoring the Storyteller |publisher=Dickinson College |date=December 2, 2008 |accessdate=October 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of Vargas Llosa's works have been adapted for the screen, including ''The Time of the Hero'' and ''Captain Pantoja and the Special Service'' (both by the Peruvian director [[Francisco Lombardi]]) and ''The Feast of the Goat'' (by Vargas Llosa's cousin, [[Luis Llosa]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0889771/ |title=Mario Vargas Llosa |accessdate=March 20, 2008 |publisher=The Internet Movie Database }}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter]]'' was turned into the English-language film, ''[[Tune in Tomorrow]]''.  ''The Feast of the Goat'' has also been adapted as a theatrical play by [[Jorge Alí Triana]], a Colombian playwright and director.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Navarro|2003|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
