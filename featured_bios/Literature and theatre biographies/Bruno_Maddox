'''Bruno P. Maddox''' (born 1969) is a British [[literary fiction|literary novelist]] and journalist who is best known for his critically lauded novel ''My Little Blue Dress'' (2001) and for his satirical magazine essays.

After graduating from [[Harvard University]] in 1992, Maddox began his career reviewing books for ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'' and ''[[The Washington Post]] Book World''.  In early 1996, he was appointed to an editorship at ''[[Spy (magazine)|Spy]]'' magazine and within a few months he was promoted to editor-in-chief, a position he held until the magazine shut down in 1998.  Maddox wrote ''My Little Blue Dress'' between 1999 and 2001.  Since its publication, he has focused on writing satirical essays for magazines such as ''[[Gear (magazine)|GEAR]]'' and ''[[Travel + Leisure]]''; he also contributes a monthly humor column to ''[[Discover (magazine)|Discover]]'' magazine called &quot;Blinded by Science&quot;, drawing on his early exposure to science and technology.  Maddox is likewise a [[contributing editor]] to the American edition of ''[[The Week]]'' magazine.&lt;ref name=TheWeekGreenIssue/&gt;

==Early years==
Maddox was born in London in 1969 to former ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' editor Sir [[John Maddox]], a writer on science and nature, and [[Brenda Maddox]], a biographer of [[Rosalind Franklin]], [[W.B. Yeats]], [[Nora Barnacle]] and several others.&lt;ref name=NinaBlount/&gt;&lt;ref name=AboutBBS&gt;{{cite web|title=About Blinded By Science columns|work=[[Discover Magazine|Discover]]|url=http://discovermagazine.com/columns/blinded-by-science|accessdate=25 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Touching base|journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature Genetics]]|volume=28|year=2001|pages=305|url=http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v28/n4/full/ng0801_305.html|doi=10.1038/91050|accessdate=25 July 2007|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has one sister, [[Bronwen Maddox|Bronwen]], who became a journalist and is Chief Foreign Commentator of ''[[The Times]]'' as of 2008.&lt;ref name=PenguinBio&gt;{{cite web|title=About Bruno Maddox|publisher=[[Penguin Group (USA)]]|url=http://us.penguingroup.com/nf/Author/AuthorPage/0,,1000037427,00.html|accessdate=25 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=About Bronwen Maddox|work=The Times |location=London |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/bronwen_maddox/|accessdate=21 January 2008  | first=Philippe | last=Naughton}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maddox enjoyed a privileged life during his childhood and youth, because of his father's position as editor of ''Nature'', encountering some of the leading scientific thinkers of the day and enjoying dinners with figures such as [[James D. Watson|James Watson]] and [[Sir Fred Hoyle]].&lt;ref name=AboutBBS/&gt;

Despite his family's background in science, Maddox was interested in the [[humanities]] while he attended [[Westminster School]], an independent boys' school in London. Maddox went on to study [[English literature]] at [[Harvard University]] and graduated in 1992.&lt;ref name=PublicityMaterial/&gt;  He published his first and only article in the [[student newspaper]] ''[[The Harvard Crimson]]'' during his [[Student#Post-second year|senior]] year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Bruno Maddox|title=Cabot Turns Trash Into Art: Superintendent Urges Residents on to Ecolympic Laurels|date=15 February 1991|work=[[The Harvard Crimson]]|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=243329|accessdate=25 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He won the undergraduate [[Thomas T.

Maddox's freelance writing career began in 1994, when he became a book reviewer for ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'' and ''[[The Washington Post]]'', where he developed a reputation for writing scathing reviews that would later help him land a job as an editor at ''[[Spy (magazine)|Spy]]'' magazine.&lt;ref name=Andelman_interview/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=One Last Hurrah|author=Bruno Maddox|date=23 January 1994|work=[[The Washington Post]] through ''[http://www.lexisnexis.com/universe LexisNexis Academic]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=In Short: Nonfiction|author=Bruno Maddox|date=17 July 1994|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maddox described his book reviewing style as &quot;pretty vicious&quot;, and quipped that he &quot;was a frustrated, twenty-something guy, sitting in his bedroom venting existential rage on these nasty academics&quot;.&lt;ref name=Andelman_interview/&gt; His last book review for ''The Washington Post'' was in late 1996; however, he continued reviewing for ''The New York Times'' up until 1998, contributing only a couple of reviews thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Monsters of Our Own Making|author=Bruno Maddox|date=29 September 1996|work=[[The Washington Post]] through ''[http://www.lexisnexis.com/universe LexisNexis Academic]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Blade Runner|author=Bruno Maddox|date=22 March 1998|work=The New York Times|url=http://www.nytimes.com/books/98/03/22/reviews/980322.22maddoxt.html|accessdate=1 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the [[dot-com boom]], Maddox found full-time work at an information technology company, where he worked for a year and a half.&lt;ref name=ACE_interview/&gt;

==Editorship of ''Spy'' magazine==
In mid-1996, Maddox was hired as a [[senior editor]] at ''[[Spy (magazine)|Spy]]'' magazine, a [[satirical]] monthly, in New York City.&lt;ref name=Andelman_interview/&gt;  ''Spy'' had ceased publication in 1994 but was quickly resuscitated under new ownership by Sussex Publishers Inc., which reduced the magazine's frequency from ten to six issues a year.&lt;ref name=Sussex&gt;{{cite news|title=Spy goes under for the last time|author=Neil Cassidy|date=1 March 1998|publisher=''Folio: The Magazine for Magazine Management'' reprinted by FindArticles.com|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3065/is_n3_v27/ai_20350760|accessdate=15 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At ''Spy'', Maddox was assisted by deputy editor Adam Lehner, a satirist.&lt;ref name=Salon-Spy&gt;{{cite news|title=Media Circus: Spy vs. Spy|author=[[James Surowiecki]]|date=2 September 1997|publisher=[[Salon.com]]|url=http://www.salon.com/sept97/media/media970902.html|accessdate=25 July 2007|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070615043026/http://www.salon.com/sept97/media/media970902.html &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt;|archivedate=15 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1996, Maddox was promoted to editor-in-chief;&lt;ref name=Andelman_interview&gt;{{cite news|title=Mr. Media Spies on Spy!|author=Bob Andelman|date=14 April 1997|work=[[Universal Press Syndicate]]|url=http://www.andelman.com/mrmedia/97/04.14.97.html |accessdate=25 July 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20001101213832/http://www.andelman.com/mrmedia/97/04.14.97.html |archivedate = 1 November 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; his editorial team included [[Jared Paul Stern]] and, beginning in late 1997, future screenwriter [[William Monahan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Reporter Was Quick Study in Art of Mingling With the Rich and Glamorous|author=Marc Santora|date=9 April 2006|work=The New York Times|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/09/nyregion/09stern.html|accessdate=8 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Standing at the corner of Shakespeare and Scorsese|author=Sam Allis|date=3 October 2006|work=The Boston Globe|url=http://www.boston.com/ae/movies/articles/2006/10/03/standing_at_the_corner_of_shakespeare_and_scorcese/|accessdate=8 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maddox wanted to turn ''Spy'' into a national magazine rather than build on its legacy of covering stories that centered on New York.  According to Maddox, two factors motivated the shift of [[target market]]. The magazine's past objects of satire, the &quot;cheesy villains who anointed themselves as targets&quot; in the 1980s, were no longer on the national stage. Meanwhile, the &quot;sins of the '90s [were] those of a private, quiet cultivation of a sense of purity&quot;, and were harder to expose or ridicule.&lt;ref name=Salon-Spy/&gt;

In early 1998, Sussex Publishers increased ''Spy''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s frequency from six to nine issues a year in an effort to boost readership and ad pages. ''Spy'''s paid circulation continued to drop during Maddox's tenure, and in March 1998, the magazine once again ceased publication.  Sussex's President and CEO John Colman concluded that &quot;[despite the] great work by Bruno and his team, there just wasn't the [advertiser and consumer] acceptance that we need to make it financially viable&quot;.&lt;ref name=Sussex/&gt;  Maddox conceded that &quot;a satirical magazine in New York in the late Nineties really had no function&quot;, because &quot;everyone was being very modest and coy&quot;.&lt;ref name=NinaBlount&gt;{{cite news|title=my little blue dress: bruno maddox talks to ivenus about the post-post-postmodern novel|author=Nina Blount|year=2001|publisher=iVenus.com|url=http://www.ivenus.com/culture/books/features/CU-FP-FullLength-wk58.asp|accessdate=1 August 2007| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20050524233446/http://www.ivenus.com/culture/books/features/CU-FP-FullLength-wk58.asp| archivedate = 24 May 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, Maddox sold the advance rights to his first novel, ''My Little Blue Dress'', to a German publisher based on a five-page fax proposal he sent on the advice of his [[literary agent]] [[John Brockman (literary agent)|John Brockman]].&lt;ref name=ACE_interview&gt;{{cite web|title=Back in the (Day) Job – Bruno Maddox|author=Cristín Leach|date=10 May 2001|work=[[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|Radio Telefís Éireann]]|url=http://www.rte.ie/arts/2001/0510/dayjob.html|accessdate=25 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Within a week Brockman managed to sell the rights to the novel to publishers in an additional eight countries on the strength of the proposal alone.&lt;ref name=prov&gt;{{cite news|title=Agent Provocateur|author=Warren St. John|date=September 1999|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] magazine|url=http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/7.09/brockman.html|accessdate=8 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Maddox had not yet written even an initial [[manuscript]].)

{{cquote|It was a pretty terrifying experience, suddenly having a legal obligation to write an extremely difficult post-modern novel having never written anything before and also, stupidly, I told him I could do it in six months, which was just a conversational thing until it turned up in black and white in my contract. The six months came and went and my reputation in publishing at the moment is a reflection of the two and a half years I spent writing it longer than I should have done. The Dutch cancelled when the Millennium came and went, they decided it was a millennial book, but weirdly they would have accepted it in November of 1999, for a few days of millennial reading, they failed to see that it is obviously a twenty-first century book.|||Bruno Maddox, on the publishing of his first novel.&lt;ref name=ACE_interview/&gt;}}

''My Little Blue Dress'' was published in 2001 by [[Viking Press]], a [[Penguin Group]] [[imprint]]. The novel begins as a [[memoir]] of a hundred-year-old woman, but several chapters later reveals itself to be a spoof of the genre. The protagonist is a fictional Bruno Maddox who is desperately attempting to create a forgery of an old woman's memoir in a single night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Books: A better shot at the Bloke's First Book|author=Brandon Robshaw|work=[[The Independent]] reprinted by FindArticles.com|date=2 June 2001|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20010602/ai_n14385504|accessdate=14 August 2007| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080202081236/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20010602/ai_n14385504| archivedate = 2 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several book reviewers avoided spoiling the novel's satire but others gave away its premise, reasoning that the publisher &quot;reveal[s] all on the book jacket anyway&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=My Little Blue Dress by Bruno Maddox: Viking, U.S., 2001|author=Michael Garry Smout|date=January–February 2002|work=The Barcelona Review|url=http://www.barcelonareview.com/rev/28.htm|accessdate=8 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Salon-Bluedress&gt;{{cite news|title=&quot;My Little Blue Dress&quot; by Bruno Maddox|author=Maria Russo|date=17 May 2001|publisher=[[Salon.com]]|url=http://archive.salon.com/books/review/2001/05/21/maddox/|accessdate=15 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The novel's intrigue lies in the mysterious reason compelling the fictional Maddox to forge a memoir.&lt;ref name=Salon-Bluedress/&gt;

Critics applauded ''My Little Blue Dress'' but also expressed some reservations. For example, [[Salon.com]]'s Maria Russo cautioned that the novel &quot;is one of those 'don't try this at home' literary experiments that could easily have turned into an unreadable, pretentious disaster&quot;, but concluded that Maddox &quot;pulls it off with a kind of fearless pizzazz&quot;.&lt;ref name=Salon-Bluedress/&gt;  ''The New York Times''' [[Emily Barton]] conceded that &quot;for all its blunders&quot;, Maddox delivers &quot;a winsome and vastly entertaining novel&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Enough About Me|author=Emily Barton|date=27 May 2001|work=The New York Times|url=http://www.nytimes.com/books/01/05/27/reviews/010527.27bartont.html|accessdate=15 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview, Maddox praised [[Bret Easton Ellis]]’s 1991 novel ''[[American Psycho]]'', stating that he drew inspiration from protagonist [[Patrick Bateman]]'s long-winded monologues about [[Phil Collins]], restaurants, clothes, and how to remove blood from his carpets.&lt;ref name=NinaBlount/&gt;

In 2001, Maddox promoted his first novel on a joint book tour billed as the &quot;Minor Novelists Tour&quot; with his friend [[William Monahan]], another former ''Spy'' editor, but it was interrupted by the 9/11 attacks. Monahan's ''[[Light House: A Trifle]]'' was also published by a Penguin imprint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Writer's 'trifle' Aims Higher|author=Darcy Cosper|date=2 October 2001|work=[[The Hartford Courant]] through ''[http://www.lexisnexis.com/universe LexisNexis Academic]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Authors at Real Art Ways|date=20 September 2001|work=[[The Hartford Courant]] through ''[http://www.lexisnexis.com/universe LexisNexis Academic]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several years later, Maddox gave some indication that he was working on a [[film adaptation]] of ''My Little Blue Dress'',&lt;ref name=NYPost1&gt;A note at the end of several of Maddox's book reviews read, &quot;Bruno Maddox is adapting his novel 'My Little Blue Dress' for the screen.&quot; See Maddox's [http://cache.zoominfo.com/CachedPage/?archive_id=0&amp;page_id=710684732&amp;page_url=%2f%2fwww.nypost.com%2fentertainment%2f25175.htm&amp;page_last_updated=6%2f6%2f2004+9%3a22%3a28+AM&amp;firstName=Bruno&amp;lastName=Maddox review] of [[P.

==Recent essays==
After the publication of ''My Little Blue Dress'' in 2001, Maddox was reportedly working on a second novel set in California, where &quot;everyone's aspirational and deluded&quot; and the &quot;people are quite happy being waiters and dreaming of stardom&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=All About Me|author=Tom Dart|date=2 June 2001|work=[[The Times]] through ''[http://www.lexisnexis.com/universe LexisNexis Academic]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2009, however, no manuscript has been forthcoming.&lt;ref&gt;As of 2009 a second novel from Maddox has not been published, however, in a story (dated 16 Oct 2009) by Bruno Maddox it is written that [http://significantobjects.com/2009/10/16/thai-hooks/ &quot;Bruno Maddox is at work on his second novel.&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2003, Maddox began to contribute articles regularly to ''[[Travel + Leisure]]''. His first article in the magazine was called &quot;The Concorde, R.I.P.&quot;, which chronicled his flight aboard the supersonic [[Concorde]] airplane before it was decommissioned; it was later included in ''The Best Travel Writing 2005'', the second volume of the annual Travelers’ Tales series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Concorde, R.I.P.|author=Bruno Maddox|date=October 2003|work=[[Travel + Leisure]]|url=http://www.travelandleisure.com/articles/the-concorde-rip|accessdate=13 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Best Travel Writing 2005: True Stories from Around the World|editor=O'Reilly, James, Larry Habegger, and Sean O'Reilly|chapter=The Concorde, R.I.P.|author=Bruno Maddox|location=San Francisco, Calif|publisher=Travelers' Tales|year=2005|isbn=978-1-932361-16-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004 Maddox began working as a [[contributing editor]] for the American edition of ''[[The Week]]'' magazine and as of 2007 continues to contribute weekly to the print issue, handling sections including &quot;Main Stories&quot;, &quot;Talking Points&quot;, and &quot;Only in America&quot;.&lt;ref name=TheWeekGreenIssue&gt;{{cite news|title=Green Issue's Masthead|date=23 April 2007|work=[[The Week]]|url=http://green.theweekmagazine.com/mainstories.html |accessdate=23 April 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070423041446/http://green.theweekmagazine.com/mainstories.html |archivedate = 23 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also reviewed several books for ''[[The New York Post]]'' in 2004 and 2005.&lt;ref name=NYPost1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=With Friends Like These...|author=Bruno Maddox|date=13 February 2005|work=The New York Post|url=http://mikealbo.com/PDFS/nypost_entertainment.pdf|format = PDF| accessdate=27 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Maddox began contributing a regular humor column called &quot;Blinded by Science&quot; to ''[[Discover Magazine|Discover]]'' magazine. His writing draws upon his childhood exposure to science; due to his father's career, his family was immersed in science and he was regularly exposed to scientists at social events.&lt;ref name=AboutBBS/&gt; Maddox's first year's columns earned him a nod as a finalist in the 2007 [[National Magazine Award]]s' &quot;Columns and Commentary&quot; category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New York is tops in magazine awards: Takes home five Ellies, the most of any magazine|author=Diego Vasquez|date=2 May 2007|work=Media Life magazine|url=http://www.medialifemagazine.com/artman2/publish/Magazines_22/New_York_is_tops_in_magazine_awards_11827.asp|accessdate=25 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maddox's ''Discover'' columns are occasionally criticized; his essay &quot;Fictional Reality&quot;, in particular, has been controversial. Maddox declared science fiction obsolete in his essay &quot;Fictional Reality&quot; and was roundly criticized in the [[blogosphere]], most notably by ''[[Scientific American]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s J.R. Minkel. Maddox wrote that &quot;fiction—all fiction—finally became obsolete as a delivery system for big ideas&quot; as a result of the &quot;scarcity of foreseeable future&quot;, citing the decline of author [[Michael Crichton]]'s work as evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Blinded by Science: Fictional Reality|author=Maddox, Bruno|date=20 July 2007|work=Discover|url=http://discovermagazine.com/2007/aug/blinded-by-science }}&lt;/ref&gt; Minkel lambasted Maddox and pointed to author [[Neal Stephenson]]'s cutting-edge work as proof to the contrary, venturing that &quot;science fiction writers can ''dictate'' the future if they have the vim and vision&quot;.

One of Maddox's most recent ''Discover'' essays, &quot;The James Watson Affair&quot;, examines comments made by [[James Watson]] in an article in London's ''[[The Times|Sunday Times]]'' which led to Watson's suspension at the laboratory where he worked and his eventual retirement, and is skeptical of critics who found Watson's comment about black employees &quot;not that big a deal&quot; yet charged him with racism for his proposition on black African intelligence; in conclusion, Maddox derides the views held by several critics, stating that in comparison to Watson's statements, &quot;the most ignorant and hurtful idea of all, of course, is that the entire topic of race and genes and intelligence is off-limits to all right-thinking, compassionate people, just on principle&quot;, which pejoratively assumes &quot;that some races ''are'' innately and immutably much less intelligent than others&quot;. Maddox's essay, although published in the March 2008 printed edition of ''Discover'', has not been published online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The elementary DNA of Dr Watson |author=Charlotte Hunt-Grubbe |date=14 October 2007 |work=The Times |location=London |url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/article2630748.ece  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Blinded by Science: The James Watson affair has this writer wondering: Who are the real racists out there?|author=Bruno Maddox |date=March 2008|work=Discover|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style==
Satire is evident in much of Maddox's work, from his years as editor-in-chief for ''[[Spy (magazine)|Spy]]'' magazine to his numerous articles in ''[[Travel + Leisure]]'', and his novel ''My Little Blue Dress''. Maddox's satirical tendencies extend to his interviews and publicity materials. In one interview he made the preposterous claim that he once &quot;spent 2 days being a personal assistant to a mafia boss in New York&quot;.&lt;ref name=ACE_interview/&gt;  Maddox's [[Penguin Group|Penguin]] biography skewers his own career, claiming he &quot;elevated [''Spy''] to within spitting distance of its former glory, then accidentally bankrupted it after two short years&quot;, which led ''[[The Harvard Crimson]]'', his alma mater's student newspaper, to speculate that &quot;Maddox himself had a hand in writing&quot; it.&lt;ref name=PublicityMaterial&gt;{{cite news|title=Reading.
