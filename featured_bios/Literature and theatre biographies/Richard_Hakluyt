'''Richard Hakluyt''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|h|æ|k|l|ʊ|t}}, {{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|æ|k|l|ə|t}}, or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|æ|k|əl|w|ɪ|t}};&lt;ref name=&quot;Literary Encyclopedia&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=McHenry|first=Patrick|title=Richard Hakluyt|url=http://www.litencyc.com/php/speople.php?rec=true&amp;UID=1930|publisher=[[The Literary Encyclopedia]]|date=2 November 2004|accessdate=2007-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; c. 1552 or 1553&amp;nbsp;– 23 November 1616) was an English writer. He is known for promoting the settlement of [[North America]] by the English through his works, notably ''Divers Voyages Touching the Discoverie of America'' (1582) and ''The Principal Navigations, Voiages, Traffiques and Discoueries of the English Nation'' (1589–1600).

Hakluyt was educated at [[Westminster School]] and [[Christ Church, Oxford]].  Between 1583 and 1588 he was [[chaplain]] and [[secretary#Origin|secretary]] to Sir [[Edward Stafford (diplomat)|Edward Stafford]], English ambassador at the French court. An [[ordination|ordained]] [[priest#Anglican or Episcopalian|priest]], Hakluyt held important positions at [[Bristol Cathedral]] and [[Westminster Abbey]] and was personal chaplain to [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury|Sir Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury]], principal [[Secretary of State (England)|Secretary of State]] to [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] and [[James VI and I|James I]]. He was the chief promoter of a petition to James I for [[letters patent]] to colonize [[Virginia]], which were granted to the [[London Company]] and [[Plymouth Company]] (referred to collectively as the [[Virginia Company]]) in 1606. The [[Hakluyt Society]] publishes scholarly editions of primary records of voyages and travels.

==Family, early life and education==
Hakluyt's patrilineal ancestors were of [[Wales|Welsh]] extraction, rather than [[Dutch people|Dutch]] as is often suggested;&lt;ref&gt;It has been suggested that the Hakluyts were originally [[Dutch people|Dutch]], but this appears to be a misconception: see the introduction of {{cite book|author=Richard Hakluyt|coauthors=Henry Morley (ed.)|title=Voyager's Tales, from the Collections of Richard Hakluyt|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/3752|location=London|publisher=Cassell &amp; Co|year=1880s}}&lt;/ref&gt; they appear to have settled in [[Herefordshire]] in England around the 13th century, and, according to [[antiquary]] [[John Leland (antiquary)|John Leland]], took their surname from the forest of Cluyd in [[Radnorshire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Richard Hakluyt 1552–1616|url=http://www.hereford-heritage.com/Hakluyt.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090105225753/http://www.hereford-heritage.com/Hakluyt.html|archivedate=5 January 2009|publisher=Notable Herefordians|date=10 February 2006|accessdate=25 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of Hakluyt's ancestors established themselves at [[Yatton, Herefordshire|Yatton]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Cambridge History&quot;&gt;&quot;Richard Hakluyt&quot;, § 13 in pt.

Richard Hakluyt, the second of four sons, was born in either [[Hereford]] in the [[Counties of England|county]] of [[Herefordshire]] around 1552,&lt;ref name=&quot;Encyclopaedia Britannica&quot;&gt;Quoted in {{cite book|author=Hugh Chisholm (ed.)|authorlink=Hugh Chisholm|title=The Encyclopædia Britannica|edition=11th|location=Cambridge|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=1910–1911}} 29 vols.&lt;/ref&gt; or in or near London around 1553.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cambridge History&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Divers Voyages&quot;/&gt; Hakluyt's father, also named Richard Hakluyt, was a member of the [[Worshipful Company of Skinners]] whose members dealt in skins and furs. He died in 1557 when his son was aged about five years, and his wife Margery&lt;ref name=&quot;Literary Encyclopedia&quot;/&gt; followed soon after. Hakluyt's cousin, also named Richard Hakluyt, of the [[Middle Temple]], became his [[Legal guardian|guardian]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Galileo Project&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Richard S.

While a Queen's Scholar at [[Westminster School]], Hakluyt visited his guardian, whose conversation, illustrated by &quot;certain bookes of cosmographie, an universall mappe, and the Bible&quot;, made Hakluyt resolve to &quot;prosecute that knowledge, and kind of literature&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Principall Navigations&quot;&gt;Hakluyt's dedication to Sir Francis Walsingham of the work {{cite book|last=Hakluyt|first=Richard|title=The Principall Navigations, Voiages, and Discoveries of the English Nation|location=London|publisher=Imprinted by George Bishop and Ralph Newberie, deputies to Christopher Barker, printer to the Queen’s Most Excellent Majestie|year=1589}} The spelling has been modernized.&lt;/ref&gt; Entering [[Christ Church, Oxford]],&lt;ref&gt;There does not appear to be any monument to Hakluyt either in [[Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford]], or elsewhere in the grounds of [[Christ Church, Oxford]].&lt;/ref&gt; in 1570 with financial support from the Skinners' Company,&lt;ref name=&quot;Galileo Project&quot;/&gt; &quot;his exercises of duty first performed&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Principall Navigations&quot;/&gt; he set out to read all the printed or written voyages and discoveries that he could find.

Hakluyt was [[ordination|ordained]] in 1578, the same year he began to receive a &quot;pension&quot; from the [[Worshipful Company of Clothworkers]] to study [[divinity (academic discipline)|divinity]]. The pension would have lapsed in 1583, but [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley]], intervened to have it extended until 1586 to aid Hakluyt's geographical research.&lt;ref name=&quot;Galileo Project&quot;/&gt;

==At the English Embassy in Paris==
[[File:Bristol Cathedral chapter room.jpg|thumb|right|The Norman chapter house of Bristol Cathedral (engraving 1882). Hakluyt was a member of the chapter.]]
Hakluyt's first publication&lt;ref&gt;The Galileo Project errs in identifying Hakluyt's first publication as ''A Shorte and Briefe Narration of the Two Nauigations and Discoueries to the Northwest Partes Called Newe Fraunce'' (1580), a translation of ''Bref Récit et Succincte Narration de la Navigation Faite en MDXXXV et MDXXXVI'' ({{cite book|author=Jacques Cartier|authorlink=Jacques Cartier|title=Bref Recit et Succincte Narration de la Navigation Faite en 1535 et 1536, par ...

({{cite book|author=Jacques Cartier|authorlink=Jacques Cartier|title=A Shorte and Briefe Narration of the Two Nauigations and Discoueries to the Northwest Partes called Newe Fraunce, first Translated out of French into Italian by...

Hakluyt's ''Voyages'' brought him to the notice of [[William Howard, 1st Baron Howard of Effingham|Lord Howard of Effingham]], and [[Edward Stafford (diplomat)|Sir Edward Stafford]], Lord Howard's brother-in-law. At the age of 30, being acquainted with &quot;the chiefest captaines at sea, the greatest merchants, and the best mariners of our nation&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Principall Navigations&quot;/&gt; he was selected as chaplain and [[secretary#Origin|secretary]] to accompany Stafford, now English ambassador at the French court, to Paris in 1583. In accordance with the instructions of Secretary [[Francis Walsingham]], he occupied himself chiefly in collecting information of the Spanish and French movements, and &quot;making diligent inquirie of such things as might yield any light unto our westerne discoverie in America&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Encyclopaedia Britannica&quot;/&gt; Although this was his only visit to the [[Mainland Europe|Continent]] in his life, he was angered to hear the limitations of the English in terms of travel being discussed in Paris.&lt;ref name=&quot;Principall Navigations&quot;/&gt;
[[File:RichardHakluyt-BristolCathedral-memorialtablet.jpg|thumb|left|A 1910 memorial tablet to Hakluyt in Bristol Cathedral]]
The first fruits of Hakluyt's labours in Paris were embodied in his important work entitled ''A Particuler Discourse Concerninge the Greate Necessitie and Manifolde Commodyties That Are Like to Growe to This Realme of Englande by the Westerne Discoueries Lately Attempted, Written in the Yere 1584'',&lt;!--NOTE: Title based on 1993 Hakluyt Society edition from British Library catalogue. Original title stated in the article, which cannot yet be confirmed, was ''A Particuler Discourse Concerning Wesierne Discoveries Written in the Yere 1584, by Richarde Hackluyt of Oxforde, at the Requeste and Direction of the Righte Worshipfull Mr Walter Ragfly before the Comynge Home of his Twoo Barkes''--&gt; which [[Walter Raleigh|Sir Walter Raleigh]] commissioned him to prepare. The manuscript, lost for almost 300 years, was published for the first time in 1877. Hakluyt revisited England in 1584, and laid a copy of the ''Discourse'' before [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] (to whom it had been dedicated) together with his analysis in [[Latin]] of [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politicks]]''. His objective was to recommend the enterprise of planting the English race in the unsettled parts of North America, and thus gain the Queen's support for [[Walter Raleigh#The New World|Raleigh's expedition]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Galileo Project&quot;/&gt; In May 1585 when Hakluyt was in Paris with the English Embassy, the Queen granted to him the next [[prebendary]] at [[Bristol Cathedral]] that should become vacant,&lt;ref name=&quot;Divers Voyages&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;According to the ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', above, the Queen granted Hakluyt the next vacant prebendal stall at Bristol Cathedral two days before his return to Paris.&lt;/ref&gt; to which he was admitted in 1585 or 1586 and held with other preferments till his death.

Hakluyt's other works during his time in Paris consisted mainly of [[translation]]s and compilations, with his own [[dedication#Book dedications|dedications]] and [[preface]]s. These latter writings, together with a few letters, are the only extant material out of which a biography of him can be framed. Hakluyt interested himself in the publication of the [[manuscript]] journal of [[René de Laudonnière]], the ''Histoire Notable de la Florida'' in Paris in 1586.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=René de Laudonnière|authorlink=René de Laudonnière|coauthors=Martin Basanier (ed.)|title=L'histoire Notable de la Floride ...

Auvray|year=1586}}&lt;/ref&gt; The attention that the book excited in Paris encouraged Hakluyt to prepare an English translation and publish it in London under the title ''A Notable Historie Containing Foure Voyages Made by Certayne French Captaynes unto Florida'' (1587). The same year, his edition of [[Peter Martyr d'Anghiera]]'s ''De Orbe Nouo Decades Octo'' saw the light at Paris.&lt;ref&gt;At Hakluyt's recommendation, the work was translated into English by [[Michael Lok]] and published as {{cite book|author=Petrus Martyr Anglerius|authorlink=Peter Martyr d'Anghiera|title=De Nouo Orbe, or The Historie of the West Indies ... Comprised in Eight Decades ... Three ... Formerly Translated into English, by R. Eden ... the Other Fiue ... by ... M. Lok|location=London|publisher=for Thomas Adams|year=1612}}&lt;/ref&gt; This work contains an exceedingly-rare [[intaglio printing|copperplate]] map dedicated to Hakluyt and signed F.G. (supposed to be Francis Gualle); it is the first on which the name &quot;Virginia&quot; appears.&lt;ref name=&quot;Encyclopaedia Britannica&quot;/&gt;

==Return to England==
[[File:RichardHakluyt-PrincipallNavigations-1589.jpg|thumb|right|The title page of the first edition of Hakluyt's ''The Principall Navigations, Voiages, and Discoveries of the English Nation'' (1589)]]
[[File:RichardHakluyt-PrincipallNavigations-1589-signature-closeup.jpg|thumb|right|A manuscript signature of Hakluyt from the front flyleaf of the above work]]

In 1588 Hakluyt finally returned to England with [[Douglas Sheffield, Baroness Sheffield|Lady Stafford]], after a residence in France of nearly five years. In 1589 he published the first edition of his chief work, ''The Principall Navigations, Voiages and Discoveries of the English Nation'', using eyewitness accounts as far as possible. In the preface to this he announced the intended publication of the first [[globe#Terrestrial and planetary globes|terrestrial globe]] made in England by [[Emery Molyneux]]. One narrative included in the book was that of the Englishman [[David Ingram (explorer)|David Ingram]], who was one of about a hundred privateers marooned at Mexico in 1567. Knowing that European fisherman frequented the Maine/Nova Scotia waters, they headed in that direction. Ingram and two other survivors were rescued by French fishermen in 1568.{{citation needed|date = April 2012}}

Between 1598 and 1600 appeared the final, reconstructed and greatly enlarged edition of ''The Principal Navigations, Voiages, Traffiques and Discoueries of the English Nation'' in three volumes. In the dedication of the second volume (1599) to his patron, [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury|Sir Robert Cecil]], Hakluyt strongly urged the minister as to the expediency of colonizing Virginia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Divers Voyages&quot;/&gt; A few copies of this monumental work contain a map of great rarity, the first on the [[Mercator projection]] made in England according to the true principles laid down by [[Edward Wright (mathematician)|Edward Wright]]. Hakluyt's great collection has been called &quot;the Prose Epic of the modern English nation&quot; by historian [[James Anthony Froude]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=James Anthony Froude|authorlink=James Anthony Froude|title=Essays on History and Literature|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/18276|location=London|publisher=J.M. Dent &amp; Co.|year=1906}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 April 1590 Hakluyt was instituted to the [[rectory]] of [[Wetheringsett-cum-Brockford]], Suffolk, by Lady Stafford, who was [[dowager]] baroness Sheffield. He held this position until his death, and resided in Wetheringsett through the 1590s and frequently thereafter.&lt;ref name=&quot;Galileo Project&quot;/&gt; In 1601 Hakluyt edited a translation from the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] of Antonio Galvão's ''The Discoveries of the World''. In the same year&lt;ref&gt;[http://galileo.rice.edu/Catalog/NewFiles/hakluyt.html The Galileo Project] says this took place in 1599.&lt;/ref&gt; his name occurs as an adviser to the [[British East India Company|East India Company]], in which capacity he supplied them with maps and informed them as to markets.{{citation needed|date = April 2012}}

==Later life==
In the late 1590s Hakluyt became the client and personal chaplain of [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury|Sir Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury]], Lord Burghley's son, who was to be Hakluyt's most fruitful patron. Hakluyt dedicated to Cecil the second (1599) and third volumes (1600) of the expanded edition of ''Principal Navigations'' and also his edition of Galvão's ''Discoveries'' (1601). Cecil, who was the principal [[Secretary of State (England)|Secretary of State]] to Elizabeth I and [[James VI and I|James I]], rewarded him by installing him as [[prebendary]] of [[Dean and Canons of Westminster|Westminster Abbey]] on 4 May 1602.&lt;ref name=&quot;Galileo Project&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;According to Jones's introduction to Hakluyt's ''Divers Voyages'', above, Hakluyt succeeded Dr. Richard Webster as prebendary of [[Westminster Abbey]] about 1605.&lt;/ref&gt; In the following year, he was elected [[archdeacon]] of the Abbey.{{citation needed|date = April 2012}}

Hakluyt was married twice, once in or about 1594&lt;ref name=&quot;Divers Voyages&quot;/&gt; and again in 1604. In the licence of Hakluyt's second marriage dated 30 March 1604, he is described as one of the chaplains of the [[Savoy Palace|Savoy Hospital]]; this position was also conferred on him by Cecil. His [[Will (law)|will]] refers to chambers occupied by him there up to the time of his death, and in another official document he is styled [[Doctor of Divinity]] (D.D.).&lt;ref name=&quot;Encyclopaedia Britannica&quot;/&gt;

Hakluyt was also a leading adventurer of the [[London Company|Charter of the Virginia Company of London]] as a director thereof in 1589.&lt;ref name=&quot;Galileo Project&quot;/&gt; In 1605 he secured the prospective living of [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]], the intended capital of the intended colony of [[Virginia]]. When the colony was at last established in 1607, he supplied this [[benefice]] with its chaplain, [[Robert Hunt (chaplain)|Robert Hunt]]. In 1606 he appears as the chief promoter of the petition to James I for [[letters patent]] to colonize Virginia, which were granted on 10 April 1606.&lt;ref name=&quot;Divers Voyages&quot;/&gt; His last publication was a translation of [[Hernando de Soto (explorer)|Hernando de Soto]]'s discoveries in Florida, entitled ''Virginia Richly Valued, by the Description of the Maine Land of Florida, Her Next Neighbour'' (1609). This work was intended to encourage the young colony of Virginia; Scottish historian [[William Robertson (historian)|William Robertson]] wrote of Hakluyt, &quot;England is more indebted for its American possessions than to any man of that age.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William Robertson|authorlink=William Robertson (historian)|title=The History of America|edition=10th|location=London|publisher=Strahan|year=1803}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:VirginiaCompanyofLondonSeal-1606-1624.png|thumb|left|The seal of the Virginia Company of London]]
Hakluyt prepared an English translation of Dutch jurist [[Hugo Grotius]]' ''[[Mare Liberum]]'' (1609),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hugo Grotius|authorlink=Hugo Grotius|title=Mare Liberum, sive de jure quod Batavis competit ad Indicana commercia dissertatio [The Free Sea, or, A Dissertation on the Right which Belongs to the Batavians to Take Part in the East Indian Trade]|location=Leiden|publisher=Ex officina Ludovici Elzevirij &amp;#91;From the office of [[Lodewijk Elzevir]]&amp;#93;|year=1609}}&lt;/ref&gt; a treatise that sought to demonstrate that the Dutch had the right to trade freely in the [[Indies]] contrary to Spanish and Portuguese claims of sovereignty over the seas,&lt;ref name=JMR&gt;{{cite journal|author=Helen Thornton|title=The Free Sea.

In that year, Hakluyt was a consultant to the Company when it was renewing its charter. Grotius' arguments supported England's right to trade in the Indies.&lt;ref&gt;Armitage, &quot;Introduction&quot;, ''The Free Sea'': see Thornton, &quot;The Free Sea [book review]&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; The translation may also have been part of the propaganda encouraging English people to settle in Virginia. In ''Mare Liberum'', Grotius denied that the 1493 donation by [[Pope Alexander VI]] that had divided the oceans between Spain and Portugal entitled Spain to make territorial claims to North America. Instead, he stressed the importance of occupation, which was favourable to the English as they and not the Spanish had occupied Virginia. Grotius also argued that the seas should be freely navigable by all, which was useful since the England to Virginia route crossed seas which the Portuguese claimed.&lt;ref name=JMR/&gt; However, it is not clear why Hakluyt's translation was not published in his lifetime. George Bruner Parks has theorized that publication at that time would have been inconvenient to England because after England had successfully helped Holland and Spain to negotiate the [[Twelve Years' Truce]] during the [[Eighty Years' War]], the work would have supported English claims for free seas against Spain, but not its claims for closed seas against Holland.&lt;ref name=JMR/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=George Bruner Parks|title=Richard Hakluyt and the English Voyages [Special Publication American Geographical Society; no. 10]|location=New York, N.Y.|publisher=[[American Geographical Society]]|year=1928|pages=212}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hakluyt's handwritten manuscript, MS Petyt 529, in [[Inner Temple Library]] in London was eventually published as ''[[The Free Sea]]'' for the first time in 2004.&lt;ref name=Armitage/&gt;

In 1591, Hakluyt inherited family property upon the death of his elder brother Thomas; a year later, upon the death of his youngest brother Edmund, he inherited additional property which derived from his uncle. In 1612 Hakluyt became a charter member of the North-west Passage Company.&lt;ref name=&quot;Galileo Project&quot;/&gt; By the time of his death, he had amassed a small fortune out of his various [[remuneration|emoluments]] and [[wikt:preferment|preferments]], of which the last was [[Gedney, Lincolnshire|Gedney]] Rectory, [[Lincolnshire]], presented to him by his younger brother Oliver in 1612. Unfortunately, his wealth was squandered by his only son.&lt;ref name=&quot;Encyclopaedia Britannica&quot;/&gt;

Hakluyt died on 23 November 1616, probably in London, and was buried on 26 November in [[Westminster Abbey]];&lt;ref name=&quot;Divers Voyages&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The burial register merely states that Hakluyt was buried &quot;in the Abbey&quot; without giving an exact location, and there is no monument or gravestone: personal e-mail communication on 10 May 2007 with Miss Christine Reynolds, Assistant Keeper of Muniments, Westminster Abbey Library.&lt;/ref&gt; by an error in the abbey register his burial is recorded under the year 1626.&lt;ref name=&quot;Encyclopaedia Britannica&quot;/&gt; A number of his manuscripts, sufficient to form a fourth volume of his collections of 1598–1600, fell into the hands of [[Samuel Purchas]], who inserted them in an abridged form in his ''Pilgrimes'' (1625–1626).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Samuel Purchas the Elder|authorlink=Samuel Purchas|title=Purchas His Pilgrimes: In Five Bookes: The First, Contayning the Voyages ...

Bod. manuscript Seld. B. 8&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hakluyt is principally remembered for his efforts in promoting and supporting the settlement of North America by the English through his writings. These works were a fertile source of material for [[William Shakespeare]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Cambridge History&quot;/&gt; and other authors. Hakluyt also encouraged the production of geographical and historical writings by others. It was at Hakluyt's suggestion that Robert Parke translated [[Juan Gonzalez de Mendoza]]'s ''The History of the Great and Mighty Kingdom of China and the Situation Thereof'' (1588–1590),&lt;ref&gt;An edition was published by the Hakluyt Society in the 19th century as {{cite book|author=Juan Gonzalez de Mendoza (comp.)|coauthors=Robert Parke (trans.); G.T.

==Hakluyt Society==
The [[Hakluyt Society]] was founded in 1846 for printing rare and unpublished accounts of voyages and travels, and continues to publish volumes each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History and Objectives of the Hakluyt Society|url=http://www.hakluyt.com/hak-soc-objectives.htm?PHPSESSID=9175b423002ab30923565934fa4e2dd7|publisher=Hakluyt Society|accessdate=13 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The 2008 Hakluyt conference and the Hakluyt Editorial Project==
In May 2008, a major interdisciplinary conference called ''Richard Hakluyt 1552–1616: Life, Times, Legacy'', examining the significance of Hakluyt's work, was jointly organized by the [[National Maritime Museum]], the Centre for Travel Writing Studies, [[Nottingham Trent University]] and the [[National University of Ireland, Galway]]. A major aim of the conference was to lay the groundwork for and establish a network of scholars to prepare a new edition of Hakluyt's ''Principal Navigations''. Those leading this group include Nigel Rigby, Will Ryan (President of the Hakluyt Society), and the project's editors Daniel Carey (NUI, Galway), Andrew Hadfield ([[University of Sussex]]) and Claire Jowitt (NTU).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document|title=The Richard Hakluyt 'Principal Navigations' editorial project|url=http://www.nmm.ac.uk/researchers/research-areas-and-projects/richard-hakluyt-conference|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5xPAroLcH|archivedate=23 March 2011|publisher=[[National Maritime Museum]]|year=2008|accessdate=23 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
