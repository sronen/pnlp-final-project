He served as [[campaign manager]] for the future president's successful runs for the [[United States Senate]] in 1950 and for the [[Vice President of the United States|vice presidency]] in 1952, and managed the campaigns of other [[California]] [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]]. He was active in each of Nixon's two successful runs for the [[White House]] in low-profile positions.

Chotiner was born in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]]; his father moved the family to California and then abandoned his wife and children. Murray Chotiner attended [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]], and graduated from the [[Southwestern Law School|Southwestern School of Law]]. He practiced law in Los Angeles, and branched out into public relations. Involving himself in Republican politics, he played an active part in several political campaigns and made an unsuccessful run for the [[California State Assembly]] in 1938.

Nixon retained Chotiner as a [[Political consulting|consultant]] to [[California's 12th congressional district election, 1946|his first congressional campaign]] in 1946. In an era when the perceived threat of [[communism]] was a major domestic issue, Chotiner advised the future president to link his [[liberal (politics)|liberal]] opponent, Representative [[Jerry Voorhis]], to a political organization which was believed to be communist-dominated. Nixon was elected, and hired Chotiner to run his 1950 Senate campaign against Representative [[Helen Gahagan|Helen Gahagan Douglas]]. Chotiner used a similar strategy in [[United States Senate election in California, 1950|that campaign]], stressing Douglas' liberal voting record and printing the accusations on [[Pinko#Politics|pink paper]] to hint at communist sympathy. Congressman Nixon easily defeated Douglas, and Chotiner next managed Nixon's 1952 vice presidential campaign and counseled Nixon through allegations of [[antisemitism]] and revelations that there was a privately run fund to pay Nixon's political expenses—revelations that the candidate decisively overcame with his televised [[Checkers speech]].

After Congress investigated Chotiner in 1956, suspecting he was using his connections to Nixon for [[influence peddling]] to benefit his private legal clients, the vice president and his former campaign manager temporarily parted ways. Nixon recalled him to work on his unsuccessful 1962 campaign for [[Governor of California]], and again for his successful [[United States presidential election, 1968|1968 presidential bid]]. After Nixon was inaugurated in 1969, Chotiner received a political appointment to a government position and, in 1970, became a member of the [[Executive Office of the President of the United States|White House staff]]. He returned to private practice a year later, but was involved in [[United States presidential election, 1972|Nixon's 1972 re-election campaign]]. Chotiner described the [[Watergate scandal|Watergate break-in]] that occurred during Nixon's 1972 campaign and that eventually brought down the Nixon administration as &quot;stupid&quot;, and when a newspaper accused him of organizing it, he sued for libel and won a substantial settlement. He remained an informal adviser to Nixon until he died in [[Washington, D.C.]], following an auto accident in January 1974, and Nixon mourned the loss of a man he described as a counselor and friend.

One of the first professional [[campaign manager]]s;&lt;ref name = &quot;jew&quot;/&gt; Chotiner was retained as a political consultant by Nixon's 1946 campaign for Congress against incumbent Representative Jerry Voorhis. He advised linking Voorhis with a [[political action committee]], believed to be communist-dominated, run by the [[Congress of Industrial Organizations]].&lt;ref name=&quot;morris&quot;/&gt; The consultant was only able to devote a limited amount of time to the Nixon campaign since he was the [[Southern California]] campaign manager for the successful re-election bid of Republican Senator [[William F. Knowland]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Katcher 1967 p=257&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Katcher|1967|p=257.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chotiner coined the campaign slogan, &quot;We will not surrender&quot; for Knowland, implying that Democratic challenger [[Will Rogers, Jr.]] would permit communism to take over the country.&lt;ref name = &quot;morris&quot;/&gt; Both Republican candidates defeated their opponents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Morris|1990|p=334.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, Chotiner served as Southern California campaign manager for the unsuccessful 1948 presidential bid of [[List of Governors of New York|New York Governor]] [[Thomas E.

Chotiner had parted ways with Governor Warren, and the popular governor, who was running for a third term, &quot;wanted no part&quot; of the Nixon campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Katcher|1967|p=260.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, Chotiner sought to maneuver the future chief justice into an endorsement of Representative Nixon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Katcher|1967|pp=256–57.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chotiner instructed [[Young Republicans]] head and future congressman [[Joseph F.

===1952 campaign===
{{main|Checkers speech}}
In 1952, Chotiner served as campaign manager for Knowland. Knowland cross-filed and won both major party primaries, virtually assuring his re-election.&lt;ref name = &quot;wolf&quot;/&gt; The strategist also served as Holt's campaign manager in the [[California's 22nd congressional district|California 22nd Congressional district]] Republican primary. Senator Nixon endorsed Holt over State Senator [[Jack Tenney]], and Chotiner asked Nixon to supply him with Tenney's [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] file—the state senator had once had communist leanings, though he had long renounced them. Nixon arranged for Chotiner to get the file, which was supposed to be for Congressional use only, though he apparently made no public use of the file in the campaign. Holt defeated Tenney in the primary, and went on to win the general election.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gellman|1999|pp=407–08.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the primary completed, Chotiner's attention turned to the [[1952 Republican National Convention]] in Chicago. While the California delegation was pledged to Governor Warren, (who hoped to gain the Republican nomination for president in a [[brokered convention]]), the strategist realized that Nixon's best chance for advancement was in the nomination of General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], who was in a close battle with Senator [[Robert Taft]] for the party's nomination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Morris|1990|p=672.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chotiner was quietly designated an alternate delegate to the convention as an original alternate had dropped out, and when Governor Warren learned of his selection, he &quot;erupted&amp;nbsp;... furiously&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Morris|1990|p=702.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chotiner had volunteered to take care of many of the convention arrangements for the California delegation, and for the Warren campaign headquarters at the Conrad Hilton Hotel. Seeking to avoid a split with Nixon,&lt;ref name = &quot;split&quot;/&gt; who assured Warren that Chotiner was merely there to handle physical arrangements,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cray|1997|p=231.}}&lt;/ref&gt; the governor grudgingly allowed Chotiner to retain his roles.&lt;ref name = &quot;split&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Morris|1990|p=703.}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the California delegation's train arrived in Chicago, the Warren campaign found that the buses which Chotiner had arranged to transport the delegation to its hotel were covered with &quot;Eisenhower for President&quot; banners—which the governor's supporters hastily replaced with Warren signs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cray|1997|p=235.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chotiner had an extra phone surreptitiously installed in the Warren headquarters so he could quietly communicate the latest developments to Nixon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Morris|1990|p=714.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also remained in close contact with Eisenhower aide and future [[Attorney General of the United States|Attorney General]], [[Herbert Brownell Jr.|Herbert Brownell]]. Warren paid a courtesy call on Eisenhower, and later wrote in his memoirs, &quot;Imagine my surprise when the doorkeeper who admitted me to the general's suite was Murray Chotiner.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cray|1997|p=238.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eisenhower was nominated over Taft and Warren in a close, first-ballot victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Morris|1990|p=729.}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a final indignity to Warren, it developed that Chotiner had overspent his budget, forcing the governor and others to pay hotel expenses from their own pockets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Black|2007|p=209.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite Chotiner's maneuvering for Nixon, the senator was still uncertain if he should take the vice-presidential slot if offered. [[Pat Nixon]] wanted her husband to decline it. Chotiner argued to the Nixons that if the Republicans lost, Nixon would retain his seat in the Senate, that if he served as Vice President and re-entered private life, he would have a lucrative legal career, but that if Nixon did not move up to the Vice Presidency, with Senator Knowland relatively young and in good health, Nixon was likely to remain merely the junior senator from California for many years to come.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Morris|1990|pp=727–28.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eisenhower offered Nixon the position, the senator accepted, and with Knowland's re-election bid all but won, Chotiner became Nixon's campaign manager.&lt;ref name = &quot;wolf&quot;&gt;{{Citation

Soon after Nixon's selection, controversy erupted over the senator's 1951 purchase of a home with a [[restrictive covenant]] that forbade resale or rental to Jews. Chotiner, a Jew, successfully appealed to the [[Anti-Defamation League]] and the Jewish press for support for Nixon in the controversy, providing them with a list of Jewish causes which he had favored. Nixon's staff pointed out that the covenant was, in any event, invalid because of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]]'s 1948 ruling in'' [[Shelley v. Kraemer]]''. The controversy &quot;failed to gain fatal traction&quot; but repeatedly surfaced in later Nixon campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Despite his success in advancing Nixon's career, Chotiner was respected, but was not universally popular among the Vice President's backers. Frank Jorgensen, one of Nixon's first backers in the Voorhis race, said of the attorney, &quot;I knew that Murray was very impatient with people who didn't have the IQ that he had. He had the habit of a man like that of tramping on them. He'd move ahead. He'd just leave the wreckage behind him, but he would get the job done.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Parmet|1990|p=192.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nixon family friend and [[Whittier College]] trustee Herman Perry stated, &quot;When Murray develops a little more of the techniques of public relations, I will be one of the first to recognize it and one of the first to give him credit&amp;nbsp;... The one thing I do not want him to do is be the quarterback and call the plays on the team on which I play.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Parmet|1990|p=193.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1955, Chotiner lectured at the Republican national campaign school.&lt;ref name = &quot;wolf&quot;/&gt; He described his campaign philosophy:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I believe in all sincerity that if you do not deflate the opposition candidate before your own campaign gets started, the odds are you are doomed to defeat. I believe it is a smear to attack an individual on matters that have no relationship whatsoever to the campaign&amp;nbsp;... but it is not a smear if you point out the record of your opponent.&lt;ref name = &quot;maninthenews&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Chotiner was slated to play a major role in the Eisenhower/Nixon re-election bid. However, he had represented two [[Atlantic City, New Jersey|Atlantic City]] clothing manufacturers, the Kravitz brothers, who had been fined and barred from further government contracts for fraud,&lt;!-- Source says 1965, not 1956, obvious typo --&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;postobit&quot;/&gt; and on April 25, 1956, a subcommittee of the Senate Permanent Committee on Investigations, looking into military procurement, subpoenaed him to appear before it. The senators wanted to inquire why a New Jersey firm which already had six attorneys would hire a California lawyer, especially one with close ties to Vice President Nixon.&lt;ref name = &quot;confer&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Robert F. Kennedy 1964.jpeg|thumb|Senate subcommittee counsel [[Robert F. Kennedy]]]]
When Chotiner appeared before the subcommittee on May 2, he testified that he had been retained by the firm when it was seeking to expand to California, that he had conferred with Justice Department attorneys regarding the criminal charges, and that no special favors had been asked or given.&lt;ref name = &quot;confer&quot;&gt;{{Citation

==Presidential adviser (1969–1974)==

===Federal lawyer (1969–1971)===
The day after Nixon's election as President in November 1968, he asked Chotiner what job he would like, and Chotiner indicated that he wanted to be chairman of the Republican National Committee (RNC), but was told that was impossible.&lt;ref name = &quot;evans&quot;/&gt; However, Mitchell and soon-to-be White House Chief of Staff [[H.R. Haldeman]] wished to see Chotiner given a position outside the White House, as they saw him as a rival. Accordingly, they proposed that Chotiner be made RNC executive director, to wield the real power with the chairman as figurehead. A reluctant Nixon, who was worried about Chotiner's hatchet-man reputation, finally agreed, and Chotiner wrapped up his affairs in California.&lt;ref name = &quot;evans&quot;/&gt;

Chotiner was given an office at the RNC, nominally as the official in charge of tickets for the inauguration.&lt;ref name = &quot;times&quot;/&gt; RNC chairman [[Ray Bliss]] and his aides were disturbed by his presence, and were told he would be gone after January 20. Meanwhile, Nixon and his aides considered a new RNC chairman finally settling on Maryland Congressman [[Rogers Morton]], who agreed to take the position once Bliss left, though Morton was not told of the promise to Chotiner. When the President-elect met with Bliss on January 10, 1969, he could not bring himself to fire the chairman. With the situation unresolved, and Morton's appointment unannounced, Chotiner sat in his RNC office for a month after the inauguration with nothing to do, as the RNC staff wondered at his presence.&lt;ref name = &quot;evans&quot;/&gt;

Nixon, Haldeman, and Mitchell did nothing to clear up the situation, and Chotiner finally took action on his own and told Bliss that he was to take control. A shaken Bliss called Haldeman, who backed up Chotiner's account, and Bliss immediately resigned. Bliss's aides publicized the reasons for his resignation, and reporter [[David Broder]] contacted Chotiner, who confirmed the story. Morton refused to be a figurehead for Chotiner, or indeed to have Chotiner at the RNC in any capacity, and so stated to the media. Mitchell dispatched his subordinate, [[John Sears (political strategist)|John Sears]], to tell Chotiner he would have no place at the RNC. Chotiner took the bad news philosophically, stating that it was not the first time he had been treated badly, and that his estranged wife had predicted that Nixon would &quot;screw&quot; him.&lt;ref name = &quot;evans&quot;/&gt;

However, some job still had to be found for Chotiner, who had wound up his California practice and sold his home. Haldeman refused to have him in the White House, and Nixon's aides deemed that the Democratic-controlled Senate was unlikely to confirm Chotiner for any post requiring its approval.&lt;ref name = &quot;evans&quot;/&gt; On April 10, 1969, acting [[Office of the United States Trade Representative|Special Representative for Trade Negotiations]] [[Theodore R.

In April 1973, the ''[[New Hampshire Union Leader|Manchester Union Leader]]'' accused Chotiner of having organized the Watergate break-in.

On January 23, 1974, Chotiner was involved in an automobile accident on [[Virginia State Route 123]] in McLean, Virginia, by the home of [[Massachusetts]] Democratic Senator [[Ted Kennedy|Edward M. Kennedy]], who heard the collision and called for an ambulance. Chotiner had suffered a broken leg, and appeared to be recovering. The evening before he was due to be discharged from the hospital, he started gasping uncontrollably, and X-rays revealed a blood clot near the lungs. Treatment was unsuccessful and he died of a [[pulmonary embolism]] at the [[Washington Hospital Center]] in Washington, D.C. Gerald R. Warren, Nixon's deputy press secretary, stated that President Nixon was &quot;deeply saddened&quot; by the news.&lt;ref name = &quot;times&quot;/&gt;

Nixon described Chotiner as a &quot;valued counselor and a trusted colleague. But above all, Murray Chotiner was my friend.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;postfriend&quot;&gt;{{Citation

Chotiner was in many ways the most interesting personality in Nixon's political camp: aggressive, egocentric, a professional among amateurs, brilliant, overbearing, ruthless, engaging, habitually guilty of overkill, constantly enlarging his area of operation.
