'''Gerald Rudolph''' &quot;'''Jerry'''&quot; '''Ford, Jr.''' (born '''Leslie Lynch King, Jr.'''; July 14, 1913 – December 26, 2006) was the [[List of Presidents of the United States|38th President of the United States]], serving from 1974 to 1977, and the [[List of Vice Presidents of the United States|40th Vice President of the United States]] serving from 1973 to 1974.  As the first person appointed to the vice-presidency under the terms of the [[Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|25th Amendment]] (after [[Spiro Agnew]] had resigned), when he became President upon [[Richard Nixon|Richard Nixon's]] resignation on August 9, 1974, he became the only President of the United States who was never elected President nor Vice-President by the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]].  Before ascending to the vice-presidency, Ford served nearly 25 years as the [[United States House of Representatives|Representative]] from [[Michigan's 5th congressional district]], eight of them as the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives|Minority Leader]].

As President, Ford signed the [[Helsinki Accords]], marking a move toward [[détente]] in the [[Cold War]]. With the [[Fall of Saigon|conquest of South Vietnam]] by North Vietnam nine months into his presidency, U.S. involvement in [[Vietnam]] essentially [[Vietnam War#Exit of the Americans: 1973–1975|ended]].  Domestically, Ford presided over arguably the weakest economy since the [[Great Depression]], with growing inflation and a [[recession]] during his tenure.&lt;ref name=&quot;'70s&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title= How We Got Here: The '70s|last= Frum|first= David|authorlink= David Frum|year= 2000|publisher=Basic Books|location= New York, New York|isbn= 0-465-04195-7|page= 14}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of his more controversial acts was to grant a [[presidential pardon]] to President Richard Nixon for his role in the [[Watergate scandal]]. During Ford's incumbency, foreign policy was characterized in procedural terms by the increased role Congress began to play, and by the corresponding curb on the powers of the President.&lt;!-- (Please keep hidden until fully developed below) &quot;This was made clear by developments in two major substantive issues during Ford's presidency: the Cyprus crisis and Arab Israeli relations.&quot; --&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lenczowski&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=[[George Lenczowski]]|title=American Presidents, and the Middle East|year=1990|isbn=0-8223-0972-6|pages=142–143|publisher=Duke University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976, Ford narrowly defeated [[Ronald Reagan]] for the Republican nomination, but lost the [[United States presidential election, 1976|presidential election]] to [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Jimmy Carter]].

Following his years as president, Ford remained active in the Republican Party.  After experiencing health problems, Ford [[Death and state funeral of Gerald Ford|died in his home]] on December 26, 2006. He [[List of Presidents of the United States by age|lived longer than any other U.S. president]], dying at 93 years and 165 days.

==Early life==
===Childhood===
Ford was born Leslie Lynch King, Jr., on July 14, 1913, at [[3202 Woolworth Avenue]] in [[Omaha, Nebraska]], where his parents lived with his paternal grandparents. His mother was [[Dorothy Ayer Gardner Ford|Dorothy Ayer Gardner]], and his father was [[Leslie Lynch King, Sr.]], a wool trader and son of prominent banker [[Charles Henry King]] and Martha King. Dorothy separated from King just sixteen days after her son's birth. She took her son with her to the [[Oak Park, Illinois]] home of her sister Tannisse and brother-in-law, Clarence Haskins James. From there, she moved to the home of her parents, Levi Addison Gardner and Adele Augusta Ayer in [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]]. Dorothy and King divorced in December 1913; she gained full custody of her son. Ford's paternal grandfather Charles Henry King paid child support until shortly before his death in 1930.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Young, Jeff C.|title=The Fathers of American Presidents|year=1997|isbn=0-7864-0182-6|publisher=McFarland &amp; Co.|location=Jefferson, NC}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Gerald Ford 1916.gif|left|thumb|upright|alt=A young boy circa 1916.|Leslie Lynch King, Jr. (later known as Gerald R. Ford) in 1916]]

Ford later said his biological father had a history of hitting his mother.&lt;ref name=&quot;ford-Nebraska&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Nebraska-born Ford Left State as Infant|author=Funk, Josh|agency=Associated Press|publisher=Fox News|date=December 27, 2006|url=http://www.foxnews.com/wires/2006Dec27/0,4670,FordNebraska,00.html|accessdate=September 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; James M. Cannon, a member of the Ford administration, wrote in a Ford biography that the Kings' separation and divorce were sparked when, a few days after Ford's birth, Leslie King threatened Dorothy with a butcher knife and threatened to kill her, Ford, and Ford's nursemaid. Ford later told confidantes that his father had first hit his mother on their honeymoon for smiling at another man.&lt;ref name=&quot;pbs-knife&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Cannon |first=James |url=http://www.pbs.org/newshour/character/essays/ford.html |title=Gerald R. Ford |work=Character Above All|publisher=Public Broadcasting System |accessdate=December 28, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After two and a half years with her parents, on February 1, 1916, Dorothy married [[Gerald Rudolff Ford]], a salesman in a family-owned paint and varnish company. They then called her son ''Gerald Rudolff Ford, Jr.'' The future president was never formally [[adoption|adopted]], however, and he did not legally change his name until December 3, 1935; he also used a more conventional spelling of his middle name.&lt;ref name=&quot;utexas&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ford.utexas.edu/grf/genealog.asp|title=Gerald R. Ford Genealogical Information |work=Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library &amp; Museum |publisher=University of Texas |accessdate=December 28, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was raised in [[East Grand Rapids, Michigan|Grand Rapids]] with his three half brothers by his mother's second marriage: Thomas Gardner Ford (1918–1995), Richard Addison Ford (born 1924), and James Francis Ford (1927–2001).

Ford also had three half-siblings from his father's second marriage: Marjorie King (1921–1993), Leslie Henry King (1923–1976), and Patricia Jane King (born 1925). They never saw one another as children and he did not know them at all. Ford was not aware of his biological father until he was 17, when his parents told him about the circumstances of his birth. That year his father Leslie King, whom Ford described as a &quot;carefree, well-to-do man who didn't really give a damn about the hopes and dreams of his firstborn son&quot;, approached Ford while he was waiting tables in a Grand Rapids restaurant. The two &quot;maintained a sporadic contact&quot; until Leslie King, Sr.'s death.&lt;ref name=&quot;ford-Nebraska&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=A Common Man on an Uncommon Climb|work=The New York Times|date=August 19, 1976|url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?_r=2&amp;res=F10F10FF3E5D14768FDDA00994D0405B868BF1D3|page=28|accessdate=April 26, 2009 | format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ford maintained his distance emotionally, saying, &quot;My stepfather was a magnificent person and my mother equally wonderful. So I couldn't have written a better prescription for a superb family upbringing.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;kunhardt&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Kunhardt, Jr. |first=Phillip |url=http://www.americanpresident.org/history/geraldford/biography/resources/ArticlesCopy1/KunhardtFordBio.article.shtml |title=Gerald R.

===Scouting and athletics===

Ford was involved in The [[Boy Scouts of America]], and earned that program's highest rank, [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]].&lt;ref name=&quot;honor&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Townley |first=Alvin |url=http://us.macmillan.com/legacyofhonor|title=Legacy of Honor: The Values and Influence of America's Eagle Scouts |publisher=St. Martin's Press|location=New York |pages=12–13 and 87|isbn=0-312-36653-1 |accessdate=December 29, 2006 |year=2007 |origyear= December 26, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In later years, Ford received the [[Distinguished Eagle Scout Award]] in May 1970 and [[Silver Buffalo Award]] from the Boy Scouts of America. He is the only U.S. president who was an Eagle Scout.&lt;ref name=&quot;honor&quot;/&gt; [[Scouting]] was so important to Ford that his family asked that Scouts participate in his funeral. About 400 Eagle Scouts were part of the funeral procession, where they formed an honor guard as the casket went by in front of the museum. A few selected scouts served as ushers inside the National Cathedral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Ray |first=Mark |year=2007 |url=http://www.scoutingmagazine.org/issues/0703/a-ford.html |title=Eagle Scout Welcome Gerald Ford Home |work=Scouting Magazine|publisher=Boy Scouts of America |accessdate=March 5, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ford attended Grand Rapids South High School and was a star athlete and [[captain (sports)|captain]] of his [[American football|football]] team.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document|title=Investigatory Records on Gerald Ford, Applicant for a Commission|date=December 30, 1941|publisher=Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library |url=http://www.fordlibrarymuseum.gov/library/document/usnavy/2825430.pdf |accessdate=November 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1930, he was selected to the All-City team of the [[Grand Rapids City League]]. He also attracted the attention of college recruiters.&lt;ref name=&quot;kunhardt&quot;/&gt;

Attending the [[University of Michigan]] as an undergraduate, Ford played [[center (American football)|center]] and [[linebacker]] for the school's football team&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wertheimer|first=Linda|title=Special Report: Former President Gerald Ford Dies; Sought to Heal Nation Disillusioned by Watergate Scandal|date=December 27, 2006|publisher=[[National Public Radio]]|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4529638|accessdate=April 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and helped the [[Michigan Wolverines football|Wolverines]] to undefeated seasons and [[NCAA Division I FBS National Football Championship|national titles]] in [[1932 Michigan Wolverines football team|1932]] and [[1933 Michigan Wolverines football team|1933]]. The team suffered a steep decline in his [[1934 Michigan Wolverines football team|1934]] senior year, however, winning only one game. Ford was the team's star nonetheless, and after a game during which Michigan held heavily favored [[Minnesota Golden Gophers football|Minnesota]] (the eventual national champion) to a scoreless tie in the first half, assistant coach [[Bennie Oosterbaan]] later said, &quot;When I walked into the dressing room at half time, I had tears in my eyes I was so proud of them. Ford and [Cedric] Sweet played their hearts out. They were everywhere on defense.&quot; Ford later recalled, &quot;During 25 years in the rough-and-tumble world of politics, I often thought of the experiences before, during, and after that game in 1934. Remembering them has helped me many times to face a tough situation, take action, and make every effort possible despite adverse odds.&quot; His teammates later voted Ford their most valuable player, with one assistant coach noting, &quot;They felt Jerry was one guy who would stay and fight in a losing cause.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;perry&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Perry |first=Will |url=http://www.aafla.org/SportsLibrary/FootballStudies/1999/FS0202h.pdf |format=PDF|title=The Wolverines: A Story of Michigan Football|chapter=No Cheers From the Alumni |pages=150–152 |publisher=The Strode Publishers |location=Huntsville, Alabama|isbn=0-87397-055-1|accessdate=December 28, 2006 |year=1974}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the same season, in a game against the [[University of Chicago]], Ford &quot;became the only future U.S. president to tackle a future [[Heisman Trophy]] winner when he brought down running back [[Jay Berwanger]], who would win the first Heisman the following year.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ford one of most athletic Presidents |agency=Associated Press |publisher=MSNBC |date=December 27, 2006 |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16367165/ |accessdate=December 31, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1934, Ford was selected for the Eastern Team on the Shriner's East West Crippled Children game at San Francisco (a benefit for crippled children), played on January 1, 1935. As part of the 1935 Collegiate All-Star football team, Ford played against the [[Chicago Bears]] in an exhibition game at [[Soldier Field]].&lt;ref name=&quot;greene&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Greene |first=J.R. |title=The Presidency of Gerald R.

Ford remained interested in football and his school throughout life, occasionally attending games. Ford also visited with players and coaches during practices, at one point asking to join the players in the huddle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Clumsy image aside, Ford was Accomplished Athlete|work=Los Angeles Times|date=December 28, 2006|accessdate=September 2, 2009|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/bal-sp.ford28dec28,0,6535524.story}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ford often had the Naval band play the University of Michigan fight song, ''[[The Victors]]'', before state events instead of ''[[Hail to the Chief]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Press and the Ford Presidency | author=Rozell, Mark J. | date=October 15, 1992 | publisher=University of Michigan Press | isbn=0-472-10350-4 | page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also selected the song to be played during his funeral procession at the U.S. Capitol.&lt;ref&gt;Anne E. Kornblut, &quot;Ford Arranged His Funeral to Reflect Himself and Drew in a Former Adversary&quot;, ''The New York Times'', December 29, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; On his death in December 2006, the [[University of Michigan Marching Band]] played the fight song for him one final time, for his last ride from the [[Gerald R.

Ford was also an avid golfer. In 1977, he shot a [[hole in one]] during a Pro-am held in conjunction with the [[Danny Thomas Memphis Classic]] at [[Colonial Country Club (Memphis)|Colonial Country Club]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. He received the 1985 [[Old Tom Morris Award]] from the [[Golf Course Superintendents Association of America]], GCSAA's highest honor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gcsaa.org/_common/templates/GcsaaSubNavigationLayout.aspx?id=333|title=Old Tom Morris Award Recipients|publisher=Golf Course Superintendents Association of America|accessdate=September 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
At Michigan, Ford became a member of the [[Delta Kappa Epsilon]] fraternity (Omicron chapter) and washed dishes at his fraternity house to earn money for college expenses. Following his graduation in 1935 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in economics, he turned down contract offers from the [[Detroit Lions]] and [[Green Bay Packers]] of the [[National Football League]] to take a coaching position at Yale and apply to its law school.&lt;ref name=&quot;proball&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Vice Presidents of the United States 1789–1993|author=Wendy Wolff|year=1997|publisher=[[United States Government Printing Office]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ford continued to contribute to football and boxing, accepting an assistant coaching job for both at Yale in September 1935.&lt;ref name=&quot;utexas-grf-timeline&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fordlibrarymuseum.gov/grf/timeline.asp |title=Timeline of President Ford's Life and Career |publisher=Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library &amp; Museum|accessdate=December 28, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ford hoped to attend Yale's law school beginning in 1935 while serving as boxing coach and assistant varsity football coach. Yale officials at first denied his admission to the law school, because of his full-time coaching responsibilities. He spent the summer of 1937 as a student at the [[University of Michigan Law School]]&lt;ref name=&quot;umlaw&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.umich.edu/ford/timeline.html |title=The U-M Remembers Gerald R. Ford |publisher=The University of Michigan |accessdate=January 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was eventually admitted in spring 1938 to [[Yale Law School]].&lt;ref name=&quot;librarybio&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fordlibrarymuseum.gov/grf/timeline.asp |title=Gerald R. Ford Biography |publisher=Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library &amp; Museum| accessdate=January 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ford earned his LL.B. degree in 1941 (later amended to [[Juris Doctor]]), graduating in the top 25 percent of his class. His introduction to politics came in the summer of 1940 when he worked in [[Wendell Willkie]]'s presidential campaign.
While attending Yale Law School, he joined a group of students led by [[R. Douglas Stuart, Jr.]], and signed a petition to enforce the 1939 [[Neutrality Acts of 1930s|Neutrality Act]]. The petition was circulated nationally and was the inspiration for the [[America First Committee]], a group determined to keep the U.S. out of [[World War II]].&lt;ref name=&quot;onlinereader&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Doenecke|first=Justus D.|year=1990 |url=http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0817988416/ |title=In Danger Undaunted: The Anti-Interventionist Movement of 1940–1941 As Revealed in the Papers of the America First Committee (Hoover Archival Documentaries) |publisher=Hoover Institution Press |accessdate=December 28, 2006}} p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Ford graduated from law school in 1941, and was admitted to the Michigan [[bar (law)|bar]] shortly thereafter. In May 1941, he opened a Grand Rapids law practice with a friend, [[Philip W. Buchen]],&lt;ref name=&quot;utexas-grf-timeline&quot;/&gt; who would later serve as Ford's White House counsel. But overseas developments caused a change in plans, and Ford responded to the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] by enlisting in the Navy.&lt;ref name=&quot;navy&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Naughton |first=James M. |coauthors=Adam Clymer |date=December 26, 2006 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/27/washington/27webford.html?pagewanted=4 |title=Gerald Ford, 38th President, Dies at 93 years and 165 day |work=The New York Times |publisher=Naval Historical Center |accessdate=October 19, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Naval service in World War II==
[[File:Group photo of ship’s gunnery officers aboard the fast aircraft carrier USS Monterey include Gerald Ford.jpg|thumb|alt=Twenty-eight Sailors in the uniform of the United States Navy pose on the deck of a World War Two-era Aircraft Carrier.|The Gunnery officers of the [[USS Monterey (CVL-26)|USS ''Monterey'']]. Ford is second from the right, in the front row.]]
Ford received a commission as [[Ensign (rank)#United States|ensign]] in the [[United States Navy Reserve|U.S. Naval Reserve]] on April 13, 1942. On April 20, he reported for active duty to the V-5 instructor school at [[Annapolis, Maryland]]. After one month of training, he went to Navy Preflight School in [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina]], where he was one of 83 instructors and taught elementary navigation skills, ordnance, gunnery, first aid and military drill. In addition, he coached in all nine sports that were offered, but mostly in swimming, boxing and football. During the one year he was at the Preflight School, he was promoted to [[Lieutenant, Junior Grade|Lieutenant Junior Grade]] on June 2, 1942, and to Lieutenant in March 1943.

Applying for sea duty, Ford was sent in May 1943 to the pre-commissioning detachment for the new aircraft carrier {{USS|Monterey|CVL-26}}, at New York Shipbuilding Corporation, [[Camden, New Jersey]]. From the ship's commissioning on June 17, 1943, until the end of December 1944, Ford served as the assistant navigator, Athletic Officer, and antiaircraft battery officer on board the ''Monterey''. While he was on board, the carrier participated in many actions in the [[Pacific Theater of Operations|Pacific Theater]] with the [[United States Third Fleet|Third]] and [[United States Fifth Fleet|Fifth Fleets]] in late 1943 and 1944. In 1943, the carrier helped secure [[Makin (islands)|Makin Island]] in the Gilberts, and participated in carrier strikes against [[Kavieng]], New Ireland in 1943. During the spring of 1944, the ''Monterey'' supported landings at [[Kwajalein]] and [[Eniwetok]] and participated in carrier strikes in the [[Mariana Islands|Marianas]], [[Caroline Islands|Western Carolines]], and northern [[New Guinea]], as well as in the [[Battle of the Philippine Sea]].&lt;ref name=&quot;hove&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Hove |first=Duane |title=American Warriors: Five Presidents in the Pacific Theater of World War II |publisher=Burd Street Press |isbn=1-57249-307-0|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; After overhaul, from September to November 1944, aircraft from the ''Monterey'' launched strikes against [[Wake Island]], participated in strikes in the Philippines and [[Ryukyu Islands|Ryukyus]], and supported the landings at [[Leyte Island|Leyte]] and [[Mindoro]].&lt;ref name=&quot;hove&quot;/&gt;
[[File:GeraldFord1945.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=The head and shoulders of a man in a World War Two-era uniform of the United States Navy.|Ford in [[United States Navy|Navy]] uniform, 1945]]

Although the ship was not damaged by [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] forces, the ''Monterey'' was one of several ships damaged by the [[typhoon]] that hit [[Admiral]] [[William Halsey, Jr.|William Halsey's]] Third Fleet on [[Typhoon Cobra (1944)|December 18–19, 1944]]. The Third Fleet lost three [[destroyer]]s and over 800 men during the typhoon. The ''Monterey'' was damaged by a fire, which was started by several of the ship's aircraft tearing loose from their cables and colliding on the hangar deck. During the storm, Ford narrowly avoided becoming a casualty himself. As he was going to his battle station on the bridge of the ship in the early morning of December 18, the ship rolled twenty-five degrees, which caused Ford to lose his footing and slide toward the edge of the deck. The two-inch steel ridge around the edge of the carrier slowed him enough so he could roll, and he twisted into the catwalk below the deck. As he later stated, &quot;I was lucky; I could have easily gone overboard.&quot;

Because of the extent of the fires, Admiral Halsey ordered Captain Ingersoll to abandon ship. Instead Captain Ingersoll ordered Ford to lead a fire brigade below. After five hours he and his team had put out the fire.

After the fire the ''Monterey'' was declared unfit for service, and the crippled carrier reached [[Ulithi]] on December 21 before continuing across the Pacific to [[Bremerton, Washington]] where it underwent repairs. On December 24, 1944, at Ulithi, Ford was detached from the ship and sent to the Navy Pre-Flight School at [[Saint Mary's College of California]], where he was assigned to the Athletic Department until April 1945. One of his duties was to coach football. From the end of April 1945 to January 1946, he was on the staff of the Naval Reserve Training Command, [[Naval Air Station Glenview|Naval Air Station, Glenview, Illinois]] as the Staff Physical and Military Training Officer. On October 3, 1945, he was promoted to Lieutenant Commander. In January 1946, he was sent to the Separation Center, [[Naval Station Great Lakes|Great Lakes]] to be processed out. He was released from active duty under honorable conditions on February 23, 1946. On June 28, 1946, the [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Secretary of the Navy]] accepted Ford's resignation from the Naval Reserve.

For his naval service, Gerald Ford earned the [[Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal]] with nine engagement stars for operations in the [[Gilbert Islands]], [[Bismarck Archipelago]], Marshall Islands, Asiatic and Pacific carrier raids, [[Battle of Hollandia|Hollandia]], Marianas, Western Carolines, Western New Guinea, and the Leyte Operation. He also received the [[Philippine Liberation Medal]] with two bronze stars for Leyte and Mindoro, as well as the [[American Campaign Medal|American Campaign]] and [[World War II Victory Medal]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;navy&quot;/&gt;

Ford was a member of several civic organizations, including the [[American Legion]], [[AMVETS]], [[Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks]], [[Sons of the Revolution]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Ford&quot;&gt;

==Marriage and children==
[[File:Fords wedding 1948.gif|thumb|alt=A man in a suit leads a flower-carrying woman by the hand, walking out of a chapel.|The Fords on their wedding day, October 15, 1948]]
On October 15, 1948, at Grace [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal Church]] in Grand Rapids, Ford married [[Betty Ford|Elizabeth Bloomer Warren]] (1918–2011), a department store fashion consultant. Warren had been a [[John Robert Powers]] fashion model and a dancer in the auxiliary troupe of the [[Martha Graham]] Dance Company. She had previously been married to and divorced from William G. Warren.

At the time of his engagement, Ford was campaigning for what would be his first of thirteen terms as a member of the United States House of Representatives. The wedding was delayed until shortly before the elections because, as ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported in a 1974 profile of Betty Ford, &quot;Jerry was running for Congress and wasn't sure how voters might feel about his marrying a divorced ex-dancer.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jane|last=Howard |title=The 38th First Lady: Not a Robot At All |work=The New York Times|date=December 8, 1974}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The couple had four children:
*[[Michael Gerald Ford|Michael Gerald]], born in 1950
*[[John Gardner Ford|John Gardner]], known as Jack, born in 1952
*[[Steven Meigs Ford|Steven Meigs]], born in 1956
*[[Susan Elizabeth Ford|Susan Elizabeth]], born in 1957

After returning to Grand Rapids, Ford became active in local Republican politics, and supporters urged him to take on [[Bartel J. Jonkman]], the incumbent Republican congressman. Military service had changed his view of the world; &quot;I came back a converted [[Internationalism (politics)|internationalist]]&quot;, Ford wrote, &quot;and of course our congressman at that time was an avowed, dedicated [[United States non-interventionism|isolationist]]. And I thought he ought to be replaced. Nobody thought I could win. I ended up winning two to one.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;kunhardt&quot;/&gt;

Ford was a member of the House of Representatives for twenty-five years, holding the Grand Rapids [[congressional district]] seat from 1949 to 1973. It was a tenure largely notable for its modesty. As an editorial in ''The New York Times'' described him, Ford &quot;saw himself as a negotiator and a reconciler, and the record shows it: he did not write a single piece of major legislation in his entire career&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt-editorial&quot;&gt;{{cite web |date=December 28, 2006 |url=http://www.pbs.org/newshour/character/essays/ford.html |title=Gerald R.

Appointed to the [[United States House Committee on Appropriations|House Appropriations Committee]] two years after being elected, he was a prominent member of the [[United States House Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense|Defense Appropriations Subcommittee]]. Ford described his philosophy as &quot;a moderate in domestic affairs, an internationalist in foreign affairs, and a conservative in fiscal policy&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/about/presidents/geraldford/|title=Gerald R.

In the early 1950s, Ford declined offers to run for both the Senate and the Michigan governorship. Rather, his ambition was to become Speaker of the House.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ford.utexas.edu/grf/fordbiop.asp |title=Gerald R.

===Warren Commission===
[[File:Lbj-wc.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Warren Commission]] presents its report to President Johnson]]

{{Further|Warren Commission|Assassination of John F. Kennedy }}
In November 1963, President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] appointed Ford to the [[Warren Commission]], a special task force set up to investigate the [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassination]] of President [[John F. Kennedy]]. Ford was assigned to prepare a biography of [[Lee Harvey Oswald]], the accused assassin.&lt;ref&gt;In 1997, the [[Assassination Records Review Board]] (ARRB) released a document that revealed that Ford had altered the first draft of the report to read: &quot;A bullet had entered the base of the back of [Kennedy's] neck slightly to the right of the spine.&quot; Some believed that Ford had elevated the location of the wound from its true location in the back to the neck to support the [[single bullet theory]]. ({{cite web |url=http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/USAfordG.htm |title=Gerald Ford |publisher=Spartacus Schoolnet |accessdate=December 29, 2006}}) The original first draft of the Warren Commission Report stated that a bullet had entered Kennedy's &quot;back at a point slightly above the shoulder and to the right of the spine&quot;. Ford replied in an introduction to a new edition of the Warren Commission Report in 2004:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I have been accused of changing some wording on the Warren Commission Report to favor the lone-assassin conclusion. That is absurd. Here is what the draft said: &quot;A bullet had entered his back at a point slightly above the shoulder and to the right of the spine.&quot; To any reasonable person, &quot;above the shoulder and to the right&quot; sounds very high and way off the side—and that's what it sounded like to me. That would have given the totally wrong impression. Technically, from a medical perspective, the bullet entered just to the right at the base of the neck, so my recommendation to the other members was to change it to say, &quot;A bullet had entered the back of his neck, slightly to the right of the spine.&quot; After further investigation, we then unanimously agreed that it should read, &quot;A bullet had entered the base of his neck slightly to the right of the spine.&quot; As with any report, there were many clarifications and language changes suggested by several of us.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Ford's description matched a [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh16/html/WH_Vol16_0501a.htm drawing] prepared for the Commission under the direction of Dr. James J. Humes, supervisor of Kennedy's autopsy, who in his [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh2/html/WC_Vol2_0178a.htm testimony to the Commission] said three times that the entrance wound was in the &quot;low neck&quot;. The Commission was not shown the autopsy photographs.&lt;/ref&gt; The Commission's work continues to be debated in the public arena.

In the preface to his book, ''A Presidential Legacy and The Warren Commission'', Ford said the [[CIA]] destroyed or kept from investigators critical secrets connected to the 1963 assassination of President John F. Kennedy. He said the commission's probe put &quot;certain classified and potentially damaging operations in danger of being exposed&quot;. The CIA's reaction, he added, &quot;was to hide or destroy some information, which can easily be misinterpreted as collusion in JFK's assassination&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last=Ford | first=Gerald R. | title=A Presidential Legacy and The Warren Commission | year=2007|publisher=The FlatSigned Press|isbn=978-1-934304-02-0 | url=http://books.google.com/?id=HOCdGQAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 1963 [[FBI]] memo released in 2008, Ford secretly provided the FBI with information about two of his fellow commission members, both of whom were doubtful about the FBI's conclusions about the assassination.&lt;ref name=&quot;WarrenJustice&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Justice for All: Earl Warren and the Nation He Made|last=Newton|first=Jim|publisher=Penguin Group|year=2007|isbn=1594482705, 9781594482700}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FBI position was that President Kennedy was shot by a single gunman firing from the Texas Book Depository. Another 1963 memo released in 1978 stated that Representative Ford volunteered to advise the FBI regarding the content of the commission's deliberations if his involvement with the bureau was kept confidential, a condition which the bureau approved.&lt;ref name=&quot;WPostFBI&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/07/AR2008080702757.html|title=Ford Told FBI of Skeptics on Warren Commission|last=Stephens|first=Joe|date=August 8, 2008|work=Washington Post|accessdate=September 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ford was an outspoken proponent of the single-assassin theory.&lt;ref name=&quot;FBI File&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2008-08-09-ford-fbi-file_N.htm|title=Ford told FBI about panel's doubts on JFK murder|work=USA Today|date=August 9, 2008|accessdate=September 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the same reports, Ford had strong ties to the FBI and [[J.

===House Minority Leader===

Mahon]], and NASA Administrator [[James E. Webb]] visit the [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] for a briefing on the Saturn program, 1964.]]
In 1964, Democratic President Lyndon Johnson led a landslide victory for his party, securing another term as president and taking 36 seats from Republicans in the House of Representatives. Following the election, members of the Republican caucus looked to select a new Minority Leader. Three members approached Ford to see if he would be willing to serve; after consulting with his family, he agreed. After a closely contested election, Ford was chosen to replace [[Charles Halleck]] of [[Indiana]] as Minority Leader.&lt;ref name=&quot;mastersDavidson&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Masters of the House: Congressional leadership over two centuries|publisher=Westview Press|year=1988|pages=267–275|author=Roger H. Davidson, Susan Webb Hammond, Raymond Smock}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Republicans had 140 seats in the House compared with the 295 seats held by the Democrats. Consequently, the Johnson Administration proposed and passed a series of programs termed by President Johnson as the &quot;[[Great Society]]&quot;. During the first session of the [[89th United States Congress|Eighty-ninth Congress]] alone, the Johnson Administration submitted eighty-seven bills to Congress, and Johnson signed eighty-four, or 96%, arguably the most successful legislative agenda in U.S. Congressional history.&lt;ref name=&quot;unger104&quot;&gt;Unger, Irwin, 1996: 'The Best of Intentions: the triumphs and failures of the Great Society under Kennedy, Johnson, and Nixon': Doubleday, p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt;

Criticism over the Johnson Administration's handling of the [[Vietnam War]] began to grow in 1966, with Ford and Congressional Republicans expressing concern that the United States was not doing what was necessary to win the war. Public sentiment also began to move against Johnson, and the [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1966|1966 midterm elections]] saw a 47-seat swing in favor of the Republicans. This was not enough to give Republicans a majority in the House, but the victory did give Ford the opportunity to prevent the passage of further Great Society programs.&lt;ref name=&quot;mastersDavidson&quot;/&gt;

Ford's private criticism of the Vietnam War became public following a speech from the floor of the House, in which he questioned whether the White House had a clear plan to bring the war to a successful conclusion.&lt;ref name=&quot;mastersDavidson&quot;/&gt; The speech angered President Johnson, who accused Ford of playing &quot;too much football without a helmet&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;mastersDavidson&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Timesteady&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Gerald Ford: Steady Hand for a Nation in Crisis|work=Time |author=Gray, Paul|date=December 27, 2006|accessdate=September 16, 2009|url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1572927,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Minority Leader in the House, Ford appeared in a popular series of televised press conferences with famed [[Illinois]] Senator [[Everett Dirksen]], in which they proposed Republican alternatives to Johnson's policies. Many in the press jokingly called this &quot;The Ev and Jerry Show&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ussenate&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Ford |first=Gerald |date=May 23, 2001 |url=http://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/generic/Leaders_Lecture_Series_Ford.htm |title=Address by President Gerald R.

Ford's role shifted under President Nixon to being an advocate for the White House agenda. Congress passed several of Nixon's proposals, including the [[National Environmental Policy Act]] and the [[Tax Reform Act of 1969]]. Another high-profile victory for the Republican minority was the State and Local Fiscal Assistance act. Passed in 1972, the act established a [[Revenue Sharing]] program for state and local governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Handbook of Social Policy|publisher=SAGE|year=2008|isbn=1-4129-5076-7|page=162|author=James Midgley, Michelle Livermore}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ford's leadership was instrumental in shepherding revenue sharing through Congress, and resulted in a bipartisan coalition that supported the bill with 223 votes in favor (compared with 185 against).&lt;ref name=&quot;mastersDavidson&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Nixon Reconsidered|author=Hoff, Joan|publisher=Basic Books|year=1995|page=69|isbn=0-465-05105-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the eight years (1965–1973) he served as Minority Leader, Ford won many friends in the House because of his fair leadership and inoffensive personality.&lt;ref name=&quot;mastersDavidson&quot;/&gt; An office building in the U.S. Capitol Complex, House Annex 2, was renamed for Gerald Ford as the [[Ford House Office Building]].

==Vice Presidency, 1973–74==
[[File:Mr. and Mrs. Ford and Nixon 13&amp;nbsp;Oct&amp;nbsp;1973.jpg|thumb|alt=Two women are flanked by two men in suits, standing in a room of the White House.|Gerald and Betty Ford with the President and First Lady [[Pat Nixon]] after President Nixon nominated Ford to be Vice President, October 13, 1973]]
On October 10, 1973, Vice President Agnew resigned and then pleaded [[Nolo contendere|no contest]] to criminal charges of tax evasion and money laundering, part of a negotiated resolution to a scheme in which he accepted $29,500 in bribes while governor of Maryland. According to ''The New York Times'', &quot;Nixon sought advice from senior Congressional leaders about a replacement. The advice was unanimous. 'We gave Nixon no choice but Ford,' [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|House Speaker]] [[Carl Albert]] recalled later&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt-editorial&quot;/&gt;

Ford was nominated to take Agnew's position on October 12, the first time the vice-presidential vacancy provision of the [[Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|25th Amendment]] had been implemented. The [[United States Senate]] voted 92 to 3 to confirm Ford on November 27. Only three Senators, all Democrats, voted against Ford's confirmation: [[Gaylord Nelson]] of [[Wisconsin]], [[Thomas Eagleton]] of [[Missouri]] and [[William Hathaway]] of [[Maine]]. On December 6, the House confirmed Ford by a vote of 387 to 35. One hour after the confirmation vote in the House, Ford took the oath of office as Vice President of the United States. Ford's brief tenure as Vice-President was little noted by the media as reporters were preoccupied by the continuing revelations about the [[Watergate scandal]]&amp;mdash;a political scandal resulting from the discovery of a series of crimes committed during the [[United States presidential election, 1972|1972 presidential election]] and allegations of cover-ups by the White House.

Following Ford's appointment, the Watergate investigation continued until [[White House Chief of Staff|Chief of Staff]] [[Alexander Haig]] contacted Ford on August 1, 1974, and told him that &quot;[[smoking gun]]&quot; evidence had been found. The evidence left little doubt that President Nixon had been a part of the Watergate cover-up. At the time, Ford and his wife, Betty, were living in suburban Virginia, waiting for their expected move into the newly-designated [[Number One Observatory Circle|vice president's residence]] in Washington, D.C. However, &quot;Al Haig [asked] to come over and see me,&quot; Ford later related, &quot;to tell me that there would be a new tape released on a Monday, and he said the evidence in there was devastating and there would probably be either an impeachment or a resignation. And he said, 'I'm just warning you that you've got to be prepared, that things might change dramatically and you could become President.' And I said, 'Betty, I don't think we're ever going to live in the vice president's house.{{'&quot;}}&lt;ref name=&quot;kunhardt&quot;/&gt;

When Nixon resigned on August 9, 1974, Ford assumed the presidency, making him the only person to assume the presidency without having been previously voted into either the presidential or vice presidential office.

The Nixon pardon was highly controversial. Critics derided the move and claimed a &quot;[[corrupt bargain]]&quot; had been struck between the men.&lt;ref name=&quot;kunhardt&quot;/&gt; They claimed Ford's pardon was granted in exchange for Nixon's resignation that elevated Ford to the Presidency. According to [[Bob Woodward]], Nixon Chief of Staff Alexander Haig proposed a pardon deal to Ford. He later decided to pardon Nixon for other reasons, primarily the friendship he and Nixon shared.&lt;ref name=&quot;shanescott&quot;&gt;{{cite news|first=Scott |last=Shane |title=For Ford, Pardon Decision Was Always Clear-Cut|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/29/washington/29pardon.html|work=The New York Times|page=A1 |accessdate=September 8, 2009 | date=December 29, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless, historians believe the controversy was one of the major reasons Ford lost the [[United States presidential election, 1976|election in 1976]], an observation with which Ford agreed.&lt;ref name=&quot;shanescott&quot;/&gt; In an editorial at the time, ''The New York Times'' stated that the Nixon pardon was &quot;a profoundly unwise, divisive and unjust act&quot; that in a stroke had destroyed the new president's &quot;credibility as a man of judgment, candor and competence&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt-editorial&quot;/&gt;

Ford's first press secretary and close friend [[Jerald terHorst|Jerald Franklin terHorst]] resigned his post in protest after President Nixon's full pardon. Ford also voluntarily appeared before Congress on October 17, 1974 to give sworn testimony—the only time a sitting president has done so—about the pardon.&lt;ref name=&quot;utexas-grf-timeline&quot;/&gt;

After Ford left the White House in 1977, intimates said that the former President privately justified his pardon of Nixon by carrying in his wallet a portion of the text of ''[[Burdick v. United States]]'', a 1915 [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] decision which stated that a pardon indicated a presumption of guilt, and that acceptance of a pardon was tantamount to a confession of that guilt.&lt;ref name=&quot;shanescott&quot;/&gt; In 2001, the [[John F.

===Presidential Proclamation 4313===
On September 16, 1974 President Ford announced a program for the Return of Vietnam Era Draft Evaders and Military Deserters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=4714#axzz1jJbv1H6i Presidential Proclamation 4313]&lt;/ref&gt; This proved to be controversial, as it provided a means for those who were against the Vietnam War to erase any remaining criminal charges and for those who were given punitive discharges as a result of being against the war to have them converted to Clemency Discharges. The Proclamation established a Clemency Board to review the records and make recommendations for receiving a Presidential Pardon and a change in [[Military discharge]] status.

===Midterm elections===
{{Main|United States House elections, 1974|United States Senate elections, 1974}}
The 1974 Congressional midterm elections took place fewer than three months after Ford assumed office and in the wake of the Watergate scandal. The Democratic Party turned voter dissatisfaction into large gains in the [[United States House elections, 1974|House elections]], taking 49 seats from the Republican Party, and increasing their majority to 291 of the 435 seats. This was one more than the number needed (290) for a two-thirds majority, necessary to override a Presidential veto (or to propose a constitutional amendment). Perhaps due in part to this fact, the [[94th United States Congress|94th Congress]] overrode the highest percentage of vetoes since [[Andrew Johnson]] was President of the United States (1865–1869).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/POLITICS/blogs/politicalticker/2007/05/bush-vetoes-less-than-most-presidents.html Bush vetoes less than most presidents], CNN, May 1, 2007.

====Budget====
The federal budget ran a [[Government budget deficit|deficit]] every year Ford was President.&lt;ref name=&quot;crs&quot;&gt;[http://assets.opencrs.com/rpts/RL33305_20060309.pdf CRS Report RL33305, The Crude Oil Windfall Profit Tax of the 1980s: Implications for Current Energy Policy], by Salvatore Lazzari, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his reservations about how the program ultimately would be funded in an era of tight [[public budgeting]], Ford signed the [[Education for All Handicapped Children Act]] of 1975, which established [[special education]] throughout the United States. Ford expressed &quot;strong support for full educational opportunities for our handicapped children&quot; according to the official White House press release for the bill signing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ford.utexas.edu/library/speeches/750707.htm &quot;President Gerald R.

The economic focus began to change as the country sank into a mild [[recession]]. The focus of the Ford administration became fixing the increase in unemployment, which hit 7.2 percent in December 1974. In January 1975, Ford proposed a 1 year tax reduction of $16&amp;nbsp;billion to stimulate economic growth, along with spending cuts to avoid inflation.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;/&gt; Ford was criticized greatly for quickly switching from advocating a tax increase to a tax reduction. In Congress, the proposed amount of the tax reduction increased to $22.8&amp;nbsp;billion in tax cuts and lacked spending cuts.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; In March 1975, Congress passed, and Ford signed into law, these [[income tax]] rebates as part of the [[Tax Reduction Act of 1975]]. This resulted in a federal deficit of around $53&amp;nbsp;billion for the 1975 fiscal year and $73.7&amp;nbsp;billion for 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/Historicals |title=Office of Management and Budget. &quot;Historical Table 1.1&quot; |publisher=Whitehouse.gov |accessdate=January 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When New York City faced bankruptcy in 1975, [[List of mayors of New York City|Mayor]] [[Abraham Beame]] was unsuccessful in obtaining Ford's support for a federal bailout.

====Middle East====

The United States is indicated in Red, while countries visit by President Ford during his presidency are indicated in Orange. Other countries are indicated in grey.|Countries visited by Ford during his presidency]]
In the Middle East and eastern Mediterranean, two ongoing international disputes developed into crises. The [[Cyprus dispute#Peacemaking efforts, 1964–1974|Cyprus dispute]] turned into a crisis with the [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus]], causing extreme strain within the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO) alliance. In mid-August, the [[Greek military junta of 1967–1974|government]] withdrew Greece from the NATO military structure; in mid-September 1974, the Senate and House of Representatives overwhelmingly voted to halt military aid to Turkey. Ford, concerned with both the effect of this on Turkish-American relations and the deterioration of security on NATO's eastern front, vetoed the bill. A second bill was passed by the house, and vetoed, although a compromise was accepted to continue aid until the end of the year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lenczowski&quot;/&gt; As Ford expected, Turkish relations were [[United States-Turkey relations#Invasion of Cyprus|considerably disrupted until 1978]].

In the continuing [[Arab-Israeli conflict]], although the initial [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 338|cease fire]] had been implemented to end active conflict in the [[Yom Kippur War]], Kissinger's continuing [[shuttle diplomacy]] was showing little progress. Ford considered it &quot;stalling&quot; and wrote, &quot;Their [Israeli] tactics frustrated the Egyptians and made me mad as hell.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Ford, A Time to Heal, 1979, p.240&lt;/ref&gt; During Kissinger's shuttle to Israel in early March 1975, a last minute reversal to consider further withdrawal, prompted a cable from Ford to Prime Minister [[Yitzhak Rabin]], which included:
{{Quote|I wish to express my profound disappointment over Israel's attitude in the course of the negotiations ... Failure of the negotiation will have a far reaching impact on the region and on our relations. I have given instructions for a reassessment of United States policy in the region, including our relations with Israel, with the aim of ensuring that overall American interests ... are protected. You will be notified of our decision.&lt;ref&gt;Rabin, Yitzak (1996), ''The Rabin Memoirs'', University of California Press, p. 256, ISBN 978-0-520-20766-0&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On March 24, Ford received congressional leaders of both parties and informed them of the reassessment of the administration policies in the Middle East. &quot;Reassessment&quot;, in practical terms, meant to cancel or suspend further aid to Israel. For six months between March and September 1975, the United States refused to conclude any new arms agreements with Israel. Rabin notes it was &quot;an innocent-sounding term that heralded one of the worst periods in American-Israeli relations&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Yitzak Rabin, The Rabin Memoirs, ISBN 0-520-20766-1 , p261&lt;/ref&gt; As could be expected, the announced reassessments upset the American Jewish community and Israel's well-wishers in Congress. On May 21, Ford &quot;experienced a real shock&quot;, seventy-six senators wrote him a letter urging him to be &quot;responsive&quot; to Israel's request for $2.59&amp;nbsp;billion in military and economic aid. Ford felt truly annoyed and thought the chance for peace was jeopardized. It was, since the September 1974 ban on arms to Turkey, the second major congressional intrusion upon the President's [foreign policy] prerogatives.&lt;ref&gt;[[George Lenczowski]], American Presidents, and the Middle East, 1990, p.150&lt;/ref&gt; The following summer months were described by Ford as an American-Israeli &quot;war of nerves&quot; or &quot;test of wills&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Ford, A Time to Heal, 1979, p.298&lt;/ref&gt; and after much bargaining, the [[Sinai Interim Agreement]] (Sinai II), was formally signed on September 1 and aid resumed.

====Vietnam====
One of Ford's greatest challenges was dealing with the continued Vietnam War. American offensive operations against North Vietnam had ended with the [[Paris Peace Accords]], signed on January 27, 1973. The accords declared a cease fire across both North and South Vietnam, and required the release of American [[POW|prisoners of war]]. The agreement guaranteed the territorial integrity of Vietnam and, like the [[Geneva Conference (1954)|Geneva Conference]] of 1954, called for national elections in the North and South. The Paris Peace Accords stipulated a sixty-day period for the total withdrawal of U.S. forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Peter Church|title=A Short History of South-East Asia.|country=Singapore|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2006|pages=193–194}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The accords had been negotiated by [[United States National Security Advisor]] Kissinger and North Vietnamese [[politburo]] member [[Le Duc Tho]]. South Vietnamese President [[Nguyen Van Thieu]] was not involved in the final negotiations, and publicly criticized the proposed agreement. However, anti-war pressures within the United States forced Nixon and Kissinger to pressure Thieu to sign the agreement and enable the withdrawal of American forces. In multiple letters to the South Vietnamese president, Nixon had promised that the United States would defend his government, should the North Vietnamese violate the accords.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brinkley1&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Brinkley, Douglas |year=2007 |title=Gerald R. Ford|isbn=0-8050-6909-7 |publisher=Times Books |location=New York, NY|pages=89–98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1974, months after Ford took office, North Vietnamese forces invaded the province of [[Phuoc Long Province|Phuoc Long]]. General [[Trần Văn Trà]] sought to gauge any South Vietnamese or American response to the invasion, as well as to solve logistical issues before proceeding with the invasion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kurnow&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Karnow, Stanley|title=Vietnam: A History|publisher=Viking|year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As North Vietnamese forces advanced, Ford requested aid for South Vietnam in a $522&amp;nbsp;million aid package. The funds had been promised by the Nixon administration, but Congress voted against the proposal by a wide margin.&lt;ref name=&quot;Challenges1970&quot;/&gt; Senator [[Jacob Javits]] offered &quot;...large sums for evacuation, but not one nickel for military aid&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Challenges1970&quot;/&gt; President Thieu resigned on April 21, 1975, publicly blaming the lack of support from the United States for the fall of his country.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/april/21/newsid_2935000/2935347.stm|title=Vietnam's President Thieu resigns|date=April 21, 1975|accessdate=September 24, 2009|publisher=BBC News }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later, on April 23, Ford gave a speech at [[Tulane University]]. In that speech, he announced that the Vietnam War was over &quot;...as far as America is concerned&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brinkley1&quot;/&gt; The announcement was met with thunderous applause.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brinkley1&quot;/&gt;

1,373 U.S. citizens and 5,595 [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] and third country nationals were evacuated from the South Vietnamese capital of [[Saigon]] during [[Operation Frequent Wind]]. Military and [[Air America (airline)|Air America]] helicopters took evacuees to [[U.S. Navy]] ships off-shore during an approximately 24-hour period on April 29 to 30, 1975, immediately preceding the [[fall of Saigon]]. During the operation, so many South Vietnamese helicopters landed on the vessels taking the evacuees that some were pushed overboard to make room for more people. Other helicopters, having nowhere to land, were deliberately crash landed into the sea, close to the ships, their pilots bailing out at the last moment to be picked up by rescue boats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Vietnam War: An Almanac| last=Bowman| first=John S.| publisher=Pharos Books| year=1985| isbn=0-911818-85-5|page=434}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the Vietnamese evacuees were allowed to enter the United States under the [[Indochina Migration and Refugee Assistance Act]]. The 1975 Act appropriated $455&amp;nbsp;million toward the costs of assisting the settlement of Indochinese refugees.&lt;ref&gt;Plummer Alston Jones (2004). &quot;''[http://books.google.com/books?id=bmSKvXN2a1IC&amp;pg=PA84&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Still struggling for equality: American public library services with minorities]''&quot;.

====Mayaguez and Panmunjom====
North Vietnam's victory over the South led to a considerable shift in the political winds in Asia, and Ford administration officials worried about a consequent loss of U.S. influence there. The administration proved it was willing to respond forcefully to challenges to its interests in the region on two occasions, once when [[Khmer Rouge]] forces seized an American ship in [[international waters]] and again when American military officers were killed in the demilitarized zone (DMZ) between North and South Korea.&lt;ref&gt;Gawthorpe, A. J. (2009), &quot;The Ford Administration and Security Policy in the Asia-Pacific after the Fall of Saigon&quot;, ''The Historical Journal'', '''52'''(3):697–716.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first crisis was the [[Mayaguez Incident]]. In May 1975, shortly after the fall of Saigon and the Khmer Rouge conquest of [[Cambodia]], Cambodians seized the American merchant ship ''Mayaguez'' in international waters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document |date=May 19, 1975|url=http://www.ford.utexas.edu/library/exhibits/vietnam/750519a.htm|title=Debrief of the Mayaguez Captain and Crew|publisher=Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library|accessdate=November 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ford dispatched [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]] to rescue the crew, but the Marines landed on the wrong island and met unexpectedly stiff resistance just as, unknown to the U.S., the ''Mayaguez'' sailors were being released. In the operation, two military transport helicopters carrying the Marines for the assault operation were shot down, and 41 U.S. servicemen were killed and 50 wounded while approximately 60 Khmer Rouge soldiers were killed.&lt;ref name=&quot;marinemerchants&quot;&gt;{{cite web |year=2000 |url=http://www.usmm.org/mayaguez.html |title=Capture and Release of SS Mayaguez by Khmer Rouge forces in May 1975 |publisher=United States Merchant Marine |accessdate=December 31, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the American losses, the operation was seen as a success in the United States and Ford enjoyed an 11-point boost in his approval ratings in the aftermath.&lt;ref&gt;Gerald R. Ford, ''A Time to Heal'', p. 284&lt;/ref&gt; The Americans killed during the operation became the last to have their names inscribed on the [[Vietnam Veterans Memorial]] wall in Washington, D.C.

Some historians have argued that the Ford administration felt the need to respond forcefully to the incident because it was construed as a Soviet plot.&lt;ref&gt;Cécile Menétray-Monchau (August 2005), &quot;The Mayaguez Incident as an Epilogue to the Vietnam War and its Reflection on the Post-Vietnam Political Equilibrium in Southeast Asia&quot;, ''Cold War History'', p. 346.&lt;/ref&gt; But recent work by Andrew Gawthorpe, based on an analysis of the administration's internal discussions, shows that Ford's national security team understood that the seizure of the vessel was a local, and perhaps even accidental, provocation by an immature Khmer government. Nevertheless, they felt the need to respond forcefully to discourage further provocations by other Communist countries in Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Gawthorpe, &quot;The Ford Administration and Security Policy&quot;, pp. 707–709.&lt;/ref&gt;

The second crisis, known as the [[axe murder incident]], occurred at [[Panmunjom]], a village which stands in the DMZ between the two Koreas. At the time, this was the only part of the DMZ where forces from the North and the South came into contact with each other. Encouraged by U.S. difficulties in Vietnam, North Korea had been waging a campaign of diplomatic pressure and minor military harassment to try and convince the U.S. to withdraw from South Korea.&lt;ref&gt;Oberdorfer, Don (2001), ''The two Koreas: a contemporary history'' (New York, NY: Basic Books), pp. 47–83.&lt;/ref&gt; Then, in August 1976, North Korean forces killed two U.S. officers and injured South Korean guards who were engaged in trimming a tree in Panmunjom's [[Joint Security Area]]. The attack coincided with a meeting of the Conference of [[Non-Aligned Nations]] in [[Colombo]], Sri Lanka, at which [[Kim Jong-il]], the son of North Korean leader [[Kim Il-sung]], presented the incident as an example of American aggression, helping secure the passage of a motion calling for a U.S. withdrawal from the South.&lt;ref&gt;Gawthorpe, &quot;The Ford Administration and Security Policy&quot;, p. 711.&lt;/ref&gt;

At administration meetings, Kissinger voiced the concern that the North would see the U.S. as &quot;the paper tigers of Saigon&quot; if they did not respond, and Ford agreed with that assessment. After mulling various options the Ford administration decided that it was necessary to respond with a major [[show of force]]. A large number of ground forces went to cut down the tree, while at the same time the air force was deployed, which included [[B-52 bomber]] flights over Panmunjom. The North Korean government backed down and allowed the tree-cutting to go ahead, and later issued an unprecedented official apology.&lt;ref&gt;Gawthorpe, &quot;The Ford Administration and Security Policy&quot;, pp. 710–714.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assassination attempts===
[[File:AV89-26-14 600d.jpg|thumb|alt=A chaotic scene of motorcade vehicles surrounded by crowd of people including police and press|Reaction immediately after the second assassination attempt]]
Ford faced two assassination attempts during his presidency, occurring within three weeks of each other and in the same state; while in [[Sacramento, California]], on September 5, 1975, [[Lynette Fromme|Lynette &quot;Squeaky&quot; Fromme]], a follower of [[Charles Manson]], pointed a [[M1911 Colt pistol|Colt .45-caliber handgun]] at Ford.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Audio/Year_in_Review/Events-of-1975/Ford-Assasinations-Attempts/12305821478075-12/ |title=1975 Year in Review: Ford Assassinations Attempts |publisher=Upi.com |accessdate=May 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Fromme pulled the trigger, [[Larry Buendorf]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2004/10/1026_041026_tv_secret_service2_2.html &quot;Election Is Crunch Time for U.S. Secret Service&quot;].

It was later found that, although the [[semi-automatic pistol]] had four cartridges in the magazine, the weapon had not been chambered, making it impossible for the gun to fire. Fromme was taken into custody; she was later convicted of attempted assassination of the President and was sentenced to life in prison; she was paroled on August 14, 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;squeakeyparole&quot;&gt;{{cite news|date=August 14, 2009|url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/2009-08-14/news/17930594_1_sharon-tate-and-eight-lynette-squeaky-fromme-charles-manson-follower|title=Charles Manson follower Lynette 'Squeaky' Fromme released from prison after more than 30 years|location=New York |work=Daily News|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=September 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In reaction to this attempt, the Secret Service began keeping Ford at a more secure distance from anonymous crowds, a strategy that may have saved his life seventeen days later; as he left the [[St. Francis Hotel]] in downtown San Francisco, [[Sara Jane Moore]], standing in a crowd of onlookers across the street, pointed her [[.38 Special|.38-caliber revolver]] at him.&lt;ref name=&quot;Secret Service&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fas.org/irp/agency/ustreas/usss/t1pubrpt.html |title=Public Report of the White House Security Review |author=United States Secret Service |accessdate=January 3, 2007|publisher=United States Department of the Treasury}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just before she fired, former Marine [[Oliver Sipple]] grabbed at the gun and deflected her shot; the bullet struck a wall about six inches above and to the right of Ford's head, then ricocheted and hit a taxi driver, who was slightly wounded.

She was paroled on December 31, 2007, having served 32 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;ABC7-Lee&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abclocal.go.com/kgo/story?section=local&amp;id=4900159|title=Interview: Woman Who Tried To Assassinate Ford|accessdate=January 3, 2007|last=Lee|first=Vic|date=January 2, 2007|publisher=KGO-TV|location=San Francisco}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judicial appointments===

Ford reluctantly agreed to run for office in 1976, but first he had to counter a challenge for the Republican party nomination. Former [[Governor of California]] Ronald Reagan and the party's [[American conservatism|conservative]] wing faulted Ford for failing to do more in [[South Vietnam]], for signing the Helsinki Accords and for negotiating to cede the [[Panama Canal]] (negotiations for the canal continued under President Carter, who eventually signed the [[Torrijos-Carter Treaties]]). Reagan launched his campaign in autumn of 1975 and won several [[United States presidential primary|primaries]] before withdrawing from the race at the [[1976 Republican National Convention|Republican Convention]] in [[Kansas City, Missouri]]. The conservative insurgency convinced Ford to drop the more [[American liberalism|liberal]] Vice President Nelson Rockefeller in favor of [[Kansas]] Senator [[Bob Dole]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1996/analysis/back.time/9603/29/index.shtml Another Loss For the Gipper].

In addition to the pardon dispute and lingering anti-Republican sentiment, Ford had to counter a plethora of negative media imagery. [[Chevy Chase]] often did [[pratfall]]s on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', imitating Ford, who had been seen stumbling on two occasions during his term. As Chase commented, &quot;He even mentioned in his own autobiography it had an effect over a period of time that affected the election to some degree.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&amp;STORY=/www/story/10-19-2004/0002287784&amp;EDATE= VH1 News Presents: Politics: A Pop Culture History Premiering Wednesday, October 20 at 10:00&amp;nbsp;pm (ET/PT)].

The 200th anniversary of the [[Battles of Lexington and Concord]] in Massachusetts gave Ford the opportunity to deliver a speech to 110,000 in Concord acknowledging the need for a strong national defense tempered with a plea for &quot;reconciliation, not recrimination&quot; and &quot;reconstruction, not rancor&quot; between the United States and those who would pose &quot;threats to peace&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Shabecoff, Philip. &quot;160,000 Mark Two 1775 Battles; Concord Protesters Jeer Ford – Reconciliation Plea&quot;, ''The New York Times'', April 20, 1975, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking in New Hampshire on the previous day, Ford condemned the growing trend toward big government bureaucracy and argued for a return to &quot;basic American virtues&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Shabecoff, Philip. &quot;Ford, on Bicentennial Trip, Bids U.S. Heed Old Values&quot;, ''The New York Times'', April 19, 1975, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Democratic nominee and former [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] [[List of Governors of Georgia|governor]] Jimmy Carter campaigned as an outsider and reformer, gaining support from voters dismayed by the Watergate scandal and Nixon pardon. After the Democratic National Convention, he held a huge 33-point lead over Ford in the polls. However, as the campaign continued, the race tightened, and, by election day, the polls showed the race as too close to call. There were three main events in the fall campaign. Most importantly, Carter repeated a promise of a &quot;blanket pardon&quot; for Christian and other religious refugees, and also all Vietnam War draft dodgers (Ford had only issued a conditional amnesty) in response to a question on the subject posed by a reporter during the presidential debates, an act which froze Ford's poll numbers in Ohio, Wisconsin, Hawaii, and Mississippi. (Ford had needed only to shift 11,000 votes in two of those four states in order to win.) Americans viewed the pardon as an essential moral act and as the true end to a bitterly hated war. It was the first act signed by Carter, on January 20, 1977. Earlier, ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine had published a controversial interview with Carter; in the interview Carter admitted to having &quot;lusted in my heart&quot; for women other than his wife, which cut into his support among women and evangelical Christians. Also, on September 24, Ford performed well in what was the first televised [[U.S. presidential election debates|presidential debate]] since [[United States presidential election, 1960|1960]]. Polls taken after the debate showed that most viewers felt that Ford was the winner. Carter was also hurt by Ford's charges that he lacked the necessary experience to be an effective national leader, and that Carter was vague on many issues.

[[United States presidential election debates|Presidential debates]] were reintroduced for the first time since the 1960 election. Carter later attributed his victory in the election to the debates, saying they &quot;gave the viewers reason to think that Jimmy Carter had something to offer&quot;. The turning point came in the second debate when Ford blundered by stating, &quot;There is no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe and there never will be under a Ford Administration.&quot; Ford also said that he did not &quot;believe that the Poles consider themselves dominated by the Soviet Union&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-cgi.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1996/debates/history/1976/|title=1976 Presidential Debates|publisher=CNN|accessdate=September 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview years later, Ford said he had intended to imply that the Soviets would never crush the ''spirits'' of eastern Europeans seeking independence. However, the phrasing was so awkward that questioner [[Max Frankel]] was visibly incredulous at the response.&lt;ref name=&quot;pbs2000&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Lehrer|first=Jim|year=2000 |url=http://www.pbs.org/newshour/debatingourdestiny/dod/1976-broadcast.html |title=1976:No Audio and No Soviet Domination |work=Debating Our Destiny|publisher=PBS|accessdate=March 31, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this blunder, and Carter's promise of a full presidential pardon for political refugees from the Vietnam era during the presidential debates, Ford's surge stalled and Carter was able to maintain a slight lead in the polls.

In the end, Carter won the election, receiving 50.1% of the popular vote and 297 [[United States Electoral College|electoral votes]] compared with 48.0% and 240 electoral votes for Ford. The election was close enough that had fewer than 25,000 votes shifted in [[Ohio]] and [[Wisconsin]] – both of which neighbored his home state – Ford would have won the electoral vote with 276 votes to 261 for Carter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.multied.com/elections/1976state.html &quot;Presidential Election 1976 States Carried&quot;]. multied.com. Retrieved on December 31, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Though he lost, in the three months between the Republican National Convention and the election Ford managed to close what was once a 34-point Carter lead to a 2-point margin.

Had Ford won the election, the provisions of the [[Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution|22nd Amendment]] would have disqualified him from running in [[United States presidential election, 1980|1980]], because he had served more than two years of Nixon's remaining term.

==Post-presidential years, 1977–2006==
===Activity===
The Nixon pardon controversy eventually subsided. Ford's successor, Jimmy Carter, opened his 1977 [[United States presidential inauguration|inaugural address]] by praising the outgoing President, saying, &quot;For myself and for our Nation, I want to thank my predecessor for all he has done to heal our land.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;JC&quot;&gt;{{cite web |date=January 20, 1977|url=http://www.bartleby.com/124/pres60.html|title=Jimmy Carter |work=U.S. Inaugural Addresses|publisher=Bartleby.com|accessdate=August 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ford remained relatively active in the years after his presidency and continued to make appearances at events of historical and ceremonial significance to the nation, such as presidential inaugurals and memorial services. In January 1977, he became the president of [[Eisenhower Fellowships]] in [[Philadelphia]] then served as its chairman of the board of trustees from 1980 to 1986.&lt;ref&gt;Perrone, Marguerite. &quot;Eisenhower Fellowship: A History 1953–2003&quot;. 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the year, he reluctantly agreed to be interviewed by James M. Naughton, a ''New York Times'' journalist who was given the assignment to write the former President's advance obituary, an article that would be updated prior to its eventual publication.&lt;ref name=&quot;poynterX&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Naughton |first=James M |date=December 27, 2006 |url=http://www.poynter.org/content/content_view.asp?id=115796|title=The Real Jerry Ford |publisher=PoynterOnline |accessdate=March 31, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979, Ford published his autobiography, ''A Time to Heal'' (Harper/Reader's Digest, 454 pages). A review in ''Foreign Affairs'' described it as, &quot;Serene, unruffled, unpretentious, like the author. This is the shortest and most honest of recent presidential memoirs, but there are no surprises, no deep probings of motives or events. No more here than meets the eye.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Gaddis|title=A Time to Heal|work=[[Foreign Affairs]]|publisher=Council on Foreign Relations|year=1979|url=http://www.foreignaffairs.org/19790901fabook14015/gerald-r-ford/a-time-to-heal.html|accessdate=April 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to his autobiography, in 1987 Ford wrote ''Humor and the Presidency'', a book of humorous political anecdotes.

During the term of office of his successor, Jimmy Carter, Ford received monthly briefs by President Carter's senior staff on international and domestic issues, and was always invited to lunch at the White House whenever he was in Washington, D.C. Their close friendship developed after Carter had left office, with the catalyst being their trip together to the funeral of [[Anwar el-Sadat]] in 1981.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTobit&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Kornblut |first=Anne |date=December 29, 2006 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/29/washington/29funeral.html?ex=1325048400&amp;en=44d6cd10bbdba342&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss |title=Ford Arranged His Funeral to Reflect Himself and Drew in a Former Adversary |work=The New York Times |accessdate=April 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until Ford's death, Carter and his wife, [[Rosalynn Carter|Rosalynn]], visited the Fords' home frequently.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last = Updegrove|first = Mark K.|title = Flying Coach to Cairo|magazine = American Heritage|volume = 57|issue = 4|date = August/September 2006|url = http://www.americanheritage.com/content/%E2%80%9Cflying-coach-cairo%E2%80%9D|accessdate = September 28, 2011|quote=&quot;Certainly few observers in January 1977 would have predicted that Jimmy and I would become the closest of friends,&quot; Ford said in 2000.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ford and Carter served as honorary co-chairs of the [[National Commission on Federal Election Reform]] in 2001 and of the [[Continuity of Government Commission]] in 2002.

Like Presidents Carter, George H.W. Bush, and [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]], Ford was an honorary co-chair of the [[Council for Excellence in Government]], a group dedicated to excellence in government performance, which provides leadership training to top federal employees.

Ford considered a run for the Republican nomination in [[United States presidential election, 1980|1980]], foregoing numerous opportunities to serve on corporate boards to keep his options open for a grudge match with Carter. Ford attacked Carter's conduct of the SALT II negotiations and foreign policy in the Middle East and Africa. Many have argued that Ford also wanted to exorcise his image as an &quot;Accidental President&quot; and to win a term in his own right. Ford also believed the more conservative Ronald Reagan would be unable to defeat Carter and would hand the incumbent a second term. Ford was encouraged by his former Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger as well as [[Jim Rhodes]] of Ohio and [[Bill Clements]] of Texas to make the race. On March 15, 1980, Ford announced that he would forgo a run for the Republican nomination, vowing to support the eventual nominee.

After securing the Republican nomination in 1980, Ronald Reagan considered his former rival Ford as a potential vice-presidential running mate, but negotiations between the Reagan and Ford camps at the [[1980 Republican National Convention|Republican National Convention]] were unsuccessful. Ford conditioned his acceptance on Reagan's agreement to an unprecedented &quot;co-presidency&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;meeteye&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Thomas|first=Evan |year=2007 |url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/56688 |title=The 38th President: More Than Met the Eye|work=Newsweek |accessdate=January 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; giving Ford the power to control key executive branch appointments (such as Kissinger as Secretary of State and [[Alan Greenspan]] as Treasury Secretary). After rejecting these terms, Reagan offered the vice-presidential nomination instead to George H.W. Bush.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, Richard V.

After his presidency, Ford joined the [[American Enterprise Institute]] as a distinguished fellow. He founded the annual [[AEI World Forum]] in 1982. Ford was awarded an [[Commencement at CCSU|honorary doctorate at Central Connecticut State University]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.zwire.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=15404901&amp;BRD=1641&amp;PAG=461&amp;dept_id=17739&amp;rfi=6|title=A $3m gift |last=Whipple|first=Scott|date=October 18, 2005|work=The New Britain Herald|accessdate=September 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; on March 23, 1988.

After leaving the White House, Ford and his wife moved to Denver, Colorado.

In a pre-recorded [[news embargo|embargoed interview]] with [[Bob Woodward]] of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' in July 2004, Ford stated that he disagreed &quot;very strongly&quot; with the Bush administration's choice of Iraq's alleged weapons of mass destruction as justification for its decision to [[Iraq War|invade Iraq]], calling it a &quot;big mistake&quot; unrelated to the national security of the United States and indicating that he would not have gone to war had he been President.

It was unveiled on May 3, 2011 in the Capitol Rotunda. On the proper right side is inscribed a quotation from a tribute by Thomas P. &quot;Tip&quot; O'Neill, Speaker of the House during Ford’s presidency: &quot;God has been good to America, especially during difficult times. At the time of the Civil War, he gave us Abraham Lincoln. And at the time of Watergate, he gave us Gerald Ford—the right man at the right time who was able to put our nation back together again.&quot; On the proper left side are words from Ford's swearing-in address: &quot;Our constitution works. Our great republic is a government of laws and not of men. Here the people rule.&quot;

===Longevity===
Ford was the [[List of United States Presidents by age|longest-lived U.S. President]], his lifespan being 45 days longer than Ronald Reagan's. He was the [[List of United States Vice Presidents by longevity|third-longest-lived Vice President]], falling short only of [[John Nance Garner]], 98, and [[Levi P. Morton]], 96. Ford had the third-longest post-presidency (29 years and 11 months) after [[Herbert Hoover]] (31 years and 7 months) and [[Jimmy Carter]] ({{age in years and months|1981|1|20}} and counting)

On November 12, 2006, upon surpassing Ronald Reagan's lifespan, Ford released his last public statement:
{{Quote|The length of one's days matters less than the love of one's family and friends. I thank God for the gift of every sunrise and, even more, for all the years He has blessed me with Betty and the children; with our extended family and the friends of a lifetime.

The trust the American people had in him was severely and rapidly tarnished by his pardon of Nixon.&lt;ref name=publicimage&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/presidents/gerald-r-ford-1451818.html|title=Gerald R Ford|accessdate=December 2, 2009|work=The Independent | location=London | date=January 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, many grant in hindsight that he had respectably discharged with considerable dignity a great responsibility that he had not sought.&lt;ref name=publicimage/&gt; His subsequent loss to Carter in 1976 has come to be seen as an honorable sacrifice he made for the nation.&lt;ref name=sacrifice/&gt;

In spite of his athletic record and remarkable career accomplishments, Ford acquired a reputation as a clumsy, likable and simple-minded Everyman. An incident in 1975 when he tripped while exiting the presidential jet in Austria, was famously and repetitively parodied by [[Chevy Chase]], cementing Ford's image as a klutz.&lt;ref name=publicimage/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pieces of Ford's common Everyman image have also been attributed to Ford's inevitable comparison to Nixon, as well as his perceived Midwestern stodginess and self-deprecation.&lt;ref name=sacrifice/&gt; Ridicule often extended to supposed intellectual limitations, with Lyndon Johnson once joking, &quot;He's a nice fellow but he spent too much time playing football without a helmet.&quot;&lt;ref name=publicimage/&gt;
