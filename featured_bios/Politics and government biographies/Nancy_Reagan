'''Nancy Davis Reagan''' (born '''Anne Frances Robbins'''; July 6, 1921) is the widow of former [[President of the United States|United States President]] [[Ronald Reagan]] and was [[First Lady of the United States]] from 1981 to 1989.

Nancy was born in New York City; her parents divorced soon after her birth and she grew up in Maryland, living with an aunt and uncle while her mother pursued acting jobs. As '''Nancy Davis''', she was an actress in Hollywood in the 1940s and 1950s, starring in films such as ''[[Donovan's Brain (film)|Donovan's Brain]]'', ''Night into Morning'', and ''[[Hellcats of the Navy]]''. In 1952 she married Ronald Reagan, who was then president of the [[Screen Actors Guild]], and they had two children. Nancy was the First Lady of California when her husband was [[Governor of California|Governor]] from 1967 to 1975. In that capacity, she began work with the [[Foster Grandparents Program]].

Nancy Reagan became First Lady of the United States in January 1981 following her [[United States presidential election, 1980|husband's election]]. She was criticized early in his first term largely due to her decision to replace the [[White House china]], despite it being paid for by private donations. Nancy restored a [[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy]]-esque glamor to the White House following years of lax formality, and her interest in high-end fashion garnered much attention, as well as criticism. She championed [[recreational drug use|recreational drug prevention]] causes by founding the &quot;[[Just Say No]]&quot; drug awareness campaign, which was considered her major initiative as first lady. Always protective of her husband, more controversy ensued when it was revealed in 1988 that she had consulted an [[astrologer]] to assist in planning the president's schedule after the [[Reagan assassination attempt|1981 assassination attempt]] on her husband. She had a strong influence on her husband and played a role in a few of his personnel and diplomatic decisions.

The Reagans retired to their home in [[Bel Air, Los Angeles, California|Bel Air]], Los Angeles, California in 1989. Nancy devoted most of her time to caring for her ailing husband, diagnosed in 1994 with [[Alzheimer's disease]], until [[Death and state funeral of Ronald Reagan|his death in 2004]]. Nancy Reagan has remained active within the [[Ronald Reagan Presidential Library|Reagan Library]] and in politics, particularly in support of [[Stem cell controversy|stem-cell research]].

== Early life ==
Anne Frances Robbins was born on July 6, 1921,&lt;ref name=&quot;Nancy Reagan: Her Life &amp; Times&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;When Nancy Davis signed with MGM, she gave her birth date as July 6, 1923, shaving two years off her age, a common practice in Hollywood (see Cannon, ''Governor Reagan'', p. 75). This caused subsequent confusion as some sources would continue to use the incorrect birth year.&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Manhattan]]'s [[Sloane Hospital for Women]] in New York,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Powling |first=Anne |coauthors=John O'Connor, Geoff Barton |title=New Oxford English |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=1997 |isbn=0198311923 |page=79 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Some sources and websites erroneously list her as either being born in Flushing or being raised in Manhattan.&lt;/ref&gt; as the only child of car salesman Kenneth Seymour Robbins (1894–1972)&lt;ref&gt;Reagan, Nancy (1989), p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; and his actress wife, [[Edith Luckett Davis|Edith Luckett]] (1888–1987).&lt;ref name=&quot;Luckett-IMDB&quot;&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0524717/ Edith Luckett] at [[Internet Movie Database]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;IBDB Luckett&quot;&gt;[http://www.ibdb.com/person.php?id=50307 Edith Luckett] at [[Internet Broadway Database]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;First Lady Nancy Reagan&quot;/&gt; Her godmother was silent-film-star [[Alla Nazimova]].&lt;ref&gt;Wills (1987), p. 182&lt;/ref&gt; She lived her first two years in [[Flushing, Queens]], in New York.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt041291&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE7DE123CF931A25757C0A967958260 |title= Talk and More Talk About Nancy (That One!) in Flushing |author=Gonzalez, David |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=1991-04-12 |accessdate=2007-10-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While her parents divorced soon after her birth, they had already been separated for some time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reagan&quot;&gt;Reagan, Nancy (1989), p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; As her mother traveled the country to pursue acting jobs, Nancy was raised in [[Bethesda, Maryland|Bethesda]], Maryland for the next six years by her aunt Virginia and uncle Audley Gailbraith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/4297405 |title=The 'just say no' first lady |accessdate=2007-10-16 |publisher=MSNBC |date=February 18, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nancy describes longing for her mother during those years: &quot;My favorite times were when Mother had a job in New York, and Aunt Virgie would take me by train to stay with her.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Reagan, Nancy (1989), p. 71&lt;/ref&gt;

== Acting career ==
[[Image:NRPOSE.jpg|thumb|right|120px|Nancy Davis poses for a publicity photo, 1950]]
Following her graduation, Davis held jobs in Chicago as a sales clerk in [[Marshall Field's]] department store and as a nurse's aide.&lt;ref name=&quot;First Lady Nancy Reagan&quot;/&gt; With the help of her mother's colleagues in theatre, including [[Zasu Pitts]], [[Walter Huston]], and [[Spencer Tracy]],&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt-lw&quot;/&gt; she pursued a career as a professional actress.

She landed the role of Si-Tchun, a [[lady-in-waiting]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id=1771 | title=Lute Song | publisher=[[Internet Broadway Database]] | accessdate=2007-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the 1946 Broadway musical about the Orient, ''[[Lute Song (musical)|Lute Song]]'', starring [[Mary Martin]] and a pre-stardom [[Yul Brynner]].&lt;ref name=&quot;First Lady Nancy Reagan&quot;/&gt; The show's producer told her, &quot;You look like you could be Chinese.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Reagan, Nancy (1989), p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;

After passing a [[screen test]],&lt;ref name=&quot;First Lady Nancy Reagan&quot;/&gt; she moved to California and signed a seven-year contract with [[MGM Studios|Metro Goldwyn Mayer Studios]] (MGM) in 1949;&lt;ref name=&quot;Nancy Reagan: Her Life &amp; Times&quot;/&gt; she later remarked, &quot;Joining Metro was like walking into a dream world.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Reagan, Nancy (1989), p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;  Her combination of attractive appearance – centered around her large eyes – and somewhat distant and understated manner made her hard at first for MGM to cast and publicize.&lt;ref name=&quot;metzger-32&quot;&gt;Metzger, Robert Paul (1989), pp. 31–32&lt;/ref&gt; Davis appeared in 11 feature films, usually [[typecasting (acting)|typecast]] as a &quot;loyal housewife&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/participant.jsp?participantId=45332%7C115968&amp;afiPersonalNameId=null|title=Biography for Nancy Davis|accessdate=2007-10-17 |publisher=Turner Broadcasting System, Inc|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;responsible young mother&quot;, or &quot;the steady woman&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;cannon-gov&quot;&gt;Cannon, Lou (2003), pp. 75–76&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jane Powell]], [[Debbie Reynolds]], [[Leslie Caron]], and [[Janet Leigh]] were among those that she competed with for roles at MGM.&lt;ref name=&quot;metzger-32&quot;/&gt;

[[Garry Wills]] believes that Davis was underrated as an actress overall because her constrained part in ''Hellcats'' was her most widely seen performance.&lt;ref name=&quot;cannon-gov&quot;/&gt; In addition, Davis downplayed her Hollywood goals: MGM promotional material in 1949 said that her &quot;greatest ambition&quot; was to have a &quot;successful happy marriage&quot;; decades later, in 1975, she would say, &quot;I was never really a career woman but [became one] only because I hadn't found the man I wanted to marry.

During her Hollywood career Davis dated many actors, including [[Clark Gable]], [[Robert Stack]], and [[Peter Lawford]];&lt;ref name=&quot;metzger-33&quot;/&gt; she later called Gable the nicest of the stars she had met.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt-lw&quot;/&gt; On November 15, 1949, she met Ronald Reagan,&lt;ref name=&quot;cannon-gov-77&quot;&gt;Cannon, Lou (2003), pp. 77–78&lt;/ref&gt; who was then president of the Screen Actors Guild. Nancy had noticed that her name had appeared on the [[Hollywood blacklist]] and sought Reagan's help to maintain her employment as a guild actress in Hollywood, and for assistance in having her name removed from the list.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt-lw&quot;/&gt;  Reagan informed her that she had been confused with another actress of the same name.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt-lw&quot;/&gt; The two began dating and their relationship was the subject of many gossip columns; one Hollywood press account described their nightclub-free times together as &quot;the romance of a couple who have no vices&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;cannon-gov-77&quot;/&gt; Ronald Reagan was skeptical about marriage, however, following his painful 1948 divorce from [[Jane Wyman]], and he still saw other women.&lt;ref name=&quot;cannon-gov-77&quot;/&gt; After three years of dating, he eventually proposed to Davis in the couple's favorite booth at the [[Beverly Hills, California|Beverly Hills]] restaurant [[Chasen's]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cannon-gov-77&quot;/&gt; They married on March 4, 1952 in a simple ceremony designed to avoid the press&lt;ref name=&quot;Little Brown Church&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.baltimoresun.com/sports/golf/sns-ap-reagan-places,0,1844441.story?page=2|title= Noteworthy places in Reagan's life|accessdate=2007-04-11|date=2004-06-05|work=[[The Baltimore Sun]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the Little Brown Church in the [[San Fernando Valley]] of Los Angeles.

Nancy was thought to be closest to her stepdaughter Maureen during the White House years, but each of the Reagan children experienced periods of estrangement from their parents.&lt;ref name=&quot;Love Story&quot;/&gt;

== First Lady of California, 1967–1975 ==
[[Image:Nancy Reagan as First Lady of California.jpg|thumb|right|Nancy as the First Lady of California]]
Reagan was First Lady of California during her husband's two terms as governor. She disliked living in [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]], which lacked the excitement, social life, and mild climate to which she was accustomed in Los Angeles.&lt;ref name=&quot;can-gov-233&quot;&gt;Cannon, Lou (2003), p. 233&lt;/ref&gt; She first attracted controversy early in 1967, when, after four months' residence in the [[California Governor's Mansion]] in Sacramento, she moved her family into a wealthy suburb because fire officials had labeled the mansion as a &quot;firetrap&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;nancy-135&quot;/&gt; Though the Reagans leased the new house at their expense,&lt;ref name=&quot;can-gov-233&quot;/&gt; the move was viewed by many{{Who|date=April 2011}} as snobbish. Nancy defended her actions as being for the good of her family, a judgment with which her husband readily agreed.&lt;ref name=&quot;can-gov-233&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nancy-135&quot;&gt;Reagan, Nancy (1989), pp. 135–137&lt;/ref&gt; Friends of the family later helped support the cost of the leased house, while Nancy Reagan supervised construction of a new [[ranch-style house|ranch-style]] governor's residence in nearby [[Carmichael, California|Carmichael]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt111904&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/19/national/19mansion.html | title=Forget the White House, Schwarzenegger Needs Digs Now | author=Charlie LeDuff | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=2004-11-19 | accessdate=2007-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new residence was finished just as Ronald Reagan left office in 1975, but his successor, [[Jerry Brown]], refused to live there. It was sold in 1982, and California governors have been living in improvised arrangements ever since.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt111904&quot;/&gt;

In 1967, Nancy Reagan was appointed by her husband to the [[California Arts Commission]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F1071FF93D5E1A718DDDAE0994D9415B878AF1D3 | title=Reagan Panel Fills Arts Chief's Post After It Ousted Aide | author=Robert_Windeler |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=1967-11-17 | accessdate=2007-10-18}} &lt;/ref&gt; and a year later was named ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''' [[Times Woman of the Year|Woman of the Year]]; in its profile, the ''Times'' labeled her &quot;A Model First Lady&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/527764082.html?dids=527764082:527764082&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Dec+13%2C+1968&amp;author=LYNN+LILLISTON&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times+%281886-Current+File%29&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=F1&amp;desc=TIMES+WOMAN+OF+THE+YEAR | title=A Model First Lady | author=Lynn Lilliston | newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] | date=1968-12-13 | accessdate=2007-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her glamour, style, and youthfulness made her a frequent subject for [[Photojournalism|press photographers]].&lt;ref name=&quot;fl-ca&quot;&gt;Cook, Lynn and Janet LaDue (2007), pp. 110–111&lt;/ref&gt; As first lady, Reagan visited veterans, the elderly, and the handicapped, and worked with a number of charities.

== Role in 1976 and 1980 presidential campaigns ==
{{main|United States presidential election, 1976|United States presidential election, 1980}}
Governor Reagan's term ended in 1975, and he did not run for a third; instead, he met with advisors to discuss a possible bid for the [[President of the United States|presidency]] in [[United States presidential election, 1976|1976]], challenging incumbent President [[Gerald Ford]]. Reagan still needed to convince a reluctant Nancy before running, however.&lt;ref&gt;Benze, James G. (2005), p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; She feared for her husband's health and his career as a whole, though she felt that he was the right man for the job and eventually approved.&lt;ref name=&quot;lpm64&quot;&gt;Loizeau, P.M. (2004), p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; Nancy took on a more traditional role in the campaign, holding coffees, luncheons, and talks with senior citizens.&lt;ref name=&quot;lpm64&quot;/&gt; With that, she oversaw personnel, monitored her husband's schedule, and occasionally provided press conferences.&lt;ref name=&quot;Benze, James G., Jr. (2005), p. 33&quot;/&gt; The 1976 campaign included the so-called &quot;battle of the queens&quot;, contrasting Nancy with First Lady [[Betty Ford]]. They both spoke out over the course of the campaign on similar issues, but with different approaches.&lt;ref&gt;Loizeau, P.M. (2004), p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; Nancy was particularly upset by the warmonger image that the Ford campaign had drawn of her husband.&lt;ref name=&quot;lpm64&quot;/&gt;

Though he lost the 1976 Republican nomination, Reagan ran again for the presidency in [[United States presidential election, 1980|1980]] and succeeded in winning the nomination and election. During this second campaign, Nancy played a very prominent role and her management of staff became more apparent.&lt;ref name=&quot;Benze, James G., Jr. (2005), p. 33&quot;&gt;Benze, James G., Jr. (2005), p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; She arranged a meeting among feuding campaign managers [[John Sears (political strategist)|John Sears]] and [[Michael Deaver]] and her husband, which resulted in Deaver leaving the campaign and Sears being given full control. After the Reagan camp lost the [[Iowa caucus]] and fell behind in [[New Hampshire primary|New Hampshire]] polls, Nancy organized a second meeting and decided it was time to fire Sears and his associates; she gave Sears a copy of the press release announcing his dismissal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Benze, James G., Jr. (2005), p. 33&quot;/&gt; Her influence on her husband became particularly notable; her presence at rallies, luncheons, and receptions increased his confidence.&lt;ref&gt;Loizeau, P.M. (2004), p. 69&lt;/ref&gt;

=== White House glamour ===
==== Renovation ====
Nancy Reagan became the First Lady of the United States when Ronald Reagan was [[Ronald Reagan 1981 presidential inauguration|inaugurated]] as president in January 1981. Early in her husband's presidency, Reagan stated her desire to create a more suitable &quot;first home&quot; in the [[White House]], as the building had fallen into a state of disrepair following years of neglect.&lt;ref name=&quot;NR American&quot;/&gt; White House aide [[Michael Deaver]] described the second and third floor family residence as having &quot;cracked plaster walls, chipped paint [and] beaten up floors;&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;md78&quot;&gt;Deaver, Michael (2004), p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; rather than use government funds to renovate and redecorate, she sought private donations.&lt;ref name=&quot;First Lady Nancy Reagan&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.firstladies.org/biographies/firstladies.aspx?biography=41 |title=First Lady Biography: Nancy Reagan|accessdate=2007-06-02|publisher= National First Ladies Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nancy directed a major renovation of several White House rooms, including all of the second and third floors&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehousehistory.org/whha_timelines/timelines_first-ladies-40.html|title=Nancy Reagan|publisher=The White House Historical Association|accessdate=2012-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and rooms adjacent to the Oval Office, including the [[James S. Brady Press Briefing Room|press briefing room]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehousemuseum.org/west-wing/press-briefing-room.htm|title=Brady Press Briefing Room|accessdate=2008-02-01|publisher=The White House Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; The renovation included repainting walls, refinishing floors, repairing fireplaces, and replacing antique pipes, windows, and wires.&lt;ref name=&quot;md78&quot;/&gt;  The closet in the master bedroom was converted into a beauty parlor and dressing room, and the West bedroom was made into a small gymnasium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehousemuseum.org/floor2/west-bedroom.htm|title=West Bedroom|accessdate=2008-02-01|publisher=The White House Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first lady secured the assistance of renowned interior designer Ted Graber, popular with affluent West Coast social figures, to redecorate the family living quarters.&lt;ref name=&quot;graber&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Ted Graber, 80, Decorator for Reagans, Dies|accessdate=2009-07-21|date=June 12, 2000|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|author=Nemy, Enid|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/12/us/ted-graber-80-decorator-for-reagans-dies.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Chinese-pattern, handpainted wallpaper was added to the master bedroom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehousemuseum.org/floor2/master-bedroom.htm|title=Master Bedroom|accessdate=2008-02-01|publisher=The White House Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; Family furniture was placed in the president's private study.&lt;ref name=&quot;graber&quot;/&gt; The first lady and her designer retrieved a number of White House antiques, which had been in storage, and placed them throughout the mansion.&lt;ref name=&quot;graber&quot;/&gt;

The extensive redecoration was paid for by private donations.&lt;ref name=&quot;First Lady Nancy Reagan&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;graber&quot;/&gt; Many significant and long-lasting changes occurred as a result of the renovation and refurbishment, of which Nancy Reagan said, &quot;This house belongs to all Americans, and I want it to be something of which they can be proud.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;graber&quot;/&gt;

==== Fashion ====

Another of Nancy Reagan's trademarks was her interest in fashion. While her husband was still [[president-elect]], press reports speculated about Nancy's social life and interest in fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=HREVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=MQMEAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=nancy%20reagan%20fashion&amp;pg=7183%2C413166|title=Nancy Reagan: &quot;She'll Bring Style&quot;|accessdate=2009-07-22|date=November 9, 1980|author=Jacobs, Jody|publisher=Google News Archives|work=The Toledo Blade}}{{dead link|date=May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;stylenyt&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=v08NAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=yG0DAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=nancy%20reagan%20fashion&amp;pg=7004%2C1576501|title=Nancy Reagan's White House: what's ahead?|accessdate=2009-07-22|date=November 11, 1980|author=Nemy, Enid|work=The New York Times published in The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|publisher=Google News Archives}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=XlANAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=yW0DAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=nancy%20reagan%20fashion&amp;pg=5805%2C4581550|title=Fashion Designers Look Ahead to '81|accessdate=2009-07-22|date=December 23, 1980|author=Proven, Grace|work=The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|publisher=Google News Archives}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many press accounts, Nancy's sense of style was favorably compared to that of previous First Lady [[Jacqueline Kennedy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;burns-148&quot;&gt;Burns, Lisa (2008), p. 148&lt;/ref&gt; Friends and those close to her remarked that, while fashionable like Kennedy, she would be different than other first ladies; close friend Harriet Deutsch was quoted as saying, &quot;Nancy has her own imprint.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;stylenyt&quot;/&gt;

Nancy Reagan's wardrobe consisted of dresses, gowns, and suits made by luxury designers, including [[James Galanos]], [[Bill Blass (designer)|Bill Blass]] and [[Oscar de la Renta]]. Her white, hand-beaded, one shoulder Galanos 1981 inaugural gown was estimated to cost $10,000&lt;ref name=&quot;Nancy's Closet&quot;/&gt; while the overall price of her inaugural wardrobe was said to cost $25,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;spbt&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=GPALAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=JloDAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=nancy%20reagan%20fashion&amp;pg=6776%2C893022|title=Nancy Reagan's inaugural wardrobe gives notice of new White House opulence|accessdate=2009-07-22|date=January 25, 1981|work=The New York Times published in the St. Petersburg Times|publisher=Google News Archives|author=Bennetts, Leslie}}{{dead link|date=May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; She favored the color red, calling it &quot;a picker-upper&quot;, and wore it accordingly.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nancy's Closet&quot;/&gt; Her wardrobe included red so often that the fire-engine shade became known as &quot;Reagan red&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://img.slate.com/blogs/blogs/xxfactor/archive/2008/02/06/color-me-nancy-reagan-red.aspx|title=Color Me Nancy Reagan Red|accessdate=2012-01-27|publisher=Slate.com|date=February 6, 2008|author=Stevens, Dana}} {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; She employed two private [[hairdresser]]s who would style her hair on a regular basis in the White House.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0DE0D81338F930A1575BC0A960948260|title=Washington Talk: Briefing; A Do Ado|author=King, Wayne and Warren Weaver, Jr.|date=August 23, 1986|accessdate=2008-06-18 | work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Nancy Reagan Red Room 1981.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Reagan models for ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' magazine in the [[Red Room (White House)|Red Room]], 1981]]

Fashion designers were pleased with the emphasis Nancy Reagan placed on clothing.&lt;ref name=&quot;spbt&quot;/&gt; Adolfo said the first lady embodied an &quot;elegant, affluent, well-bred, chic American look,&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;spbt&quot;/&gt; while Bill Blass commented, &quot;I don't think there's been anyone in the White House since Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis who has her flair.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;spbt&quot;/&gt; William Fine, president of cosmetic company Frances Denney, noted that she &quot;stays in style, but she doesn't become trendy.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;spbt&quot;/&gt;

Though her elegant fashions and wardrobe were hailed as a &quot;glamorous paragon of chic&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;spbt&quot;/&gt; they were also controversial subjects. In 1982, she revealed that she had accepted thousands of dollars in clothing, jewelry, and other gifts, but defended her actions by stating that she had borrowed the clothes and that they would either be returned or donated to museums,&lt;ref name=&quot;Nancy's Closet&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://select.nytimes.com/search/restricted/article?res=F60716FA3A5C0C758DDDA80894DA484D81 | title=For Mrs. Reagan, Gifts Mean High Fashion At No Cost | publisher=Associated Press for ''[[The New York Times]]'' | date=1982-01-16 | format=fee required | accessdate=2008-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that she was promoting the American fashion industry.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt021782&quot;/&gt; Facing criticism, she soon said she would no longer accept such loans.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt021782&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://select.nytimes.com/search/restricted/article?res=F30912F9395F0C748DDDAB0894DA484D81 | title=Nancy Reagan Gives Up Dress Designer Loans | author=Hedrick Smith | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=1982-02-17 | format=fee required | accessdate=2008-02-01 |authorlink=Hedrick Smith}}&lt;/ref&gt; While often buying her clothes, she continued to borrow and sometimes keep designer clothes throughout her time as first lady, which came to light in 1988.&lt;ref name=&quot;time102488&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,968774-1,00.html | title=Why Mrs. Reagan Still Looks Like a Million | author=Ed Magnuson | work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] | date=1988-10-24 | accessdate=2008-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; None of this had been included on financial disclosure forms;&lt;ref name=&quot;time102488&quot;/&gt; the non-reporting of loans under $10,000 in liability was in violation of a voluntary agreement the White House had made in 1982, while not reporting more valuable loans or clothes not returned was a possible violation of the [[Ethics in Government Act]].&lt;ref name=&quot;time102488&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;wapo120589&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1226713.html | title=IRS Looking Into Gifts To Reagans; Borrowed Designer Dresses Subject of Tax Inquiry | author=Kurtz, Howard | newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] | date=1989-12-05 | accessdate=2008-02-02 | format=fee required}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt101888&quot;/&gt; Nancy expressed through her press secretary &quot;regrets that she failed to heed counsel's advice&quot; on disclosing them.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt101888&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE4DA1E3AF93BA25753C1A96E948260 | title= First Lady Expresses 'Regrets' on Wardrobe | author=Steven V.

Despite the controversy, many designers who allowed her to borrow clothing noted that the arrangement was good for their businesses&lt;ref name=&quot;time102488&quot;/&gt; as well as for the American fashion industry overall.&lt;ref name=&quot;bg101988&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-8084313.html | title=Nancy Reagan's Dress Blues: Borrowing Clothes From Top Designers May Be Chic, But Is It Proper? | author=John Robinson | work=[[The Boston Globe]] | date=1988-10-19 | accessdate=2008-02-07 | format=fee required}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, Nancy was honored at the annual gala awards dinner of the [[Council of Fashion Designers of America]], during which she received the council's lifetime achievement award.&lt;ref name=&quot;honorednyt&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1989/01/10/style/fashion-amid-the-rustle-of-finery-fashion-celebrates-its-own.html|title=Fashion; Amid the Rustle of Finery, Fashion Celebrates Its Own|author=Hochswender, Woody|date=January 10, 1989|accessdate=2009-07-22|work=The New York Times}} &lt;/ref&gt; [[Barbara Walters]] said of her, &quot;She has served every day for eight long years the word 'style.'&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;honorednyt&quot;/&gt;

==== Elegance and formality ====
Approximately a year into her husband's first term, Nancy Reagan explored the idea of ordering new [[White House china|state china service]] for the White House.&lt;ref name=&quot;apchina&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=p_INAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=FnsDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6521%2C2662729|title=Nancy Reagan's White House china: $209,508|date=September 12, 1981|accessdate=2009-07-23|work=Associated Press, published in The St. Petersburg Times|publisher=Google News Archives|author=Santini, Maureen}}{{dead link|date=May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A full china service had not been purchased since the [[Harry Truman|Truman]] administration in the 1940s, as only a partial service was ordered in the [[Lyndon B. Johnson|Johnson]] administration.&lt;ref name=&quot;apchina&quot;/&gt; She was quoted as saying, &quot;The White House really badly, badly needs china.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;apchina&quot;/&gt; Working with [[Lenox]], the primary porcelain manufacturer in America, the first lady chose a design scheme of a red with etched gold band, bordering the scarlet and cream colored ivory plates with a raised presidential seal etched in gold in the center.&lt;ref name=&quot;apchina&quot;/&gt; The full service comprised 4,370 pieces, with 19 pieces per individual set.&lt;ref name=&quot;apchina&quot;/&gt;  The service totaled $209,508.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.lenox.com/index.cfm?ss=services&amp;cat=about&amp;lp=whitehouse|title= Lenox: White House|accessdate=2007-06-02|publisher= Lenox, Inc}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it was paid for by private donations, some from the private Knapp Foundation, the purchase generated quite a controversy, for it was ordered at a time when the nation was undergoing an [[Early 1980s recession|economic recession]].&lt;ref&gt;Klapthor, Margaret Brown (1999), p. 184&lt;/ref&gt;

The new china, White House renovations, expensive clothing, and her attendance at the wedding of [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Charles]] and [[Diana, Princess of Wales|Diana]], Prince and Princess of Wales,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/inatl/longterm/diana/background/wedding1.htm|title=Britain Celebrates, Charles Takes a Bride|accessdate=2007-11-16 |publisher= ''The Washington Post''|date=1981-07-30|author=Downie, Leonard Jr.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  gave her an aura of being &quot;out of touch&quot; with the American people during an [[Early 1980s recession|economic recession]].&lt;ref name=&quot;First Lady Nancy Reagan&quot;/&gt; This and her taste for splendor inspired the derogatory nickname &quot;Queen Nancy&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;First Lady Nancy Reagan&quot;/&gt; While Jacqueline Kennedy had also faced some press criticism for her spending habits, Reagan's treatment was much more consistent and negative.&lt;ref name=&quot;burns-148&quot;/&gt;  In an attempt to deflect the criticism, she self-deprecatingly donned a [[baglady]] costume at the [[Gridiron Club|1982 Gridiron Dinner]] and sang &quot;Second-Hand Clothes&quot;, mimicking the song &quot;Second-Hand Rose&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Husband's Past will shape Nancy Reagan's future&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.usatoday.com/life/people/2004-06-13-nancy-reagan_x.htm|title= Husband's Past will shape Nancy Reagan |accessdate=2007-03-08 |publisher= ''USA Today''|date=2004-06-13|author=Page, Susan}}&lt;/ref&gt; The skit helped to restore her reputation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/aug/19/local/me-deaver19?pg=4|page=5|title=Michael K.

[[Image:Reagans with Jackie Kennedy.jpg|thumb|right|Reagan and her husband with a predecessor as First Lady, [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis|Jacqueline Kennedy]], in 1985. Nancy and Jackie were often compared due to their glamour, in contrast to the intervening First Ladies.]]

Nancy Reagan reflected on the criticisms in her 1989 autobiography, ''My Turn''.

After the presidencies of [[Gerald Ford]] (who favored the [[The Victors|Michigan fight song]] over &quot;[[Hail to the Chief]]&quot;) and [[Jimmy Carter]] (who dramatically reduced the formality of presidential functions), Nancy brought a [[John F.

=== Just Say No ===
{{main|Just Say No}}
Nancy Reagan launched the &quot;[[Just Say No]]&quot; drug awareness campaign in 1982, which was her primary project and major initiative as first lady.&lt;ref name=&quot;First Lady Nancy Reagan&quot;/&gt; Nancy first became aware of the need to educate young people about drugs during a 1980 campaign stop in Daytop Village, New York.&lt;ref name=&quot;Just Say No&quot;/&gt; She remarked in 1981 that &quot;Understanding what drugs can do to your children, understanding peer pressure and understanding why they turn to drugs is... the first step in solving the problem.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Just Say No&quot;/&gt; Her campaign focused on drug education and informing the youth of the danger of drug abuse.&lt;ref name=&quot;Just Say No&quot;/&gt;

In 1985, Nancy expanded the campaign to an international level by inviting the [[First Lady|First Ladies]] of various nations to the White House for a conference on drug abuse.&lt;ref name=&quot;First Lady Nancy Reagan&quot;/&gt; On October 27, 1986, President Reagan signed a drug enforcement bill into law, which granted $1.7 billion in funding to fight the crisis and ensured a mandatory minimum penalty for [[drug-related crime|drug offenses]].&lt;ref name=&quot;PBS Frontline&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/drugs/cron/ | title= Thirty Years of America's Drug War | publisher = pbs.org | accessdate=2007-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the bill was criticized by some, Nancy Reagan considered it a personal victory.&lt;ref name=&quot;First Lady Nancy Reagan&quot;/&gt; In 1988, she became the first First Lady invited to address the [[United Nations General Assembly]], where she spoke on international drug interdiction and trafficking laws.&lt;ref name=&quot;First Lady Nancy Reagan&quot;/&gt;

=== Her husband's protector ===
Nancy Reagan assumed the role of unofficial &quot;protector&quot; for her husband after the [[Reagan assassination attempt|attempted assassination]] on his life in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/06/05/national/main621274.shtml|title=His Fierce Protector: Nancy|first=David|last=Hancock|accessdate= 2007-11-15|date= June 5, 2004|publisher=CBS}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 30 of that year, President Reagan and three others were shot as they left the [[Hilton Washington|Washington Hilton Hotel]]. Nancy was alerted and arrived at [[George Washington University Hospital]], where the President was hospitalized. She recalled having seen &quot;emergency rooms before, but I had never seen one like this—with my husband in it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Reagan, Nancy (1989), p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; She was escorted into a waiting room, and when granted access to see her husband, he quipped to her, &quot;Honey, I forgot to duck&quot;, borrowing the defeated boxer [[Jack Dempsey|Jack Dempsey's]] jest to his wife.&lt;ref name=&quot;NoonanPBS&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.pbs.org/newshour/character/essays/reagan.html| author=Noonan, Peggy|title= Character Above All: Ronald Reagan essay |publisher = PBS |accessdate=2007-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An early example of her protective nature occurred when Senator [[Strom Thurmond]] entered the President's hospital room that day in March, passing the [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] detail by claiming he was the President's &quot;close friend&quot;, presumably to acquire media attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web1.millercenter.org/poh/transcripts/ohp_2002_1024_friedersdorf.pdf|title= Final Edited Transcript: Interview with Max Friedersdorf|accessdate= 2007-10-20|date= October 24–25, 2002|format= PDF|publisher= Miller Center of Public Affairs|page= 60|quote=Mrs. Reagan was all upset, of course. He said that Senator [Strom] Thurmond had come over to the hospital and had talked his way in, past the lobby, up to the President's room—he's in intensive care, tubes coming out of his nose and his throat, tubes in his arms and everything—and said that Strom Thurmond had talked his way past the secret service into his room and Mrs. Reagan was outraged, distraught. She couldn't believe her eyes. He said, 'You know, those guys are crazy. They come over here trying to get a picture in front of the hospital and trying to talk to the President when he may be on his deathbed.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nancy was outraged and demanded he leave.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beschloss, Michael p. 284&quot;/&gt; While the president recuperated in the hospital, the first lady slept with one of his shirts to be comforted by the scent.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beschloss, Michael p. 284&quot; /&gt; When Reagan was released from the hospital on April 12, she escorted him back to the White House.

Press accounts [[Framing (social sciences)|framed]] Nancy as her husband's &quot;chief protector&quot;, an extension of their general initial framing of her as a helpmate and a [[Cold War]] domestic ideal.&lt;ref&gt;Burns, Lisa (2008), pp. 130, 138–139&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Influence in the White House ====
[[Image:President Reagan being sworn in for second term during the private ceremony held at the White House 1985.jpg|thumb|right|&quot;The Gaze&quot;: Nancy watches as her husband is sworn in for a second term by Chief Justice [[Warren Burger]], on January 20, 1985.]]

Nancy stated in her [[memoirs]], &quot;I felt panicky every time [Ronald] left the White House&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Reagan, Nancy (1989), p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; following the assassination attempt, and made it her concern to know her husband's schedule: the events he would be attending, and with whom.&lt;ref name=&quot;First Lady Nancy Reagan&quot;/&gt; Eventually, this protectiveness led to her consulting an [[astrologer]], [[Joan Quigley]], who offered insight on which days were &quot;good&quot;, &quot;neutral&quot;, or should be avoided, which influenced her husband's [[White House]] schedule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CEEDF1030F93BA25750C0A966958260|title=Stars and Strife|accessdate= 2007-11-16|date= March 18, 1990|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|author=Ivins, Molly|authorlink=Molly Ivins}} &lt;/ref&gt; Days were color-coded according to the astrologer's advice to discern precisely which days and times would be optimal for the president's safety and success.&lt;ref name=&quot;First Lady Nancy Reagan&quot;/&gt;
The [[White House Chief of Staff]], [[Donald Regan]], grew frustrated with this regimen, which created friction between him and the First Lady. This escalated with the revelation of the [[Iran-Contra affair]], an administration scandal, in which the First Lady felt Regan was damaging the president.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony, C.S. (1991), p. 396&lt;/ref&gt; She thought he should resign, and expressed this to her husband although he did not share her view. Regan wanted President Reagan to address the Iran-Contra matter in early 1987 by means of a press conference, though Nancy refused to allow Reagan to overexert himself due to a recent prostate surgery and astrological warnings.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony, C.S. (1991), p. 398&lt;/ref&gt; Regan became so angry with Nancy that he hung up on her during a 1987 telephone conversation. According to former [[ABC News]] correspondent [[Sam Donaldson]], when the President heard of this treatment, he demanded—and eventually received—Regan's resignation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | people=Thomas, Rhys (Writer/Producer); Donaldson, Sam (interviewee)|date=2005 | url=http://shop.history.com/detail.php?a=71740| title=The Presidents| medium=Documentary | publisher=A&amp;E Television}}{{dead link|date=September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1988 memoirs, Regan wrote about Nancy's consultations with the astrologer, the first public mention of them, which resulted in embarrassment for the First Lady.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/01/AR2007050102070.html| title=Ronald Reagan, In His Own Words| author=Kurtz, Howard| newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] | date=2007-05-02 | accessdate=2007-10-20|authorlink=Howard Kurtz}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nancy later wrote, &quot;Astrology was simply one of the ways I coped with the fear I felt after my husband almost died... Was astrology one of the reasons [further attempts did not occur]? I don't ''really'' believe it was, but I don't ''really'' believe it wasn't.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Reagan, Nancy (1989), p. 44, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Reagans talking in Oval Office cropped.jpg|thumb|left|The Reagans talk in the Oval Office, 1985]]
Nancy Reagan wielded a powerful influence over President Reagan.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC Nancy's image&quot;/&gt; Again stemming from the assassination attempt, she strictly controlled access to the president and even occasionally attempted to influence her husband's decision making.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC Nancy's image&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reagan, Nancy (1989), p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 1985, Nancy strongly encouraged her husband to hold &quot;summit&quot; conferences with Soviet General Secretary Gorbachev, and suggested they form a personal relationship beforehand.&lt;ref name=&quot;First Lady Nancy Reagan&quot;/&gt; Both Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev had developed a productive relationship through their summit negotiations. The relationship between Nancy Reagan and [[Raisa Gorbachev]] was anything but the friendly, diplomatic one between their husbands; Nancy found Raisa hard to converse with and their relationship was described as &quot;frosty&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=The New York Times|accessdate=2008-10-14|date=December 8, 1988|author=Celestine Bohlen|title= The Gorbachev Visit; Another Obstacle Falls: Nancy Reagan and Raisa Gorbachev Get Chummy|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE6DD1039F93BA35751C1A96E948260}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two women usually had tea, and discussed differences between the USSR and the United States. Visiting the U.S. for the first time in 1987, Raisa irked Reagan with lectures on subjects ranging from architecture to socialism, reportedly prompting the American President's wife to quip, &quot;Who does that dame think she is?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,967592-1,00.html |magazine = [[Time (magazine)|Time]]| author = Chua-Eoan, Howard G. | title = My Wife Is a Very Independent Lady | date = June 6, 1988 | accessdate = 2007-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Press framing of Nancy changed from that of just helpmate and protector to someone with hidden power.&lt;ref name=&quot;burns-power&quot;&gt;Burns, Lisa (2008), pp. 139–140&lt;/ref&gt; As the image of her as a political interloper grew, she sought to explicitly deny that she was the [[power behind the throne]].&lt;ref name=&quot;burns-power&quot;/&gt; At the end of her time as First Lady, however, she said that her husband had not been well-served by his staff.&lt;ref name=&quot;burns-power&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;reut111388&quot;/&gt; She acknowledged her role in reaction in influencing him on personnel decisions, saying &quot;In no way do I apologize for it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;reut111388&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/13/us/nancy-reagan-criticizes-aides-to-president.html | title=Nancy Reagan Criticizes Aides to President | agency=Reuters | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=1988-11-13 | accessdate=2009-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; She wrote in her memoirs, &quot;I don't think I was as bad, or as extreme in my power or my weakness, as I was depicted,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Reagan, Nancy (1989), p. vii&lt;/ref&gt; but went on, &quot;[H]owever the first lady fits in, she has a unique and important role to play in looking after her husband. And it's only natural that she'll let him know what she thinks. I always did that for Ronnie, and I always will.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Reagan, Nancy (1989), p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Breast cancer ===
In October 1987, a [[mammogram]] detected a lesion in Nancy Reagan's left breast and she was subsequently diagnosed with breast cancer. She chose to undergo a [[mastectomy]] rather than a [[lumpectomy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&amp;res=9B0DE2DA123DF93BA25753C1A961948260|title=Surgeons Remove Cancerous Breast of Nancy Reagan|accessdate=2008-06-23|work=The New York Times|author=Altman, Lawrence K|date=October 18, 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the breast was removed on October 17, 1987. Ten days after the operation, her mother, [[Edith Luckett Davis]], died in [[Phoenix, Arizona]], leading Nancy to dub the period &quot;a terrible month&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Reagan, Nancy (1989), p. 285&lt;/ref&gt;

After the surgery, more women across the country had mammograms, an example of the influence the First Lady possesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00001360.htm|title=Perspectives in Disease Prevention and Health Promotion Trends in Screening Mammograms for Women 50 Years of Age and Older — Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, 1987|accessdate=2008-06-23|date=March 10, 1989|publisher=Department of Health and Human Services}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Later life ==
Though Nancy was a controversial First Lady, 56&amp;nbsp;percent of Americans had a favorable opinion of her when her husband left office on January 20, 1989, with 18&amp;nbsp;percent having an unfavorable opinion and the balance not giving an opinion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nancy Reagan's poll numbers&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/06/07/opinion/polls/main621632.shtml|title=A Look Back At The Polls|accessdate=2007-10-14|publisher=CBS Interactive Inc|date=June 7, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Compared to fellow First Ladies when their husbands left office, Reagan's approval was higher than those of [[Rosalynn Carter]] and [[Hillary Rodham Clinton]], however she was less popular than [[Barbara Bush]] and her disapproval rating was double that of Carter's.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nancy Reagan's poll numbers&quot;/&gt;

=== Early post-White House activities ===
In late 1989, the former First Lady established the Nancy Reagan Foundation, which aimed to continue to educate people about the dangers of substance abuse.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nancy Reagan&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.reaganfoundation.org/reagan/nancy/nancy_bio.asp|title= Nancy Reagan: Her Life and Times|accessdate= 2007-05-12|publisher= Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071112053844/http://www.reaganfoundation.org/reagan/nancy/nancy_bio.asp |archivedate = November 12, 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Foundation teamed with the BEST Foundation For A Drug-Free Tomorrow in 1994, and developed the Nancy Reagan Afterschool Program. She continued to travel around the nation, speaking out against drug and alcohol abuse. After President Reagan revealed that he had been diagnosed with [[Alzheimer's disease]] in 1994, she made herself his primary caregiver and became actively involved with the National Alzheimer's Association and its affiliate, the [[Ronald and Nancy Reagan Research Institute]] in Chicago, Illinois.&lt;ref name=&quot;First Lady Nancy Reagan&quot;/&gt;

Also in 1989 she published ''[[My Turn (memoir)|My Turn: The Memoirs of Nancy Reagan]]'', which gives an account of her life in the White House, speaking openly about her influence within the Reagan administration and discussing the myths and controversies that surrounded the couple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.a1wdb.com/cgi-bin/women/11521.html|title=My Turn Review|accessdate=2007-03-28 |publisher=A-1 Women's Discount Bookstore}}{{dead link|date=September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, the controversial author [[Kitty Kelley]] wrote an unauthorized and largely uncited biography about Nancy Reagan, repeating accounts of a poor relationship with her children and introducing rumors of alleged sexual relations with singer [[Frank Sinatra]].

The funeral had a great impact on Reagan's public image.

=== Life after Ronald ===
Reagan has remained active in politics, particularly relating to [[stem cell research]]. Beginning in 2004, she favored what many consider to be the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party's]] position, and urged President [[George W. Bush]] to support federally funded embryonic stem cell research in the hope that this science could lead to a cure for Alzheimer's disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Erika Check | title = Bush pressured as Nancy Reagan pleads for stem-cell research | journal = Nature | year = 2004 | volume = 429 | page = 116| doi = 10.1038/429116a | pmid = 15141173 | issue = 6988}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although she failed to change the president's position, she did support his campaign for a second term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/politicselections/nation/president/2004-08-03-nancy-reagan-bush_x.htm|title= Former first lady Nancy Reagan supports Bush's re-election|accessdate=2007-10-17 |newspaper=[[USA Today]]| date = August 4, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Reagan was honored at a gala dinner at the [[Ronald Reagan Building]] in Washington, D.C. where guests included [[Dick Cheney]], [[Harry Reid]] and [[Condoleezza Rice]].&lt;ref name=&quot;dinner-wapo&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/05/12/AR2005051200490_pf.html|title=Just Say Yes: Nancy Reagan Welcomed Back at Tribute|date=May 12, 2005|accessdate=2008-05-17|work=The Washington Post|author=Roberts, Roxanne}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was her first major public appearance since the funeral. Asked what her future plans were, Reagan shook her head and responded, &quot;I don't know. I'll know when I'll know. But the [Reagan] library is Ronnie, so that's where I spend my time.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;dinner-wapo&quot;/&gt;

[[File:President Bush, Laura Bush and Nancy Reagan.jpg|thumb|left|Nancy Reagan dedicates the Air Force One Pavilion at the Reagan Library with President and Laura Bush, October 2005]]

In 2007, she attended the [[Death and state funeral of Gerald Ford|national funeral service for Gerald Ford]] in the [[Washington National Cathedral]]. Nancy Reagan hosted [[Republican Party (United States) presidential debates, 2008|two 2008 Republican Presidential Candidates Debates]] at the Reagan Presidential Library, the first in May 2007 and the second in January 2008.

Nancy Reagan's health and well being became a prominent concern in 2008. In February she suffered a fall at her Bel Air home and was taken to [[St. John's Health Center]] in [[Santa Monica, California]]. Doctors reported that she did not break a hip as feared and she was released from the hospital two days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/23241883/|title=Nancy Reagan Released From Hospital|date=February 19, 2008|accessdate=2008-02-19|work=MSNBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; News commentators noted that Reagan's step had slowed significantly, as the following month she walked in very slow strides with John McCain.&lt;ref name=&quot;msnbc fall&quot;&gt;{{cite video |people= Williams, Brian (interviewee)|date=2008-10-15|title=Nancy Reagan suffers broken pelvis|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21134540/vp/271999154#27199154|medium=Television production|publisher=MSNBC|accessdate=2008-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  NBC's [[Brian Williams]], who attended a dinner with Reagan in mid-2008, recalled, &quot;Mrs. Reagan's vision isn't what it always was so she was taking very halting steps as a lot of folks her age do... [I]t is so important for folks in her age bracket and in her bracket of life to remain upright and captain of their own ship.

She is, as most of her friends described her, a pistol.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;msnbc fall&quot;/&gt;

In October 2008, Reagan was admitted to [[Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center]] after falling at home. Doctors determined that the 87-year-old had fractured her [[human pelvis|pelvis]] and [[sacrum]] and could recuperate at home with a regimen of [[physical therapy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUSTRE49G7S420081017 | publisher=Reuters | title=Former first lady Nancy Reagan out of hospital | first=Dan | last=Whitcomb | date=2008-10-17 | accessdate=2009-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of her mishap, medical articles were published containing information on how to prevent falls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Steps to take for strong bones|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/living/story/754530.html|work=The Miami Herald|accessdate=2008-12-06|author=Rarback, Sheah|date=November 4, 2008}} {{dead link| date=June 2010 | bot=DASHBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/126942.php|title=Physical Therapy Will Play Key Role In Nancy Reagan's Recovery From Recent Fall|accessdate=2008-12-06|publisher=News Today|date=October 27, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2009, Reagan was said to be &quot;improving every day and starting to get out more and more.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.etonline.com/news/69715_Nancy_Reagan_Health_Update_She_s_Improving_Every_Day/index.html|title=Nancy Reagan Health Update: 'Shes Improving Every Day'|accessdate=2009-01-20|date=January 15, 2009|publisher=Entertainment Tonight}}&lt;/ref&gt;
