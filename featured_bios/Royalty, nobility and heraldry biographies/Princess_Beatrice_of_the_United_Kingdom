}}
'''The Princess Beatrice''' (Beatrice Mary Victoria Feodore; later '''Princess Henry of Battenberg'''; 14 April 1857 &amp;ndash; 26 October 1944) was a member of the [[British Royal Family]]. She was the fifth daughter and youngest child of [[Queen Victoria]] and [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]]. [[Juan Carlos I of Spain|Juan Carlos]], [[Monarchy of Spain|King of Spain]], is her great-grandson. Beatrice has the distinction of being the last of Victoria's children to die, 66 years after the first, Beatrice's sister, [[Princess Alice of the United Kingdom|Princess Alice]]. 

Beatrice's childhood coincided with Victoria's grief following the death of her husband, [[Albert, Prince Consort]], on 14 December 1861. As Beatrice's elder sisters married and left their royal mother, Victoria came to rely on the company of her youngest daughter, whom she called ''Baby'' for most of her childhood. Beatrice, who was brought up to stay with her mother always, soon resigned herself to her fate.&lt;ref&gt;Dennison, p. 71&lt;/ref&gt;

Victoria was set against her youngest daughter marrying and refused to discuss the possibility. Nevertheless, many suitors were put forward, including [[Louis Napoléon, Prince Imperial]], the son of the exiled Emperor [[Napoleon III of France]], and [[Louis IV, Grand Duke of Hesse]], the [[widower]] of Beatrice's older sister [[Alice of the United Kingdom|Alice]]. She was attracted to the Prince Imperial and there was talk of a possible marriage; however, he was killed in the [[Anglo-Zulu War]] in 1879.

Beatrice fell in love with [[Prince Henry of Battenberg]], the son of [[Prince Alexander of Hesse and by Rhine]] and [[Julia von Hauke]]. After a year of persuasion, Victoria agreed to the marriage, which took place at [[Whippingham]] on the [[Isle of Wight]], on 23 July 1885. Victoria consented on condition that Beatrice and Henry make their home with her and that Beatrice continue her duties as the Queen's unofficial secretary.

The Prince and Princess had four children, but ten years into their marriage, on 20 January 1896, Prince Henry died of [[malaria]] while fighting in the [[Anglo-Ashanti wars#Fourth Anglo-Ashanti War|Anglo-Asante War]]. Beatrice remained at her mother's side until Victoria died on 22 January 1901. Beatrice devoted the next thirty years to editing Queen Victoria's journals as her designated literary executor. She continued to make public appearances after her mother's death and died at the age of 87, outliving all her siblings and several of her children, nieces and nephews.

==Early life==
[[Image:Queen Victoria and Princess Beatrice as baby.jpg|left|thumb|Queen Victoria, holding Princess Beatrice in 1862]]
Beatrice was born at [[Buckingham Palace]].&lt;ref&gt;Dennison, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; She was the fifth daughter and youngest of the nine children of the reigning British monarch, [[Queen Victoria]], and her husband, [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]] (later The [[Prince Consort]]). The birth caused controversy when it was announced that Victoria would seek relief from the pains of delivery through the use of [[chloroform]] administered by [[John Snow (physician)|Doctor John Snow]]. Chloroform was considered dangerous to mother and child and was frowned upon by the [[Church of England]] and the medical authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Dennison, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;  Victoria was undeterred and used &quot;that blessed chloroform&quot; for her last pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;Longford, (''Victoria R. I.'') p. 234&lt;/ref&gt; A [[fortnight]] later, Victoria reported in her journal, &quot;I was amply rewarded and forgot all I had gone through when I heard dearest Albert say 'It's a fine child, and a girl!' &quot;&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Dennison, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; Albert and Victoria chose the names ''Beatrice Mary Victoria Feodore'': Mary after [[Princess Mary, Duchess of Gloucester]], the last surviving child of [[George III|King George III of the United Kingdom]]; Victoria after the Queen; and Feodore after the Queen's older half-sister. She was christened in the private chapel at  [[Buckingham Palace]] on 16 June 1857. Her godparents were her maternal grandmother, the [[Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld|Duchess of Kent]]; her eldest sister, the [[Victoria, Princess Royal|Princess Royal]]; and the Princess Royal's fiancé, [[Frederick III, German Emperor|Prince Frederick of Prussia]].&lt;ref&gt;Dennison, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Princess Beatrice mourning.jpg|right|thumb|The daughters of Queen Victoria mourn the loss of their father. Beatrice is the only one shown who is not looking down.]]

From birth, Beatrice became a favoured child.&lt;ref name=Dennison1&gt;Dennison, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; The elder favourite daughter of Prince Albert, the Princess Royal, was about to take up residence in Germany with her new husband, Frederick (&quot;Fritz&quot;) of Prussia. At the same time, the newly arrived Beatrice showed promise.  Albert wrote to [[Augusta of Saxe-Weimar|Augusta]], Fritz's mother, that &quot;Baby practises her scales like a good ''prima donna'' before a performance and has a good voice!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Jagow, p. 272&lt;/ref&gt; Although Victoria was known to dislike most babies, she liked Beatrice, whom she considered attractive. This provided Beatrice with an advantage over her elder siblings. Victoria once remarked that Beatrice was &quot;a pretty, plump and flourishing child&amp;nbsp;... with fine large blue eyes, [a] pretty little mouth and very fine skin&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Dennison, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Her long, golden hair was the focus of paintings commissioned by Victoria, who even enjoyed giving Beatrice her bath, in marked contrast to her bathing preferences for her other children.&lt;ref name=Dennison1&gt;Dennison, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; Beatrice showed intelligence, which further endeared her to the Prince Consort, who was amused by her childhood precociousness.&lt;ref name=Dennison1&gt;Dennison, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote to Baron Stockmar that Beatrice was &quot;the most amusing baby we have had.&quot; Despite sharing the rigorous education programme designed by Prince Albert and his close adviser, [[Christian Friedrich, Baron Stockmar|Baron Stockmar]], Beatrice had a more relaxed infancy than her siblings because of her relationship with her parents.&lt;ref&gt;Dennison, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; By four years the youngest, and the acknowledged last Royal child, Beatrice was not forced to share her parents' attention the way her siblings had, and her amusing ways provided comfort to her faltering father.

==Victoria's devoted companion==
[[Image:Princess Beatrice 1868.jpg|left|thumb|Princess Beatrice in 1868. Her late childhood brought little companionship since Prince Leopold, the sibling closest to her age, could not play because of his [[haemophilia]].]]
In March 1861, Victoria's mother [[Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld|Victoria, Duchess of Kent]], died at [[Frogmore]]. The Queen broke down in grief and guilt over their estrangement at the beginning of Victoria's reign.&lt;ref&gt;Longford, (''Victoria, Duchess of Kent'') Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&lt;/ref&gt; Beatrice tried to console her mother by reminding her that the Duchess of Kent was &quot;in heaven, but [Beatrice] hopes she will return&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Epton, p. 92&lt;/ref&gt; This comfort was significant because Victoria had isolated herself from her children except the eldest unmarried, [[Alice of the United Kingdom|Princess Alice]], and Beatrice.&lt;ref&gt;Bolitho, p. 104&lt;/ref&gt; Victoria again relied on Beatrice and Alice after the death of Albert, of typhoid fever, on 14 December.&lt;ref&gt;Bolitho, pp. 195–196&lt;/ref&gt;

The depth of the Queen's grief over the death of her husband surprised her family, courtiers, politicians and general populace. As when her mother died, she shut herself off from her family—most particularly, [[Edward VII|the Prince of Wales]], (whom she blamed for her husband's death),&lt;ref&gt;Matthew, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&lt;/ref&gt; with the exception of Alice and Beatrice. Victoria often took Beatrice from her cot, hurried to her bed and &quot;lay there sleepless, clasping to her child, wrapped in the nightclothes of a man who would wear them no more.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Duff, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; After 1871, when the last of Beatrice's elder sisters married,&lt;ref&gt;[[Victoria, Princess Royal|Vicky]] in 1858; [[Alice of the United Kingdom|Alice]] in 1862; [[Princess Helena of the United Kingdom|Helena]] in 1866; [[Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll|Louise]] in 1871&lt;/ref&gt; Victoria came to rely upon her youngest daughter, who had declared from an early age: &quot;I don't like weddings at all. I shall never be married. I shall stay with my mother.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Dennison, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; As her mother's secretary, she performed duties such as writing on the Queen's behalf and helping with political correspondence.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennison, p. 204&quot;&gt;Dennison, p. 204&lt;/ref&gt; These mundane duties mirrored those that had been performed in succession by her sisters, Alice, Helena and Louise.&lt;ref name=Dennison2&gt;Dennison, p. 92&lt;/ref&gt; However, to these the Queen soon added more personal tasks. During a serious illness in 1871, the Queen dictated her journal entries to Beatrice,&lt;ref name=Dennison2&gt;Dennison, p. 92&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1876 she allowed Beatrice to sort the music that she and the Prince Consort had played, unused since his death fifteen years earlier.&lt;ref name=Dennison2&gt;Dennison, p. 92&lt;/ref&gt;

The devotion that Beatrice showed to her mother was acknowledged in the Queen's letters and journals, but her constant need for Beatrice grew stronger.&lt;ref&gt;Bolitho, p. 301&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;After a failed assassination attempt on the Queen in 1882, she wrote of Beatrice: &quot;Nothing can exceed dearest Beatrice's courage and calmness, for she saw the whole thing, the man take aim, and fire straight into the carriage, but she never said a word, observing that I was not frightened.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The Queen suffered another bereavement in 1883, when her highland servant, [[John Brown (servant)|John Brown]], died at [[Balmoral Castle|Balmoral]].&lt;ref&gt;Buckle, p. 418&lt;/ref&gt; Once again, the Queen plunged into public mourning and relied on Beatrice for support. Unlike her siblings, Beatrice had not shown dislike for Brown, and the two had often been seen in each other's company;&lt;ref name=Dennison3&gt;Dennison, pp. 95–101&lt;/ref&gt; indeed, they had worked together to carry out the Queen's wishes.&lt;ref name=Dennison3&gt;Dennison, pp. 95–101&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage==
===Possible suitors===
Although the Queen was set against Beatrice marrying anyone in the expectation that she would always stay at home with her, a number of possible suitors were put forward before Beatrice's marriage to [[Prince Henry of Battenberg]]. One of these was [[Napoleon Eugene, Prince Imperial|Napoleon Eugene]], the French [[Prince Imperial]], son and heir of the exiled Emperor [[Napoleon III of France]] and his wife, the [[Eugénie de Montijo|Empress Eugénie]]. After Prussia defeated France in the [[Franco-Prussian War]], Napoleon was deposed and moved his family to England in 1870.&lt;ref&gt;Corley, p. 349&lt;/ref&gt; After the Emperor's death in 1873, Victoria and Empress Eugénie formed a close attachment, and the newspapers reported the imminent engagement of Beatrice to the Prince Imperial.&lt;ref&gt;Dennison, pp. 86–87&lt;/ref&gt; These rumours ended with the death of the Prince Imperial in the [[Anglo-Zulu War]] on 1 June 1879. Victoria's journal records their grief: &quot;Dear Beatrice, crying very much as I did too, gave me the telegram&amp;nbsp;... It was dawning and little sleep did I get&amp;nbsp;... Beatrice is so distressed; everyone quite stunned.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Dennison, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Napoléon Eugène Bonaparte, sitting.jpg|left|thumb|[[Louis Napoléon, Prince Imperial]], to whom Beatrice was romantically attached in the 1870s]]
After the death of the Prince Imperial, Beatrice's brother, [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Albert Edward]], the [[Prince of Wales]], suggested that she marry their sister Alice's widower, [[Louis IV, Grand Duke of Hesse|Louis IV]], the [[Grand Duke of Hesse]], who had lost his wife to [[diphtheria]] in 1878. Albert Edward argued that Beatrice could act as replacement mother for Louis's young children and spend most of her time in England looking after her mother.&lt;ref&gt;Dennison, pp. 103–104&lt;/ref&gt; He further suggested that the Queen could oversee the upbringing of her [[Hesse|Hessian]] grandchildren with greater ease.&lt;ref name=Dennison104&gt;Dennison, p. 104&lt;/ref&gt; However, at the time, it was forbidden by law for Beatrice to marry her sister's widower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; This was countered by the Prince of Wales, who vehemently supported passage by the [[Houses of Parliament]] of the [[Deceased Wife's Sister Bill]], which would have removed the obstacle.&lt;ref name=Dennison104&gt;Dennison, p. 104&lt;/ref&gt; Despite popular support for this measure and although it passed in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]], it was rejected by the [[House of Lords]] because of opposition from those [[Church of England]] [[bishop]]s who sat in the Lords.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Queen was disappointed that the bill had failed, she was happy to keep her daughter at her side.&lt;ref&gt;Dennison, p. 106&lt;/ref&gt;

Other candidates, including two of Prince Henry's brothers, [[Alexander, Prince of Bulgaria|Prince Alexander]] (&quot;Sandro&quot;) and [[Prince Louis of Battenberg]], were put forward to be Beatrice's husband, but they did not succeed.  Although Alexander never formally pursued Beatrice, merely claiming that he &quot;might even at one time have become engaged to the friend of my childhood, Beatrice of England&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Dennison, p. 126&lt;/ref&gt; Louis was more interested. Victoria invited him to dinner but sat between him and Beatrice, who had been told by the Queen to ignore Louis to discourage his suit.&lt;ref&gt;Dennison, p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; Louis, not realising for several years the reasons for this silence, married Beatrice's niece, [[Princess Victoria of Hesse and by Rhine]]. Although her marriage hopes had been dealt another blow, while attending Louis's wedding at [[Darmstadt]], Beatrice fell in love with [[Prince Henry of Battenberg|Prince Henry]], who returned her affections.&lt;ref&gt;Dennison, p. 124&lt;/ref&gt;

===Engagement and wedding===
{{See also|Wedding dress of Princess Beatrice}}
[[Image:Princess Beatrice coloured bookplate.jpg|right|thumb|Princess Beatrice in her wedding dress, Osborne, 1885. Beatrice wore her mother's wedding veil of [[Honiton]] lace.]]
When Beatrice, after returning from Darmstadt, told her mother that she planned to marry, the Queen reacted with frightening silence. Although they remained side by side, the Queen did not talk to her for seven months, instead communicating by note.&lt;ref&gt;Dennison, p. 130&lt;/ref&gt;
Victoria's behaviour, unexpected even by her family,&lt;ref&gt;Dennison, p. 128&lt;/ref&gt; seemed prompted by the threatened loss of her daughter.&lt;ref&gt;Dennison, pp. 127–128&lt;/ref&gt; The Queen regarded Beatrice as her &quot;Baby&quot;&amp;mdash;her innocent child&amp;mdash;and viewed the physical sex that would come with marriage as an end to innocence.&lt;ref&gt;Dennison, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; Subtle persuasions by the [[Alexandra of Denmark|Princess of Wales]] and the Crown Princess of Prussia, who reminded her mother of the happiness that Beatrice had brought the Prince Consort, induced the Queen to resume talking to Beatrice. Victoria consented to the marriage on condition that Henry give up his German commitments and live permanently with Beatrice and the Queen.&lt;ref name=Purdue&gt;Purdue, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&lt;/ref&gt;

Beatrice and Henry were married at [[Saint Mildred]]'s Church at [[Whippingham]], near [[Osborne House|Osborne]],&lt;ref&gt;Beatrice and her siblings were confirmed here&lt;/ref&gt; on 23 July 1885.&lt;ref name=Purdue/&gt; Beatrice, who wore her mother's wedding veil of Honiton lace, was escorted by the Queen and Beatrice's eldest brother, the Prince of Wales.&lt;ref&gt;Dennison, pp. 152–153&lt;/ref&gt; The ceremony—which was not attended by her eldest sister and brother-in-law, the Crown Prince and Princess of Prussia, who were detained in Germany; [[William Ewart Gladstone]]; or Beatrice's cousin, [[Princess Mary Adelaide of Cambridge|Princess Mary Adelaide, Duchess of Teck]]&lt;ref&gt;The duchess was in mourning for her father-in-law&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dennison, p. 153&lt;/ref&gt;—ended with the couple's departure for their honeymoon at [[Quarr Abbey House]], a few miles from Osborne. The Queen, taking leave of them, &quot;bore up bravely till the departure and then fairly gave way&quot;, as she later admitted to the Crown Princess.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt;

==Victoria's last years==
After a short [[honeymoon]], Beatrice and her husband fulfilled their promise and returned to the Queen's side. The Queen made it clear that she could not cope on her own and that the couple could not travel without her.&lt;ref name=Dennison179&gt;Dennison, 179&lt;/ref&gt; [[Image:Prince Henry of Battenberg.jpg|thumb|left|[[Prince Henry of Battenberg]], who was married to Beatrice from 1885 until his death in 1896]] Although the Queen relaxed this restriction shortly after the marriage, Beatrice and Henry travelled only to make short visits with his family.&lt;ref name=Dennison179&gt;Dennison, p. 179&lt;/ref&gt; Beatrice's love for Henry, like that of the Queen's for the Prince Consort, seemed to increase the longer they were married.&lt;ref name=Dennison180&gt;Dennison, p. 180&lt;/ref&gt;  When Henry travelled without Beatrice, she appeared happier when he returned.&lt;ref name=Dennison180&gt;Dennison, p. 180&lt;/ref&gt;

The addition of Prince Henry to the family gave new reasons for Beatrice and the Queen to look forward, and the court was brighter than it had been since the Prince Consort's death.&lt;ref name=Dennison171&gt;Dennison, p. 171&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, Henry, supported by Beatrice, was determined to take part in military campaigns, and this annoyed the Queen, who opposed his participation in life-threatening warfare.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennison190&quot;/&gt; Conflicts also arose when Henry attended the [[Ajaccio]] carnival and kept &quot;low company&quot;,&lt;ref name=Dennison186&gt;Dennison, p. 186&lt;/ref&gt; and Beatrice sent a [[Royal Navy]] officer to remove him from temptation.&lt;ref name=Dennison186&gt;Dennison, p. 186&lt;/ref&gt; On one occasion, Henry slipped away to [[Corsica]] with his brother [[Prince Louis of Battenberg|Louis]];&lt;ref name=Purdue/&gt; the Queen sent a warship to bring him back.&lt;ref name=Purdue/&gt; Henry was feeling continually oppressed by Victoria's constant need for his and his wife's company.&lt;ref&gt;Dennison, pp. 185–186&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite being married, Beatrice fulfilled her promise to the Queen by continuing as her full-time confidante and secretary. Victoria warmed to Henry, as she often did with other handsome, strong men.&lt;ref&gt;Bolitho, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Queen criticised Beatrice's conduct during her first pregnancy. When Beatrice stopped coming to the Queen's dinners a week before giving birth, preferring to eat alone in her room, the Queen wrote angrily to her [[physician]], Dr James Reid, that, &quot;I [urged the Princess] coming to dinner, and not simply moping in her own room, which is very bad for her. In my case I regularly came to dinner, except when I was really unwell (even when suffering a great deal) up to the very last day.&quot;&lt;ref name=Dennison164&gt;Quoted in Dennison, p. 164&lt;/ref&gt; Beatrice, aided by [[chloroform#As an anesthetic|chloroform]], gave birth the following week to her first son, [[Alexander Mountbatten, 1st Marquess of Carisbrooke|Alexander]].&lt;ref name=Dennison164/&gt;

In addition to having a [[miscarriage]] in the early months of her marriage,&lt;ref&gt;Dennison, p. 161&lt;/ref&gt; Beatrice gave birth to four children: [[Alexander Mountbatten, 1st Marquess of Carisbrooke|Alexander]], called &quot;Drino&quot;, was born in 1886; [[Victoria Eugenia of Battenberg|Ena]] in 1887; [[Lord Leopold Mountbatten|Leopold]] in 1889 and [[Prince Maurice of Battenberg|Maurice]] in 1891. Following this, Beatrice took a polite and encouraging interest in social issues, such as conditions in the coal mines.  However, this interest did not extend to changing the conditions of poverty, as it had done with her brother, the Prince of Wales.&lt;ref name=Dennison171&gt;Dennison, p. 171&lt;/ref&gt;

Although court entertainments were few after the Prince Consort's death, Beatrice and the Queen enjoyed [[tableau vivant]] photography, which was often performed at the royal residences.&lt;ref name=Dennison171&gt;Dennison, p. 171&lt;/ref&gt; Henry, increasingly bored by the lack of activity at court, longed for employment, and in response, the Queen made him [[Governor of the Isle of Wight]] in 1889.&lt;ref name=Purdue/&gt; However, he yearned for military adventure and pleaded with his mother-in-law to let him join the Ashanti expedition fighting in the [[Ashanti Empire#Fourth Anglo-Ashanti War|Anglo-Asante war]]. Despite misgivings, the Queen consented, and Henry and Beatrice parted on 6 December 1895; they would not meet again. Henry contracted [[malaria]] and was sent home. On 22 January 1896, Beatrice, who was waiting for her husband at [[Madeira]], received a telegram informing her of Henry's death two days earlier.&lt;ref name=Dennison190&gt;Dennison, p. 190&lt;/ref&gt; Devastated, she left court for a month of mourning before returning to her post at her mother's side.&lt;ref name=Dennison190&gt;Dennison, p. 190&lt;/ref&gt; The Queen's journal reports that Victoria &quot;[w]ent over to Beatrice's room and sat a while with her. She is so piteous in her misery.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Dennison, p. 192&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite her grief, Beatrice remained her mother's faithful companion,&lt;ref name=Dennison190&gt;Dennison, p. 190&lt;/ref&gt; and as Victoria aged, she relied more heavily on Beatrice for dealing with correspondence. However, realising that Beatrice needed a place of her own, she gave her the [[Kensington Palace]] apartments once occupied by the Queen and her mother.&lt;ref&gt;Dennison, p. 203&lt;/ref&gt; In response to Beatrice's interest in photography, the Queen had a [[darkroom]] installed at Osborne House.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennison, p. 204&quot;/&gt; The changes in the family, including Beatrice's preoccupation with her mother, may have affected her children, who rebelled at school. It was discovered that the children's [[governess]] had been undermining the love and trust they had in their mother.&lt;ref name=Dennison211212&gt;Dennison, pp. 210–212&lt;/ref&gt; Beatrice also wrote that Ena was &quot;troublesome and rebellious&quot;, and that Alexander was telling &quot;unwarrantable untruths&quot;.&lt;ref name=Dennison211212&gt;Dennison, pp. 210–212&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
[[Image:Princess Beatrice mourning with Queen Victoria.jpg|right|thumb|Princess Beatrice with her mother, Queen Victoria]]
Beatrice's life was overturned by the death of Queen Victoria on 22 January 1901. She wrote to the Principal of the [[University of Glasgow]] in March, &quot;... you may imagine what the grief is. I, who had hardly ever been separated from my dear mother, can hardly realise what life will be like without her, who was the centre of everything.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Dennison, p. 213&lt;/ref&gt; Beatrice's public appearances continued, but her position at court was diminished. She, unlike her sister Louise, was not close to her brother, now [[Edward VII|King Edward VII]], and was not included in the King's inner circle.&lt;ref name=Dennison233&gt;Dennison, pp. 233–234&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, though their relationship did not break down completely, it was occasionally strained, for example when she accidentally (but noisily) dropped her service book from the royal gallery onto a table of gold plate during his coronation.&lt;ref name=Dennison233&gt;Dennison, pp. 233–234&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

After inheriting Osborne, the King had his mother's personal photographs and belongings removed and some of them destroyed, especially material relating to [[John Brown (servant)|John Brown]], whom he detested.&lt;ref&gt;Magnus, p. 290&lt;/ref&gt; Victoria had intended the house to be a private, secluded residence for her descendants, away from the pomp and ceremony of mainland life.&lt;ref name=Benson302&gt;Benson, p. 302&lt;/ref&gt; However, the new King had no need for the house and consulted his lawyers about disposing of it, transforming the main wing into a convalescent home, opening the state apartments to the public, and constructing a Naval College on the grounds.&lt;ref name=Benson302&gt;Benson, p. 302&lt;/ref&gt; His plans met with strong disapproval from Beatrice and Louise. Victoria had bequeathed them houses on the estate, and the privacy promised to them by their mother was threatened. When Edward discussed the fate of the house with them, Beatrice argued against allowing the house to leave the family, citing its importance to their parents.&lt;ref name=Benson302&gt;Benson, p. 302&lt;/ref&gt; However, the King did not want the house himself, and he offered it to his heir-apparent, Beatrice's nephew [[George V|George]], who declined, objecting to the high cost of maintenance. Edward subsequently extended the grounds of Beatrice's home, Osborne Cottage, to compensate her for the impending loss of her privacy. Shortly afterwards, the King declared to [[Arthur Balfour]], the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], that the main house would go to the nation as a gift. An exception was made for the private apartments, which were closed to all but the royal family members, who made it a shrine to their mother's memory.&lt;ref&gt;Dennison, pp. 225–228&lt;/ref&gt;

===Victoria's journals===
Upon Victoria's death, Beatrice began the momentous task of transcribing and editing Victoria's journals, which had been kept since 1831. The hundreds of volumes contained the Queen's personal views of the day-to-day business of her life and included personal and family matters as well as matters of state.&lt;ref name=Royal1&gt;{{cite web

Victoria had given Beatrice the task of editing the journals for publication, which meant removing private material as well as passages that, if published, might be hurtful to living people. Beatrice deleted so much material that the edited journals are only a third as long as the originals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Royal1&quot;/&gt; The destruction of such large passages of Victoria's diaries distressed Beatrice's nephew, [[George V|King George V]], and his wife [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]], who were powerless to intervene.&lt;ref name=Magnus&gt;Magnus, p. 461&lt;/ref&gt; Beatrice copied a draft from the original and then copied her draft into a set of blue notebooks. Both the originals and her first drafts were destroyed as she progressed.&lt;ref name=Magnus&gt;Magnus, p. 461&lt;/ref&gt; The task took thirty years and was finished in 1931. The surviving blue notebooks are kept in the [[Royal Archives]] at [[Windsor Castle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Retirement from public life===
Beatrice continued to appear in public after her mother's death. The public engagements she carried out were often related to her mother, Victoria, as the public had always associated Beatrice with the deceased monarch.&lt;ref&gt;Dennison, p. 215&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:1891 Maurice-04.JPG|left|thumb|[[Prince Maurice of Battenberg]]. After his death during the [[World War I|First World War]], Beatrice began to retire from public life.]]
The beauty of Beatrice's daughter, [[Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg|Ena]], was known throughout Europe, and, despite her low rank, she was a desirable bride.&lt;ref name=Noel&gt;Noel, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&lt;/ref&gt; Her chosen suitor was King [[Alphonso XIII of Spain]]. However, the marriage caused controversy in Britain, since it required Ena to convert to [[Catholicism]].&lt;ref&gt;Lee, p. 513&lt;/ref&gt; This step was opposed by Beatrice's brother, [[Edward VII|King Edward VII]], and Spanish ultra-conservatives were against the King's marriage to a Protestant of low birth.&lt;ref name=Noel/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Because Prince Henry, Ena's father, was the son of a [[morganatic marriage]], they considered Ena to be only partly royal and thus unfit to be Queen of Spain.&lt;/ref&gt;
Nevertheless, Alphonso and Ena were married on 31 May 1906. The marriage began inauspiciously when an anarchist attempted to bomb them on their wedding day.&lt;ref name=Noel/&gt;  Apparently close at first, the couple grew apart. Ena became unpopular in Spain and grew more so when it was discovered that her son, the heir to the throne, suffered from [[haemophilia]].&lt;ref&gt;Noel (Spain's English Queen), p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; Alphonso blamed Beatrice for bringing the [[Haemophilia in European royalty|royal disease]] to the Spanish royal house and turned bitterly against Ena.&lt;ref name=Noel/&gt;

During her time as Queen of Spain, Ena returned many times to visit her mother in Britain, but always without Alphonso and usually without her children.

Meanwhile, Beatrice lived at Osborne Cottage and [[Carisbrooke Castle]], home of the [[Governor of the Isle of Wight]]. (Victoria had made Beatrice governor after Prince Henry died.)&lt;ref name=Purdue/&gt; In time, Beatrice chose to abandon Osborne Cottage and, against the wishes of her nephew, George V, sold it in 1912.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; She moved into Carisbrooke Castle whilst keeping an apartment at [[Kensington Palace]] in London. She had been much involved in collecting material for the Carisbrooke Castle museum, which she opened in 1898.&lt;ref name=IWB&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

Her presence at court further decreased as she aged. Devastated by the death of her favourite son, [[Prince Maurice of Battenberg|Maurice]], during the [[World War I|First World War]] in 1914, she began to retire from public life.&lt;ref&gt;Dennison, p. 245&lt;/ref&gt; In response to war with Germany, George V changed the family surname from [[Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]] to [[House of Windsor|Windsor]] to downplay their German origins. Subsequently, Beatrice and her family renounced their German names; Beatrice's [[Style (manner of address)|style]] reverted from ''HRH Princess Henry of Battenberg'' to her birth style, ''HRH The Princess Beatrice''. Her surname was also anglicised to Mountbatten.&lt;ref&gt;As a royal princess, Beatrice did not use a surname, but when one was used it was Battenberg (1896–1917) and then Mountbatten (1917–1944)&lt;/ref&gt; Her sons gave up their courtesy style, ''Prince of Battenberg''.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=30374|startpage=11593|date=14 July 1914|accessdate=11 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Alexander, the eldest, became [[Alexander Mountbatten, 1st Marquess of Carisbrooke|Sir Alexander Mountbatten]] and was later given the title [[Marquess of Carisbrooke]] in the [[Peerage of the United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=30374|startpage=11594|date=7 November 1914|accessdate=11 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her younger son, Leopold, became [[Lord Leopold Mountbatten]] and was given the rank of a younger son of a marquess.&lt;ref name=Purdue/&gt;  He was a haemophiliac, having inherited the &quot;royal disease&quot; from his mother, and died during a knee operation in 1922 one month short of his 33rd birthday.

Following the war, Beatrice was one of several members of the royal family who became patrons of [[The Ypres League]], a society founded for veterans of the [[Ypres Salient]] and bereaved relatives of those killed in fighting in the Salient.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aftermath&quot;&gt;[http://www.aftermathww1.com/ypresl.asp The Ypres League], Aftermath – when the boys came home, accessed 16/01/2010&lt;/ref&gt; She was herself a bereaved mother, as her son, Prince Maurice of Battenberg, had been killed in action during the [[First Battle of Ypres]]. Her rare public appearances after her son's death included commemorations of these events, including her laying of wreaths at the [[Cenotaph]] in 1930 and 1935 to mark the 10th and 15th anniversaries of the founding of the League.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.google.co.uk/newspapers?id=0nAhAAAAIBAJ&amp;&amp;pg=1135,1596208 To celebrate the tenth anniversary&amp;nbsp;...], ''[[Reading Eagle]]'', 9 December 1930, page 10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gettyimages.co.uk/detail/3294671/Hulton-Archive?language=en-GB&amp;location=GBR Beatrice Lays Wreath], Getty Images, image number 3294671, from the Hulton Archive, accessed 16/01/2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Last years===
Even in her seventies, Beatrice continued to correspond with her friends and relatives and to make rare public appearances, such as when, pushed in a wheelchair, she viewed the wreaths laid after the death of George V in 1936.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video

Entitled &quot;In Napoleonic Days&quot;, it was the personal diary of Queen Victoria's maternal grandmother, [[Augusta Reuss-Ebersdorf|Augusta, Duchess of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld]]. She corresponded with the publisher, [[John Murray (publisher)|John Murray]], who greatly approved of the work.&lt;ref&gt;Dennison, p. 262&lt;/ref&gt; She made her last home at [[Brantridge Park]] in [[West Sussex]], which was owned by Queen Mary's brother, [[Alexander Cambridge, 1st Earl of Athlone|Alexander Cambridge]], the first [[Earl of Athlone]], and his wife, [[Princess Alice, Countess of Athlone|Princess Alice of Albany]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

There, Beatrice died peacefully in her sleep on 26 October 1944, aged eighty-seven.&lt;ref name=Purdue/&gt; After her funeral service in St George's Chapel, [[Windsor Castle]], her coffin was placed in the royal vault on 3 November.

&lt;/ref&gt; Beatrice's final wish, to be buried with her husband on the island most familiar to her, was fulfilled in a private service at Whippingham attended only by her son, the Marquess of Carisbrooke, and his wife.&lt;ref name=&quot;IWB&quot;/&gt;

Beatrice was the shyest of all Victoria's children. However, because she accompanied Victoria almost wherever she went, she became among the best known.&lt;ref&gt;Dennison, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; Despite her shyness, she was an able actress and dancer as well as a keen artist and photographer.&lt;ref&gt;Dennison: (dancing) pp. 44, 53; (acting) 174–175; (musician) 232–233; (photographer) 121–122&lt;/ref&gt; She was devoted to her children and was concerned when they misbehaved at school. To those who enjoyed her friendship, she was loyal and had a sense of humour,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; and as a public figure she was driven by a strong sense of duty.&lt;ref&gt;Dennison, p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; Music, a passion that was shared by her mother and the Prince Consort, was something in which Beatrice excelled, and she played the piano to professional standards.&lt;ref&gt;Dennison, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; Like her mother, she was a devout [[Christianity|Christian]], fascinated by [[theology]] until her death.&lt;ref&gt;Dennison, pp. 84–85&lt;/ref&gt; With her calm temperament and personal warmth, the princess won wide approval.&lt;ref&gt;Dennison, p. 193&lt;/ref&gt;

The demands made on Beatrice during her mother's reign were high. Despite suffering from [[rheumatism]], Beatrice was forced to endure her mother's love of cold weather.&lt;ref name=Dennison110&gt;Dennison, p. 110&lt;/ref&gt; Beatrice's piano playing suffered as her rheumatism got gradually worse, eliminating an enjoyment in which she excelled; however, this did not change her willingness to cater to her mother's needs.&lt;ref name=Dennison110&gt;Dennison, p. 110&lt;/ref&gt; Her effort did not go unnoticed by the British public. In 1886, when she agreed to open the Show of the Royal Horticultural Society of Southampton, the organisers sent her a [[proclamation]] of thanks, expressing their &quot;admiration of the affectionate manner in which you have comforted and assisted your widowed mother our Gracious Sovereign the Queen&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

May those blessings which it has hitherto been your constant aim to confer on others now be returned in full measure to yourself.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'' newspaper, 29 July 1885&lt;/ref&gt; The sentence was, as far as it dared, criticising the Queen's hold over her daughter.&lt;ref name=Dennison134&gt;Dennison, p. 134&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the buildings with which Beatrice would have been familiar, continue to be regularly used by the royal family: [[Buckingham Palace]], [[Windsor Castle]], [[Balmoral Castle]], and [[Kensington Palace]]. [[Brantridge Park]], where she died, is a minor royal residence and seldom used. [[Osborne House]], her mother's favourite home, is accessible to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
