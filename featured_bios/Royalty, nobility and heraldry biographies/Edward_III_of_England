'''Edward III''' (13 November 1312 – 21 June 1377) was [[List of English monarchs|King of England]] from 1327 until his death and is noted for his military success. Restoring royal authority after the disastrous reign of his father, [[Edward II of England|Edward&amp;nbsp;II]], Edward&amp;nbsp;III went on to transform the [[Kingdom of England]] into one of the most formidable military powers in Europe. His reign saw vital developments in legislation and government&amp;mdash;in particular the evolution of the English parliament&amp;mdash;as well as the ravages of the [[Black Death]]. He remains one of only [[List of longest-reigning British monarchs|five monarchs]] to have ruled England or its [[Succession of states|successor kingdoms]] for more than fifty years.

Edward was crowned at the age of fourteen, following the [[deposition (politics)|deposition]] of his father. When he was only seventeen years old, he led a coup against the ''de facto'' ruler of the country, his mother's consort [[Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March|Roger Mortimer]], and began his personal reign. After a successful campaign in [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]] in 1333, he declared himself rightful heir to the French throne in 1337,&lt;ref&gt;Edward first styled himself &quot;King of France&quot; in 1337, though he did not officially assume the title until 1340; Prestwich (2005), pp. 307–8.&lt;/ref&gt; starting what would become known as the [[Hundred Years' War]]. Following some initial setbacks, the war went exceptionally well for England; the victories of [[Battle of Crécy|Crécy]] and [[Battle of Poitiers (1356)|Poitiers]] led to the highly favourable [[Treaty of Brétigny]]. Edward's later years, however, were marked by international failure and domestic strife, largely as a result of his inactivity and bad health.

Edward&amp;nbsp;III was a temperamental man, but also capable of unusual clemency. He was in many ways a conventional king, whose main interest was warfare. Admired in his own time and for centuries after, Edward was denounced as an irresponsible adventurer by later [[Whig history|Whig historians]] such as [[William Stubbs]]. This view has been challenged recently, and modern [[historiography]] credits him with some significant achievements.&lt;ref&gt;Mortimer (2006), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

===Early life===
[[File:Edward III Groat.jpg|thumb|left|[[Groat (coin)|Groat]] featuring Edward III]]
Edward was born at [[Windsor Castle]] on 13&amp;nbsp;November 1312, and was often referred to as '''Edward of Windsor''' in his early years.&lt;ref&gt;Mortimer (2006), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; The reign of his father, [[Edward II of England|Edward&amp;nbsp;II]], was a particularly problematic period of English history.&lt;ref&gt;For an account of the political conflicts of Edward II's early years, see: {{cite book|first=J.R.|last=Maddicot|authorlink=John Maddicott|title=Thomas of Lancaster, 1307–1322|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|year=1970|isbn=0-19-821837-0|oclc=132766}}&lt;/ref&gt; One source of contention was the king's inactivity, and repeated failure, in the ongoing [[First War of Scottish Independence|war with Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;Tuck (1985), p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; Another controversial issue was the king's exclusive [[patronage]] of a small group of royal [[favourite]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Prestwich (1980), p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; The birth of a male heir in 1312 temporarily improved Edward&amp;nbsp;II's position in relation to the baronial opposition.&lt;ref&gt;Prestwich (2005), p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt; To further bolster the independent prestige of the young prince, the king had him created [[Earl of Chester]] at only twelve days of age.&lt;ref&gt;Mortimer (2006), p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1325, Edward&amp;nbsp;II was faced with a demand from the French king, [[Charles IV of France|Charles&amp;nbsp;IV]], to perform [[Homage (feudal)|homage]] for the English [[Duchy of Aquitaine]].&lt;ref&gt;Tuck (1985), p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; Edward was reluctant to leave the country, as discontent was once again brewing domestically, particularly over his relationship with the favourite [[Hugh Despenser the Younger]].&lt;ref&gt;For an account of Edward II's later years, see: {{cite book|first=N.M.|last=Fryde|title=The tyranny and fall of Edward II, 1321-1326|isbn=0-521-54806-3|year=1979|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=MekRPcFKOHAC }}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, he had his son Edward created Earl of Aquitaine in his place and sent him to France to perform the homage.&lt;ref&gt;Mortimer (2006), p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; The young Edward was accompanied by his mother [[Isabella of France|Isabella]], who was the sister of King Charles, and was meant to negotiate a peace treaty with the French.&lt;ref&gt;Prestwich (2005), p. 213.&lt;/ref&gt; While in France, however, Isabella conspired with the exiled [[Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March|Roger Mortimer]] to have the king deposed.&lt;ref&gt;Prestwich (2005), p. 216.&lt;/ref&gt; To build up diplomatic and military support for the venture, Isabella had Prince Edward engaged to the twelve-year-old [[Philippa of Hainault]].&lt;ref&gt;Mortimer (2006), p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; An invasion of England was launched and Edward&amp;nbsp;II's forces deserted him completely. The king was forced to relinquish the throne to his son, who was crowned as Edward&amp;nbsp;III on 1&amp;nbsp;February 1327.&lt;ref&gt;Mortimer (2006), p. 54. The later fate of Edward&amp;nbsp;II has been a source of much scholarly debate. For a summary of the evidence, see: Mortimer (2006), pp. 405–10&lt;/ref&gt;

It was not long before the new reign also met with other problems caused by the central position at court of Roger Mortimer, who was now the ''[[de facto]]'' ruler of England. Mortimer used his power to acquire noble estates and titles, and his unpopularity grew with the humiliation at [[Battle of Stanhope Park|Stanhope Park]] and the ensuing [[Treaty of Edinburgh–Northampton]], signed with the Scots in 1328.&lt;ref&gt;McKisack (1959), pp. 98–100.&lt;/ref&gt; Also the young king came into conflict with his guardian. Mortimer knew his position in relation to the king was precarious and subjected Edward to disrespect and humiliation. The tension increased after Edward and Philippa, who had married on 24&amp;nbsp;January 1328, [[Edward, the Black Prince|had a son]] on 15&amp;nbsp;June 1330.&lt;ref&gt;Mortimer (2006), pp. 67, 81.&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, Edward decided to take direct action against Mortimer. Aided by his close companion [[William Montagu, 1st Earl of Salisbury|William Montagu]] and a small number of other trusted men, Edward took Mortimer by surprise at [[Nottingham Castle]] on 19&amp;nbsp;October 1330. Mortimer was executed and Edward&amp;nbsp;III’s personal reign began.&lt;ref&gt;Prestwich (2005), pp. 223–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early reign===
Edward&amp;nbsp;III was not content with the peace agreement made in his name, but the renewal of the war with Scotland originated in private, rather than royal initiative. A group of English [[magnate]]s known as The Disinherited, who had lost land in Scotland by the peace accord, staged an invasion of Scotland and won a great victory at the [[Battle of Dupplin Moor]] in 1332.&lt;ref&gt;Preswich (2205), p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt; They attempted to install [[Edward Balliol]] as king of Scotland in [[David II of Scotland|David&amp;nbsp;II]]'s place, but Balliol was soon expelled and was forced to seek the help of Edward&amp;nbsp;III. The English king responded by laying siege to the important border town of [[Berwick-upon-Tweed|Berwick]] and defeated a large relieving army at the [[Battle of Halidon Hill]].&lt;ref&gt;DeVries (1996), pp. 114–5.&lt;/ref&gt; Edward reinstated Balliol on the throne and received a substantial amount of land in southern Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;Preswich (2205), pp. 244–5.&lt;/ref&gt; These victories proved hard to sustain, however, as forces loyal to David&amp;nbsp;II gradually regained control of the country. In 1338, Edward was forced to agree to a truce with the Scots.&lt;ref name=Ormrod21&gt;Ormrod (1990), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Royal Arms of England (1340-1367).svg|thumb|upright|left|alt=Coat of arms with three lions, gold on red, in two quarter, fleurs de lys, gold on blue, in two.|To mark his claim on the French crown, Edward III [[Quartering (heraldry)|quartered]] the [[Royal Arms of England|three lions]] of England with the [[fleurs de lys]] of France in his royal arms in 1340.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Maclagan|first=Michael |authorlink=Michael Maclagan|coauthors=Louda, Jiří|title=Line of Succession: Heraldry of the Royal Families of Europe|year=1981|publisher=Macdonald &amp; Co|location= London|isbn=0-85613-276-4|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
One reason for the change of strategy towards Scotland was a growing concern for the relationship between England and France. As long as Scotland and France were in [[Auld Alliance|an alliance]], the English were faced with the prospect of fighting a war on two fronts.&lt;ref&gt;McKisack (1959), pp. 117–9.&lt;/ref&gt; The French carried out raids on English coastal towns, leading to rumours in England of a full-scale French invasion.&lt;ref name=Ormrod21/&gt; In 1337, [[Philip VI of France|Philip&amp;nbsp;VI]] confiscated the English king's duchy of [[Aquitaine]] and the county of [[Ponthieu]]. Instead of seeking a peaceful resolution to the conflict by paying homage to the French king, the way his father had done, Edward responded by [[English claims to the French throne|laying claim]] to the French crown as the grandson of [[Philip IV of France|Philip&amp;nbsp;IV]].&lt;ref&gt;Edward did not officially assume the title &quot;King of England and France&quot; until 1340; Ormrod (1990), pp. 21–2.&lt;/ref&gt; The French, however, invoked the [[Salic law]] of succession and rejected his claim. Instead, they upheld the rights of Philip&amp;nbsp;IV's nephew, King Philip&amp;nbsp;VI (an agnatic descendant of the [[Capetian dynasty|House of France]]), thereby setting the stage for the [[Hundred Years' War]] ([[Edward III of England#Family tree|see family tree below]]).&lt;ref&gt;Sumption (1999), p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early stages of the war, Edward's strategy was to build alliances with other Continental princes. In 1338, [[Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Louis&amp;nbsp;IV]] named Edward vicar-general of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and promised his support.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers (2000), p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt; These measures, however, produced few results; the only major military victory in this phase of the war was the English naval victory at [[Battle of Sluys|Sluys]] on 24&amp;nbsp;June 1340, which secured English control of the [[English Channel|Channel]].&lt;ref&gt;McKisack (1959), pp. 128–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, the fiscal pressure on the kingdom caused by Edward's expensive alliances led to discontent at home. The regency council at home was frustrated by the mounting national debt, while the king and his commanders on the Continent were angered by the government in England's failure to provide sufficient funds.&lt;ref&gt;Prestwich (2005), pp. 273–5.&lt;/ref&gt; To deal with the situation, Edward himself returned to England, arriving in London unannounced on 30&amp;nbsp;November 1340.&lt;ref&gt;McKisack (1959), p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt; Finding the affairs of the realm in disorder, he purged the royal administration of a great number of ministers and judges.&lt;ref&gt;Fryde (1975), pp. 149–61.&lt;/ref&gt; These measures did not bring domestic stability, however, and a stand-off ensued between the king and [[John de Stratford]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. Stratford claimed that Edward had violated the laws of the land by arresting royal officers.&lt;ref&gt;Prestwich (2005), pp. 275–6.&lt;/ref&gt; A certain level of conciliation was reached at the parliament of April 1341. Here Edward was forced to accept severe limitations to his financial and administrative freedom, in return for a grant of taxation.&lt;ref&gt;McKisack (1959), pp. 174–5.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet in October the same year, the king repudiated this statute and Archbishop Stratford was politically ostracised. The extraordinary circumstances of the April parliament had forced the king into submission, but under normal circumstances the powers of the king in medieval England were virtually unlimited, a fact that Edward was able to exploit.&lt;ref&gt;Ormrod (1990), p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rodger called Edward III's own claim to be the &quot;Sovereign of the Seas&quot; into
question, arguing there was hardly any Royal Navy before the reign of Henry V (1413–22). Rodger also argues that for much of the fourteenth century, the French had the upper hand, apart from Sluys in 1340 and, perhaps, off Winchelsea in 1350.&lt;ref&gt;N. A. M. Rodger, ''The Safeguard of the Sea'' (1997) p 99&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fortunes of war===
By the early 1340s, it was clear that Edward's policy of alliances was too costly, and yielded too few results, to be continued. The following years saw more direct involvement by English armies, including in the [[Breton War of Succession]], but these interventions also proved fruitless at first.&lt;ref&gt;Mortimer (2006), p. 205. The main exception was [[Henry of Grosmont, 1st Duke of Lancaster|Henry of Lancaster]]'s victory in the [[Battle of Auberoche]] in 1345; Fowler (1969), pp. 58–9.&lt;/ref&gt; A major change came in July 1346, when Edward staged a major offensive, sailing for [[Normandy]] with a force of 15,000 men.&lt;ref&gt;McKisack (1959), p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; His army [[Battle of Caen (1346)|sacked]] the city of [[Caen]], and marched across northern France, to meet up with English forces in [[County of Flanders|Flanders]]. It was not Edward's initial intention to engage the French army, but at [[Crécy-en-Ponthieu|Crécy]], just north of the [[Somme (river)|Somme]], he found favourable terrain and decided to fight an army led by Philip VI.&lt;ref&gt;Prestwich (2005), pp. 316–8.&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 August, the English army defeated a far larger French army in the [[Battle of Crécy]].&lt;ref&gt;DeVries (1996), pp. 155–76.&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after this, on 17 October, an English army defeated and captured King David II of Scotland at the [[Battle of Neville's Cross]].&lt;ref&gt;Waugh (1991), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; With his northern borders secured, Edward felt free to continue his major offensive against France, [[Siege of Calais (1346)|laying siege]] to the town of [[Calais]]. The operation was the greatest English venture of the Hundred Years' War, involving an army of 35,000 men.&lt;ref&gt;Ormrod (1990), p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; The siege started on 4 September 1346, and lasted until the town surrendered on 3 August 1347.&lt;ref&gt;Sumption (1999), pp. 537, 581.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Map- France at the Treaty of Bretigny.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Map showing 14th-century France in green, with the southwest and parts of the north in pink.|Map showing the area (in pink) gained by England through the [[Treaty of Brétigny]].]]
After the fall of Calais, factors outside of Edward's control forced him to wind down the war effort. In 1348, the [[Black Death in England|Black Death]] struck England with full force, killing a third or more of the country's population.&lt;ref&gt;For more on the debate over mortality rates, see: {{cite book|first=John|last=Hatcher|authorlink=|title=Plague, Population and the English Economy, 1348-1530|edition=|publisher=Macmillan|location=London|year=1977|pages=11–20|isbn=0-333-21293-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This loss of manpower led to a shortage of farm labour, and a corresponding rise in wages. The great landowners struggled with the shortage of manpower and the resulting inflation in labour cost.&lt;ref&gt;Waugh (1991), p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; To curb the rise in wages, the king and parliament responded with the [[Ordinance of Labourers]] in 1349, followed by the [[Statute of Labourers of 1351|Statute of Labourers]] in 1351. These attempts to regulate wages could not succeed in the long run, but in the short term they were enforced with great vigour.&lt;ref&gt;Prestwich (2005), pp. 547–8.&lt;/ref&gt; All in all, the plague did not lead to a full-scale breakdown of government and society, and recovery was remarkably swift.&lt;ref&gt;Prestwich (2005), p. 553.&lt;/ref&gt; This was to a large extent thanks to the competent leadership of royal administrators such as [[Lord High Treasurer|Treasurer]] [[William de Shareshull]] and [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales|Chief Justice]] [[William Edington]].&lt;ref&gt;Ormrod (1986), pp. 175–88.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was not until the mid-1350s that military operations on the Continent were resumed on a large scale.&lt;ref&gt;Prestwich (2005), p. 550.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1356, Edward's oldest son, [[Edward, the Black Prince]], won an important victory in the [[Battle of Poitiers (1356)|Battle of Poitiers]]. The greatly outnumbered English forces not only routed the French, but captured the French king, [[John II of France|John II]].&lt;ref&gt;McKisack (1959), p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt; After a succession of victories, the English held great possessions in France, the French king was in English custody, and the French central government had almost totally collapsed.&lt;ref&gt;McKisack (1959), pp. 139–40.&lt;/ref&gt; There has been a historical debate as to whether Edward's claim to the French crown originally was genuine, or if it was simply a political ploy meant to put pressure on the French government.&lt;ref&gt;For a summary of the debate, see: Prestwich (2005), pp. 307–10.&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of the original intent, the stated claim now seemed to be within reach. Yet a campaign in 1359, meant to complete the undertaking, was inconclusive.&lt;ref&gt;Prestwich (2005), p. 326.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1360, therefore, Edward accepted the [[Treaty of Brétigny]], whereby he renounced his claims to the French throne, but secured his extended French possessions in full sovereignty.&lt;ref&gt;Ormrod (1990), pp. 39–40.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later reign===
While Edward's early reign had been energetic and successful, his later years were marked by inertia, military failure and political strife. The day-to-day affairs of the state had less appeal to Edward than military campaigning, so during the 1360s Edward increasingly relied on the help of his subordinates, in particular [[William of Wykeham|William Wykeham]].&lt;ref&gt;For more on Wykeham, see: {{cite book|last=Davis|first=Virginia|title=William Wykeham|year=2007|publisher=Hambledon Continuum|isbn=978-1-84725-172-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; A relative upstart, Wykeham was made [[Lord Privy Seal|Keeper of the Privy Seal]] in 1363 and [[Lord Chancellor|Chancellor]] in 1367, though due to political difficulties connected with his inexperience, the Parliament forced him to resign the chancellorship in 1371.&lt;ref&gt;Ormrod (1990), pp. 90–4.&lt;/ref&gt; Compounding Edward's difficulties were the deaths of his most trusted men, some from the 1361–62 recurrence of the plague. [[William Montagu, 1st Earl of Salisbury|William Montague, Earl of Salisbury]], Edward's companion in the 1330 coup, died as early as 1344. [[William de Clinton, 1st Earl of Huntingdon|William de Clinton]], who had also been with the king at Nottingham, died in 1354. One of the earls created in 1337, [[William de Bohun, 1st Earl of Northampton|William de Bohun, Earl of Northampton]], died in 1360, and the next year [[Henry of Grosmont, 1st Duke of Lancaster|Henry of Grosmont]], perhaps the greatest of Edward's captains, succumbed to what was probably plague.&lt;ref&gt;Fowler (1969), pp. 217–8.&lt;/ref&gt; Their deaths left the majority of the magnates younger and more naturally aligned to the princes than to the king himself.&lt;ref&gt;Ormrod (1990), pp. 127–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Edward III Black Prince 14thc.jpg|thumb|200px|King Edward III grants Aquitaine to his son [[Edward, the Black Prince]]. Initial letter &quot;E&quot; of miniature, 1390; British Library, shelfmark: Cotton MS Nero D VI, f.31]]
Increasingly, Edward began to rely on his sons for the leadership of military operations. The king's second son, [[Lionel of Antwerp, 1st Duke of Clarence|Lionel of Antwerp]], attempted to subdue by force the largely autonomous [[Hiberno-Norman|Anglo-Irish]] lords in [[Ireland]]. The venture failed, and the only lasting mark he left were the suppressive [[Statutes of Kilkenny]] in 1366.&lt;ref&gt;McKisack (1959), p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt; In France, meanwhile, the decade following the Treaty of Brétigny was one of relative tranquillity, but on 8&amp;nbsp;April 1364 [[John II of France|John&amp;nbsp;II]] died in captivity in England, after unsuccessfully trying to raise his own ransom at home.&lt;ref&gt;Tuck (1985), p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt; He was followed by the vigorous [[Charles V of France|Charles&amp;nbsp;V]], who enlisted the help of the capable [[Constable of France|Constable]] [[Bertrand du Guesclin]].&lt;ref&gt;Ormrod (1990), p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1369, the French war started anew, and Edward's younger son [[John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster|John of Gaunt]] was given the responsibility of a military campaign. The effort failed, and with the Treaty of Bruges in 1375, the great English possessions in France were reduced to only the coastal towns of [[Calais]], [[Bordeaux]], and [[Bayonne]].&lt;ref&gt;McKisack (1959), p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt;

Military failure abroad, and the associated fiscal pressure of constant campaigns, led to political discontent at home. The problems came to a head in the parliament of 1376, the so-called [[Good Parliament]]. The parliament was called to grant taxation, but the [[House of Commons of England|House of Commons]] took the opportunity to address specific grievances. In particular, criticism was directed at some of the king's closest advisors. [[Lord Chamberlain|Chamberlain]] [[William Latimer]] and [[Lord Steward|Steward of the Household]] [[John Neville, 3rd Baron Neville de Raby|John Neville]] were dismissed from their positions.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes (1975), p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; Edward's mistress, [[Alice Perrers]], who was seen to hold far too much power over the aging king, was banished from court.&lt;ref&gt;Ormrod (1990), pp. 35–7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McKisack (1959), pp. 387–94.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet the real adversary of the Commons, supported by powerful men such as Wykeham and [[Edmund de Mortimer, 3rd Earl of March|Edmund de Mortimer, Earl of March]], was John of Gaunt. Both the king and the Black Prince were by this time incapacitated by illness, leaving Gaunt in virtual control of government.&lt;ref&gt;Harriss (2006), p. 440.&lt;/ref&gt; Gaunt was forced to give in to the demands of parliament, but at its [[Bad Parliament|next convocation]], in 1377, most of the achievements of the Good Parliament were reversed.&lt;ref&gt;The earlier belief that Gaunt &quot;packed&quot; the 1377 parliament with his own supporters is no longer widely held. See: {{cite journal|last=Wedgwood|first=Josiah C.|year=1930|title=John of Gaunt and the Packing of Parliament|journal=The English Historical Review|volume=XLV|issue=CLXXX|pages=623–625|issn=0013-8266|doi=10.1093/ehr/XLV.CLXXX.623}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Edward himself, however, did not have much to do with any of this; after around 1375 he played a limited role in the government of the realm. Around 29&amp;nbsp;September 1376 he fell ill with a large [[abscess]]. After a brief period of recovery in February 1377, the king died of a stroke at Sheen on 21&amp;nbsp;June.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ormrod 1990, p. 52&quot;&gt;Ormrod (1990), p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; He was succeeded by his ten-year-old grandson, [[Richard II of England|King Richard II]], son of the Black Prince, since the Black Prince himself had died on 8&amp;nbsp;June 1376.&lt;ref&gt;McKisack (1959), pp. 392, 397.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Achievements of the reign==

===Legislation===
The middle years of Edward's reign were a period of significant legislative activity. Perhaps the best-known piece of legislation was the [[Statute of Labourers of 1351]], which addressed the labour shortage problem caused by the [[Black Death]]. The statute fixed wages at their pre-plague level and checked peasant mobility by asserting that lords had first claim on their men's services. In spite of concerted efforts to uphold the statute, it eventually failed due to competition among landowners for labour.&lt;ref&gt;McKisack (1959), p. 335.&lt;/ref&gt; The law has been described as an attempt &quot;to legislate against the law of [[supply and demand]]&quot;, which made it doomed to fail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hanawalt|first=Barbara A.|title=The ties that bound: peasant families in medieval England|date=1989-02-09|publisher=Oxford University Press US|page=139|isbn=978-0-19-504564-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the labour shortage had created a community of interest between the smaller landowners of the House of Commons and the greater landowners of the [[House of Lords]]. The resulting measures angered the peasants, leading to the [[English peasants' revolt of 1381|Peasants' Revolt]] of 1381.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Prestwich|first=M.C.|editor=Cosgrove, Art; McGuire, J.I. (eds.)|title=Parliament &amp; Community: Papers Read before the Irish Conference of Historians, Dublin 27–30 May 1981|year=1983|publisher=Appletree Press|isbn=978-0-904651-93-5|chapter=Parliament and the community of the realm in the fourteenth century|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reign of Edward III coincided with the so-called [[Avignon Papacy|Babylonian Captivity]] of the papacy at [[Avignon]]. During the wars with France, opposition emerged in England against perceived injustices by a papacy largely controlled by the French crown.&lt;ref&gt;McKisack (1959), p. 272.&lt;/ref&gt; Papal taxation of the English Church was suspected to be financing the nation's enemies, while the practice of provisions – the Pope providing benefices for clerics – caused resentment in the English population. The statutes of [[Statute of Provisors|Provisors]] and [[Praemunire]], of 1350 and 1353 respectively, aimed to amend this by banning papal benefices, as well as limiting the power of the papal court over English subjects.&lt;ref&gt;McKisack (1959), pp. 280–1.&lt;/ref&gt; The statutes did not, however, sever the ties between the king and the Pope, who were equally dependent upon each other.&lt;ref&gt;Ormrod (1990), pp. 140–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other legislation of importance includes the [[Treason Act 1351|Treason Act of 1351]]. It was precisely the harmony of the reign that allowed a consensus on the definition of this controversial crime.&lt;ref&gt;McKisack (1959), p. 257.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet the most significant legal reform was probably that concerning the [[Justice of the Peace|Justices of the Peace]]. This institution began before the reign of Edward III but, by 1350, the justices had been given the power not only to investigate crimes and make arrests, but also to try cases, including those of [[felony]].&lt;ref&gt;The pioneering study of this process is: {{cite journal|last=Putnam|first=B.H.|year=1929|title=The Transformation of the Keepers of the Peace into the Justices of the Peace 1327-1380|journal=Transactions of the Royal Historical Society|volume=12|pages=pp. 19–48|issn=00804401|doi=10.2307/3678675}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this, an enduring fixture in the administration of local English justice had been created.&lt;ref&gt;Musson and Omrod (1999), pp. 50–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parliament and taxation===
[[Parliament of England|Parliament]] as a representative institution was already well established by the time of Edward III, but the reign was nevertheless central to its development.&lt;ref&gt;Harriss (2006), p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, membership in the English [[baron]]age, formerly a somewhat indistinct group, became restricted to those who received a personal [[Hereditary peer#Writs of summons|summons]] to parliament.&lt;ref&gt;McKisack (1959), pp. 186–7.&lt;/ref&gt; This happened as parliament gradually developed into a [[Bicameralism|bicameral]] institution, composed of a [[House of Lords]] and a [[House of Commons of England|House of Commons]].&lt;ref&gt;Harriss (2006), p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet it was not in the upper, but in the lower house that the greatest changes took place, with the expanding political role of the Commons.  Informative is the [[Good Parliament]], where the Commons for the first time – albeit with noble support – were responsible for precipitating a political crisis.&lt;ref&gt;Prestwich (1980), p. 288.&lt;/ref&gt; In the process, both the procedure of [[impeachment]] and the office of the [[List of Speakers of the English House of Commons|Speaker]] were created.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fritze|first1=Ronald H.|last2=Robison|first2=William Baxter| title =Historical dictionary of late medieval England, 1272-1485|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=INmdwCSkvIgC&amp;pg=PA409 | accessdate =8 May 2011|year=2002|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-29124-1|page=409}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the political gains were of only temporary duration, this parliament represented a watershed in English political history.

The political influence of the Commons originally lay in their right to grant taxes.&lt;ref&gt;Ormrod (1990), pp. 60–1.&lt;/ref&gt; The financial demands of the Hundred Years' War were enormous, and the king and his ministers tried different methods of covering the expenses. The king had a steady income from [[Crown Estate|crown lands]], and could also take up substantial loans from Italian and domestic financiers.&lt;ref&gt;Brown (1989), pp. 80–4.&lt;/ref&gt; To finance warfare on Edward III's scale, however, the king had to resort to taxation of his subjects. Taxation took two primary forms: [[Tax|levy]] and [[customs]]. The levy was a grant of a proportion of all moveable property, normally a tenth for towns and a fifteenth for farmland. This could produce large sums of money, but each such levy had to be approved by parliament, and the king had to prove the necessity.&lt;ref&gt;Brown (1989), pp. 70–1.&lt;/ref&gt; The customs therefore provided a welcome supplement, as a steady and reliable source of income. An &quot;ancient duty&quot; on the export of wool had existed since 1275. [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] had tried to introduce an additional duty on wool, but this unpopular ''maltolt'', or &quot;unjust exaction&quot;, was soon abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;Harriss (1975), pp. 57, 69.&lt;/ref&gt; Then, from 1336 onwards, a series of schemes aimed at increasing royal revenues from wool export were introduced. After some initial problems and discontent, it was agreed through the [[Statute of the Staple|Ordinance of the Staple]] of 1353 that the new customs should be approved by parliament, though in reality they became permanent.&lt;ref&gt;Brown (1989), pp. 67–9, 226–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the steady taxation of Edward III's reign, parliament – and in particular the Commons – gained political influence. A consensus emerged that in order for a tax to be just, the king had to prove its necessity, it had to be granted by the community of the realm, and it had to be to the benefit of that community.&lt;ref&gt;Harriss (1975), p. 509.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to imposing taxes, parliament would also present [[petition]]s for redress of grievances to the king, most often concerning misgovernment by royal officials.&lt;ref&gt;Prestwich (2005), pp. 282–3.&lt;/ref&gt; This way the system was beneficial for both parties. Through this process the commons, and the community they represented, became increasingly politically aware, and the foundation was laid for the particular English brand of constitutional monarchy.&lt;ref&gt;Harriss (1975), pp. 509–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chivalry and national identity===
[[File:The Great Seal of Edward III.JPG|thumb|upright|alt=Partly ruined black seal, showing Edward III on horseback, in armour and sword raised.|The [[Great Seal of the Realm|Great Seal]] of Edward III.]]
Central to Edward III's policy was reliance on the higher nobility for purposes of war and administration. While his father had regularly been in conflict with a great portion of his peerage, Edward III successfully created a spirit of camaraderie between himself and his greatest subjects.&lt;ref name=Ormrod114&gt;Ormrod (1990), pp. 114–5.&lt;/ref&gt; Both Edward I and Edward II had been limited in their policy towards the nobility, allowing the creation of few new peerages during the sixty years preceding Edward III's reign.&lt;ref&gt;Given-Wilson (1996), pp. 29–31.&lt;/ref&gt; The young king reversed this trend when, in 1337, as a preparation for the imminent war, he created six new [[earl]]s on the same day.&lt;ref&gt;Given-Wilson (1996), pp. 35–6.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, Edward expanded the ranks of the peerage upwards, by introducing the new title of [[duke]] for close relatives of the king.&lt;ref&gt;Prestwich (2005), p. 364.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Edward bolstered the sense of community within this group by the creation of the [[Order of the Garter]], probably in 1348. A plan from 1344 to revive the [[Round Table (Camelot)|Round Table]] of [[King Arthur]] never came to fruition, but the new order carried connotations from this legend by the circular shape of the garter.&lt;ref&gt;Tuck (1985), p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Polydore Vergil]] tells of how the young [[Joan of Kent]], Countess of Salisbury – allegedly the king's favourite at the time – accidentally dropped her [[Garter (stockings)|garter]] at a ball at Calais. King Edward responded to the ensuing ridicule of the crowd by tying the garter around his own knee with the words ''honi soit qui mal y pense'' – shame on him who thinks ill of it.&lt;ref&gt;McKisack (1959), pp. 251–2.&lt;/ref&gt;

This reinforcement of the aristocracy must be seen in conjunction with the war in France, as must the emerging sense of national identity.&lt;ref name=Ormrod114/&gt; Just as the war with Scotland had done, the fear of a French invasion helped strengthen a sense of national unity, and nationalise the aristocracy that had been largely Anglo-French since the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman conquest]]. Since the time of Edward I, popular myth suggested that the French planned to extinguish the [[English language]], and as his grandfather had done, Edward III made the most of this scare.&lt;ref&gt;Prestwich (1980), pp. 209–10.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the English language experienced a strong revival; in 1362, a [[Statute of Pleading]] ordered the English language to be used in law courts,&lt;ref&gt;For the original text, see: {{cite web|url=http://languageandlaw.org/TEXTS/STATS/PLEADING.HTM|title=Statute of Pleading (1362)|work=languageandlaw.org|publisher=[[Loyola Law School]]|accessdate=8 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the year after, Parliament was for the first time opened in English.&lt;ref&gt;McKisack (1959), p. 524.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the vernacular saw a revival as a literary language, through the works of [[William Langland]], [[John Gower]] and especially ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'' by [[Geoffrey Chaucer]].&lt;ref&gt;McKisack (1959), pp. 526–32.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet the extent of this [[Anglicisation]] must not be exaggerated. The statute of 1362 was in fact written in the [[French language]] and had little immediate effect, and parliament was opened in that language as late as 1377.&lt;ref&gt;Prestwich (2005), p. 556.&lt;/ref&gt; The Order of the Garter, though a distinctly English institution, included also foreign members such as [[John V, Duke of Brittany]] and Sir [[Robert de Namur|Robert of Namur]].&lt;ref&gt;McKisack (1959), p. 253.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Prestwich (2005), p. 554.&lt;/ref&gt; Edward III – himself bilingual – viewed himself as legitimate king of both England and France, and could not show preferential treatment for one part of his domains over another.

==Assessment and character==
[[File:King Edward III from NPG.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Early modern half-figure portrait of Edward III in royal garb.|Edward III as he was portrayed in the late 16th century.]]
Edward III enjoyed unprecedented popularity in his own lifetime, and even the troubles of his later reign were never blamed directly on the king himself.&lt;ref&gt;Ormrod (1990), p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; Edward's contemporary [[Jean Froissart]] wrote in his [[Froissart's Chronicles|''Chronicles'']] that &quot;His like had not been seen since the days of King Arthur&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ormrod 1990, p. 52&quot;/&gt; This view persisted for a while but, with time, the image of the king changed. The [[Whig history|Whig]] historians of a later age preferred constitutional reform to foreign conquest and discredited Edward for ignoring his responsibilities to his own nation. In the words of [[William Stubbs|Bishop Stubbs]]:
{{cquote|Edward III was not a statesman, though he possessed some qualifications which might have made him a successful one. He was a warrior; ambitious, unscrupulous, selfish, extravagant and ostentatious. His obligations as a king sat very lightly on him. He felt himself bound by no special duty, either to maintain the theory of royal supremacy or to follow a policy which would benefit his people. Like Richard I, he valued England primarily as a source of supplies.}}
::::::::::::::William Stubbs, ''The Constitutional History of England''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stubbs|first=William|authorlink=William Stubbs|title=The Constitutional History of England|publisher=Clarendon|location=Oxford|year=1880|volume=ii|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Influential as Stubbs was, it was long before this view was challenged. In a 1960 article, titled &quot;Edward III and the Historians&quot;, [[May McKisack]] pointed out the [[Teleology|teleological]] nature of Stubbs' judgement. A medieval king could not be expected to work towards the future ideal of a parliamentary monarchy; rather his role was a pragmatic one—to maintain order and solve problems as they arose. At this, Edward III excelled.&lt;ref&gt;McKisack (1960), pp. 4–5.&lt;/ref&gt; Edward had also been accused of endowing his younger sons too liberally and thereby promoting dynastic strife culminating in the [[Wars of the Roses]]. This claim was rejected by [[K.B. McFarlane]], who argued that this was not only the common policy of the age, but also the best.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McFarlane|first=K.B.|authorlink=K.B. McFarlane|title=England in the Fifteenth Century: Collected Essays|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=WHMENs-CiTAC|accessdate=8 May 2011|year=1981|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-907628-01-9|page=238}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later biographers of the king such as Mark Ormrod and [[Ian Mortimer (historian)|Ian Mortimer]] have followed this historiographical trend. However, the older negative view has not completely disappeared; as recently as 2001, [[Norman Cantor]] described Edward III as an &quot;avaricious and sadistic thug&quot; and a &quot;destructive and merciless force.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cantor|first=Norman|authorlink=Norman Cantor|title=In the Wake of the Plague: The Black Death and the World it Made|year=2002|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=0-06-001434-2|pages=37, 39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From what is known of Edward's character, he could be impulsive and temperamental, as was seen by his actions against Stratford and the ministers in 1340/41.&lt;ref&gt;Prestwich (2005), p. 289.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, he was well known for his clemency; Mortimer's [[Roger de Mortimer, 2nd Earl of March|grandson]] was not only absolved, but came to play an important part in the French wars, and was eventually made a Knight of the Garter.&lt;ref&gt;McKisack (1959), p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt; Both in his religious views and his interests, Edward was a conventional man. His favourite pursuit was the art of war and, in this, he conformed to the medieval notion of good kingship.&lt;ref&gt;Ormrod (1990), p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Prestwich (2005), pp. 290–1.&lt;/ref&gt;  As a warrior he was so successful that one modern military historian has described him as the greatest general in English history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rogers|first=C.J.|year=2002|title=England's Greatest General|journal=MHQ: The Quarterly Journal of Military History|volume=14|issue=4|pages=34–45}}&lt;/ref&gt; He seems to have been unusually devoted to his wife, [[Philippa of Hainault|Queen Philippa]]. Much has been made of Edward's sexual licentiousness, but there is no evidence of any infidelity on the king's part before [[Alice Perrers]] became his lover, and by that time the queen was already terminally ill.&lt;ref&gt;Mortimer (2006), pp. 400–1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Prestwich (1980), p. 241.&lt;/ref&gt; This devotion extended to the rest of the family as well; in contrast to so many of his predecessors, Edward never experienced opposition from any of his five adult sons.&lt;ref&gt;Prestwich (2005), p. 290.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family tree==
Edward's claim on the French throne was based on his descent from King [[Philip IV of France]], through his mother [[Isabella of France|Isabella]]. The following, simplified family tree shows the dynastic background for the [[Hundred Years' War]]:
