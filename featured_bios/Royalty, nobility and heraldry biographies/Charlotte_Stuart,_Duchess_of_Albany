'''Charlotte Stuart''', styled '''Duchess of Albany'''&lt;ref name=peerage&gt;She was given the title in 1783 by her father, [[Charles Edward Stuart]], who claimed to be able to grant [[Peerage of Scotland|Scottish peerages]] by virtue of being ''de jure'' [[King of Scots]]. Neither that claim, nor the title itself, were ever recognised by the British State. Her title was recognised by [[Pope Pius VI]], but not, unlike other [[Jacobite peerage|Jacobite peers]], by [[Louis XVI of France]] or [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold I, Grand Duke of Tuscany]].

Her mother was [[Clementina Walkinshaw]], who was [[mistress (lover)|mistress]] to the Prince from 1752 until 1760. After years of abuse, Clementina left him, taking Charlotte with her. Charlotte spent most of her life in French convents, estranged from a father who refused to make any provision for her. Unable to marry, she herself became a mistress with illegitimate children, taking [[Ferdinand Maximilien Mériadec de Rohan|Ferdinand de Rohan, Archbishop of Bordeaux]], as her lover.

She was finally reconciled with her father in 1784, when he legitimised her and created her Duchess of Albany.&lt;ref name=peerage/&gt; She left her own children with her mother, and became her father's carer and companion in the last years of his life, before dying less than two years after him. Her three children were raised in anonymity; however, as the only grandchildren of the pretender, they have been the subject of Jacobite interest since their lineage was uncovered in the 20th century.

Charlotte Stuart was born on 29 October 1753 at [[Liège (city)|Liège]] to Charles and his mistress Clementina Walkinshaw, whom he had met during the [[Jacobite rising]] of 1745 (when he came to Scotland from France in an attempt to regain by force the thrones of [[England]], [[Scotland]] and [[Ireland]], which had been lost by his grandfather, [[James II of England|James II and VII]], in 1689). Clementina (1720–1802) was the youngest of the ten daughters of John Walkinshaw of Barrowhill (1671–1731).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gdl.cdlr.strath.ac.uk/smihou/smihou099.htm |title=The old country houses of the old Glasgow gentry XCIX. Wolfe's House |accessdate=2007-12-08 |work=Glasgow Digital Library |publisher=University of Strathclyde }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Walkinshaws owned the lands of [[Barrowfield]] and [[Camlachie]], and her father had become a wealthy [[Glasgow]] merchant (founding the textile village of [[Calton, Glasgow|Calton]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;story&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theglasgowstory.com/story.php?id=TGSBH03 |title=Clementina Walkinshaw |accessdate=2007-12-13 |last=Maver |first=Irene |work=The Glasgow Story }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he was also an [[Anglicanism|Episcopalian]] and a Jacobite who had fought for the Prince's father in the rising of 1715, been captured at the [[Battle of Sheriffmuir]], before escaping from [[Stirling Castle]] and fleeing to Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;story&quot;/&gt; In 1717, he had been [[pardon]]ed by the British Government and returned to Glasgow, where his youngest daughter was born probably at Camlachie. However, Clementina was largely educated on the Continent, and later converted to [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;story&quot;/&gt; In 1746, she was living at the home of her uncle [[Sir Hugh Paterson, 2nd Baronet|Sir Hugh Paterson]] at [[Bannockburn]], near [[Stirling]].&lt;ref name=&quot;k186&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Kybert | first = Susan Maclean | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Bonnie Prince Charlie:An Autobiography | publisher = Unwin | year = 1988 | location = London | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-04-440387-9 | page = 186 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Prince came to Sir Hugh's home in early January 1746 where he first met Clementina, and he returned later that month to be nursed by her from what appears to have been a cold. Given that she was living under her uncle's protection, it is not thought the two were lovers at this time.&lt;ref&gt;Kybert, p. 190&lt;/ref&gt;

After the defeat of the Prince's rebellion at [[Battle of Culloden|Culloden]] in April 1746, Charles fled Scotland for [[France]]. In the following years, he had a scandalous affair with his 22-year-old first cousin Louise de [[Duchy of Montbazon|Montbazon]] (who was married to his close friend, and whom he deserted when she became pregnant) and then with the Princess of [[House of La Trémoille|Talmont]], who was in her 40s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Magnus&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Magnusson | first = Magnus | authorlink = Magnus Magnusson | coauthors = | title = Scotland: The Story of a Nation | publisher = HarperCollins | year = 2000 | location = London | pages = 628–29 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-00-4653191-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1752, he heard that Clementina was at [[Dunkirk]] and in some financial difficulties, so he sent 50 [[Louis (coin)|louis d'or]] to help her and then dispatched [[Goring Baronets|Sir Henry Goring]] to entreat her to come to [[Ghent]] and live with him as his mistress. Goring, who described Clementina as a &quot;bad woman&quot;, complained of being used as &quot;no better than a pimp&quot;, and shortly after left Charles's employ.&lt;ref&gt;Letter of June 1752, quoted by Kybert, p. 269&lt;/ref&gt; However, by November 1752, Clementina was living with Charles, and was to remain as his mistress for the following eight years. The couple moved to [[Liège (city)|Liège]] where Charlotte, their only child, was born on 29 October 1753&lt;ref&gt;Kybert, p. 269&lt;/ref&gt; and baptised into the Roman Catholic faith at the church of Sainte Marie-des-Fonts.&lt;ref name=douglas&gt;Douglas, Hugh (2004) [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/28523 &quot;Walkinshaw, Clementine, styled countess of Albestroff (c.1720–1802)&quot;], ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, [[doi:10.1093/ref:odnb/28523]], retrieved 2007-12-14 (subscription required)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Separation from father (1760–1783)==
[[Image:Ritratto di Henry Benedict Marie Clement Edward Stuart, cardinale York.jpg|thumb|130px|left|Cardinal Henry Stuart, Charlotte's uncle&lt;ref&gt;Portrait by [[Anton Raphael Mengs]], 1756 (Musée Fabre, Avignon)&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The relationship between prince and mistress was disastrous. Charles was already a disillusioned, angry alcoholic when they began living together, and he became violent towards, and insanely possessive of, Clementina,&lt;ref name=&quot;Magnus&quot;/&gt; treating her as a &quot;submissive whipping post&quot;.&lt;ref name=Kybert270&gt;Kybert p. 270&lt;/ref&gt; Often away from home on &quot;jaunts&quot;, he seldom referred to his daughter, and when he did, it was as &quot;ye cheild&quot;.&lt;ref name=Kybert270/&gt; During a temporary move to Paris, the Prince's lieutenants record ugly public arguments between the two, and that his drunkenness and temper were damaging his reputation.&lt;ref name=Kybert270/&gt; By 1760, they were in [[Basel]], and Clementina had had enough of Charles's intoxication and their nomadic lifestyle. She contacted his staunchly [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] father, [[James Francis Edward Stuart|James Stuart]] ('the Old Pretender'), and expressed a desire to secure a Catholic education for Charlotte and to retire to a convent.&lt;ref&gt;Kybert, p. 271&lt;/ref&gt; (In 1750, during an incognito visit to London, Charles had nominally disavowed Roman Catholicism for the [[Anglican Church]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Magnus&quot;/&gt;) James agreed to pay her an annuity of 10,000 [[French livre|livres]] and, in July 1760, there is evidence to suggest he aided her escape from the watchful Charles, with the seven year-old Charlotte, to the convent of the Nuns of the Visitation in [[Paris]]. She left a letter for Charles expressing her devotion to him but complaining she had had to flee in fear of her life. A furious Charles circulated descriptions of them both, but it was to no avail.&lt;ref&gt;Kybert, p. 271–2&lt;/ref&gt;

===Appeals from France===
For the next twelve years, Clementina and Charlotte continued to live in various French convents, supported by the 10,000 livre pension granted by James Stuart. Charles never forgave Clementina for depriving him of &quot;ye cheild&quot;, and stubbornly refused to pay anything for their support. On 1 January 1766 James died, but Charles, (now considering himself ''de jure'' Charles III of Scotland, England and Ireland) still refused to make any provision for the two, forcing Clementina, now styling herself &quot;Countess Alberstroff&quot;, to appeal to his brother [[Henry Benedict Stuart|Cardinal Henry Stuart]] for assistance. Henry gave them an allowance of 5,000 livres, but in return extracted a statement from Clementina that she had never been married to Charles – a statement she later tried to retract.&lt;ref&gt;Kybert, p. 282–3&lt;/ref&gt; This lower amount forced them to find cheaper lodgings in the convent of Notre Dame at [[Meaux|Meaux-en-Brie]].&lt;ref name=&quot;heritage&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jacobite.ca/essays/charlotte.htm |title=Charlotte, Duchess of Albany |accessdate=2007-12-08 |last=McFerran |first=Noel S. |date=2003-12-22 |publisher=The Jacobite Heritage }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Louise, Countess d'Albany.jpg|thumb|right|130px|[[Princess Louise of Stolberg-Gedern|Louise of Stolberg-Gedern]], Charles's wife, was only months older than his daughter.]]

In 1772, the Prince, then aged fifty-one, married the nineteen year-old [[Princess Louise of Stolberg-Gedern]] (who was only a year older than Charlotte). Charlotte, now in [[Poverty|penury]], had consistently been writing to her father for some time, and she now desperately entreated him to legitimise her, provide support, and bring her to Rome before an heir could be born. In April 1772, Charlotte wrote a touching, yet pleading, letter to &quot;mon Augusta Papa&quot; which was sent via Principal Gordon of the [[The Scots College (Rome)|Scots College]] in Rome. Charles relented and offered to bring Charlotte to [[Rome]] (he was now resident in the [[Palazzo Muti]] – the residence of the Stuarts-in-exile), but only on condition she would leave her mother behind in France. This she loyally refused to do, and Charles, in fury, broke off all discussions.&lt;ref&gt;Kybert, p. 283–4&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mistress of an Archbishop===
Towards the end of 1772, Clementina and Charlotte unexpectedly arrived in Rome to press their desperate cause in person. (The trip pushed Clementina further into debt.) However, the Prince reacted angrily, refusing even to see them, forcing their helpless return to France, from where Charlotte's pleading letters continued.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kybert&quot;&gt;Kybert, p. 285&lt;/ref&gt; Three years later, Charlotte, now in her twenty-second year and already in poor health, (she was apparently suffering from a liver ailment shared by the Stuarts) decided her only option was to marry as soon as possible. Charles, however, refused to give permission either for her to marry or to take the veil, and she was left awaiting his royal pleasure.&lt;ref&gt;Kybert p. 287–8&lt;/ref&gt;

Lacking legitimacy or permission, Charlotte was unable to marry. Thus, she otherwise sought a protector and provider. Probably unbeknown to Charles, she became the mistress of [[Ferdinand Maximilien Mériadec de Rohan]], [[Archbishopric of Bordeaux|Archbishop of Bordeaux and Cambrai]]. Ferdinand de Rohan – related by blood to the house of Stuart as well as Bourbon and Lorraine&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Pininski | first =Peter | authorlink = | coauthors = Edward Corp (ed) | title = The Stuart's Last Secret, the children of Charlotte Duchess of Albany '''In''' The Stuart Court in Rome: The Legacy of Exile | publisher = Ashgate Publishing | month = September | year = 2003 | location = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-7546-3324-1| page = 112 }}&lt;/ref&gt; – was also unable to marry legitimately, having entered the Church as a younger son of a noble house. By him, she had three children: two daughters, Marie Victoire and Charlotte, and finally a son, [[Charles Edward Stuart, Count Roehenstart|Charles Edward]]. Her children were kept secret, and remained largely unknown until the 20th century. When Charlotte eventually left France for [[Florence]], she entrusted the children – and she was only just recovering from her son's birth&lt;ref name=Kybert304&gt;Kybert, p. 304&lt;/ref&gt; – to the care of her mother, and it appears that few, and certainly not her father, knew of their existence.

==Reconciliation==
[[Image:CharlotteStuart2.jpg|thumb|left|130px|Charlotte Stuart (again by [[Hugh Douglas Hamilton]])]]

Only after his childless marriage to Louise was over, and Charles had fallen seriously ill, did he take an interest in Charlotte. She was now thirty, and she had not seen her father since she was seven. On 23 March 1783, he altered his will to make her his heir and, a week later, signed an act of legitimisation.&lt;ref name=&quot;heritage&quot;/&gt; This act, recognising her as his natural daughter and entitling her to succeed to his private estate, was sent to [[Louis XVI of France]]. Henry Stuart, however, contested the legitimisation as being irregular and confusing to the succession. Louis XVI eventually did confirm the act and register it with the [[Parlement of Paris]], but not until 6 September 1787.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jacobite.ca/documents/1784protest.htm |title=Protest against the Legitimation of Charlotte, Duchess of Albany, 1784 |accessdate=2007-12-10 |date=2003-10-06 |work=The Jacobite Heritage }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1784, having granted Louise a [[legal separation]], Charles summoned Charlotte to Florence, where he was now resident and, in November, installed her in the Palazzo Guadagni as [[Duke of Albany|Duchess of Albany]],&lt;ref name=peerage/&gt; styling her &quot;Her [[Royal Highness]]&quot; – and appointing her to the [[Order of the Thistle]].&lt;ref name=&quot;heritage&quot;/&gt; Nevertheless, being illegitimate at birth, Charlotte still had no right of succession to the Stuart claim to the British throne. However, by this stage, the claims were of little value. European rulers had long since ceased to take Charles seriously. Even [[Pope Pius VI]] was refusing to recognise his royal title, and the famous [[Giacomo Casanova|Casanova]] had wittily called him the &quot;pretender-in-vain&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kybert&quot;/&gt; He was reduced to styling himself the 'Count d'Albany'.

That a Stuart restoration was now less than unlikely did not prevent the Prince presenting Charlotte as the next generation of the cause. He had medals struck for her, bearing the figure of Hope, the map of England, and the Stuart arms with legends such as ''&quot;Spes Tamen Est Una&quot;'' (there is one hope). He also had her idealised in art; the Scottish artist [[Gavin Hamilton (artist)|Gavin Hamilton]] was commissioned to draw her in chalk in the [[Neoclassicism|neo-classical]] style, whilst [[Hugh Douglas Hamilton]] painted a flattering portrait in a tiara.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Monod | first = Paul Kelber | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Jacobitism and the English People, 1688-1788 | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]] | month = March | year = 1993 | location = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-521-44793-3| page = 90 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Companion to her father===
[[Image:Charles Edward Stuart (1775).jpg|thumb|right|130px|Charles Stuart in 1775 by [[Hugh Douglas Hamilton]], [[Scottish National Portrait Gallery]].]]

When Charlotte arrived to live with her father in 1784, he was an ailing alcoholic. She found his physical state disgusting, and he was suffering from mental degeneration and using a litter for travel.&lt;ref name=Kybert304/&gt; He did, however, introduce Charlotte into society, allowing her to wear [[Clementina Sobieski|his mother]]'s famous Sobieska jewellery.&lt;ref&gt;Kybert, p. 305&lt;/ref&gt; She continually, and unsuccessfully, sought gifts of jewels or money from her close-fisted father;&lt;ref name=Kybert307&gt;Kybert, p. 307&lt;/ref&gt; but this was probably largely out of a concern for the welfare of her mother and children.&lt;ref name=Kybert307/&gt; Within a month of arriving at Florence, she did manage to persuade her father to provide at last for Clementina.&lt;ref name=douglas/&gt; By this time, Charlotte was also in poor health, suffering from an ailment that would result in her death from &quot;obstruction of the liver&quot; just two years after her father. Indeed, shortly after she arrived in Florence, a protruding growth forced her to have clothes altered.&lt;ref name=Kybert307/&gt; Charlotte sorely missed her mother (whom she vainly hoped Charles would allow to come to Rome) and her children, writing to her mother as many as 100 times in a single year;&lt;ref name=douglas/&gt; she also feared that Rohan would take another lover; all this is revealed in her dispirited letters home, as she awaited Charles's death.&lt;ref name=&quot;loins&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotsman.com/people/The-cursed-fruits-of-Charlies.2618613.jp |title=The cursed fruits of Charlie's loins |accessdate=2008-06-20 |last=Stiùbhart |first=Domhnall Uilleam |date= 2005-03-15 |work=Scotsman.com |publisher=[[The Scotsman]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Final months===
In December 1785, she enlisted the help of Henry Stuart to get Charles back to the Palazzo Muti in Rome. There, Charlotte remained her father's carer and companion and did her best to make his life bearable until he died of a stroke two years later (31 January 1788). Her sacrifice for him was considerable—she was torn between an evident affection for her father and her mother and three children left behind in Paris.&lt;ref name=&quot;loins&quot;/&gt;

Charlotte survived her father by only twenty-two months and never saw her children again. On 9 October 1789, she arrived at the Palazzo Vizzani Sanguinetti (now Palazzo Ranuzzi) in [[Bologna]], the home of her friend the Marchesa Giulia Lambertini-Bovio. She died there at age 36 of [[Hepatocellular carcinoma|liver cancer]] (17 November 1789).&lt;ref name=&quot;PalazzoVizzani&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jacobite.ca/gazetteer/Bologna/PalazzoVizzani.htm |title=A Jacobite Gazetteer - Bologna: Palazzo Vizzani Sanguinetti |accessdate=2007-12-10 |last=McFerran |first=Noel |work=The Jacobite Heritage }}&lt;/ref&gt; In her will, written just three days before her death, Charlotte left her mother, Clementina, a sum of 50,000 livres and an annuity of a further 15,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;will&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jacobite.ca/documents/17891114.htm |title=Will of Charlotte, Duchess of Albany |accessdate=2007-12-08 |publisher=The Jacobite Heritage }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was two years before Henry Stuart, her executor, and now considered by Jacobites to be King Henry IX, would release the money. Indeed, he only agreed to do this when Clementina signed a &quot;quittance&quot; renouncing, on behalf of herself and her descendants, any further claim on the estate.&lt;ref name=Kybert312&gt;Kybert, p. 312&lt;/ref&gt; Charlotte was buried in the Church of San Biagio, near where she died. When the church was pulled down by the French in 1797, Charlotte's remains were moved to the Oratorio della Santissima Trinità. When it closed in 1961, her monument (and possibly her remains) were moved to the nearby Chiesa della Santissima Trinità.&lt;ref name=&quot;PalazzoVizzani&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kybert312/&gt;

==Legacy==
[[Image:Marie-Victoire Princess de Rohan.jpg|thumb|left|130px|Marie-Victoire, Princess de Rohan—Charles's secret granddaughter]]

For many years, Charlotte's three children remained unknown to history, and it was believed that the direct line of the Stuarts ended with the death of Henry in 1807. However, in the 1950s, research by the historians [[Alasdair and Hetty Tayler]] revealed the existence of two daughters and a son. Historian George Sherburn&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Sherburn | first = George | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Roehenstart: A Late Stuart Pretender.

===Children===
It appears that Clementina lived on in [[Fribourg]], [[Switzerland]], until her death in 1802 and that it was she who reared Charlotte's children in deliberate anonymity. Their identities were concealed by a variety of aliases and ruses, not even being mentioned in Charlotte's detailed will. The will makes reference only to Clementina and to Charlotte's desire that Clementina might be able to provide for &quot;her necessitous relations&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;will&quot;/&gt; The reason these children remained secret can be explained by the fact that the relationship between Rohan, the Archbishop, and Charlotte, who had been forbidden to marry, was highly illicit and would have been scandalous.&lt;ref name=&quot;burke&quot;/&gt; Marie Victoire Adelaide (born 1779) and Charlotte Maximilienne Amélie (born 1780)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Reitwiesner|first=William Addams|authorlink=William Addams Reitwiesner|url=http://www.wargs.com/royal/stuart.html |title=Descendants of Bonnie Prince Charlie|publisher=William Addams Reitwiesner Genealogical Services|accessdate=2007-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; were thought to have been placed in the care of [[Thomas Coutts]], the London banker, and a distant relative of the Walkinshaws. They remained in anonymity and were believed to have been simply absorbed into English society.&lt;ref name=Kybert312/&gt;

Charlotte's son, [[Charles Edward Stuart, Count Roehenstart|Charles Edward]], born in Paris in 1784, followed a different path. Calling himself 'Count Roehenstart' (Rohan+Stuart), he was educated by his father's family in Germany, became an officer in the Russian army, and a General in the Austrian service.&lt;ref name=&quot;General Charles&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jacobite.ca/essays/roehenstart.htm |title=General Charles Edward Stuart, Count Roehenstart |accessdate=2007-12-15 |last=McFerran |first=Noel |date=2003-10-30, |work=The Jacobite Heritage }}&lt;/ref&gt; He travelled widely—visiting India, America, and [[Caribbean|the West Indies]]—before coming to England and Scotland. He told such tall tales of his origins and adventures that few believed his claims to royal descent.&lt;ref name=Kybert313&gt;Kybert, p. 313&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, it was not until the 20th century that historian George Sherburn established that he was indeed who he had claimed to be.&lt;ref name=Kybert313/&gt; He died in Scotland in 1854 as the result of a coach accident near [[Stirling Castle]] and was buried at [[Dunkeld Cathedral]], where his grave can still be seen.&lt;ref&gt;His gravestone states he was 73 although, if born in 1784, he would have been 69 (Kybert, p. 313)&lt;/ref&gt; He married twice but had no issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.englishmonarchs.co.uk/stuart_12.htm |title=Charles Edward Stuart |accessdate=2007-12-15 |work=www.englishmonarchs.co.uk }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Occasionally, it has been suggested that Prince Charles married Clementina Walkinshaw, and thus that Charlotte was legitimate and could legally claim to be her father's successor.&lt;ref name=&quot;heritage&quot;/&gt; However, there are no records to substantiate this claim, and the sworn affidavit signed by Clementina on 9 March 1767 explicitly disavows the idea. Further, Charles's initial disavowal of Charlotte speaks against her legitimacy.&lt;ref name=&quot;heritage&quot;/&gt;

It is generally believed that Charlotte's daughters also died without issue.&lt;ref name=&quot;Peter&quot;/&gt; However, according to Peter Pininski's research, Charlotte's elder daughter, Marie Victoire, did have issue. Pininski's book suggests that Jules-Hercule, Prince de Guéméné and Duke of Montbazon, elder brother of Ferdinand de Rohan (and [[Aide-de-camp|aide de camp]] to Henry Stuart in 1745) recognised Charlotte's offspring as his own – thus giving her status in that tight family. In 1793, at the outbreak of the [[French revolution]], the Rohan family scattered; and Marie Victoire de Rohan went to relatives in Poland. There, she met and married Paul Anthony Louis Bertrand de Nikorowicz, a Polish nobleman and son of a banker. They had a son, Antime, before she was widowed four years later. (She later remarried twice: first to James d'Auvergne, a British naval captain, who died after 14 months, and then finally to Jean de Pauw, a French army officer.) Antime was to have a son, Charles, and a daughter, Julia-Thérèse, who married Count Leonard Pininski and became Peter Pininski's great-great-grandmother.&lt;ref name=&quot;burke&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p book&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Pininski | first = Peter | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = The Stuarts' Last Secret | publisher = Tuckwell Press Ltd | month = April | year = 2002 | location = | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 1-86232-199-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pininski's evidence for his thesis has been described as &quot;often indirect, if not elliptical&quot;; the Rohans were a large family, and it is easy to confuse its many members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baronage.co.uk/2003b/Pininski.pdf|format=pdf|author=Lyon, Ann|publisher=The Baronage|title=Book review: The Stuarts' Last Secret|accessdate=2007-12-17|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; A former chairman of the [[Royal Stuart Society]], however, stated that Pininski's evidence seemed &quot;genuine&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;link&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/1927808.stm|title=Historian's royal link claim|date=13 April 2002|work=BBC News Website|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2009-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Jacobite folklore===
{{wikisource|The Bonnie Lass of Albanie}}
Charlotte Stuart's story did not take long to enter into the Jacobite folklore. The Scots poet, [[Robert Burns]] (1759–96), a near contemporary, wrote a number of works celebrating the tragic romanticism of the Jacobite cause. Amongst them was ''The Bonnie Lass of Albanie'', a lament to Charlotte Stuart probably written at the time of her death. Indeed, evidence from an unpublished collection of letters from Burns to Robert Ainslie reveals the Poet's fascination with Charlotte, in that he considered naming one of his own illegitimate children Charlotte after her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Noble | first = Andrew (editor) | authorlink = | coauthors = Patrick Scott Hogg | title = The Canongate Burns | publisher = Canongate Books | year = 2001 | location = Edinburgh | pages = 677–78 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-86241-994-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
