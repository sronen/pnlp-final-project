'''Henry Edwards''' (August 27, 1827 – June 9, 1891), known as &quot;'''Harry'''&quot;, was an English-born stage actor, writer and [[entomology|entomologist]] who gained fame in Australia, San Francisco and New York City for his theater work.

Edwards was drawn to the theater early in life, and he appeared in amateur productions in London. After sailing to Australia, Edwards appeared professionally in [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]an plays and light comedies primarily in Melbourne and Sydney. Throughout his childhood in England and his acting career in Australia, he was greatly interested in [[Insect collecting|collecting insects]], and the [[Museum Victoria|National Museum of Victoria]] used the results of his Australian fieldwork as part of the genesis of their collection.

In San Francisco, Edwards was a founding member of the [[Bohemian Club]], and a gathering in Edwards' honor was the spark which began the club's traditional summer encampment at the [[Bohemian Grove]].&lt;ref name=Garnett7&gt;Garnett, 1908, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; As well, Edwards cemented his reputation as a preeminent stage actor and theater manager. After writing a series of influential studies on [[West Coast of the United States|Pacific Coast]] butterflies and moths he was elected life member of the [[California Academy of Sciences]]. Relocating to the  [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]], Edwards spent a brief time in Boston theater. This led to a connection to [[Wallack's Theatre]] and further renown in New York City. There, Edwards edited three volumes of the journal ''Papilio'' and published a major work about the life of the butterfly.&lt;ref name=Beutenmuller/&gt; His large collection of insect specimens served as the foundation of the [[American Museum of Natural History]]'s butterfly and moth studies.

Edwards' wide-ranging studies and observations of insects brought him into contact with specimens not yet classified. Upon discovering previously unknown insects he would give them names, which led to a number of [[butterfly]], [[moth]] and [[beetle]] species bearing &quot;Hy. Edw.&quot; (for Henry Edwards) as an attribution.&lt;ref name=Lepidopterists&gt;{{Cite journal

==Early career==
Henry Edwards was born to Hannah and Thomas Edwards (c. 1794–1857) at Brook House in [[Ross-on-Wye]], Herefordshire, England, on August 27, 1827, and was christened on September 14.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brown-May&quot;&gt;Brown-May and May, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; From his older brother William, he picked up an interest in examining insects. He collected butterflies as a hobby, and studied them under the tutelage of [[Edward Doubleday]]. His solicitor father intended a law career for his son, but after a brief period of unsuccessful study, Edwards took a position at a [[counting house]] in London, and began acting in amateur theater. He then journeyed to join his brother William who had settled in Australia, nine miles (14&amp;nbsp;km) north-west of Melbourne along the bank of [[Merri Creek]], a location then called Merrivale. Aboard the sailing ship ''Ganges'' from March to June 1853, he wrote descriptions of creatures such as the [[albatross]] that he encountered for the first time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brown-May&quot;/&gt; After arriving in Melbourne, Edwards began collecting and cataloging the insects he found on his brother's land, and further afield. Within two years, he had gathered 1,676 species of insects, shot and mounted 200 birds, and pressed some 200 botanical specimens.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brown-May&quot;/&gt; This collection and that of William Kershaw were purchased by [[Frederick McCoy]] to form the nucleus of the new [[Museum Victoria|National Museum of Victoria]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Brown-May&quot;/&gt;

The first Australian stage appearance by Edwards was with [[George Selth Coppin]]'s company at the Queen's Theatre in Melbourne. Later, he joined [[Gustavus Vaughan Brooke]]'s theatrical group. The part of [[Petruchio]], the male lead in Shakespeare's ''[[The Taming of the Shrew]]'', was filled by Edwards at the Princess's Theatre in Sydney in November, 1859, playing opposite [[Tragedy|tragedian]] Avonia Jones as Katharine.&lt;ref name=Brooke/&gt; In December that year Brooke retired from management, yielding the reins of his company to the team of Edwards and George Fawcett Rowe, English actor and playwright. Brooke continued to act under Edwards and Rowe: his starring performance in April 1860 as [[Louis XI of France|Louis XI]] in [[Dion Boucicault]]'s play of the same name was a stirring portrayal that Edwards, playing [[Jacques d'Armagnac, Duke of Nemours]], recalled vividly for the rest of his life.&lt;ref name=Brooke/&gt; Sharing the stage again in August, Brooke and Edwards were well received in their portrayal of twin brothers in a production of Shakespeare's ''[[The Comedy of Errors]]'' in Melbourne, the first Australian mounting of that work.&lt;ref name=Brooke&gt;{{Cite book

However, not all of Edwards' performances were successful: his turn at [[Angelo (Measure for Measure)|Angelo]] in Shakespeare's ''[[Measure for Measure]]'' was called &quot;invertebrate&quot;&lt;ref name=Brooke/&gt; by drama critic William John Lawrence; in Lawrence's estimation, Edwards and his fellow actors paled against the powerful performance of Avonia Jones as Isabella.&lt;ref name=Brooke/&gt;

The renowned entomologist and collector [[William Sharp Macleay]] was sought out by Edwards whenever his stage appearances took him to Sydney. Beginning in 1858, Macleay mentored Edwards and encouraged him to search for more insect specimens when his theater obligations allowed. Robust and adventuresome, Edwards occasionally trekked out into the wilds of Australia on the hunt for insects. While in Sydney, Edwards went up two times in a [[hot air balloon]] as a favor to George Coppin, narrowly avoiding severe injury or death in the first ascent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

==San Francisco==
In 1865, Edwards began a 12-year residence in San Francisco, California. At the [[1870 United States Census]], Edwards reported himself as a non-voting foreign-born resident, a [[Comedy (drama)|comedian]] by trade, living in a home worth $1,000.&lt;ref name=1870Census&gt;United States Census, 1870. San Francisco, 2d Precinct, 12th Ward, page 38. June 14, 1870.&lt;/ref&gt; Edwards lived in San Francisco with a white woman listed in the census as &quot;Mariana&quot;, born in England, age 40, and a 16-year-old Chinese servant named Heng Gim.&lt;ref name=1870Census/&gt; The woman Mariana was likely Edwards's wife,&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; the former Marianne Elizabeth Woolcott Bray who was born about 1822–1823 in [[New Street, Birmingham]].&lt;ref name=Brooke/&gt; In 1851 at the age of 28, Bray married Gustavus Vaughan Brooke, and the two went to Australia to manage Brooke's then-new theater company. It was there that Edwards met Brooke and his wife, but after several years of the two men working together, Brooke remarried in February 1863, taking Avonia Jones (1836–1867)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/index/101014983/ |title=Avonia Jones |last=Knight |first=Joseph |date=September 2004 |work=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography |publisher=Oxford University Press |accessdate=February 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; as his second wife. Brooke died in an accident at sea in January 1866, and Avonia Jones Brooke died in England the next year.&lt;ref name=Brooke/&gt; Later reports spoke of Edwards marrying Brooke's widow, without naming her.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

[[File:Henry Edwards engraving with sig.jpg|thumb|left|Theatre card]]
In 1868–1869 Edwards leased and managed the Metropolitan Theater,&lt;ref name=Shuck/&gt; and he was a founding member of the acting company of the [[California Theatre (San Francisco)|California Theatre]], which opened in January 1869.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Edwards was one of the founders and the first vice president of the Bohemian Club, and served two terms as president, 1873–1875.&lt;ref&gt;Bohemian Club (1904).

Still very much interested in insects, Edwards spent his spare time at the [[California Academy of Sciences]] studying butterflies under [[Hans Hermann Behr]], the academy's curator for [[Lepidoptera]], the scientific [[Order (biology)|order]] of moths and butterflies.&lt;ref name=Lepidopterists/&gt; Elected a member of the academy in 1867, he concentrated on describing the structure and habits of moths and butterflies on the [[Pacific coast]] from [[British Columbia]] to [[Baja California]]. He went to visit [[John Muir]] in [[Yosemite Valley]] in June 1871, with a letter of introduction from Jeanne Carr, the wife of California's chief geologist Ezra S. Carr. The letter described Edwards as &quot;one of Nature's truest and most devoted disciples&quot;, a sojourner who &quot;has the keys to the Kingdom&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/lifeandlettersof007082mbp#page/n281/mode/1up|title=The Life and Letters of John Muir|last=Badè|first=William Frederic|year=1924|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|pages=262–264|accessdate=January 24, 2010|location=Boston and New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the visit, Muir occasionally sent specimens from the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierras]] to add to Edwards' collection, carried to San Francisco by men such as geologist and artist [[Clarence King]] who were returning from Yosemite field study. Edwards presented a series of papers to the academy entitled ''Pacific Coast Lepidoptera'',&lt;ref name=Shuck/&gt; and classified two species as new to science. He named one ''Gyros muiri'' for Muir, with &quot;Hy. Edw.&quot; as the attribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Beginning early that year, he accompanied and befriended [[George Robert Crotch]] on the latter's insect-collecting tour of California, [[Oregon]] and British Columbia. In 1874, Edwards began to serve as one of the academy's vice presidents, and for the academy in late 1874 after Crotch's death from [[tuberculosis]], he published a memorial tribute to the man.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Though successful in San Francisco, Edwards decided to head for Boston and New York City to see if his career as an actor could benefit from appearances in the eastern United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85066387/1896-07-12/ed-1/seq-24/;words=Edwards+Harry|title=The New Jinks and Old Jinks: Midnight Programmes in the Forest|date=July 12, 1896|work=The San Francisco Call|accessdate=January 25, 2010|location=San Francisco}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 29, 1878, somewhat fewer than 100 of his Bohemian friends gathered in the woods near [[Taylorville, California]] (present-day [[Samuel P. Taylor State Park]]), for a night-time send-off party in Edwards' honor.&lt;ref&gt;Garnett, 1908, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Bohemian Club historian Porter Garnett later wrote that the men at the &quot;nocturnal picnic&quot; were &quot;provided with blankets to keep them warm and a generous supply of liquor for the same purpose&quot;.&lt;ref name=Garnett7/&gt; Japanese lanterns were used for illumination and decoration. This festive gathering was repeated without Edwards by club members the next year, and every year thereafter, eventually evolving and expanding into the club's annual summer encampment at the [[Bohemian Grove]],&lt;ref name=Garnett7/&gt; famous (or infamous) for the casual commingling of top politicians and powerful captains of industry in attendance.&lt;ref&gt;Weiss, Philip (November 1989).

==Boston to New York==
In late 1878, Edwards joined a theater company in Boston, replacing another actor as &quot;Schelm, Chief of Police&quot; at a revival of the spectacle ''The Exiles'' at the [[Boston Theatre]] on Washington Street.&lt;ref&gt;Tompkins, 1908, p. 258.&lt;/ref&gt; After a four-week run, he performed in other productions at the theater through the 1879–1880 season.&lt;ref&gt;Tompkins, 1908, p. 266.&lt;/ref&gt; In June, Edwards answered the [[1880 United States Census|1880 census]] to report himself an England-born actor living with his English wife &quot;Marian&quot; and his Chinese servant, Gim Hing.&lt;ref name=1880Census&gt;United States Census, 1880.

From Boston, Edwards moved to New York to stay for some ten years, performing on stage and participating in insect studies. He was active in the Brooklyn and New York Entomological Societies. In 1881, he co-founded and edited a butterfly enthusiast's periodical entitled ''Papilio'', named for the [[genus]] ''Papilio'' in the [[swallowtail butterfly]] [[family (biology)|family]], [[Swallowtail butterfly|Papilionidae]].&lt;ref name=Lepidopterists/&gt; Edwards served as editor until January 1884 when he gave the reins to his friend Eugene Murray-Aaron of Philadelphia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Beginning in December 1880 under [[John Lester Wallack|Lester Wallack]], the charismatic son of the theater's founder, Edwards was associated with [[Wallack's Theatre]] in New York, called the &quot;finest theatre company in America&quot;.&lt;ref name=Hardee47/&gt; Now in his 50s, the entomologist and actor appeared in such representative British dramatic roles as Prince Malleotti in ''Forget Me Not'', Max Harkaway in ''[[London Assurance]]'', Baron Stein in ''Diplomacy'', and Master Walter in ''The Hunchback'', reprising [[James Sheridan Knowles]]'s earlier portrayal. Edwards used Wallack's Theatre as his professional mailing address, and helped manage it upon occasion. Wallack, already head &quot;Shepherd&quot; of the [[Lambs Club]], a modest meetinghouse of professional stage actors, invited Edwards to join.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Edwards appeared in early 1882 at Palmer's Theatre on Broadway and West 30th Street in a production of the English [[Comedy (drama)|comedy]] ''[[The School for Scandal]]''. Wallack stalwart [[John Gibbs Gilbert]] reached the height of his fame in the production, playing Sir Peter Teazle.

A testimonial production of ''[[Hamlet]]'' was mounted at the [[Metropolitan Opera House (39th St)|Metropolitan Opera House]] on May 21, 1888, to celebrate the life and accomplishments of an aging Lester Wallack, and to raise money to ease the chronic [[sciatica]] that arrested his career. &quot;One of the greatest casts ever assembled&quot;&lt;ref name=Hardee47&gt;{{Cite book

Notables such as Mayor [[Abram Stevens Hewitt|Hewitt]] and General [[William Tecumseh Sherman|Sherman]] were in attendance. More than $10,000 was raised for Wallack's care.

The next year, Edwards published a significant treatise entitled ''Bibliographic Catalogue of the Described Transformation of North American Lepidoptera''.&lt;ref name=Lepidopterists/&gt; In response to an invitation and after arranging a business contract, he traveled back to Australia to accept a position as stage manager of a theatrical company in Melbourne. Frustrated with the experience, Edwards sailed back to New York the next year with the intention of returning to acting, but poor health kept him from full enjoyment of the [[limelight]]. In March, Edwards appeared as Holofernes in ''[[Love's Labour's Lost]]'' at [[Augustin Daly]]'s Daly Theatre, but was often short of breath and unable to keep pace with the run—his part was given to a young [[Tyrone Power, Sr.|Tyrone Power]] who also covered Edwards' old role of Sir Oliver Surface for Daly's road show of ''The School for Scandal''.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news |title=Obituary: Henry Edwards, Comedian |newspaper=The New York Times |date=June 10, 1891 |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9A00E1DC173AE533A25753C1A9609C94609ED7CF |accessdate=January 17, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To regain his strength, Edwards and his wife took a carriage to a rustic cottage refuge in Arkville in the [[Catskill Mountains]] but isolation, plain food and rest yielded little improvement. A physician was called and he informed Mrs. Edwards that there would be no recovery for her husband from the advanced [[Bright's disease]] with complications from chronic [[pneumonia]]&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; so she brought him back to New York City. Edwards died at home at 185 East [[116th Street (Manhattan)|116th Street]] in [[Spanish Harlem|East Harlem]] late on June 9, 1891, just hours after returning.&lt;ref name=Lepidopterists/&gt;

===Birth dates===
The birth date that Edwards gave as his own varied depending on the time and place he was asked. Parish records show he was christened in England on September 14, 1827, and corroborating this date he gave his age as 25 in June 1853 when he first arrived in Australia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brown-May&quot;/&gt; However, when questioned in San Francisco for the [[1870 United States Census]], he gave his birth year as 1830.&lt;ref name=1870Census/&gt; [[1880 United States Census|Ten years later]] in Boston, he reported his age as 45,&lt;ref name=1870Census/&gt; implying a birth year of 1835, but he returned to supplying the year 1830 along with the date August 27 for the brief biographical sketches used by theater and entomological publications. Two years before he died, he told a reporter from the ''Lorgnette'' that he was born in 1832.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brown-May&quot;/&gt; A prominent obituary in ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that his family gave his birthday as September 23, 1830, but that some published lists of actors' ages, &quot;not always trustworthy&quot;, put his birth year at 1824.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;
