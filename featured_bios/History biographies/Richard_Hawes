'''Richard Hawes''' (February 6, 1797 – May 25, 1877) was a [[United States Representative]] from [[Kentucky]] and the second [[Confederate government of Kentucky|Confederate Governor of Kentucky]]. He was part of an influential political family, with a brother, uncle, and cousin who also served as U.S. Representatives. He began his political career as an ardent [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] and was a close friend of the party's founder, [[Henry Clay]]. When the party declined and dissolved in the 1850s, Hawes became a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], and his relationship with Clay cooled.

At the outbreak of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], Hawes was a supporter of [[Kentucky]]'s doctrine of [[armed neutrality]]. When the Commonwealth's neutrality was breached in September 1861, Hawes fled to Virginia and enlisted as a brigade commissary under Confederate general [[Humphrey Marshall (general)|Humphrey Marshall]]. When Kentucky's Confederate government was formed in [[Russellville, Kentucky|Russellville]], Hawes was offered the position of [[state auditor]], but declined. Months later, he was selected to be  Confederate governor of the Commonwealth following [[George W. Johnson (Civil War)|George W. Johnson]]'s death at the [[Battle of Shiloh]].

Hawes and the Confederate government traveled with [[Braxton Bragg]]'s [[Army of Tennessee]], and when Bragg invaded Kentucky in October 1862, he captured [[Frankfort, Kentucky|Frankfort]] and held an inauguration ceremony for Hawes. The ceremony was interrupted, however, by forces under Union general [[Don Carlos Buell]], and the Confederates were driven from the Commonwealth following the [[Battle of Perryville]]. Hawes relocated to Virginia, where he continued to lobby President [[Jefferson Davis]] to attempt another invasion of Kentucky.

At the end of the war, the Confederate government of Kentucky in exile ceased to exist, and Hawes returned to his home in [[Paris, Kentucky]]. He swore an oath of allegiance to the Union, and was allowed to return to his law practice. He was elected [[County Judge/Executive|county judge]] of [[Bourbon County, Kentucky|Bourbon County]], a post he held until his death in 1877.

==Early life==
Richard Hawes was born on February 6, 1797 near [[Bowling Green, Virginia|Bowling Green]], [[Caroline County, Virginia|Caroline County]], Virginia.&lt;ref name=congbio&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=H000363 |title=Hawes, Richard, (1797–1877) |publisher=United States Congress |accessdate=May 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of eleven children born to Richard and Clara{{Ref|clary|[a]}} Walker Hawes.&lt;ref name=powell&gt;&quot;Richard Hawes in Powell, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; The Hawes' were a political family; Richard's brother, [[Albert Gallatin Hawes]], nephew, [[Aylett Hawes]], and cousin, [[Aylett Hawes Buckner]], all served in the U.S. House of Representatives.&lt;ref name=congbio/&gt; In 1810, the family moved to Kentucky, settling in [[Fayette County, Kentucky|Fayette County]], near [[Lexington, Kentucky|Lexington]].&lt;ref name=kye&gt;&quot;Hawes, Richard&quot; in Kleber, pp. 418–419&lt;/ref&gt; Part of Hawes' early education was obtained through the [[Jessamine County, Kentucky|Jessamine County]] school conducted by Samuel Wilson.&lt;ref name=register28&gt;Harrison in ''Register'', p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 13, 1818, Hawes married Hetty Morrison Nicholas of Lexington.&lt;ref name=powell/&gt; He pursued classical studies at [[Transylvania University]], then studied law under [[Robert C. Wickliffe]].&lt;ref name=congbio/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rootsweb.com/~kyfayett/dunn/hawes_richard.htm |title=Capt. Richard Hawes, Jr. House |publisher=RootsWeb.com |month=June |year=2006 |accessdate=May 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hawes and Wickliffe became law partners upon the former's admission to the [[bar (law)|bar]] in 1818.&lt;ref name=register28/&gt; Due to overcrowding of the bar in Lexington, Hawes moved to [[Winchester, Kentucky|Winchester]] in 1824.&lt;ref name=register28/&gt; While there, he became part owner of a [[rope]] and bagging factory with Benjamin H. Buckner.&lt;ref name=register28/&gt;

===Political career===
Hawes began his political career in 1828 when he was elected as a Whig to represent [[Clark County, Kentucky]] in the [[Kentucky House of Representatives]].&lt;ref name=powell/&gt; As a member of the state [[militia]], Hawes saw limited service in the [[Black Hawk War]] in 1832, and returned to his position in the Kentucky House in 1834.&lt;ref name=powell/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harrison in ''Register'', p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; He was an unsuccessful candidate for U.S. Representative in 1834, but was elected to represent Henry Clay's &quot;[[Ashland, Kentucky|Ashland]] District&quot; three years later, serving from March 4, 1837 to March 3, 1841.&lt;ref name=congbio/&gt;&lt;ref name=powell/&gt; He then moved to Paris, Kentucky in 1843 and continued the practice of law.&lt;ref name=harrison&gt;Harrison in ''Kentucky Governors'', pp. 82–84&lt;/ref&gt;

Hawes was once close friends with Clay, but the friendship between them cooled when Hawes supported [[Zachary Taylor]] instead of Clay for [[President of the United States|president]] in 1848.&lt;ref name=rose&gt;&quot;Richard Hawes, 1797–1877: Our Cause is Steadily on the Increase&quot; in Rose, pp. 90–91&lt;/ref&gt; When the Whig Party dissolved in the 1850s, Hawes became a Democrat, supporting presidential candidates [[James Buchanan]] in 1856 and [[John C. Breckinridge]] in 1860.&lt;ref name=harrison/&gt;

Though alarmed by the election of [[Abraham Lincoln]] in the election of 1860, Hawes was an opponent of secession, supporting instead the idea of armed neutrality.&lt;ref name=harrison/&gt;&lt;ref name=rose/&gt; In May 1861, Hawes, Breckinridge, and Kentucky governor [[Beriah Magoffin]] represented the Southern Rights viewpoint at a convention to decide Kentucky's course in the Civil War.&lt;ref name=rose/&gt; He attended another such convention in September 1861.&lt;ref name=kye/&gt; Neither convention produced a conclusive decision.&lt;ref name=kye/&gt;

A July 1861 address to the people of [[Bourbon County, Kentucky|Bourbon County]], authored by Hawes and other like-minded Democrats, blamed [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] for starting the Civil War, denounced the coercion of states to remain in the Union, and warned that the Lincoln administration would fight to end slavery. The address called for an end to the war, recognition of the Confederate States of America as a sovereign nation, and equitable distribution of the national debt and federal property.&lt;ref name=rose/&gt;

===Military service===
When Kentucky's neutrality was breached in September 1861, Hawes fled to Virginia to escape imprisonment by Federal authorities.&lt;ref name=kye/&gt; While there, he enlisted as a brigade commissary under Confederate general Humphrey Marshall and was given the rank of [[Major (United States)|major]].&lt;ref name=harrison/&gt; Though his ability to obtain supplies for Marshall's brigade was commendable given the difficult conditions, his age (64) and lack of military experience lessened his value to Marshall's unit, and his predilection for jumping the chain of command and communicating directly with Confederate Secretary of War [[Judah P. Benjamin]] put him at odds with Marshall personally.&lt;ref name=rose/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bcoref&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.breathittcounty.com/JCN-2governors.html |title=Kentucky Had Two Confederate Governors |accessdate=June 26, 2007 |author=Neace, James Clell and Harned, Edgar Porter |year=2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1861, the self-appointed members of the Confederate state sovereignty convention in Russellville, Kentucky appointed Hawes state auditor of the Commonwealth's Confederate government, but he declined in order to continue his military service.&lt;ref name=kye/&gt; However, he wrote President Davis on January 25, 1862 to inform him that he was traveling to [[Bowling Green, Kentucky]] at Confederate Governor George W. Johnson's request in order to assist Johnson in administering the state government.&lt;ref name=rose/&gt; He resigned his military commission two days later, but his departure for Bowling Green was delayed when he was stricken with [[typhoid fever]].&lt;ref name=harrison/&gt;

==Confederate Governor of Kentucky==
[[File:Confederate occupation marker Frankfort KY.png|thumb|left|A historical marker in [[Frankfort, Kentucky]] documents Hawes' [[inauguration]] as Confederate governor]]
Governor Johnson was killed while participating in the [[Battle of Shiloh]]. Following the resolutions of the Russellville Convention, the provisional Confederate government's ten legislative councillors selected Hawes to succeed Johnson as governor. (Under these provisions, the councillors could not select one of their own.)&lt;ref name=harrison/&gt; He joined the leaderless and nomadic [[Shadow Cabinet|shadow government]], which had been traveling with the Army of Tennessee, in [[Corinth, Mississippi]], and took the oath of office on May 31.&lt;ref name=brown93&gt;Brown, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; The army's leader, General Braxton Bragg, had been considering an invasion of Kentucky.&lt;ref name=harrison/&gt; On August 27, Hawes was dispatched to [[Richmond, Virginia]] to favorably recommend this action to President Jefferson Davis, but Davis was non-committal.&lt;ref name=harrison/&gt; Bragg and [[Edmund Kirby Smith]] proceeded with the invasion nonetheless, while the leaders of Kentucky's Confederate government remained in [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]], awaiting Hawes' return.&lt;ref name=harrison/&gt; They departed on September 18, and caught up with Bragg and Smith in Lexington, Kentucky on October 2.&lt;ref name=harrison/&gt;&lt;ref name=rose/&gt;

Bragg, desiring to enforce the Confederate Conscription Act in the Commonwealth, decided to install the provisional government in the recently-captured state capital of Frankfort.&lt;ref name=rose/&gt; The ceremony took place on October 4, 1862.&lt;ref name=powell/&gt; Humphrey Marshall gave the opening remarks, then General Bragg introduced Governor Hawes.&lt;ref name=brown95&gt;Brown, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt; Hawes delivered a lengthy inaugural address in which he declared &quot;It is now a truth and a fact that the late Union cannot be restored.&quot;&lt;ref name=brown95/&gt; He promised to call a convention to provide for a permanent government as soon as such a convention was feasible, and denounced the Union's goal of freeing the slaves.&lt;ref name=brown95/&gt; In the celebratory atmosphere of the inauguration ceremony, however, the Confederate forces let their guard down, and were ambushed and forced to retreat by Union general Don Carlos Buell.&lt;ref name=powell/&gt; Hawes later denied ever taking the oath of office, and became a vocal critic of Bragg.&lt;ref name=powell/&gt;&lt;ref name=kye/&gt;

Displaced from their home state, the legislative council dispersed to places where they could make a living or be supported by relatives until Governor Hawes called them into session. Scant records show that on December 30, 1862, Hawes summoned the council, auditor, and treasurer to his location at [[Athens, Tennessee]] for a meeting on January 15, 1863. Hawes unsuccessfully lobbied President Davis to remove Hawes' former superior, Humphrey Marshall, from command. On March 4, he told Davis by letter that &quot;our cause is steadily on the increase&quot; and assured him that another foray into the Commonwealth would produce better results than the first had.&lt;ref name=brown9697&gt;Brown, pp. 96–97&lt;/ref&gt;

The government's financial woes also continued. Hawes was embarrassed to admit that neither he nor anyone else seemed to know what became of approximately $45,000 that had been sent from [[Columbus, Kentucky|Columbus]] to [[Memphis, Tennessee]] during the Confederate occupation of Kentucky.&lt;ref name=brown97&gt;Brown, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; Another major blow was Davis' decision not to allow Hawes to spend $1 million that had been secretly appropriated in August 1861 to help Kentucky maintain its neutrality.&lt;ref name=harrison/&gt; Davis reasoned that the money could not be spent for its intended purpose, since Kentucky was now a part of the Confederacy.&lt;ref name=harrison/&gt;

By 1864, Hawes had joined his sister at the small Virginia settlement of Nelly's Ford.&lt;ref name=brown97/&gt; His wife and daughter joined him there.&lt;ref name=brown97/&gt; This location was only {{convert|100|mi|km}} from Richmond, allowing Hawes to travel easily to the Confederate capital for audiences with President Davis.&lt;ref name=brown97/&gt; Records show that as late as September 16, 1864, Hawes still maintained hope for another military advance into Kentucky.&lt;ref name=brown97/&gt; In the summer 1864, Colonel R. A. Alston of the Ninth Tennessee Cavalry requested Governor Hawes' assistance in investigating crimes allegedly committed by General [[John Hunt Morgan]] during his unauthorized raid into Kentucky.&lt;ref name=rose/&gt; Hawes never had to act on the request, however, as Morgan was suspended from command on August 10 and killed by Union troops on September 4, 1864.&lt;ref name=rose/&gt;

==Later life and death==
Hawes remained at Nelly's Ford until May 1865.&lt;ref name=bcoref/&gt; Finally satisfied that it was safe to return to Kentucky, Hawes arrived in Paris to find his home had been burned by Union troops.&lt;ref name=bcoref/&gt; Four of Hawes' sons served in the Confederate Army, including [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]] [[James Morrison Hawes]]; only three sons returned home from the war.&lt;ref name=bcoref/&gt;&lt;ref name=kye-jmh&gt;&quot;Hawes, James Morrison&quot; in Kleber, p. 418&lt;/ref&gt;{{Ref|children|[b]}} On September 18, 1865, Hawes took an oath of allegiance to the United States, and was allowed to return to his previous career as a lawyer.&lt;ref name=rose/&gt;

In 1866, he was elected county judge of Bourbon County.&lt;ref name=powell/&gt; His most notable ruling in this capacity was to nullify the apprenticeship contracts of the [[Freedman's Bureau]] in Kentucky.&lt;ref name=register38&gt;Harrison in ''Register'', p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; Hawes based this decision on the fact that the Bureau's powers extended only to states that had been part of the rebellion, which Kentucky had not.&lt;ref name=register38/&gt; Hawes was also chosen master commissioner of the circuit court in 1866.&lt;ref name=powell/&gt; In 1871, Hawes was mentioned as a possible candidate for governor of Kentucky.&lt;ref name=register38/&gt; In 1876, he helped frame his party's response to the disputed [[Rutherford B. Hayes|Hayes]]–[[Samuel J. Tilden|Tilden]] presidential election.&lt;ref name=register38/&gt; Hawes died in Paris, Kentucky on May 25, 1877&lt;ref name=powell/&gt; and was interred in Paris Cemetery.&lt;ref name=congbio/&gt;

==Notes==
&lt;div class=&quot;references-small&quot;&gt;
*{{note|clary|[a]}}''The Kentucky Encyclopedia'' lists the name as &quot;Clary&quot;
*{{note|children|[b]}}There is some discrepancy regarding the number of children born to Richard and Hetty Hawes. Harrison claims that the couple had two children, while Neace and Harned mention four sons. The 1850 census showed six Hawes children living in the household: four sons and two daughters. This did not include James Morrison Hawes, who was already an instructor at the [[United States Military Academy]] by 1850.
