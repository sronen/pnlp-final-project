'''Samantha Reed Smith''' (June 29, 1972 – August 25, 1985) was an American schoolgirl, [[List of peace activists|peace activist]] and [[child actress]] from [[Manchester, Maine]], who became famous in the [[Cold War]]-era [[United States]] and [[Soviet Union]]. In 1982, Smith wrote a letter to the newly appointed [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|CPSU General Secretary]] [[Yuri Andropov]], and received a personal reply which included a personal invitation to visit the Soviet Union, which she accepted.

Smith attracted extensive media attention in both countries as a &quot;[[Goodwill Ambassador]]&quot;, and became known as &quot;America's Youngest Ambassador&quot; participating in peacemaking activities in Japan.&lt;ref name=MoscowEmbassy&gt;{{cite web |last=Saint-André |first=Yvette Irène |title=I Remember Samantha Smith: Goodwill Ambassador |publisher=U.S. Embassy in Moscow |url=http://moscow.usembassy.gov/200th/anniversary.php?record_id=yvette |accessdate=2008-02-27|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080219074549/http://moscow.usembassy.gov/200th/anniversary.php?record_id=yvette |archivedate = February 19, 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; She wrote a book about her visit to the Soviet Union and co-starred in the television series ''[[Lime Street (TV series)|Lime Street]]'', before her death at the age of 13 in the [[Bar Harbor Airlines Flight 1808]] plane crash.

== Historical context ==

When Yuri Andropov succeeded [[Leonid Brezhnev]] as leader of the Soviet Union in November 1982, the mainstream [[Western world|Western]] newspapers and magazines ran numerous front page photographs and articles about him. Most coverage was negative and tended to a perception of a new threat to the stability of the Western world. Andropov had been the Soviet Ambassador to Hungary during the [[1956 Hungarian Revolution]] and began his tenure as Soviet leader by strengthening the powers of the [[KGB]], and by suppressing dissidents.&lt;ref&gt;Burns, John M. &quot;[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990DEED6133BF935A35752C1A965948260 The Emergence of Yuri Andropov]&quot;. ''New York Times'', 06-11-1983. Retrieved on 04-01-08&lt;/ref&gt; Andropov declared, &quot;the struggle for human rights was a part of a wide-ranging imperialist plot to undermine the foundation of the Soviet state.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Andrew&quot;&gt;[[Christopher Andrew (historian)|Christopher Andrew]] and [[Vasili Mitrokhin]]. &quot;The [[Mitrokhin Archive]]: The KGB in Europe and the West&quot;. Gardners Books, 2000. ISBN 0-14-028487-7&lt;/ref&gt; Much international tension surrounded both Soviet and American efforts to develop weapons capable of being launched from satellites in orbit. Both governments had extensive research and development programs to develop such technology. However, both nations were coming under increasing pressure to disband the project. In America, president [[Ronald Reagan]] came under pressure from a lobby of U.S. scientists and arms experts, while in Russia the government issued a statement that read, &quot;To prevent the militarization of space is one of the most urgent tasks facing mankind&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;time836&quot;/&gt;

During this period, large anti-nuclear protests were taking place across Europe and North America, while the November 20, 1983 screening of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s post-[[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]] dramatization ''[[The Day After]]'' became one of the most anticipated media events of the decade.&lt;ref&gt;Emmanuel, Susan. &quot;[http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/D/htmlD/dayafterth/dayafter.htm The Day After]&quot;. The Museum of Broadcast Communications. Retrieved on April 14, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The two superpowers had by this point abandoned their strategy of ''[[détente]]'' and in response to the Soviet deployment of [[SS-20]]s, Reagan moved to deploy [[cruise missile|cruise]] and [[Pershing II]] missiles to Europe. The Soviet Union's involvement in a [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan|war in Afghanistan]] was in its third year, a matter which was also contributing to international tension. In this atmosphere, on November 22, 1982, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine published an issue with Andropov on the cover. When Smith viewed the edition, she asked her mother, &quot;If people are so afraid of him, why doesn't someone write a letter asking whether he wants to have a war or not?&quot; Her mother replied, &quot;Why don't you?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Press |publisher=www.SamanthaSmith.info |url=http://www.samanthasmith.info/timenov22-1982.htm |accessdate=2008-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life ==

Samantha Smith was born on June 29, 1972, in the small town of [[Houlton, Maine]], on the Canada–United States border, to Jane Reed and Arthur Smith.  At the age of five, she wrote a letter to [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] to express her admiration to the monarch. When Smith had finished second grade in the spring of 1980, the family settled in [[Manchester, Maine]], where she attended Manchester Elementary School. Her father taught literature and writing at the [[University of Maine at Augusta]]&lt;ref name=&quot;time836&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,923608-2,00.html Pen Pals]&quot;. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine'', May 09, 1983. Retrieved on April 14, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; while her mother worked as a [[social worker]] with the Maine Department of Human Services.

In November 1982, when Smith was 10 years old, she wrote to Soviet leader [[Yuri Andropov]], seeking to understand why the relations between the Soviet Union and the United States were so tense:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Samantha's Letter |publisher=www.SamanthaSmith.Info |url=http://www.samanthasmith.info/samantha's_letter1.htm |accessdate=2008-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background:#fff8f8; border:1px solid gray; padding:2px;&quot;&gt;
:Dear Mr. Andropov,

:My name is Samantha Smith. I am ten years old. Congratulations on your new job. I have been worrying about Russia and the United States getting into a nuclear war. Are you going to vote to have a war or not? If you aren't please tell me how you are going to help to not have a war. This question you do not have to answer, but I would like to know why you want to conquer the world or at least our country. God made the world for us to live together in peace and not to fight.

:Sincerely,
:Samantha Smith
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Her letter was published in the Soviet newspaper ''[[Pravda]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=PRAVDA says it has letters from America |last=Chazanov |first=Mathis |work=The Philadelphia Inquirer |date=1983-04-12 |pages=E16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Samantha was happy to discover that her letter had been published; however, she had not received a reply.  She then sent a letter to the Soviet Union's Ambassador to the United States asking if Mr. Andropov intended to respond. On April 26, 1983, she received a response from Andropov:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Yuri Andropov's Response
|publisher=www.SamanthaSmith.Info |url=http://www.samanthasmith.info/andropov's_response.htm |accessdate=2008-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background:#fff8f8; border:1px solid gray; padding:2px;&quot;&gt;
:Dear Samantha,

:I received your letter, which is like many others that have reached me recently from your country and from other countries around the world.

:It seems to me – I can tell by your letter – that you are a courageous and honest girl, resembling [[List of Tom Sawyer characters#Rebecca &quot;Becky&quot; Thatcher|Becky]], the friend of [[List of characters in the Tom Sawyer series#Tom Sawyer|Tom Sawyer]] in the famous book of your compatriot [[Mark Twain]]. This book is well known and loved in our country by all boys and girls.

:You write that you are anxious about whether there will be a nuclear war between our two countries. And you ask are we doing anything so that war will not break out.

:Your question is the most important of those that every thinking man can pose. I will reply to you seriously and honestly.

:Yes, Samantha, we in the Soviet Union are trying to do everything so that there will not be war on Earth. This is what every Soviet man wants. This is what the great founder of our state, [[Vladimir Lenin]], taught us.

:Soviet people well know what a terrible thing war is. Forty-two years ago, [[Nazi Germany]], which strove for supremacy over the whole world, [[Operation Barbarossa|attacked our country]], burned and destroyed many thousands of our towns and villages, killed millions of Soviet men, women and children.

:In that war, which ended with our victory, we were in [[Allies of World War II|alliance with the United States]]: together we fought for the liberation of many people from the Nazi invaders. I hope that you know about this from your history lessons in school. And today we want very much to live in peace, to trade and cooperate with all our neighbors on this earth—with those far away and those near by. And certainly with such a great country as the United States of America.

:In America and in our country there are nuclear weapons—terrible weapons that can kill millions of people in an instant. But we do not want them to be ever used. That's precisely why the Soviet Union solemnly declared throughout the entire world that never—never—will it [[No first use|use nuclear weapons first]] against any country. In general we propose to discontinue further production of them and to proceed to the [[Nuclear disarmament|abolition of all the stockpiles]] on Earth.

:It seems to me that this is a sufficient answer to your second question: 'Why do you want to wage war against the whole world or at least the United States?' We want nothing of the kind. No one in our country– neither workers, peasants, writers nor doctors, neither grown-ups nor children, nor members of the government–want either a big or 'little' war.

:We want peace—there is something that we are occupied with: growing wheat, building and inventing, writing books and flying into space. We want peace for ourselves and for all peoples of the planet. For our children and for you, Samantha.

:I invite you, if your parents will let you, to come to our country, the best time being this summer. You will find out about our country, meet with your contemporaries, visit an international children's camp – [[Artek (camp)|Artek]] – on the sea. And see for yourself: in the Soviet Union, everyone is for peace and friendship among peoples.

:Thank you for your letter. I wish you all the best in your young life.

:Y. Andropov
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A [[media circus]] ensued, with Smith being interviewed by [[Ted Koppel]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Koppel |first=Ted  |title=A Nightline Moment From 1983 |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Nightline/Nightline25/story?id=358816 |date=2004-12-23| accessdate=2008-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Johnny Carson]], among others, and with nightly reports by the major American networks. On July 7, 1983, she  flew to Moscow with her parents, and spent two weeks as Andropov's guest. During the trip she visited Moscow and [[Leningrad]] and spent time in [[Artek (camp)|Artek]], the main Soviet pioneer camp, in the town of [[Gurzuf]] on the [[Crimea|Crimean Peninsula]]. Smith wrote in her book that in Leningrad she and her parents were amazed by the friendliness of the people and by the presents many people made for them. Speaking at a Moscow press conference, she declared that the Russians were &quot;just like us&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Krauthammer |first=Charles |title=Deep Down, We're All Alike, Right? Wrong |work=Time |date= 1983-08-15 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,949728,00.html |accessdate=2008-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Artek, Smith chose to stay with the Soviet children rather than take the privileged accommodation offered to her. For ease of communication, teachers and children with fluent English were chosen to stay in the building where she was lodged. Smith shared a dormitory with nine other girls, and spent her time there swimming, talking and learning Russian songs and dances. While there, she made many friends, including Natasha Kashirina from Leningrad, a fluent English speaker.

Andropov, however, was unable to meet with her during her visit,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Andropov Is Too Busy To Meet Maine Girl |work=The New York Times |date=1983-07-21 |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9504EED81239F932A15754C0A965948260&amp;scp=10 |accessdate=2008-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
although they did speak by telephone. It was later discovered that Andropov had become seriously ill and had withdrawn from the public eye during this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Soviet Union Sick Leave |work=Time |last=Smith |first=William E |date=1985-02-04 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,959886,00.html |accessdate=2008-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith also received a phone call from Russian cosmonaut [[Valentina Tereshkova]], the first woman to orbit the Earth. However, not realizing with whom she was speaking, Samantha mistakenly hung up after only a brief conversation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=The Philadelphia Inquirer |title= An American girl gets a telephone call from a former cosmonaut |page=A03 |date=1983-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Media followed her every step—photographs and articles about her were published by the main Soviet newspapers and magazines throughout her trip and after it. Smith became widely known to Soviet citizens and was well regarded by many of them.  In the United States, the event drew suspicion and some regarded it as an &quot;American-style public relations stunt&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Moats |first=Alice-Leone |authorlink=Alice-Leone Moats |title=Yes, Samantha, there's a Soviet bear |work=The Philadelphia Inquirer |date=1983-07-12|page=A11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith's return to the U.S. on July 22, 1983, was celebrated by the people of [[Maine]] with roses, a red carpet, and a limousine&lt;ref Name=NYTBack&gt;{{cite news |title=From Russia back to 'regular things'|date=1983-07-23 |work=The New York Times |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0CE5DC1339F930A15754C0A965948260&amp;sec=travel&amp;spon= |accessdate=2008-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and her popularity continued to grow in her native country.

Smith pursued her role as a media celebrity when in 1984, she hosted a children's special for the [[Disney Channel]] entitled ''Samantha Smith Goes To Washington...Campaign '84''.&lt;ref&gt;February 1984 issue, Disney Channel Magazine&lt;/ref&gt; The show covered politics, where Smith interviewed several candidates for the [[United States presidential election, 1984|1984 presidential election]], including [[George McGovern]] and [[Jesse Jackson]]. Her fame resulted in Smith becoming the subject of [[Stalking|stalker]] [[Robert John Bardo]], the man who would later go on to stalk and ultimately murder ''[[My Sister Sam]]'' actress [[Rebecca Schaeffer]]. Bardo took a bus to Maine in an attempt to meet Smith but was stopped by police and returned home by them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Snow |first=Robert L. |year=1998 |title=Stopping a Stalker: A Cop's Guide to Making the System Work for You |pages=72 |isbn=0-306-45785-7 |publisher=Da Capo Press |url=http://books.google.com/?id=LwBayeFbb0IC&amp;pg=PA72&amp;lpg=PA72&amp;dq=stalking+samantha+smith |accessdate=2005-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985 she co-starred with [[Robert Wagner]] in a television series called ''[[Lime Street (TV series)|Lime Street]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Samantha, SOV visitor, going on TV |work=Philadelphia Daily News |date=1985-02-25 |page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=People |last=Castro |first=Janice |journal=Time |date=1985-03-11 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,962605,00.html |accessdate=2008-03-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death ==
On August 25, 1985, Smith and her father were returning home aboard [[Bar Harbor Airlines Flight 1808]] after filming a segment for ''Lime Street''. While attempting to land at [[Auburn/Lewiston Municipal Airport|Lewiston-Auburn Regional Airport]] in [[Auburn, Maine]], the [[Beechcraft Model 99|Beechcraft 99]] commuter plane struck some trees {{convert|4007|ft|m}} short of the runway and crashed, killing all six passengers and two crew on board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Aviation Safety Network Database |url=http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19850825-0 |title=Accident report, 25 AUG 1985 |accessdate=2008-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Much speculation regarding the cause of the accident circulated afterwards.  Accusations of foul play circulated widely in the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=The Great War of Words |last=Thomas |first=Evan |work=Time Magazine |date=1985-09-09 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,959791-1,00.html |accessdate=2008-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Washington talk: U.S.-Soviet relations; Commonality at an Exhibition |work=The New York Times |date=1987-12-07 |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DEFD8103EF934A35751C1A961948260&amp;scp=54 |accessdate=2008-02-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; An investigation was undertaken in the United States and the official report—which did not show evidence of foul play—was made public. As stated in the report, the accident occurred at about 22:05 [[Eastern Daylight Time|EDT]], the ground impact point located one mile (1.6&amp;nbsp;km) south-west of the airport, at {{coord|44|02|22|N|70|17|30|W|type:event}}. The report goes on to say, &quot;The relatively steep flight path angle and the [[Yaw, pitch, and roll|attitude]] (the orientation of the aircraft relative to the horizon, direction of motion etc.) and speed of the airplane at ground impact precluded the occupants from surviving the accident.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |date=1986-09-30 |title=Aircraft Accident Report: Bar Harbor Airlines Flight 1808 Beech BE-99, N300WP Auburn-Lewiston Municipal Airport Auburn, Maine August 25, 1985 |publisher=National Transportation Safety Board |page=16 |url=http://libraryonline.erau.edu/online-full-text/ntsb/aircraft-accident-reports/AAR86-06.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2009-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main point of the report was that it was a rainy night, the pilots were inexperienced, and an accidental, but not uncommon and not usually critical, ground [[radar]] failure occurred.

Samantha Smith was mourned by about 1,000 people at her funeral in Augusta, Maine, and was eulogized in Moscow as a champion of peace. Attendees included [[Robert Wagner]] and Vladimir Kulagin of the Soviet Embassy in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], who read a personal message of condolence from [[Mikhail Gorbachev]].

&lt;blockquote&gt; &quot;Everyone in the Soviet Union who has known Samantha Smith will forever remember the image of the American girl who, like millions of Soviet young men and women, dreamt about peace, and about friendship between the peoples of the United States and the Soviet Union&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Time Magazine |title=Milestones: Samantha Smith |date=1985-09-09 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,959775,00.html |accessdate=2008-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; President Ronald Reagan sent his condolences to Smith's mother, in writing,

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Perhaps you can take some measure of comfort in the knowledge that millions of Americans, indeed millions of people, share the burdens of your grief.

Smith's contributions have been honored with a number of tributes by Russians and by the people of her home state of Maine.
