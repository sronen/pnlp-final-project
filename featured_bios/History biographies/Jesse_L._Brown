'''Jesse LeRoy Brown''' (13 October 1926 &amp;ndash; 4 December 1950) was the first [[African-American]] [[naval aviator]] in the [[United States Navy]], and the first naval officer killed in the [[Korean War]].

Born in [[Hattiesburg, Mississippi]], to an impoverished family, Brown gained an avid interest in aircraft from a young age. In an era of institutionalized [[racism]], Brown was able to graduate as [[salutatorian]] of his high school. Brown enlisted in the US Navy in 1946 and became a [[midshipman]] one year later. Brown earned his [[United States Aviator Badge|pilot wings]] on 21 October 1948 amid a flurry of press coverage. He was subsequently assigned to [[VF-32|Fighter Squadron 32]] aboard the [[USS Leyte (CV-32)|USS ''Leyte'']].

At the outset of the Korean War, the ''Leyte'' was ordered to the [[Korean Peninsula]], arriving in October 1950. Brown, an [[Ensign (rank)#United States|ensign]], flew 20 combat missions before his [[F4U Corsair]] aircraft came under fire and crashed on a remote mountaintop on 4 December 1950 during a mission supporting ground troops at the [[Battle of Chosin Reservoir]].  Brown died of his wounds in spite of efforts by wingman [[Thomas J. Hudner, Jr.]], who intentionally crashed his aircraft attempting a rescue and was later awarded the [[Medal of Honor]].

Brown's successes in the [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregated]] US military were memorialized in several books, and the frigate [[USS Jesse L. Brown (DE-1089)|USS ''Jesse L. Brown'' (DE-1089)]] was named in his honor.

== Biography ==
=== Early life ===

Jesse LeRoy Brown was born on 13 October 1926 in [[Hattiesburg, Mississippi]].&lt;ref name=&quot;FGS38&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Fannin|Gubert|Sawyer|2001|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Will60&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Williams|2003|p=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of six children born to John Brown, a [[grocer]]y warehouse worker, and Julia Lindsey Brown, a schoolteacher.&lt;ref name=&quot;DS395&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Dwight|Sewell|2009|p=395}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had four brothers, Marvin, William, Fletcher, and Lura, as well as a sister, Johnny. Brown's ancestry was [[African American]], [[Chicksaw]] and [[Choctaw]] [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Taylor23&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Taylor|2007|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family lived in a house without [[central heating]] or [[indoor plumbing]] so they relied on a [[fireplace]] for warmth. As a child, Jesse's brother William fell into this fireplace and was severely burned.&lt;ref name=&quot;FGS39&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Fannin|Gubert|Sawyer|2001|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the [[Great Depression]], John Brown lost his job and relocated the family to Palmer's Crossing, {{convert|10|mi}} from Hattiesburg, where he worked at a [[turpentine]] factory until he was laid off in 1938.&lt;ref name=&quot;Taylor26&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Taylor|2007|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Brown then moved the family to Lux, Mississippi, to be a part of a [[sharecropper]] farm.&lt;ref name=&quot;FGS39&quot;/&gt; During this time, Jesse Brown shared a bed with his brothers and attended a one-room school {{convert|3|mi}} away. His parents were very strict about school attendance and homework, and Jesse Brown walked to school every day.&lt;ref name=&quot;Taylor28&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Taylor|2007|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Browns were also committed [[Baptist Christian]]s and Jesse, William and Julia Brown sang in the [[church choir]].&lt;ref name=&quot;FGS39&quot;/&gt; In his spare time, Brown also worked in the fields of the farm harvesting [[corn]] and [[cotton]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Taylor27&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Taylor|2007|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Jesse Brown was six years old, his father took him to an [[air show]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Taylor25&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Taylor|2007|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brown gained an intense interest in flying from this experience, and afterward was attracted to a dirt airfield near his home, which he visited frequently in spite of being chased away by a local mechanic.&lt;ref name=&quot;FGS39&quot;/&gt;

At age 13, Brown took a job as a [[paperboy]] for the ''[[Pittsburgh Courier]]'', a [[black press]] paper,&lt;ref name=&quot;Taylor30&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Taylor|2007|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and developed a desire to pilot while reading in the newspaper about African-American aviators of the time including [[C. Alfred Anderson]], [[Eugine Jacques Bullard]] and [[Bessie Coleman]].&lt;ref name=&quot;FGS39&quot;/&gt; He also became an avid reader of ''[[Popular Aviation]]'' and the ''[[Chicago Defender]]'', which he later said heavily influenced his desire to fly naval aircraft.&lt;ref name=&quot;Taylor9&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Taylor|2007|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his childhood he was described as &quot;serious, witty, unassuming and very intelligent.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;DS395&quot;/&gt; In 1937, he wrote a letter to US President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] in which he complained of the injustice of African-American pilots being kept out of the [[US Army Air Corps]], to which the [[White House]] responded with a letter saying that it appreciated the viewpoint.&lt;ref name=&quot;Taylor31&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Taylor|2007|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Education ===
[[File:Jesse L. Brown 1948.jpg|thumb|Brown as a midshipman in Jacksonville, Florida in 1947|alt=A young African-American man in a military uniform.]]

In 1939, Brown lived with his aunt and attended the [[segregation in the United States|segregated]] Eureka High School in Hattiesburg, as the schools closer to his family were of lower quality.&lt;ref name=&quot;FGS39&quot;/&gt; He was a member of the [[basketball]], [[American football]], and [[track and field]] teams&lt;ref name=&quot;DS395&quot;/&gt; and an excellent student, graduating as the [[salutatorian]] in 1944.&lt;ref name=&quot;Will60&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;FGS39&quot;/&gt; During this time, he met Daisy Pearl Nix, and the two began to date. They would marry during Brown's military training in 1947.&lt;ref name=&quot;FGS39&quot;/&gt; In the meantime, the two wrote letters to one another almost daily.&lt;ref name=&quot;Taylor8&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Taylor|2007|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following graduation, Jesse Brown sought to enroll in a college outside of the [[Southern United States|South]]. His principal, Nathaniel Burger, advised he attend an all-black college, as his brother Marvin Brown had done. However, he ended up enrolling in [[Ohio State University]] as his childhood role model, [[Jesse Owens]], had done. Burger told Brown only seven African-Americans had graduated from the school that year but Brown was nonetheless determined to enroll, feeling he would compete well with white students.&lt;ref name=&quot;FGS40&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Fannin|Gubert|Sawyer|2001|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brown took several side jobs to save money for college, including waiting tables at the Holmes Club, a saloon for white [[US Army]] soldiers. In this job, Brown was frequently the target of [[racist]] verbal abuse but nonetheless continued the job, earning $600 to pay for college.&lt;ref name=&quot;FGS40&quot;/&gt; In autumn 1944, Brown took a segregated train to [[Columbus, Ohio]], and began school at Ohio State.&lt;ref name=&quot;Taylor8&quot;/&gt;

Brown moved into an on-campus [[boarding house]] at 61 E. Eleventh Avenue in the primarily black neighborhood of Columbus' University District,&lt;ref name=&quot;Taylor10&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Taylor|2007|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and majored in [[architectural engineering]]. Brown attempted several times to apply to the school's [[aviation]] program but was denied because of his race.&lt;ref name=&quot;Taylor12&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Taylor|2007|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brown joined the track and field team as well as the [[wrestling]] team, but soon dropped both for financial reasons. He took a job as a janitor at a local [[Lazarus (department store)|Lazarus]] [[department store]] and then was hired by the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] to a job loading [[boxcar]]s from 15:30 to midnight each day.&lt;ref name=&quot;FGS40&quot;/&gt; In spite of this, he maintained top marks in his classes.&lt;ref name=&quot;DS395&quot;/&gt; Facing difficulties with his academics and institutional segregation in the city, Brown nevertheless found most of his fellow students were friendly toward him.&lt;ref name=&quot;Taylor11&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Taylor|2007|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brown rarely returned to Mississippi during the school year but in the summers he worked at a [[dry cleaner]] in Hattiesburg to help pay for his classes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Taylor15&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Taylor|2007|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his second year in college, Brown learned of the V-5 [[Aviation Cadet Training Program (USN)|Aviation Cadet Training Program]] being conducted by the [[US Navy]] to commission [[naval aviation]] pilots.&lt;ref name=&quot;Will60&quot;/&gt; This program operated at 52 colleges, none of which were predominately black colleges, so only students like Brown who attended integrated colleges were eligible.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacGregor246&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|MacGregor|1981|pp=246–247}}&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of resistance from recruiters, Brown passed the entrance exams.&lt;ref name=&quot;FGS40&quot;/&gt; Brown enlisted in the [[US Naval Reserve]] on 8 July 1946&lt;ref name=&quot;DS395&quot;/&gt; and was admitted to the aviation program, becoming a [[Seaman Apprentice]] in the US Navy and a member of the school's [[Naval Reserve Officers' Training Corps]] (NROTC) program. A $50 monthly stipend  allowed him to quit his jobs and complete his architectural engineering degree in 1947.&lt;ref name=&quot;FGS40&quot;/&gt; The NROTC was at this time the normal route to a regular Naval commission, but only 14 out of over 5,600 NROTC students in 1947 were black.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacGregor246&quot;/&gt;

=== Military career ===
On 15 March 1947, Brown reported to [[Glenview Naval Air Station]] in [[Glenview, Cook County, Illinois|Glenview, Illinois]], for [[Naval Flight Officer]] training.&lt;ref name=&quot;DS395&quot;/&gt; There, his enlistment ended 15 April and Brown reverted to the rank of [[midshipman]], becoming the only African American in the program. Although he anticipated antagonism, he found the other cadets were generally friendly and welcoming of him.&lt;ref name=&quot;FGS40&quot;/&gt; However, he found many of the black cooks and janitors hostile to him, possibly due to jealousy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Taylor38&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Taylor|2007|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brown got his first flight time aboard a [[Stearman N2S]] [[trainer aircraft]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Taylor42&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Taylor|2007|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jesse L. Brown Commissioned.jpg|thumb|Brown is commissioned aboard the USS ''Leyte'' in 1949.|left|alt=Three man stand on the deck of a ship, one with his arm raised and another reading from a paper.]]

In spite of the rigors of the initial training, Brown was encouraged by instructors and completed the first phase of training, transferring to [[Ottumwa Naval Air Station]] in [[Ottumwa, Iowa]], for the next phase.&lt;ref name=&quot;DS395&quot;/&gt; The Ottumwa training involved intense physical fitness and technical training, which Brown completed.&lt;ref name=&quot;FGS40&quot;/&gt; Thereafter he was moved to [[Pensacola Naval Air Station]] in [[Pensacola, Florida]], to train in aircraft flight. In Pensacola, Brown and Nix married in secret, as Naval Cadets were not allowed to marry until their training was complete, under threat of immediate dismissal. Nix took a room in Pensacola, and the two visited one another on weekends.&lt;ref name=&quot;FGS41&quot;/&gt; In spite of overt racism from at least one instructor and several classmates at this posting,&lt;ref name=&quot;DS395&quot;/&gt; Brown completed the rigorous training in August 1947.&lt;ref name=&quot;FGS41&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Fannin|Gubert|Sawyer|2001|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By June 1948, Brown had begun training for [[carrier-based aircraft]] aboard the [[USS Wright (CVL-49)|USS ''Wright'']].&lt;ref name=&quot;Taylor161&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Taylor|2007|p=161}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brown hoped to qualify aboard the [[F4U Corsair]] or the [[F6F Hellcat]].&lt;!-- Clarify.  Did he hope to qualify for carrier landings, in the Hellcat or Corsair? --&gt; After he completed this training, he was moved to [[Jacksonville, Florida]], for his final flight qualifications. On 21 October 1948, he completed his training and was and given his [[Naval Aviator Badge]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Will60&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;DS395&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;FGS41&quot;/&gt; This accomplishment was widely publicized, and Brown became nationally known. The [[Associated Press]] profiled him and his photo appeared in [[Life Magazine|''Life'' magazine]]. Author [[Theodore Taylor (author)|Theodore Taylor]] later wrote that through Brown's efforts to become a pilot, he had broken the &quot;[[color barrier]]&quot; which had been longstanding for blacks in naval aviation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Taylorxii&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Taylor|2007|p=xii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following his commissioning, Brown was assigned to temporary duty at [[Norfolk Naval Air Station]] in [[Norfolk, Virginia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Taylor181&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Taylor|2007|p=181}}&lt;/ref&gt; His daughter, Pamela Elise Brown, was born in December.&lt;ref name=&quot;FGS41&quot;/&gt; In January 1949, Brown was assigned to [[VF-32|Fighter Squadron 32]] aboard the [[USS Leyte (CV-32)|USS ''Leyte'' (CV-32)]].&lt;ref name=&quot;FGS41&quot;/&gt; Over the next 18 months, the unit conducted numerous training exercises along the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]], many of them taking place at [[Quonset Point]]. Brown reported here his superiors treated him fairly and held others to equal standards. The unit trained rigorously in aircraft maneuvers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Taylor185&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Taylor|2007|p=185}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brown was [[Commissioned officer|commissioned]] as an [[ensign]] in the US Navy on 26 April 1949.&lt;ref name=&quot;Will60&quot;/&gt; He was assigned to [[Naval Air Station Quonset Point|Quonset Point Naval Air Station]] in [[Quonset, Rhode Island]],&lt;ref name=&quot;FGS41&quot;/&gt; as a part of the [[US Atlantic Fleet]]. Brown reported that incidents of racism and discrimination which had been harsh late in his training were substantially relieved once he became an officer.&lt;ref name=&quot;DS395&quot;/&gt; By the outbreak of the [[Korean War]], he had gained a reputation among the others in the squadron as an experienced pilot and capable section leader.&lt;ref name=&quot;DS396&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Dwight|Sewell|2009|p=396}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was well-liked among other pilots and the black stewards and support staff of the carrier. However, Brown did not socialize much with the other pilots, and was known to spend as much time as possible visiting his wife, as he was allowed to reveal his marriage following his commissioning.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith120&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|2004|p=120}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Till209&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Tillman|2002|p=209}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Korean War ===
[[File:Jesse L. Brown in cockpit.jpg|thumb|Brown in the cockpit of his F4U Corsair in Korea in late 1950]]
{{See also|Initial phase of the Korean War}}

On the night of 25 June 1950, ten divisions of the [[North Korean People's Army]] launched a full-scale invasion of the nation's neighbor to the south, the [[Republic of Korea]]. The force of 89,000&amp;nbsp;men moved in six columns, catching the [[Republic of Korea Army]] by surprise, resulting in a rout. The smaller South Korean army suffered from widespread lack of organization and equipment, and was unprepared for war.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Alexander|2003|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The numerically superior North Korean forces destroyed isolated resistance from the 38,000&amp;nbsp;South Korean soldiers on the front before it began moving steadily south.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Alexander|2003|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of South Korea's forces retreated in the face of the invasion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Apple36&quot;/&gt; The North Koreans were well on their way to South Korea's capital of [[Seoul]] within hours, forcing the government and its shattered army to retreat further south.&lt;ref name=&quot;Apple36&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To prevent South Korea's collapse the [[United Nations Security Council]] voted [[UNSCR 82|to send military forces]]. The United States' [[United States Seventh Fleet|Seventh Fleet]] dispatched [[Task Force 77 (U.S. Navy)|Task Force 77]], led by the [[fleet carrier]] [[USS Valley Forge (CV-45)|USS ''Valley Forge'']]; the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Far East Fleet]] dispatched several ships, including [[HMS Triumph (R16)|HMS ''Triumph'']], to provide air and naval support.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Malkasian|2001|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the navies blockaded North Korea and launched aircraft to delay the North Korean forces, these efforts alone did not stop the North Korean Army juggernaut on its southern advance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Malk24&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Malkasian|2001|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; US President [[Harry S. Truman]] ordered ground troops into the country to supplement the air support.&lt;ref name=&quot;Var3&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Varhola|2000|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; All US Navy units, including the ''Leyte'', were placed on alert.&lt;ref name=&quot;FGS41&quot;/&gt; At the time, the ship was in the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and Brown did not expect to be deployed to Korea, but on 8 August a relief carrier arrived in the area and the ''Leyte'' was ordered to Korea.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith117&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|2004|p=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commanders felt the pilots on the carrier were better trained, and hence needed in the theater. The ship sailed from the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] across the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and to Quonset, then through the [[Panama Canal]] and [[San Diego, California]], [[Hawaii]], and [[Japan]] before arriving in Korea around 8 October.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith118&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|2004|p=118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ship joined Task Force 77 off the northeast coast of the [[Korean Peninsula]], part of a fleet of 17 ships from the Seventh Fleet, including the [[aircraft carrier]] [[USS Philippine Sea (CV-47)|USS ''Philippine Sea'']], [[battleship]] [[USS Missouri (BB-63)|USS ''Missouri'']] and [[cruiser]] [[USS Juneau (CL-119)|USS ''Juneau'']].&lt;ref name=&quot;Taylor1&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Taylor|2007|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brown flew 20 missions in-country.&lt;ref name=&quot;FGS41&quot;/&gt; These missions included attacks on communication lines, troop concentrations and military installations around [[Wonsan]], [[Chongpu]], [[Songjim]] and [[Senanju]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DS396&quot;/&gt;

Following the entrance of the [[People's Republic of China]] into the war in late November 1950, Brown and his squadron were dispatched to the [[Chosin Reservoir]], where an [[Battle of Chosin Reservoir|intense campaign]] was being fought between the [[People's Volunteer Army]] and the [[US X Corps]].&lt;ref name=&quot;FGS41&quot;/&gt; Almost 100,000 Chinese troops had surrounded 15,000 US troops, and Brown and other pilots on the ''Leyte'' flew dozens of [[close air support]] missions every day to prevent the Chinese from overrunning the US troops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Taylor2&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Taylor|2007|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Will61&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Williams|2003|p=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Death ===
{{main|Battle of Chosin Reservoir}}

[[File:Thomas J Hudner 1950.jpg|thumb|[[Thomas J. Hudner, Jr.]], Brown's wingman, who was awarded the [[Medal of Honor]] for attempting to save him|left]]

On 4 December 1950, Brown was part of a six-aircraft flight supporting [[US Marine Corps]] ground troops who were trapped by Chinese forces.&lt;ref name=&quot;DS397&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Dwight|Sewell|2009|p=397}}&lt;/ref&gt; At 13:38 [[Korea Standard Time|KST]], Brown took off from the ''Leyte'' with squadron [[executive officer]] [[Lieutenant Commander]] Dick Cevoli, [[lieutenant (navy)|Lieutenant]] George Hudson, Lieutenant Junior Grade Bill Koenig, Ensign Ralph McQueen and [[Lieutenant Junior Grade]] [[Thomas J. Hudner, Jr.]], who was Brown's [[wingman]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Taylor3&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Taylor|2007|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this flight, Brown had the call sign &quot;Iroquois 13&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Taylor6&quot;/&gt;  The flight traveled {{convert|100|mi}} from the Task Force's location to the Chosin Reservoir, flying 35 to 40 minutes through very harsh wintery conditions to the vicinity of the villages of Yudam-ni and Hagaru-ri. The flight began searching for targets along the west side of the reservoir, lowering altitude to {{convert|700|ft}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Taylor4&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Taylor|2007|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mission was a three-hour [[search and destroy]] flight as well as an attempt to probe Chinese troop strength in the area.&lt;ref name=&quot;Till209&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith121&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|2004|p=121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the flight spotted no Chinese, at 14:40 Koenig radioed that Brown appeared to be trailing fuel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith121&quot;/&gt; The damage had likely come by [[small arms]] fire from Chinese infantry, who were known to hide in the snow and ambush passing aircraft by firing in unison.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith120&quot;/&gt; At least one bullet had ruptured a fuel line. Brown, losing fuel pressure and increasingly unable to control the aircraft, dropped his [[external fuel tank]]s and rockets and attempted to land the craft in a snow-covered clearing on the side of a mountain. Brown crashed into a bowl-shaped valley at approximately {{coord|40|36|N|127|06|E}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith121&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Taylor5&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Taylor|2007|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aircraft broke up violently upon impact and was destroyed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Taylor6&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Taylor|2007|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the crash, Brown's leg was pinned beneath the [[fuselage]] of the aircraft, and he stripped off his helmet and gloves in an attempt to free himself, before waving to the other pilots, who were circling close overhead.&lt;ref name=&quot;FGS41&quot;/&gt; The other pilots had thought he had died in the crash.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith121&quot;/&gt; Brown had [[crash landing|crash-landed]] near Somong-ni, {{convert|15|mi}} behind Chinese lines in {{convert|15|°F|°C}} weather,&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith122&quot;/&gt; and the other pilots began a [[Mayday]] radio to any heavy transport aircraft in the area as they canvassed the mountain for any sign of Chinese ground forces who might threaten Brown.&lt;ref name=&quot;Taylor7&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Taylor|2007|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; They received a signal that a rescue helicopter would come as soon as possible, but Brown's aircraft was smoking and a fire had started near its internal fuel tanks.&lt;ref name=&quot;Till209&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith122&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|2004|p=122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hudner attempted in vain to rescue Brown by radioing him instructions for escaping his damaged aircraft, before it became clear Brown was seriously injured. Hudner then intentionally crash-landed his aircraft, ran to Brown's side and attempted to wrestle him free from the wreck. While Brown's condition worsened by the minute, Hudner attempted in vain to drown the aircraft fire in snow and pull Brown from the aircraft. In great pain, Brown began slipping in and out of consciousness.&lt;ref name=&quot;Will61&quot;/&gt; A rescue helicopter arrived around 15:00; its pilot Lieutenant Charles Ward and Hudner were unable to put out the engine fire with a [[fire extinguisher]], and tried unsuccessfully to free Brown with an axe for 45 minutes. They even considered, at Brown's request, amputating his trapped leg.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith123&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|2004|p=123}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brown lost consciousness shortly thereafter. His last known words to Hudner were, &quot;Tell Daisy I love her.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;FGS41&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Will61&quot;/&gt; The helicopter, which was unable to operate in the darkness, was forced to return to base at nightfall with Hudner, leaving Brown behind. Brown is believed to have died shortly thereafter of his injuries and exposure to the extreme cold. No Chinese forces threatened the site, likely owing to the heavy air presence of Brown and Hudner's unit.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith124&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|2004|p=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hudner begged superiors to allow him to return to the wreck to help extract Brown, but he was not allowed, as other officers feared an ambush of the vulnerable helicopters resulting in casualties. To prevent the body and the aircraft from falling into Chinese or North Korean hands, the US Navy bombed the aircraft with [[napalm]] two days later, reportedly reciting the [[Lord's Prayer]] over the radio as they watched Brown's body consumed by flames.&lt;ref name=&quot;Will62&quot;/&gt; The pilots observed that Brown's body was still stuck in the aircraft, but his clothes were gone. The remains of both Brown and the aircraft were never recovered.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith125&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|2004|p=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brown was the first US Navy officer killed in the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;Will62&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Williams|2003|p=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ecker|2004|p=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For his actions in Korea leading up to his death, Brown was awarded the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United States)|Distinguished Flying Cross]], the [[Purple Heart Medal]] and the [[Air Medal]].&lt;ref name=&quot;FGS38&quot;/&gt; For the failed rescue attempt, Hudner received the [[Medal of Honor]], the highest valor award presented by the [[US military]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith115&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|2004|p=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Till208&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Tillman|2002|p=208}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ecker|2004|p=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brown's shipmates memorialized him in a shipwide newspaper as &quot;a Christian soldier, a gentleman, a shipmate and friend&amp;nbsp;... His courage and faith&amp;nbsp;... shone like a beacon for all to see.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;FGS41&quot;/&gt; As word of his death spread, Brown inspired numerous other African Americans to become pilots, notably Seaman Apprentice [[Frank E. Petersen]]. Petersen would become the first African-American Marine Corps aviator and the first African-American Marine Corps general, graduating from the Naval Aviation Training Program in 1952 and retiring from the military after 38 years in 1988 with the rank of [[Lieutenant General (United States)|lieutenant general]].&lt;ref name=&quot;FGS41&quot;/&gt;

On 17 February 1973, the Navy commissioned the [[Knox class frigate|''Knox''-class frigate]] [[USS Jesse L. Brown (DE-1089)|USS ''Jesse L. Brown'' (DE-1089)]], the first US ship named in honor of an African American. Present at the commissioning ceremony in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], were Daisy Brown Thorne (who had remarried), Pamela Brown, and Hudner, who gave a dedication.&lt;ref name=&quot;FGS41&quot;/&gt; The ship was decommissioned on 27 July 1994 and sold to [[Egypt]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Will62&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;FGS42&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Fannin|Gubert|Sawyer|2001|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An extensive biography of Brown was later compiled by author [[Theodore Taylor (author)|Theodore Taylor]], who had served in Korea and had been deeply moved by the news of Brown's death at the time. Taylor interviewed many of Brown's closest friends and family and consulted Daisy Brown's personal diary and records from the ''Leyte'''s ship log while preparing his 300-page book, published in 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;Taylorxiii&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Taylor|2007|p=xiii}}&lt;/ref&gt;
