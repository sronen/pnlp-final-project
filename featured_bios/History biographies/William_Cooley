'''William Cooley''' (1783–1863) was one of the first American [[settler]]s, and a regional leader, in what is now known as [[Broward County, Florida|Broward County]], in the US state of Florida. His family was killed by [[Seminole]]s in 1836, during the [[Second Seminole War]]. The attack, known as the &quot;New River Massacre&quot;, caused immediate abandonment of the area by whites.&lt;ref name=BrowardLegacyKirk1&gt;{{cite journal

Cooley was born in [[Maryland]], but little else is known about his life prior to 1813, when he arrived in [[East Florida]] as part of a military expedition. He established himself as a farmer in the northern part of the territory before moving south, where he traded with local [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indians]] and continued to farm. He sided with natives in a land dispute against a merchant who had received a large grant from the [[King of Spain]] and was evicting the Indians from their lands. Unhappy with the actions of the Spanish, he moved to the [[New River (Broward County, Florida)|New River]] area in 1826 to get as far as possible from the Spanish influence.&lt;ref name=BrowardLegacyKirk1/&gt;

In New River, Cooley sustained himself as a salvager and farmer, cultivating and milling [[Zamia integrifolia|arrowroot]]. His fortune and influence grew: he became the first lawman and judge in the settlement, besides being a land appraiser. Local Indians held him responsible for what they saw as a misjudgment involving the murder of one of their chiefs and attacked the settlement in revenge on January 4, 1836.&lt;ref name=BrowardLegacyKirk1/&gt;

Cooley survived the attack and lived for a further {{nowrap|twenty-seven years}}. He held administrative positions in [[Miami-Dade County, Florida|Dade County]],&lt;ref name=BrowardLegacyKirk2&gt;{{cite journal

==New River settlement==
[[Image:William Cooley Map.png|300px|left|thumb|William Cooley timeline, mapped]]

Like the other New River settlers, Cooley did not buy land; he simply occupied the land in hope that the United States would eventually survey the area and grant ownership to the present settlers. The settlement was primarily populated by [[Bahamas|Bahamians]], who survived by [[Turtling (hunting)|turtling]], fishing, [[shipbuilding]] and [[Wrecking (shipwreck)|wrecking]].&lt;ref name=BrowardLegacyKirk1/&gt;

In 1830, Frankee Lewis, who in 1788 had been one of the area's first settlers,&lt;ref name=frankee&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.broward.org/history/timeline.htm|title=Broward Milestones|author=Broward County Historical Commission|accessdate=June 23, 2007| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070427135734/http://www.broward.org/history/timeline.htm| archivedate = April 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; sold her business interests to Richard Fitzpatrick. After Fitzpatrick's arrival, the settlement of approximately {{nowrap|70 people}} prospered with the introduction of a [[Plantation (settlement or colony)|plantation]] regimen based on [[Slavery in Colonial America#The first African slaves|black slavery]].&lt;ref name=BrowardLegacyKirk1/&gt;

Cooley's main occupation was gathering, processing and shipping [[arrowroot]], a starch made from the root of the [[Zamia integrifolia|coontie]] plant. Arrowroot was used to make bread dough, wafers and biscuits; its resistance to spoilage made it especially favored for use on ships. Pulp remaining after processing was used as a fertilizer or for animal rations. Favorable conditions for arrowroot cultivation contributed to the presence of several hundred Indians in the area—arrowroot being a staple of their diet.&lt;ref name=BrowardLegacyKirk1/&gt; The market price for the starch was {{nowrap|between 8US$ and 16¢ per pound}} (between 17¢ and 35¢ per kg), and the geography of the river and the good performance of his machinery—the output was close to {{nowrap|450 lb (200 kg) per day}}—brought Cooley great prosperity. His good fortune allowed him to dedicate much of his time to exploration of the area as far north as [[Lake Okeechobee]] and brought him increasing political influence.&lt;ref name=BrowardLegacyKirk1/&gt; It is likely that he married Nancy Dayton, a former Indian captive, on December 2, 1830.&lt;ref name=MarrRecord&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ancestry.com|quote=WILLIAM COOLEY/NANCY DAYTON/2 Dec 1830/Monroe/FL|title=Dodd, Jordan R, et al.

[[Image:Frankee Lewis Lands New River FL.PNG|thumb|Frankee Lewis lands, New River Settlement]]

While trade and farming activities were prominent, wrecking was the most important economic activity in the settlement. Northern newspapers started a campaign against wrecking in 1832, claiming that the activity was just a disguise for piracy; the {{nowrap|33 percent salvager's fee}} underscored their claim. Cooley, already in charge of overseeing [[Wrecking (shipwreck)|wrecking]], received a territorial appointment as [[appraiser]] of the sunk vessels and their cargoes. The strength of [[hurricane]] seasons affected the activity, and the especially active [[1830-1839 Atlantic hurricane seasons#1835 Atlantic hurricane season|1835 season]] brought even bigger profits.&lt;ref name=BrowardLegacyKirk1/&gt;

By 1835, Cooley had two sons and one daughter. The boys were named Almonock and Montezuma, after two local Indian chiefs. His ten-year-old daughter and his nine-year-old son were tutored by the couple Mary E. Rigby and Joseph Flinton.&lt;ref name=BrowardLegacyKirk1/&gt;

Cooley was appointed as an appraiser of property and [[slavery|slaves]] for Union Bank of Florida. His ally, Richard Fitzpatrick, purchased his coontie and [[citrus]] plantation on the Miami River for $2,500. Subsequently, Fitzpatrick was elected as representative for [[Monroe County, Florida|Monroe County]] to the [[Florida Legislature|Territorial Legislative Council]]. The unanimous vote for Fitzpatrick in New River was questioned by the ''Key West Inquirer''. Cooley's conduct was implicitly questioned as well, since as Justice of the Peace, Cooley conducted the non-secret [[ballot]]ing. In [[Key West, Florida|Key West]], Fitzpatrick lost to William Hackley.&lt;ref name=BrowardLegacyKirk1/&gt;

The Cooley property in New River had a house that was &quot;twenty feet by fifty feet [6 by 15&amp;nbsp;m], one story high, built of [[cypress]] logs, sealed and floored with 1-1/2 inch [4&amp;nbsp;cm] planks&quot;.&lt;ref name=BrowardLegacyKirk1/&gt; At least three black slaves and several Indians cultivated sugar cane, corn, potatoes, pumpkins and other vegetables on the twenty-acre (eight-hectare) property, which also had a pen with eighty [[Pig|hogs]]. The coontie [[watermill]] was twenty-seven by fourteen&amp;nbsp;feet {{nowrap|(eight by four meters)}}. His Key West holdings included a factory, two storage houses, kitchen and slave quarters; [[coconut]], [[Lime (fruit)|lime]] and orange trees; and domesticated and wild [[fowl]].&lt;ref name=BrowardLegacyKirk1/&gt;

==New River Massacre==

===Buildup===
{{see also|Second Seminole War|Dade Massacre}}
[[Image:Wreckers Florida Keys.jpg|thumb|[[Florida Keys]] wreckers]]

Cooley maintained friendly relations and trade with the Seminole Indians in the area. In the early nineteenth century, [[Creek people|Creek Indians]] had moved from Alabama and joined the Seminoles. In 1835, white settlers killed Creek chief Alibama and burned his hut in a dispute. As Justice of the Peace, Cooley jailed the settlers, but they were released due to insufficient evidence after a hearing at the [[Monroe County, Florida|Monroe County]] Court in Key West. The Creek people blamed Cooley, saying he withheld evidence. The growing uneasiness between the Creeks and the whites led to the Creeks' emigration to the Okeechobee area.&lt;ref name=BrowardLegacyKirk1/&gt;

[[Francis L. Dade|Major Francis L. Dade]], military commandant at Key West, received intelligence that [[Cuba]] and Spain were arming the Indians; investigations did not confirm the rumor. Reports coming from [[Fort Brooke]], near present-day [[Tampa]], noted that Indians in the area were resisting orders from the federal government to emigrate to [[Mississippi]], contradicting the assertions made by the federal authorities that the Indians had agreed to emigrate peacefully. Dade, two companies of soldiers, and all of the available arms were sent to Fort Brooke at [[Tampa Bay]], the port designated for the commencement of the Indians' emigration. The Indians answered by concentrating all of their forces in the New River region.&lt;ref name=BrowardLegacyKirk1/&gt; On December 28, 1835, Dade and 107&amp;nbsp;soldiers were ambushed en route from Tampa Bay to [[Fort King]], near present-day [[Ocala]].

[[Image:William Cooley Attack+Cleaned.png|thumb|Attack on New River Settlement in a contemporary rendition]]

Six days later, Cooley led a large expedition to free the ''Gil Blas'', a ship that had beached the previous year. The scale of the operation required all of the settlement's able men. On the next day, January 4, 1836, the Indians attacked the settlement.&lt;ref name=BrowardLegacyKirk1/&gt;

Between fifteen and twenty Indians invaded the Cooley house, overpowering the tutor and [[scalping]] him. Cooley's wife grabbed their infant son and tried to run to the river, but was shot about {{convert|170|yd|m|0}} from the house. The shot killed her and the baby.

[[Image:Cape Florida 1830.jpg|thumb|Cape Florida Lighthouse c. 1830|right]]

After the attack, the Indians torched the house and left without attacking other dwellings. The next day, Cooley came back to bury the dead; it is unclear who alerted the salvager's team to the attack.&lt;ref name=BrowardLegacyKirk1/&gt; After staying at the settlement for three days, Cooley went to the [[Cape Florida Light]]house. One of the missing slaves appeared, reporting that he recognized the assailants as having been acquaintances of the Cooley family.

When Cooley arrived at Indian Key, he was informed that Indians had attempted to acquire arms and munition but had been repelled by the garrison in the island's fort.

==After New River==

Cooley resumed his life as a wrecker. Later that same year, he worked again as justice of the peace and assumed a position as a legislatively&lt;!--LOCE:what does this word mean??--&gt;-appointed auctioneer.&lt;ref name=BrowardLegacyKirk2/&gt;

Constant attacks and rumor-spreading amplified the demands of Floridian community leaders, forcing the Navy to send Lieutenant Levin M. Powell to Key West. Lieutenant Powell built a small force of {{nowrap|fifty seamen}}, {{nowrap|ninety-five marines}}, and {{nowrap|eight officers}}, reinforced by {{nowrap|two schooners}} and the United States Cutter
''Washington'', commanded by Captain Day. Powell called Cooley to be his guide in the enterprise because of his knowledge of Indian leaders and customs. Powell had mixed success, although by December 1836 the situation was under control at the coasts. Cooley went back to his usual duties in Indian Key ([[Miami-Dade County, Florida|Dade County]] Seat); not long after, he moved to Tampa&lt;ref name=BrowardLegacyKirk2/&gt; but still worked occasionally as a guide.

General [[Thomas Jesup]], headquartered in Fort Dade, made Cooley an express rider in early 1837 to deliver messages between [[Tampa Bay]] and [[Middleburg, Florida#History|Fort Heilman]], a corridor of {{convert|170|mi|km|-1}}.&lt;ref name=BrowardLegacyKnetch1/&gt; That same year, reports circulated that Cooley was spreading rumors about a Seminole chief leading a rebellion involving black slaves and Indians. Afraid that Cooley could be directly involved, the general had him interrogated. Afterwards, a disgusted Cooley resigned his position.&lt;ref name=BrowardLegacyKirk2/&gt;

Cooley befriended Captain William Bunce, a retailer striving to keep Indians in the area, as they represented a source of cheap labor. He became involved again in local politics, this time against General Jesup, who wanted to remove all Indians from Florida. Judge Steele, a newcomer from Connecticut, was Cooley's ally in this fight.&lt;ref name=BrowardLegacyKirk2/&gt;
