'''John Dee''' (13 July 1527–1608 or 1609) was an English [[mathematics|mathematician]], [[astronomy|astronomer]], [[astrology|astrologer]], [[occultism|occultist]], [[navigation|navigator]], [[imperialist]]&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot;&gt;{{cite web|authorlink=Julian Roberts|author=Roberts, R. Julian|title=Dee, John (1527–1609)|work=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=2004; online edition, May 2006|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/7418|accessdate=6 December 2011|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/7418}} ({{ODNBsub}}).&lt;/ref&gt; and consultant to [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]]. He devoted much of his life to the study of [[alchemy]], [[divination]] and [[Hermeticism|Hermetic philosophy]].

Dee straddled the worlds of science and [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] just as they were becoming distinguishable. One of the most learned men of his age, he had been invited to lecture on advanced [[algebra]] at the [[University of Paris]] while still in his early twenties.  Dee was an ardent promoter of mathematics and a respected astronomer, as well as a leading expert in [[navigation]], having trained many of those who would conduct England's [[Age of Exploration#Northern European involvement|voyages of discovery]].

Simultaneously with these efforts, Dee immersed himself in the worlds of [[magic (paranormal)|magic]], [[astrology]] and [[Hermeticism|Hermetic philosophy]]. He devoted much time and effort in the last thirty years or so of his life to attempting to commune with [[angels]] in order to learn the [[universal language]] of creation and bring about the pre-apocalyptic unity of mankind. A student of the [[Renaissance Neo-Platonism]] of [[Marsilio Ficino]], Dee did not draw distinctions between his mathematical research and his investigations into Hermetic magic, angel summoning and divination. Instead he considered all of his activities to constitute different facets of the same quest: the search for a transcendent understanding of the divine [[forms]] which underlie the visible world, which Dee called &quot;pure verities&quot;.

In his lifetime Dee amassed one of the largest libraries in England. His high status as a scholar also allowed him to play a role in Elizabethan politics. He served as an occasional adviser and tutor to Elizabeth I and nurtured relationships with her ministers [[Francis Walsingham]] and [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley|William Cecil]]. Dee also tutored and enjoyed patronage relationships with Sir [[Philip Sidney]], his uncle [[Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester]], and [[Edward Dyer]]. He also enjoyed patronage from [[Sir Christopher Hatton]].

==Biography==
=== Early life ===
Dee was born in Tower Ward, London, to a [[Wales|Welsh]] family. He was the only child of his parents: Rowland, who was a [[mercer (occupation)|mercer]] and minor [[courtier]], and Joan, who was the daughter of William Wild.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot;/&gt;

Dee attended the [[Chelmsford]] Catholic School from 1535 (now [[King Edward VI Grammar School (Chelmsford)]]), then – from November 1542 to 1546 – [[St John's College, Cambridge|St. John's College]], Cambridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Venn|id=DY542J|name=Dee, John}}&lt;/ref&gt; His great abilities were recognised, and he was made a founding fellow of [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]], where the clever stage effects he produced for a production of [[Aristophanes]]' [[Peace (play)|''Peace'']] procured him the reputation of being a magician that clung to him through life. In the late 1540s and early 1550s, he travelled in Europe, studying at [[Katholieke Universiteit Leuven|Leuven]] (1548) and [[Brussels]] and lecturing in Paris on [[Euclid]]. He studied with [[Gemma Frisius]] and became a close friend of the [[cartography|cartographer]] [[Gerardus Mercator]], returning to England with an important collection of mathematical and astronomical instruments. In 1552, he met [[Gerolamo Cardano]] in London: during their acquaintance they investigated a [[perpetual motion machine]] as well as a gem purported to have magical properties.&lt;ref name=&quot;GC&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=De Vita Propria (The Book of My Life)|author=Gerolamo Cardano (trans. by Jean Stoner)|location=New York|publisher=New York Review of Books|year=2002|nopp=true|page=viii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--Can't find a ref for this: Dee was offered a readership in mathematics at Oxford University in 1554, which he declined, citing English universities' emphasis on [[rhetoric]] and [[grammar]] (which, together with [[logic]], formed the [[academia|academic]] ''[[trivium]]'') over philosophy and science (the more advanced ''[[quadrivium]]'', comprised of [[arithmetic]], [[geometry]], music and [[astronomy]]) as offensive.--&gt;Rector at [[Upton-upon-Severn]] from 1553, Dee was offered a readership in mathematics at [[Oxford University|Oxford]] in 1554, which he declined; he was occupied with writing and perhaps hoped for a better position at court.&lt;ref name=&quot;CFS&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=Fell Smith, Charlotte|year=1909|title=John Dee: 1527–1608|location=London|publisher=Constable and Company|url=http://www.johndee.org/charlotte/}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1555, Dee became a member of the [[Worshipful Company of Mercers]], as his father had, through the company's system of [[Property|patrimony]].&lt;ref name=&quot;RM&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.adam-matthew-publications.co.uk/digital_guides/ren_man_series1_prt1/chronology.aspx|work=Renaissance Man: The Reconstructed Libraries of European Scholars: 1450–1700 Series One: The Books and Manuscripts of John Dee, 1527–1608|title=A John Dee Chronology, 1509–1609|editor=[[Julian Roberts]]|publisher=Adam Matthew Publications|year=2005|accessdate=27 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That same year, 1555, he was arrested and charged with &quot;calculating&quot; for having cast [[horoscope]]s of [[Mary I of England|Queen Mary]] and [[Elizabeth I of England|Princess Elizabeth]]; the charges were expanded to [[treason]] against Mary.&lt;ref name=&quot;CFS&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mortlake&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Mortlake|journal=The Environs of London: County of Surrey|volume=1|year=1792|pages=364–88| url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=45385|accessdate=27 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dee appeared in the [[Star Chamber]] and exonerated himself, but was turned over to the Catholic [[Edmund Bonner|Bishop Bonner]] for religious examination. His strong and lifelong penchant for secrecy perhaps worsening matters, this entire episode was only the most dramatic in a series of attacks and slanders that would dog Dee throughout his life. Clearing his name yet again, he soon became a close associate of Bonner.&lt;ref name=&quot;CFS&quot; /&gt;

Dee presented Queen Mary with a visionary plan for the preservation of old books, manuscripts and records and the founding of a national library, in 1556, but his proposal was not taken up.&lt;ref name=&quot;CFS&quot; /&gt; Instead, he expanded his personal library at his house in [[Mortlake]], tirelessly acquiring books and manuscripts in England and on the European Continent. Dee's library, a center of learning outside the universities, became the greatest in England and attracted many scholars.&lt;ref name=&quot;SJCC&quot;&gt;{{Cite web

When Elizabeth took the throne in 1558, Dee became her trusted advisor on astrological and scientific matters, choosing Elizabeth's coronation date himself.&lt;ref name=&quot;IHR&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.history.ac.uk/eseminars/sem2.html| title=John Dee and the English Calendar: Science, Religion and Empire|author = Dr. Robert Poole|publisher=Institute of Historical Research|date=6 September 2005|accessdate=26 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=Literature Compass|author=Szönyi, György E.|title=John Dee and Early Modern Occult Philosophy|volume=1|issue=1|pages=1–12|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the 1550s through the 1570s, he served as an advisor to England's voyages of discovery, providing technical assistance in navigation and ideological backing in the creation of a &quot;British Empire&quot;, a term that he was the first to use.&lt;ref name=&quot;nav&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=Canadian Journal of History| title=Discourse on history, geography, and law: John Dee and the limits of the British empire, 1576–80|author =Ken MacMillan|date=2001-04|
url =http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-76020627.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dee wrote a letter to [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley]] in October 1574 seeking patronage. He claimed to have occult knowledge of treasure on the [[Welsh Marches]], and of ancient valuable manuscripts kept at [[Wigmore Castle]], knowing that the [[Lord Treasurer]]'s ancestors came from this area.&lt;ref&gt;John Strype, ''Annals of the Reformation'', Oxford (1824), vol.ii, part ii, no. XLV, 558–563&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1577, Dee published ''General and Rare Memorials pertayning to the Perfect Arte of Navigation'', a work that set out his vision of a maritime empire and asserted English territorial claims on the [[New World]]. Dee was acquainted with [[Humphrey Gilbert]] and was close to Sir [[Philip Sidney]] and his circle.&lt;ref name=&quot;nav&quot; /&gt;
[[Image:DeeHieroglyph.gif|frame|Dee's [[glyph]], whose meaning he explained in ''[[Monas Hieroglyphica]]''.]]

In 1564, Dee wrote the [[Hermetica|Hermetic]] work ''Monas Hieroglyphica'' (&quot;The Hieroglyphic [[Monad (symbol)|Monad]]&quot;), an exhaustive [[Christian Kabbalah|Cabalistic]] interpretation of a [[glyph]] of his own design, meant to express the mystical unity of all creation. He travelled to [[Hungary]] to present a copy personally to [[Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor]]. This work was highly valued by many of Dee's contemporaries, but the loss of the secret oral tradition of Dee's milieu makes the work difficult to interpret today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=Ambix|title=The Early Alchemical Reception of John Dee's Monas Hieroglyphica|author=Forshaw, Peter J. |volume=52| issue=3|year=2005|pages=247–269|publisher=Maney Publishing|doi=10.1179/000269805X77772}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He published a &quot;Mathematical Preface&quot; to [[Henry Billingsley]]'s English translation of Euclid's ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]'' in 1570, arguing the central importance of mathematics and outlining mathematics' influence on the other arts and sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=John Dee (1527–1608): Alchemy – the Beginnings of Chemistry|url=http://www.msim.org.uk/uploadedDocs/Document_Depository_01/John%20Dee.pdf|publisher=Museum of Science and Industry in Manchester|year=2005|accessdate=26 October 2006|format=PDF|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060928120544/http://www.msim.org.uk/uploadedDocs/Document_Depository_01/John%20Dee.pdf |archivedate = 28 September 2006|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intended for an audience outside the universities, it proved to be Dee's most widely influential and frequently reprinted work.&lt;ref name=&quot;SJ&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=The identity of the mathematical practitioner in 16th-century England|url=http://www.mhs.ox.ac.uk/staff/saj/texts/mathematicus.htm|author=Stephen Johnston|publisher=Museum of the History of Science, Oxford|year=1995|accessdate=27 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later life===
By the early 1580s, Dee was growing dissatisfied with his progress in learning the secrets of nature and with his own lack of influence and recognition. He began to turn towards the [[supernatural]] as a means to acquire knowledge. Specifically, he sought to contact [[angel]]s through the use of a &quot;scryer&quot; or [[crystal ball|crystal-gazer]], who would act as an intermediary between Dee and the angels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=Canadian Journal of History|title=John Dee's Conversations with Angels: Cabala, alchemy, and the end of nature|author=Frank Klaassen|date=2002-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dee's first attempts were not satisfactory, but, in 1582, he met [[Edward Kelley]] (then going under the name of Edward Talbot), who impressed him greatly with his abilities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Calder&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.johndee.org/calder/html/TOC.html| author=Calder, I. R. F.| year=1952|title=John Dee Studied as an English Neo-Platonist|publisher=University of London|accessdate=26 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dee took Kelley into his service and began to devote all his energies to his supernatural pursuits.&lt;ref name=&quot;Calder&quot; /&gt; These &quot;spiritual conferences&quot; or &quot;actions&quot; were conducted with an air of intense Christian piety, always after periods of purification, [[prayer]] and [[fasting]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Calder&quot; /&gt; Dee was convinced of the benefits they could bring to mankind. (The character of Kelley is harder to assess: some have concluded that he acted with complete cynicism, but delusion or self-deception are not out of the question.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Dee, John|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|year= 2006|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Online|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9029722/John-Dee|accessdate=27 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kelley's &quot;output&quot; is remarkable for its sheer mass, its intricacy and its vividness.) Dee maintained that the angels laboriously dictated several books to him this way, some in a special angelic or [[Enochian|Enochian language]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MC&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=Meric Casaubon| title=A True &amp; Faithful Relation of What passed for many Yeers between Dr. John Dee (A Mathematician of Great Fame in Q. Eliz. and King James their Reignes) and some spirits|date=1659 Republished by Magickal Childe (1992)|isbn =0-939708-01-9|publisher=Magickal Childe Pub.|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;JD1&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=Dee, John|title=Quinti Libri Mysteriorum|location=British Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1583, Dee met the visiting [[Poles|Polish]] nobleman [[Albert Laski|Albert Łaski]], who invited Dee to accompany him on his return to [[Poland]].&lt;ref name=&quot;mortlake&quot; /&gt; With some prompting by the angels, Dee was persuaded to go. Dee, Kelley and their families left for the Continent in September 1583, but Łaski proved to be bankrupt and out of favour in his own country.&lt;ref name=&quot;CM&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Memoirs of Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds|author=Mackay, Charles|chapter=4|location=London|publisher=Office of the National Illustrated Library|year=1852|url=http://www.econlib.org/LIBRARY/Mackay/macEx4b.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dee and Kelley began a [[nomad]]ic life in Central Europe, but they continued their spiritual conferences, which Dee recorded meticulously.&lt;ref name=&quot;MC&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;JD1&quot; /&gt; He had audiences with [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Rudolf II]] in [[Prague Castle]] and [[Stefan Batory of Poland|King Stefan Batory]] of Poland and attempted to convince them of the importance of his angelic communications. His meeting with the Polish King Stefan Batory took place at the [[Niepołomice Castle|royal castle]] at [[Niepołomice]] (near [[Kraków]], then the capital of Poland) and was later widely analysed by Polish historians (Ryszard Zieliński, Roman Żelewski, Roman Bugaj) and writers (Waldemar Łysiak). While generally they accepted him as being a man of wide and deep knowledge they also pointed out his connections with the English monarch Elizabeth. This prompted them to conclude that the meeting could have hidden political goals. Nevertheless, the Polish King who, being a devout Catholic, was very cautious of any supernatural media, started the meeting with a statement that all prophetic revelations were finalised with the mission of [[Jesus Christ]]. He also stressed that he would take part in the event provided that there would be nothing against the teaching of the [[Catholic Church|Holy Catholic Church]].

During a spiritual conference in [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemia]], in 1587, Kelley told Dee that the angel [[Uriel]] had ordered that the two men should [[open marriage|share their wives]]. Kelley, who by that time was becoming a prominent alchemist and was much more sought-after than Dee, may have wished to use this as a way to end the spiritual conferences.&lt;ref name=&quot;CM&quot; /&gt; The order caused Dee great anguish, but he did not doubt its genuineness and apparently allowed it to go forward, but broke off the conferences immediately afterwards and did not see Kelley again. Dee returned to England in 1589.&lt;ref name=&quot;CM&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AG&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.alchemyguild.org/history.htm|title=History of the Alchemy Guild|publisher=International Alchemy Guild|accessdate=26 October 2006}} (subscription required)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Final years===
Dee returned to Mortlake after six years to find his library ruined and many of his prized books and instruments stolen.&lt;ref name=&quot;SJCC&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CM&quot; /&gt; He sought support from Elizabeth, who finally made him Warden of [[Christ's College, Manchester]], in 1595.&lt;ref&gt;Dee, John (1842) ''Diary''. Manchester: Chetham Society; p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; This former College of Priests had been re-established as a Protestant institution by a Royal Charter of 1578.&lt;ref name=&quot;ne&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia =Encyclopædia Britannica|title = John Dee| publisher = Cambridge University Press| location = London| edition = 11th ed.| year = 1911}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, he could not exert much control over the Fellows, who despised or cheated him.&lt;ref name=&quot;CFS&quot; /&gt; Early in his tenure, he was consulted on the demonic possession of seven children, but took little interest in the matter, although he did allow those involved to consult his still extensive library.&lt;ref name=&quot;CFS&quot; /&gt;

He left Manchester in 1605 to return to London;&lt;ref name=&quot;CFS2&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=Fell-Smith, Charlotte|year=1909|title=John Dee: 1527–1608: Appendix 1|location=London|publisher=Constable and Company|url=http://www.johndee.org/charlotte/Appendix1/ap1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, he remained Warden until his death.&lt;ref&gt;Frangopulo, N. J. (1962) ''Rich Inheritance''. Manchester: Education Committee; pp. 129–30&lt;/ref&gt; By that time, Elizabeth was dead, and [[James I of England|James I]], unsympathetic to anything related to the supernatural, provided no help. Dee spent his final years in poverty at Mortlake, forced to sell off various of his possessions to support himself and his daughter, Katherine, who cared for him until the end.&lt;ref name=&quot;CFS2&quot; /&gt; He died in Mortlake late in 1608 or early 1609 aged 82 (there are no extant records of the exact date as both the parish registers and Dee's gravestone are missing).&lt;ref name=&quot;CFS&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BL&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Brief Lives chiefly of Contemporaries set down John Aubrey between the Years 1669 and 1696|author=John Aubrey|editor=Rev.

===Personal life===
Dee was married twice and had eight children. Details of his first marriage are sketchy, but is likely to have been from 1565 to his wife's death in around 1576. From 1577 to 1601 Dee kept a meticulous diary.&lt;ref name=&quot;RM&quot; /&gt; In 1578 he married the 23-year-old Jane Fromond (Dee was fifty-one at the time). She was to be the wife that Kelley claimed Uriel had demanded that he and Dee share, and although Dee complied for a while this eventually caused the two men to part company.&lt;ref name=&quot;RM&quot; /&gt; Jane died during the plague in Manchester and was buried in March 1604,&lt;ref&gt;Manchester Cathedral Archive, MS 1&lt;/ref&gt; along with a number of his children: Theodore is known to have died in Manchester, but although no records exist for his daughters Madinia, Frances and Margaret after this time, Dee had by this time ceased keeping his diary.&lt;ref name=&quot;CFS&quot; /&gt; His eldest son was [[Arthur Dee]], about whom Dee wrote a letter to his headmaster at [[Westminster School]] which echoes the worries of boarding school parents in every century; Arthur was also an alchemist and hermetic author.&lt;ref name=&quot;CFS&quot; /&gt; The antiquary [[John Aubrey]]&lt;ref&gt;Aubrey's great-grandfather William Aubrey was a cousin of Dee's &quot;and intimate acquaintance&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; gives the following description of John Dee: &quot;He was tall and slender. He wore a gown like an artist's gown, with hanging sleeves, and a slit.... A very fair, clear sanguine complexion... a long beard as white as milk. A very handsome man.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;BL&quot; /&gt;

==Achievements==
=== Thought ===
Dee was an intensely pious Christian, but his Christianity was deeply influenced by the Hermetic and [[Plato]]nic-[[Pythagoras|Pythagorean]] doctrines that were pervasive in the [[Renaissance]].&lt;ref name=&quot;WIT&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=Journal of the History of Ideas|jstor=2708083|title=God and Expansion in Elizabethan England: John Dee, 1527–1583|author=Walter I. Trattner|volume=25|issue=1|date=January 1964|pages=17–34|doi=10.2307/2708083}}&lt;/ref&gt; He believed that [[numerology|numbers]] were the basis of all things and the key to knowledge, that God's creation was an act of numbering.&lt;ref name=&quot;IHR&quot; /&gt; From [[Hermeticism]], he drew the belief that man had the potential for divine power, and he believed this divine power could be exercised through mathematics. His cabalistic angel magic (which was heavily numerological) and his work on practical mathematics (navigation, for example) were simply the exalted and mundane ends of the same spectrum, not the antithetical activities many would see them as today.&lt;ref name=&quot;SJ&quot; /&gt; His ultimate goal was to help bring forth a unified world religion through the healing of the breach of the Catholic and [[Protestantism|Protestant]] churches and the recapture of the pure [[theology]] of the ancients.&lt;ref name=&quot;IHR&quot; /&gt;

===Advocacy of English expansion===

From 1570 Dee advocated a policy of political and economic strengthening of England and imperial expansion into the New World.&lt;ref name = ODNB/&gt;  In his manuscript, ''Brytannicae reipublicae synopsis'' (1570), he outlined the current state of the [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan Realm]]&lt;ref name = WTS&gt;William Howard Sherman ''John Dee: The Politics of Reading and Writing in the English Renaissance,'' Univ of Massachusetts Press, 1997 ISBN 1-55849-070-1&lt;/ref&gt; and was concerned with trade, ethics and national strength.&lt;ref name = ODNB /&gt;

His 1576 ''General and rare memorials pertayning to the Perfect Arte of Navigation,'' was the first volume in an unfinished series planned to advocate the rise of imperial expansion.&lt;ref&gt;Frances Amelia Yates ''Astraea''&lt;/ref&gt; In the highly symbolic frontispiece, Dee included a figure of [[Britannia]]  kneeling by the shore beseeching Elizabeth I, to protect her empire by strengthening her navy.&lt;ref&gt;Virginia Hewitt, ‘Britannia (fl. 1st–21st cent.)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, Sept 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Dee used [[Geoffrey of Monmouth|Geoffrey]]'s inclusion of Ireland in [[King Arthur|Arthur's]] imperial conquests to argue that Arthur had established a ‘British empire’ abroad.&lt;ref&gt;O. J. Padel, ‘Arthur (supp. fl. in or before 6th cent.)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, Sept 2004&lt;/ref&gt; He further argued that England exploit new lands through colonisation and that this vision could become reality through maritime supremacy.&lt;ref&gt;[[National Maritime Museum]], ''

Dee posited a formal claim to North America on the back of a map drawn in 1577–80;&lt;ref&gt;R. C. D.

===Reputation and significance===
About ten years after Dee's death, the antiquarian [[Robert Bruce Cotton|Robert Cotton]] purchased land around Dee's house and began digging in search of papers and artifacts. He discovered several manuscripts, mainly records of Dee's angelic communications. Cotton's son gave these manuscripts to the scholar [[Méric Casaubon]], who published them in 1659, together with a long introduction critical of their author, as ''A True &amp; Faithful Relation of What passed for many Yeers between Dr. John Dee (A Mathematician of Great Fame in Q. Eliz. and King James their Reignes) and some spirits.''&lt;ref name=&quot;MC&quot;/&gt; As the first public revelation of Dee's spiritual conferences, the book was extremely popular and sold quickly. Casaubon, who believed in the reality of spirits, argued in his introduction that Dee was acting as the unwitting tool of evil spirits when he believed he was communicating with angels. This book is largely responsible for the image, prevalent for the following two and a half centuries, of Dee as a dupe and deluded fanatic.&lt;ref name=&quot;WIT&quot; /&gt;

Around the same time the ''True and Faithful Relation'' was published, members of the [[Rosicrucian]] movement claimed Dee as one of their number.&lt;ref name=&quot;HJ&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=The Hermetic Journal|author=Ron Heisler|title = John Dee and the Secret Societies|year=1992|url=http://www.levity.com/alchemy/h_dee.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is doubt, however, that an organised Rosicrucian movement existed during Dee's lifetime, and no evidence that he ever belonged to any secret fraternity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Calder&quot;/&gt; Dee's reputation as a magician and the vivid story of his association with [[Edward Kelley]] have made him a seemingly irresistible figure to [[fabulist]]s, writers of [[horror fiction|horror stories]] and latter-day [[magician (paranormal)|magicians]]. The accretion of false and often fanciful information about Dee often obscures the facts of his life, remarkable as they are in themselves.&lt;ref name=&quot;KN&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.shpltd.co.uk/neal-rhetoric.pdf |title=The Rhetoric of Utility: Avoiding Occult Associations For Mathematics Through Profitability and Pleasure|author=Katherine Neal|publisher=University of Sydney|year=1999|accessdate=27 October 2006|format=PDF |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080528234717/http://www.shpltd.co.uk/neal-rhetoric.pdf |archivedate = 28 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A re-evaluation of Dee's character and significance came in the 20th century, largely as a result of the work of the historian [[Frances Yates]], who brought a new focus on the role of magic in the [[Renaissance]] and the development of modern science. As a result of this re-evaluation, Dee is now viewed as a serious scholar and appreciated as one of the most learned men of his day.&lt;ref name=&quot;WIT&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;FY&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Theatre of the World|author=Frances A. Yates|publisher=Routledge|location=London|year=1987|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His personal library at Mortlake was the largest in the country, and was considered one of the finest in Europe, perhaps second only to that of [[Jacques Auguste de Thou|de Thou]]. As well as being an astrological and scientific advisor to Elizabeth and her court, he was an early advocate of the [[European colonization of the Americas|colonisation of North America]] and a visionary of a British Empire stretching across the North Atlantic.&lt;ref name=&quot;nav&quot; /&gt;

Dee promoted the sciences of navigation and [[cartography]]. He studied closely with Gerardus Mercator, and he owned an important collection of maps, [[globe]]s and astronomical instruments. He developed new instruments as well as special navigational techniques for use in [[polar regions]]. Dee served as an advisor to the English voyages of discovery, and personally selected pilots and trained them in navigation.&lt;ref name=&quot;CFS&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nav&quot; /&gt;

He believed that mathematics (which he understood mystically) was central to the progress of human learning. The centrality of mathematics to Dee's vision makes him to that extent more modern than [[Francis Bacon]], though some scholars believe Bacon purposely downplayed mathematics in the anti-occult atmosphere of the reign of James I.&lt;ref name=&quot;FB&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=Journal of the History of Ideas|jstor=2709891|title=Francis Bacon and the Progress of Knowledge|author=Brian Vickers| volume=53| issue=3|date=1992-07|pages=495–518|doi=10.2307/2709891|authorlink=Brian Vickers (academic)}}&lt;/ref&gt; It should be noted, though, that Dee's understanding of the role of mathematics is radically different from our contemporary view.&lt;ref name=&quot;SJ&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;KN&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SJ2&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Like father, like son? John Dee, Thomas Digges and the identity of the mathematician|url=http://www.mhs.ox.ac.uk/staff/saj/texts/dee-digges.htm|author=Stephen Johnston|publisher=Museum of the History of Science, Oxford|year=1995|accessdate=27 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dee's promotion of mathematics outside the universities was an enduring practical achievement. His &quot;Mathematical Preface&quot; to Euclid was meant to promote the study and application of mathematics by those without a university education, and was very popular and influential among the &quot;mecanicians&quot;: the new and growing class of technical craftsmen and artisans. Dee's preface included demonstrations of mathematical principles that readers could perform themselves.&lt;ref name=&quot;SJ&quot; /&gt;

Dee was a friend of [[Tycho Brahe]] and was familiar with the work of [[Copernicus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CFS&quot;  /&gt; Many of his astronomical calculations were based on Copernican assumptions, but he never openly espoused the [[heliocentrism|heliocentric]] theory. Dee applied Copernican theory to the problem of [[calendar]] reform. His sound recommendations were not accepted, however, for political reasons.&lt;ref name=&quot;IHR&quot; /&gt;

He has often been associated with the [[Voynich Manuscript]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Calder&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

|title=The Mystery of the Voynich Manuscript|author=Gordon Rugg|publisher=Scientific American|date=2004-07|accessdate=28 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wilfrid M. Voynich]], who bought the manuscript in 1912, suggested that Dee may have owned the manuscript and sold it to [[Rudolph II]]. Dee's contacts with Rudolph were far less extensive than had previously been thought, however, and Dee's diaries show no evidence of the sale. Dee was, however, known to have possessed a copy of the ''[[Book of Soyga]]'', another enciphered book.&lt;ref name=&quot;JR&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dtc.umn.edu/~reedsj/soyga.pdf|author=Jim Reeds|title=John Dee and the Magic Tables in the Book of Soyga|year=1996|accessdate=8 November 2006|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[Elizabeth I]]'s request Dee embraced the old Welsh '[[Madog|Prince Madog]]' myth to lay claim to North America. The well known story was of a young Welsh prince who discovered America in 1170, over three hundred years before Christopher Columbus's voyage in 1492. The fact was that [[Elizabeth I]] had little interest in the New World and Dee's hopes were premature.&lt;ref&gt;Robert W. Barone is Professor of History at the University of Montevallo&lt;/ref&gt;

===Artifacts===
[[Image:John Dee's Seal of God.jpg|thumb|right|The &quot;Seal of God&quot;]]
The [[British Museum]] holds several items once owned by Dee and associated with the spiritual conferences:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_mla/d/dr_dees_magic.aspx British Museum, Dr Dee's magic]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Dee's Speculum or [[Mirrors in Mesoamerican culture|Mirror]] (an [[Obsidian use in Mesoamerica|obsidian]] [[Aztec]] cult object in the shape of a hand-mirror, brought to Europe in the late 1520s), which was once owned by [[Horace Walpole, 4th Earl of Orford|Horace Walpole]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_mla/d/dr_dees_mirror.aspx British Museum, Dr Dee's mirror]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The small [[seal (device)|wax seals]] used to support the legs of Dee's &quot;table of practice&quot; (the table at which the [[scrying]] was performed).
* The large, elaborately decorated wax &quot;Seal of God&quot;, used to support the &quot;shew-stone&quot;, the [[crystal ball]] used for scrying.
* A gold [[amulet]] engraved with a representation of one of Kelley's visions.
* A crystal globe, six centimetres in diameter. This item remained unnoticed for many years in the mineral collection; possibly the one owned by Dee, but the provenance of this object is less certain than that of the others.&lt;ref name=&quot;BM&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dcs.warwick.ac.uk/bshm/zingaz/London2.html|title=BSHM Gazetteer – LONDON: British Museum, British Library and Science Museum|publisher=British Society for the History of Mathematics|date=2002-08|accessdate=27 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2004, both a [[shew stone]] (a stone used for scrying) formerly belonging to Dee and a mid-17th century explanation of its use written by [[Nicholas Culpeper]] were stolen from the [[Science Museum (London)|Science Museum]] in London; they were recovered shortly afterwards.&lt;ref name=&quot;G&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-1398477,00.html|title=Museum thief spirits away old crystal ball|author=Adam Fresco|work=The Times |date=11 December 2004|accessdate=27 October 2006 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;
