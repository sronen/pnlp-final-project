Lieutenant General '''Nguyễn Chánh Thi''' (23 February 1923 &amp;ndash; 23 June 2007) was an officer in the [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam]] (ARVN). He is best known for frequently being involved in coups in the 1960s and wielding substantial influence as a key member of various juntas that ruled [[South Vietnam]] from 1964 until 1966, when he was overpowered by [[Vietnam Air Force]] chief and Prime Minister [[Nguyen Cao Ky]] in a [[Buddhist Uprising|power struggle]] and exiled to the United States. Known for his flamboyant style and hostility to US advice, Thi's ouster was supported by the American leadership, who backed Ky's pro-U.S. regime.

Thi joined the [[French Army]] at the age of 17 and was captured by [[Imperial Japan|Japan]] after they invaded [[French Indochina]] during [[World War II]]. After several months he escaped. He later transferred to the [[Vietnamese National Army]] of the French-backed [[State of Vietnam]], which, in October 1955, became the ARVN and Republic of Vietnam (South Vietnam), respectively. A paratrooper, he fought for then-Prime Minister [[Ngo Dinh Diem|Ngô Đình Diệm]] against the [[Binh Xuyen]] [[organized crime|organized crime syndicate]] in the [[Battle of Saigon (1955)|1955 Battle for Saigon]]. This winning performance so impressed the bachelor Diem that he thereafter regarded Thi as an adopted son and put him in command of the [[Vietnamese Airborne Division|Airborne Brigade]]. In November 1960, Thi led the paratroopers [[1960 South Vietnamese coup|in a coup]] against Diệm, citing political interference in the military. The rebels gained the upper hand but Thi was reluctant to push for a complete victory, and the coup was defeated after Diem falsely promised reforms in order to buy time for loyalists to rescue him. Thi fled into exile in [[Cambodia]], but returned after [[1963 South Vietnamese coup|Diệm's deposal]] and [[Arrest and assassination of Ngo Dinh Diem|execution in November 1963]]. He became the deputy commander of [[I Corps (South Vietnam)|I Corps]] under [[Nguyen Khanh]], and helped his superior to [[1964 South Vietnamese coup|overthrow Diệm's conquerors three months later]]. Thi became the commander of the [[1st Division (South Vietnam)|1st Division]], before taking control of I Corps later in the year.

During the year after Khanh's rise to power, Thi helped Khanh stage or put down several coup attempts, making him a key player in South Vietnamese military politics. In [[September 1964 South Vietnamese coup attempt|September 1964]], he and Ky helped rescue Khanh from a coup attempt by the disgruntled Catholic Generals [[Lam Van Phat]] and [[Duong Van Duc]]. This gave Ky and Thi increased leverage in the junta. Two months later, he [[December 1964 South Vietnamese coup|was prominent in shutting down]] a junta-appointed civilian advisory body after they disapproved of a plan to compulsorily retire all older generals&amp;mdash;the younger officers wanted to sideline older rivals. In January 1965, he helped Khanh depose the junta-appointed civilian Prime Minister [[Tran Van Huong]], but by this time he had turned against Khanh. In February 1965, he helped defeat a [[1965 South Vietnamese coup|coup attempt]] by Phat and [[Pham Ngoc Thao]], and helped to force Khanh's resignation at the same time. Over the next year, Ky and Thi were the foremost officers in the junta, and in June 1965, Thi declined an opportunity to serve as prime minister after being nominated by his fellow officers following the resignation of civilian [[Phan Huy Quat]]. Thi wanted to let a rival take the job and then step in after they had failed, but he never received a second opportunity. 

A strong-willed and independent-minded officer, Thi oversaw I Corps with a great deal of autonomy from Saigon, and the other officers felt threatened. This was accentuated by Thi's alignment with Buddhist activist movements in his region, traditionally a Buddhist stronghold. The Buddhists were opposed to expansion of the [[Vietnam War]] and the American leadership viewed Thi very negatively. In early 1966, feeling more confident about his hold on power, Ky orchestrated Thi's removal and announced that Thi would be going to the US for medical treatment, but in reality into exile. Thi refused to go along with Ky's false story and wanted to stay in Vietnam, and this led to [[Buddhist Uprising|civil unrest in I Corps]], where Thi was popular. The disquiet escalated into open rebellion by pro-Thi military units in the I Corps, allied to Buddhist anti-junta activists who were calling for civilian government and an end to the US-driven war expansion policy. After three months of virtual secession, Ky's forces quelled the dissidents, and Thi emigrated to the U.S., where he lived for the rest of his life.

==Early life==
Thi was born on 23 February 1923 in [[Huế]], then the capital of Vietnam and the seat of the [[Nguyen Dynasty]].&lt;ref name=post/&gt; At the time, Vietnam was part of the colony of [[French Indochina]] and his father was a low-level [[mandarin (bureaucrat)|mandarin]] in the French-controlled monarchy and had served in the [[French Army]] during [[World War I]].&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; Thi joined the French Army at 17; a few months later, [[Imperial Japan]] invaded Indochina during [[World War II]], wresting control from France.&lt;ref name=ww2&gt;Jacobs, pp. 26-40.&lt;/ref&gt; Thi was a Japanese [[prisoner of war]] for several months until he escaped amidst the confusion of an Allied bombing raid on the Japanese military jail.&lt;ref name=post/&gt; According to family documents, Thi was captured and imprisoned by the communist [[Vietminh]] of [[Ho Chi Minh]] for three months at the end of the war in 1945 as they declared independence during the [[August Revolution]].&lt;ref name=post/&gt; At the time, a power vacuum emerged as the defeated Japanese withdrew from Vietnam. France attempted to reassert its colonial grip over Indochina, while various Vietnamese groups jockeyed for power at the head of an independent country.&lt;ref name=ww2/&gt; In 1946, full-scale conflict erupted between the Vietminh, who had declared the [[Democratic Republic of Vietnam]] (DRV) independent, and France. As part of their political effort, the French created the [[State of Vietnam]] (SoV), an associated state in the [[French Union]], and installed former Emperor [[Bao Dai]] as the head of state. Thi served in the SoV's [[Vietnamese National Army]] (VNA), and rose steadily up the ranks.&lt;ref name=post/&gt;

==Diệm era==

He has chubby cheeks, parts his hair to the side and wears a suit and tie.]]
In 1954, the Vietminh defeated the French Union forces at the [[Battle of Dien Bien Phu]] and France decided to withdraw from Vietnam. Under the provisions of the [[Geneva Conference (1954)|Geneva Accords]], the Vietminh's DRV would take control of the northern half of the country, and the SoV the south, pending national reunification elections in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, pp. 43-44.&lt;/ref&gt; In the meantime, the State of Vietnam remained unstable. The [[Cao Dai|Cao Đài]] and [[Hoa Hao]] religious sects had their own private armies and de facto states in the [[Mekong Delta]], while the [[Binh Xuyen]] [[organized crime|organized crime syndicate]] controlled the national police, had their own military, and dominated the rampant drug trade, prostitution and illegal gambling in the southern capital [[Saigon]].&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, pp. 61-62.&lt;/ref&gt; In April and May 1955, Thi fought in VNA airborne units for Prime Minister [[Ngo Dinh Diem|Diệm]] against the Binh Xuyen in the [[Battle of Saigon (1955)|Battle for Saigon]] after Diệm gave them an ultimatum to surrender. When they did not, the VNA attacked and decisively dispersed the Binh Xuyen after a few days of heavy street fighting. This performance so impressed the lifelong bachelor Diệm that he thereafter referred to Thi as &quot;my son&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;j117&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Halberstam, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Diệm promoted Thi to the rank of colonel and put him in charge of the [[Vietnamese Airborne Division|Airborne Brigade]],&lt;ref name=post/&gt; which was expanded into a division a few years later. The [[Central Intelligence Agency]] however, was not so impressed, and one of their reports described Thi as &quot;an opportunist and a man lacking strong convictions&quot;.&lt;ref name=m109&gt;Moyar (2006), p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; An American military advisor assessed Thi as &quot;tough, unscrupulous, and fearless, but dumb&quot;.&lt;ref name=m109/&gt; In October 1955, Diệm deposed [[Bao Dai|Bảo Đại]] in a [[1955 State of Vietnam referendum|fraudulent referendum]] overseen by his brother [[Ngo Dinh Nhu|Ngô Đình Nhu]] and declared himself President of the newly-proclaimed [[Republic of Vietnam]]. The VNA thus became the [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam]], and after Diệm canceled the reunification elections, the [[Vietnam War]] ensued.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, pp. 90-100.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Failed coup against Diệm==
{{main|1960 South Vietnamese coup attempt}}
In 1960, Thi led a revolt against Diệm after lobbying by his [[Vietnamese Airborne Division|Airborne Division]] deputy commander, Lieutenant Colonel [[Vuong Van Dong]].&lt;ref name=&quot;j117&quot;/&gt; Dong had become discontented with Diệm's arbitrary rule and constant meddling in military affairs. Diệm, who promoted officers on religion and loyalty, rather than skill, gave orders directly to individual commanders, and played senior officers against one another in order to weaken the military leadership and prevent them from becoming effective, lest they try to challenge his rule. Dong later asserted that his sole objective was to force Diệm to improve the governance of the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;k&quot;/&gt; Dong was clandestinely supported by his brother-in-law, Lieutenant Colonel Nguyen Trieu Hong and Hong's uncle, Hoang Co Thuy, members of the [[Viet Nam Quoc Dan Dang|Đại Việt Quốc Dân Đảng]] (VNQDD, Vietnamese Nationalist Party), an anti-communist political organization whose members were marginalized by Diem.&lt;ref name=h131&gt;Hammer (1987), p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt; The coup was organized with the help of some VNQDD and [[Dai Viet Quoc Dan Dang|Đại Việt Quốc Dân Đảng]] (Nationalist Party of Greater Vietnam, known as Dai Viet) members, civilians and officers alike.&lt;ref name=&quot;h131&quot;/&gt; Dong enlisted the cooperation of an armored regiment, a [[Republic of Vietnam Marine Corps|marine unit]] and three paratrooper battalions. The operation was launched on November 11 at 05:00.&lt;ref name=&quot;k&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;h131&quot;/&gt;

The coup was executed ineffectually;&lt;ref name=&quot;k&quot;/&gt; although the rebels captured the headquarters of the Joint General Staff at [[Tan Son Nhut Air Base]],&lt;ref name=&quot;h131&quot;/&gt; they failed to block the roads leading into Saigon and cut off loyalist reinforcements. Thi's men also failed to disconnect phone lines into the palace, which allowed Diệm to appeal for aid from loyal units.&lt;ref name=k/&gt; After taking the key military points, the paratroopers headed towards [[Reunification Palace|Independence Palace]].&lt;ref name=m109/&gt; At first, they did not attack, believing that Diệm  would capitulate.&lt;ref name=&quot;k&quot;&gt;Karnow, pp. 252-53.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of Thi's soldiers had been tricked into thinking that they were attacking in order to save Diệm from a [[Presidential Guard (South Vietnam)|Presidential Guard]] mutiny.&lt;ref name=&quot;h131&quot;/&gt; When the attack finally started, Diệm was nearly killed in the opening salvoes when gunfire hit his bed, but he had arisen just a few minutes earlier.&lt;ref name=m109/&gt; Despite their numerical advantage, the paratroopers' first assault was repelled by the loyalists. Thi and Dong held fire;&lt;ref name=&quot;j117&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=m109/&gt; they brought in reinforcements and attacked again, but the loyalists held firm.&lt;ref name=m109/&gt; In the meantime, Thi's rebels had captured the national police offices, the studios of Radio Saigon and the Presidential Guard barracks. They had also put most of the Saigon-based generals under house arrest.&lt;ref name=m110&gt;Moyar (2006), p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;

Apparently poised for a military victory, the rebels hesitated. Dong wanted to storm the palace and capture the president and his family. On the other hand, Thi was worried Diệm could be killed in an attack. Thi felt that despite Diệm's shortcomings, he was South Vietnam's best available leader. Thi thought that enforced reform was the best outcome.&lt;ref name=&quot;j118&quot;/&gt; The rebels wanted Nhu, Diệm's younger brother and chief advisor, and his wife, [[Madame Nhu]], who were widely regarded as the powers behind Diệm's rule, out of the government, although they disagreed over whether to assassinate or deport the couple.&lt;ref name=&quot;j117&quot;&gt;Jacobs, p. 117. &lt;/ref&gt; Thi demanded that Diem appoint an officer as Prime Minister and remove [[Madame Nhu]] from the palace. Saigon Radio broadcast a speech authorized by Thi's Revolutionary Council, claiming that Diem was being removed for corruption and suppression of liberty. Worried by the uprising, Diệm sent representatives to negotiate.&lt;ref name=&quot;l&quot;&gt;Langguth, pp. 108&amp;ndash;109.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=m111&gt;Moyar (2006), p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt;

After lengthy talks, the parties agreed to a ceasefire.&lt;ref name=m112&gt;Moyar (2006), p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; In the meantime, loyalist forces headed towards the capital.&lt;ref name=m112/&gt; Diem promised to end press censorship, liberalize the economy, and hold free and fair elections. Diệm refused to sack Nhu, but agreed to dissolve the cabinet and form a new government which would accommodate members of the Revolutionary Council. In the early hours of 12 November, Diệm taped a speech detailing the concessions, and Thi broadcast the message on Saigon Radio.&lt;ref name=&quot;j118&quot;&gt;Jacobs, p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=m112/&gt; When the loyalist reinforcements rolled into the capital aboard tanks and armored vehicles and began to wrest the initiative, the rebels began to break.&lt;ref name=&quot;j118&quot;/&gt; &lt;ref name=m113&gt;Moyar (2006), p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; After a brief, violent battle that killed around 400 people, the coup attempt was crushed. &lt;ref name=&quot;l&quot;/&gt; The casualties included a large number of anti-Diệm civilians; Thi exhorted them to bring down the Ngô family by charging the palace; 13 were gunned down by the loyalist soldiers as they invaded the grounds.&lt;ref name=m112/&gt;

After the failed coup, Dong, Thi and several other prominent officers fled to Tan Son Nhut and climbed aboard a [[C-47]].&lt;ref name=m113/&gt; They fled to [[Cambodia]], where they were given asylum by Prince [[Norodom Sihanouk]], a long-time Diệm opponent.&lt;ref name=&quot;h132&quot;&gt;Hammer, p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; Diệm promptly reneged on his promises, and intensified his authoritarian rule and crackdowns on dissidents.&lt;ref name=&quot;k&quot;/&gt; Almost three years after the incident, Diệm opened the trial for those involved in the coup on 8 July 1963. Thi and his fellow exiled officers were found guilty and sentenced to death in absentia.&lt;ref name=&quot;htrial&quot;&gt;Hammer, pp. 154-55.&lt;/ref&gt; In the meantime, Thi survived in Cambodia for three years as a farmer. 

==1964 coups with Nguyen Khanh==
{{main|1964 South Vietnamese coup}}
Diem was [[arrest and assassination of Ngo Dinh Diem|killed]] in a [[1963 South Vietnamese coup|November 1963 coup]],&lt;ref&gt;Blair, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; allowing Thi to return to South Vietnam and resume his military service.&lt;ref&gt;Karnow, pp. 460-64.&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after arriving home, Thi found himself involved in another coup plot, acting as the link between [[Nguyen Khanh]] and [[Do Mau]], two generals disgruntled with their position under the military junta of [[Duong Van Minh]], who oversaw the overthrow of Diệm.&lt;ref&gt; Shaplen, pp. 229-34.&lt;/ref&gt; Mau was one of the principal tacticians in the 1963 coup; although he did not command troops, he had a thorough knowledge of the backgrounds of the ARVN officers and their strengths, weaknesses and characteristics through his role as Diem's director of military security,&lt;ref name=s230/&gt; and this understanding had allowed him to engineer the previous coup. Minh's junta feared Mau's shrewdness and tried to sideline him by making him the Minister of Information, a relatively unimportant position.&lt;ref name=s231/&gt;

Disgruntled, Mau began recruiting for a coup,&lt;ref name=s231/&gt; targeting Khanh, who had been moved to the [[I Corps (South Vietnam)|I Corps]] in the far north of South Vietnam to keep him far away from Saigon and the opportunity to stage a putsch.&lt;ref name=s230&gt;Shaplen, p. 230.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=kb/&gt; Khanh made no attempt to hide his annoyance at not being given a more important job,&lt;ref name=&quot;s230&quot;/&gt; and had long been regarded as an ambitious and unscrupulous officer by his colleagues.&lt;ref name=kb&gt;Karnow, pp. 354-55.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=l161&gt;Logevall, p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=s228&gt;Shaplen, p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt; Mau persuaded the junta to install Thi as Khanh's deputy in I Corps. He tricked the junta by telling them that as Khanh had played a large part in putting down the 1960 coup attempt, Thi would still be harboring resentment. According to Mau, Thi would thus be an ideal mechanism for keeping the disliked Khanh in check. Privately, Mau predicted that Thi would act as a bridge between him in Saigon and Khanh in Huế. He was correct in thinking the 1960 conflict would be irrelevant as allegiances shifted over time and that the pair would work together for their current aims.&lt;ref name=s231/&gt;

The trio were joined by General [[Tran Thien Khiem]], the disaffected commander of the [[III Corps (South Vietnam)|III Corps]] that surrounded Saigon,&lt;ref name=s231&gt;Shaplen, p. 231. &lt;/ref&gt; and an assortment of [[Republic of Vietnam Marine Corps|Marine]], [[Republic of Vietnam Air Force|Air Force]] and [[ARVN Special Forces|Special Forces]] officers and their units. Other notable recruits were Diem loyalist and former chief of the [[South Vietnamese Popular Force|Civil Guard]], [[Duong Ngoc Lam]], who was under investigation for corruption, and General [[Duong Van Duc]], who had recently returned from exile in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Shaplen, pp. 231-32.&lt;/ref&gt; The cabal scheduled the coup for 04:00, 30 January.&lt;ref name=k352&gt;Karnow, p. 352.&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 January, Thi followed Khanh to the capital. The plotters and their agents met in obscure locations spots around town. On the night of 29 January, the rebel troops assumed their positions around Saigon. A number of American officers and embassy officials were alerted to be in their offices at 2:00. At 03:00, Khanh took over the Joint General Staff Headquarters at Tan Son Nhut, and by dawn, the coup had succeeded without a shot being fired as Minh's junta was caught unaware.&lt;ref name=s233&gt;Shaplen, p. 233.&lt;/ref&gt; The popular Minh was allowed to stay on as a ceremonial but powerless head of state, but his colleagues were taken into custody. Nevertheless, Minh remained disgruntled and persistently tried to regain his influence through political means.&lt;ref&gt;Shaplen, pp. 235-45.&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 February 1964, Thi was appointed to be commander of the [[1st Division (South Vietnam)|1st Division]] based in Huế, as part of I Corps. He stayed in the post until 21 October; on 14 November, he took control of the entire corps.&lt;ref name=ob&gt;Tucker, pp. 526-33.&lt;/ref&gt; This corps oversaw the five northernmost provinces of central Vietnam and the 1st and [[2nd Division (South Vietnam)|2nd Divisions]].&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

===Defeating the September 1964 coup===
{{main|September 1964 South Vietnamese coup attempt}}
In August, Khanh gave himself more powers, provoking widespread riots and demonstrations across the nation, with Buddhist activists prominent in expressing opposition against Khanh. The anarchy forced Khanh to back down and make concessions, and he ended up in a weaker position than before. Among the concessions he made was to remove or demote some Catholic officials who had been close to Diệm's religiously discriminatory rule, angering the minority Catholic community.&lt;ref&gt;Moyar (2004), pp. 760-64.&lt;/ref&gt; Among those demoted were Generals [[Lam Van Phat]] and Duc, both of whom were Catholic. They launched a coup attempt backed mainly by Catholic elements against Khanh before dawn on 13 September.&lt;ref name=m326&gt; Moyar (2006), p. 326.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kahin, pp. 228-32.&lt;/ref&gt; They took over the city without firing a shot, and used the national radio station to proclaim the deposing of Khanh's junta. There was little initial reaction from most of the military commanders, including Thi.&lt;ref name=m327&gt;Moyar (2006), p. 327.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Phat and Duc could not apprehend Khanh, and the Americans decided to support the incumbent after concluding that the rebels did not have a satisfactory plan to rule.&lt;ref name=m327/&gt; Thi and Air Force chief [[Nguyen Cao Ky]] were then prominent in helping to crush the coup. Ky and Thi's role in putting down the coup attempt gave them more leverage in Saigon's military politics. Indebted to Ky, Thi and their so-called Young Turks for maintaining his hold on power, Khanh was now in a weaker position. This group of young officers were headlined by Thi, Ky, [[IV Corps (South Vietnam)|IV Corps]] commander General [[Nguyen Van Thieu]], and Admiral [[Chung Tan Cang]], the head of the [[Republic of Vietnam Navy]]. They publicly called on Khanh to remove &quot;corrupt, dishonest and counterrevolutionary&quot; officers, civil servants and exploitationists, and threatened to remove him if he did not enact their proposed reforms.&lt;ref name=remake&gt;{{cite web|title=South Viet Nam: Remaking a Revolution|publisher=[[TIME|''Time'']]|date=1964-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some observers accused Ky and Thi of deliberately orchestrating or allowing the plot to develop before putting it down in order to embarrass Khanh, portray themselves as heroes, and therefore gain prominence on the political stage.&lt;ref name=k396&gt;Karnow, p. 396.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=kh232&gt;Kahin, p. 232.&lt;/ref&gt; In later years, Cao Huy Thuan, a professor and Buddhist activist based in the city of [[Da Nang|Đà Nẵng]] in I Corps, claimed Ky and Thi met with him a few days before the coup, and had discussed their plans for joining a coup against Khanh.&lt;ref name=kh498&gt;Kahin, p. 498.&lt;/ref&gt; At the subsequent military trial of Phat and Duc's faction, the plotters were acquitted. According to the historian [[George McTurnan Kahin]], Khanh rigged the trial so that Duc and Phat were acquitted so they would be used as a Catholic counterweight to the Young Turks faction of Ky and Thi, who in Khanh's eyes had become increasingly strong and ominous.&lt;ref name=kh232/&gt; Khanh decided to try to build an alliance with the generals from Minh's junta by releasing them from house arrest and recalling them to active roles. However, Thi and Ky were aware of the motives for these moves and adjusted accordingly.&lt;ref name=kh232/&gt;

===Dissolution of the High National Council===
{{main|December 1964 South Vietnamese coup}}
The Young Turks and Khanh wanted to forcibly retire officers with more than 25 years of service, ostensibly because they thought them to be lethargic, out of touch, and ineffective. However, the unspoken and most important reason was because they viewed the older generals as rivals for power.&lt;ref name=mo769/&gt; Specific targets of this proposed policy were Minh and other senior officers in his short-lived junta, [[Tran Van Don]], [[Le Van Kim]] and [[Mai Huu Xuan]].&lt;ref&gt;Kahin, pp. 245&amp;ndash;260.&lt;/ref&gt;

The signature of the military-appointed civilian Chief of State [[Phan Khac Suu|Phan Khắc Sửu]] was required to pass the ruling, but Sửu referred the matter to the [[High National Council (South Vietnam)|High National Council]] (HNC), a junta-appointed civilian advisory body, to get their opinion.&lt;ref name=versus/&gt; The HNC turned down the request. This was speculated to be due to the fact that many HNC members were old, and did not appreciate the generals' negativity towards seniors.&lt;ref name=m344&gt;Moyar (2006), p. 344.&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 December, the generals dissolved the HNC.&lt;ref name=mo769&gt;Moyar (2004), p. 769.&lt;/ref&gt; The operation was commanded by Thi&amp;mdash;who had travelled into Saigon from I Corps&amp;mdash;and Ky. The national police, which was under the control and command of the military, moved through the streets before dawn, arresting five HNC members and other politicians and student leaders they deemed to be an obstacle to military rule.&lt;ref name=versus&gt;{{cite news| title=South Viet Nam: The U.S. v. the Generals |date=1965-01-01 |work=[[TIME|Time]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=s294&gt;Shaplen, p. 294.&lt;/ref&gt; Minh and the other aging generals were arrested and flown to [[Pleiku]], a [[Tay Nguyen|central highlands]] town in a [[Montagnard (Vietnam)|Montagnard]] area and forcibly retired, while other officers were simply imprisoned in the capital.&lt;ref name=k398&gt;Karnow, p. 398.&lt;/ref&gt; The junta's forces also arrested around 100 members of the [[National Salvation Council]] (NSC) of [[Le Khac Quyen]]; the NSC was a new political party active in the I Corps region that opposed the expansion of the war and was aligned with Thi and the Buddhist activist monk [[Thich Tri Quang]]. As Thi was active in the purge, it was believed that Quyen had fallen out with Thi.&lt;ref name=s295&gt;Shaplen, p. 295.&lt;/ref&gt;

The deposal prompted US Ambassador [[Maxwell D. Taylor]] to angrily berate Thieu, Thi, Ky and Cang in a private meeting and threaten to cut off aid if they did not reverse their decision. Although nettled by the outburst, Thi took a perverse pleasure in riling Taylor. He was seen by a CIA officer soon after, grinning. When asked why he was happy, Thi said &quot;Because this is one of the happiest days of my life&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;Today I told the American ambassador that he could not dictate to us.&quot;&lt;ref name=post/&gt; The dispute escalated for a few days as the junta threatened to expel Taylor, and Khanh went on a media offensive. A CIA informant reported that the arguments with Taylor had incensed the volatile Thi so much he privately vowed to &quot;blow up everything&quot; and &quot;kill Phan Khac Suu, [[Tran Van Huong]] and Nguyen Khanh and put an end to all this. Then we will see what happens.&quot;&lt;ref name=kh257&gt; Kahin, p. 257.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the dispute galvanized the officers' nationalist sentiments and they rallied around the embattled Khanh for a time. They ignored Taylor's threats without suffering repercussions because the Americans were too intent on defeating the communists to cut funding in an attempt to force policy change in Saigon.&lt;ref&gt;Karnow, pp. 398&amp;ndash;399.&lt;/ref&gt;

During this period, Thi became notorious for his involvement in infighting. A CIA dossier compiled in the 1960s said that Thi &quot;is like a card player, placing his bets now on this leader, then on another; he plays his subordinates in the same manner.

In late January 1965, Buddhist protests against junta-appointed civilian Prime Minister [[Tran Van Huong]] broke out across South Vietnam. The unrest came after Huong had unveiled plans to expand conscription and the war against the communists, and demonstrations were at their largest in I Corps, a Buddhist and anti-war escalation stronghold. In Hue, matters degenerated into a riot as 5,000 demonstrators attacked the United States Information Service Library and burned 8,000 books. Khanh and Thi were thought to have turned a blind eye to the rioting in order to allow the disorder to ruin the Huong government and allow them to inherit power.&lt;ref&gt; Moyar (2004), pp. 774-75.&lt;/ref&gt; Khanh decided to have the armed forces replace Huong, and on the morning of January 27, Khanh staged a bloodless putsch with the support of Thi and Ky. However, many of the officers had agreed to Khanh's plan in the hope that he would fail and discredit himself.&lt;ref name=mo775&gt;Moyar (2004), p. 775.&lt;/ref&gt;

==1965 coup against Nguyen Khanh==
{{main|1965 South Vietnamese coup}}
By this time, Taylor's relationship with Khanh had already broken down irreparably over the issue of the HNC,&lt;ref&gt;Kahin, pp. 255&amp;ndash;260.&lt;/ref&gt; and the US became increasingly intent on a regime change as Khanh was becoming more reliant on Buddhist support, which they saw as an obstacle to their war expansion plans.&lt;ref&gt;Kahin, pp. 294&amp;ndash;296.&lt;/ref&gt; In the first week of February, Taylor told the leading South Vietnamese officers that the US was &quot;in no way propping up General Khanh or backing him in any fashion&quot;.&lt;ref name=kh298&gt;Kahin, p. 298.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite their mutual alignment with Buddhist activists,&lt;ref name=kh296&gt;Kahin, p. 296. &lt;/ref&gt; Thi was known to have become personally hostile to Khanh by this time.&lt;ref name=kh301&gt;Kahin, p. 301.&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, many officers were organizing separate plots against Khanh.&lt;ref&gt;Kahin, pp. 297-300.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly before noon on 19 February,&lt;ref name=tc/&gt;&lt;ref name=m363/&gt; the undetected communist agent,&lt;ref&gt;Karnow, pp. 39-40.&lt;/ref&gt; Colonel [[Pham Ngoc Thao]] and Phat used tanks and some infantry battalions to seize control of the national military headquarters, post office and the radio station of Saigon.&lt;ref name=tc/&gt;&lt;ref name=m363&gt;Moyar (2006), p. 363.&lt;/ref&gt; The rebels failed to capture Ky,&lt;ref name=patience&gt;{{cite news|title=South Viet Nam: A Trial for Patience|work=[[TIME|Time]]|date=1965-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; who fled to Tan Son Nhut, where he ran into Khanh, and the pair flew off together, while some junta figures were arrested there.&lt;ref name=kh300&gt;Kahin, p. 300.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=vd81&gt;VanDeMark, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=t363&gt; Tang, p. 363.&lt;/ref&gt; Thao made a radio announcement stating his desire to get rid of Khanh, whom he described as a &quot;dictator&quot;,&lt;ref name=tc/&gt; while some of his fellow rebels made comments eulogizing Diem and indicating that they would start a hardline Catholic regime. This alarmed Thi, as the tone of the comments indicated that the rebels might punish people who had fought against Diệm in the past, such as those involved in the 1960 and 1963 coups.&lt;ref&gt; Kahin, pp. 300-01.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Americans decided that while they wanted Khanh out, they did not approve of Thao and Phat and their polarizing policies, so they began to lobby Ky and Thi, the two most powerful officers apart from Khanh, to defeat both sides.&lt;ref name=kh301/&gt; While Ky used air power to stop the two sides from confrontation by threatening to bomb them if they opened fire,&lt;ref name=kh302&gt;Kahin, p. 302. &lt;/ref&gt; the Americans consulted with Thi and General [[Cao Van Vien]], the commander of III Corps surrounding Saigon. They wanted Thi and Vien to assemble units hostile to both Khanh and the rebels into a Capital Liberation Force.&lt;ref name=kh302/&gt; The Americans provided Thi with a plane so that he could fly in from his I Corps headquarters in [[Da Nang|Đà Nẵng]] to lead ground forces against both Khanh and the rebels.&lt;ref name=kh302/&gt;

Late in the night, Phat and Thao met Ky in a meeting organized by the Americans, and insisted that Khanh be removed from power. The coup collapsed when, between midnight and dawn, anti-coup forces swept into the city; it was generally thought that the rebels did not put up a fight after being assured that Khanh would be ousted.&lt;ref name=tc/&gt;&lt;ref name=m364&gt;Moyar (2006), p. 364.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=vd82&gt;VanDeMark, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; Early in the morning, Thi, who gained the support of Ky, proposed a motion within the junta to remove Khanh and force him into exile, and the final vote was unanimous&amp;mdash;Khanh was absent from the meeting.&lt;ref name=tc/&gt;&lt;ref name=kh303&gt;Kahin, p. 303.&lt;/ref&gt; Ky, Thi and Thieu then became the key figures in a junta that continued with Sửu and Prime Minister [[Phan Huy Quat]] as a civilian front, although General [[Tran Van Minh]] became the nominal commander-in-chief of the armed forces.&lt;ref name=tc&gt;Shaplen, pp. 310&amp;ndash;312.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=kh303/&gt;&lt;ref name=l3467&gt;Langguth, pp. 346&amp;ndash;347.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thi was a senior member in the ten-man ruling junta, which wanted to expand the military effort against the communists, something that was opposed by the Buddhist protestors. Thi performed a balancing act and accommodated the Buddhists, wanting them to see him as a friend. He allowed the students to publish a magazine that was highly critical of military rule.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite web|title=Obituaries: Nguyen Chanh Thi, 84, was ousted as general in South Vietnam|work=[[The New York Times]]|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/26/world/asia/26thi.html|author=Martin, Douglas|date=2007-06-26|accessdate=2009-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thi also manoeuvred to have his trusted subordinate Colonel [[Pham Van Lieu]] installed as the head of the national police&amp;mdash;a body controlled by the army and effectively a military unit&amp;mdash;increasing his political power.&lt;ref name=thiparty&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,941937,00.html|title=The Saigon Thi Party|accessdate=2009-10-11|date=1966-03-25|publisher=[[TIME|''Time'']]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following his ascension, Lieu replaced most of the Saigon district police chiefs with Thi supporters, raising the ire of some other prominent officers.&lt;ref name=kh343&gt;Kahin, p. 343.&lt;/ref&gt; The Buddhist activist leader [[Thich Tri Quang|Thích Trí Quảng]] said that &quot;Thi is nominally a Buddhist, but does not really care about religion&quot;.&lt;ref name=mo781&gt;Moyar (2004), p. 781.&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1965, Quat and Sửu resigned due to persistent disputes with the military and one another; Thi had an opportunity to take power.&lt;ref&gt;Kahin, pp. 340-43.&lt;/ref&gt; Quat resigned and tried to directly hand over power to Thi, but this was not allowed by the generals. Nevertheless, Thi was offered the prime ministerial position by his colleagues.&lt;ref name=kh344/&gt; He was seen as having a similar level of political influence to Ky, and was voted in as prime minister by the ten-man junta. However, he declined the job offer on the private advice of Lieu, who told him that the political conditions were not ideal and that he should let a rival take control and fail before stepping in himself. According to Kahin, &quot;to his [Thi's] own bitter disappointment, he was never given a second chance&quot;.&lt;ref name=kh344&gt;Kahin, p. 344.&lt;/ref&gt; Thi's blunder was a great relief to the Americans, who were aware of the fact that Thi&amp;mdash;despite being anti-communist&amp;mdash;had a hostility towards American advice. Ky and Thieu, both pro-American and supportive of a drastic escalation in anti-communist military activity, became prime minister and head of state respectively, the latter post being largely ceremonial.&lt;ref&gt;Kahin, pp. 344-45, 525.&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of who held the top jobs, no officer had firm control over his peers, and the respective corps commanders were effectively allowed to independently rule their own regions in return for ongoing support of the junta.&lt;ref name=kh417/&gt;

In the same year, U.S. ground forces were introduced into combat roles in large numbers, and the first [[US Marines]] came ashore at Da Nang in Thi's I Corps. The flamboyant Thi organized for the American troops to be greeted by military bands, welcoming banners and teenage girls who garlanded them with flowers. This caused embarrassment to US military officials who felt the introduction of combat troops and resultant American casualties would not be received well by the public when contrasted with Thi's celebratory fanfare. Soon after the Americans were in position, Thi tipped off Marine Lieutenant General [[Lewis W. Walt]] about a major movement of [[Vietcong|Việt Cộng]] insurgents near [[Chu Lai]] in [[Quang Tri Province]] near the border with North Vietnam.&lt;ref name=post/&gt;&lt;ref name=t383&gt;Gilbert, pp. 77-80.&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted in [[Operation Starlite]], generally regarded as the first offensive action undertaken by the Americans in the Vietnam War.&lt;ref name=post/&gt; Occurring between 18-24 August, it resulted in the 1st [[Vietcong|Việt Cộng]] Regiment being pushed to the coast.&lt;ref name=t383/&gt;

Air Marshal Ky, the prime minister and the most powerful member of the junta feared Thi as a rival.&lt;ref name=post&gt;{{cite web |title= South Vietnamese Gen.

The historian [[Stanley Karnow]] said of Ky and Thi: &quot;Both flamboyant characters who wore gaudy uniforms and sported sinister moustaches, the two young officers had been friends, and their rivalry seemed to typify the personal struggles for power that chronically afflicted South Vietnam. But their dispute mirrored more than individual ambition.&quot;&lt;ref name=k460&gt;Karnow, p. 460.&lt;/ref&gt; Both were also known for their colorful red berets.&lt;ref name=post/&gt; There were reports Thi was showing insubordination towards Ky. The US military commander in Vietnam, General [[William Westmoreland]], said that Thi once refused to report to Ky in Saigon when requested.&lt;ref name=t34/&gt; On one occasion, when Ky came to I Corps to remonstrate with him, Thi turned to address his staff and mockingly asked &quot;Should we pay attention to this funny little man from Saigon or should we ignore him?&quot;&lt;ref name=thiparty/&gt; Thi made this comment rather loudly, within earshot of Ky, and the Vietnamese politician [[Bui Diem]] thought that Ky viewed Thi's comment as a direct and calculated challenge to his authority.&lt;ref name=t34/&gt; ''Time'' said Thi &quot;ran it [I Corps] like a warlord of yore, obeying those edicts of the central government that suited him and blithely disregarding the rest&quot;.&lt;ref name=thiparty/&gt; Of the four corps commanders, Thi was seen as the one with the most power and independence from Saigon.&lt;ref name=kh417&gt;Kahin, p. 417.&lt;/ref&gt; Kahin said that Ky may have feared that Thi would secede from Saigon and turn central Vietnam into an independent state. The CIA analyst [[Douglas Pike]], who worked in Vietnam, speculated that this would have been a large part of Ky’s thinking, as Vietnamese people have often had strong regional tendencies.&lt;ref name=t34/&gt;

Knowing that Westmoreland and the US Embassy were hostile to Thi and supportive of his leadership,&lt;ref name=kh417/&gt; Ky mustered the support of eight generals on the 10-man junta, meaning that along with his vote, there were nine officers in favor of Thi's removal.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; With Thi the only non-supporter, Ky and his colleagues removed Thi from the junta and his corps command on March 10, 1966.&lt;ref name=post/&gt; Thi claimed that during this meeting, knowing the other generals' antipathy to him, he nettled them by chastising their commitment to the country. He said the populace would never support the generals' war effort as long as they lived so comfortably, and he mocked them for ostentatiously flying their wives and mistresses to [[Hong Kong]] for shopping expeditions.&lt;ref name=t35&gt;Topmiller, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; The junta put Thi under house arrest pending his deportation from the country, and appointed General [[Nguyen Van Chuan]], the erstwhile commander of 1st Division and a Thi subordinate, as the new I Corps commander.&lt;ref name=t35/&gt;

The Americans supported Thi's removal as they regarded him as being soft on communism,&lt;ref name=post/&gt; and a &quot;virtual warlord&quot;.&lt;ref name=post/&gt; US Ambassador [[Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr.]], Westmoreland and the Defense Secretary [[Robert McNamara]] were supportive of the Ky-Thieu regime, their prosecution of the war against the communists and support of a US escalation, and they opposed Thi, regarding him as lacking firmness against communism.&lt;ref name=hn/&gt; At a White House meeting after news of the dismissal came through, Taylor said that Thi was &quot;a bad character and good riddance&quot;.&lt;ref name=kh417/&gt; Lodge wrote in a report that Thi &quot;cherished some resentment against the Americans in respect of what he considers political and military interference and infringement of sovereignty&quot;,&lt;ref name=kh417/&gt; claiming he had contemplated &quot;the possibility of establishing a government in the south which would be of such a character that the bulk of the population including the Vietcong would support it&amp;mdash;and presumably neutralization of the country and possibly federation with the North would soon be possible&quot;.&lt;ref name=kh417/&gt; The Americans wanted to ease Thi out of the corridors of power by offering him an economic future in the US and free education for his children,&lt;ref name=hn/&gt; and Lodge and Westmoreland personally spoke to him in an attempt to convince him to accept, but they were unsuccessful.&lt;ref name=kh418&gt;Kahin, p. 418.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Thi had the support of Walt, who commanded American forces in I Corps and was the senior advisor to Thi's forces.&lt;ref name=hn/&gt; Unlike his countrymen, Walt thought highly of Thi's character and ability as an officer.&lt;ref name=hn/&gt;

Ky said that Thi was leaving the country to receive medical treatment for his nasal passages,&lt;ref name=post/&gt; as well as a general health examination.&lt;ref name=kh418/&gt; An official announcement said that the junta &quot;had considered and accepted General Thi's application for a vacation&quot;.&lt;ref name=thiparty/&gt; Thi retorted that &quot;The only sinus condition I have is from the stink of corruption.&quot;&lt;ref name=post/&gt; With the health story exposed as a sham, Ky gave a series of reasons for dismissing Thi, accusing him of being too left-wing, ruling I Corps like a warlord, having a mistress who was suspected of being a communist, and being too conspiratorial.&lt;ref name=t34/&gt; Ky knew that Thi supported negotiations with the communists as a means of ending the war, and had a history of consistently removing officials and military figures who promoted such a policy, but did not publicly mention this as a reason.&lt;ref name=t34/&gt;

Thi's dismissal provoked the Buddhist Uprising, led by the &quot;Struggle Movement&quot;.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; Thi was immensely popular in the Buddhist stronghold of Hue, a city of approximately 120,000, and civil unrest erupted throughout the region. When he returned to the former imperial capital five days after being relieved of his command, around 20,000 supporters mobbed him, shouting and trying to touch him.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; This was part of a gamble by Ky to allow Thi back to his home city in an attempt to placate the dismayed locals, but it did not work.&lt;ref name=t38&gt;Topmiller, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; A general strike incapacited 90% of Da Nang, the second biggest city in South Vietnam and the main port in central Vietnam.&lt;ref name=post/&gt;

During a rally, a Buddhist student leader cried &quot;Do you want the general to stay with us?&quot; to which the students and other protestors answered, &quot;Yes! Yes!&quot;&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; Thi told the large crowd to &quot;Think about our country, not about me&quot;.&lt;ref name=post/&gt; During the tongue-in-cheek speech, he made sarcastic references about his need to go to the US for health treatment.&lt;ref name=t38/&gt; He told a journalist that he would accept &quot;any position which is useful for the country&quot;, leading some to think that he wanted Ky or Thieu's job.&lt;ref name=post/&gt; According to ''Time'' magazine, Thi's speeches showed he &quot;was obviously torn between a desire to rally support for a comeback and his soldier's distaste for adding to dissension&quot;.&lt;ref name=smoke&gt;{{Cite news| title=South Viet Nam: Smoke, Fire &amp; Welfare |date=1966-03-25 |work=[[TIME|Time]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kahin said that &quot;despite the circumspection of his public addresses, [they] undoubtedly helped encourage the Struggle Movement.&quot;&lt;ref name=kh419&gt;Kahin, p. 419.&lt;/ref&gt;

The various dissidents formed a pro-Thi, anti-Ky organization called the Military-Civilian Struggle Committee, better known as the Struggle Movement.&lt;ref name=hn/&gt; Their message and influence quickly spread as they called for the end of military rule and took over radio stations and government buildings in I Corps.&lt;ref name=hn/&gt; They intensified their calls for Ky to fulfil his promise to hold democratic elections.&lt;ref name=kh418/&gt; Some I Corps units supportive of Thi then decided to join the Struggle Movement and ceased military operations against the Vietcong, instead starting a stand-off against Ky. Throughout April and May there were tense incidents as units loyal to the junta were flown in from Saigon, and the factions came close to warfare.&lt;ref name=hn/&gt;

Thi publicly disassociated himself from the Struggle Movement.&lt;ref name=hn/&gt; However, he remained in I Corps and was still regarded as a significant political influence and motivating factor for the Struggle Movement. Regardless of what he may have thought, the discontent against Ky was by then too much for him to control even if he had wanted to.&lt;ref name=kh419/&gt; By June, ARVN loyalists, with the help of the American forces, prevailed.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; Their superior numbers convinced many in the Struggle Movement to back down and realign with the government, and those who refused were militarily defeated, often in bitter street-to-street fighting.&lt;ref&gt;Kahin, pp. 428&amp;ndash;432.&lt;/ref&gt; While the Struggle Movement was finally ebbing away, Thi agreed to meet with Ky at an American air base in [[Chu Lai]] to reach a settlement, seeing as the junta was going to prevail in any case. Thi agreed to the original offers of subsidies and the cover story of a medical trip.&lt;ref name=kh429/&gt;

== Exile ==
After the uprising was crushed, Thi was deported to the US and lived in a small apartment on Connecticut Avenue on [[Washington, DC|Washington's]] [[Dupont Circle, Washington, D.C.|Dupont Circle]].&lt;ref name=post/&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; Although the apartment was small, Kahin, who interviewed Thi after his exile, described it as &quot;handsome&quot;.&lt;ref name=kh429&gt;Kahin, p. 429.&lt;/ref&gt; However, ''The New York Times'' called it &quot;shabby&quot;.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; Thi left his uniforms in his closet in Vietnam and disposed of all his medals. The only thing he kept from his military career was an army blanket.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; As part of his removal from South Vietnam, the American government gave him a substantial living allowance and paid for all his children's education fees. Around 1973, the payments were suddenly discontinued.&lt;ref&gt;Kahin, pp. 418, 429.&lt;/ref&gt; During his life in Washington, Thi spent much of his time at the [[Library of Congress]], reading books about Asian history.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; Outspoken and still supported by many Buddhists, Thi tried to return to South Vietnam in February 1972, but troops of the Catholic President Thieu surrounded his plane on the tarmac and prevented him from disembarking;&lt;ref name=post/&gt; the aircraft eventually took off and returned to the US.&lt;ref name=post/&gt;

Thi lived in the American capital until 1975, when he moved to [[Arkansas]]. He lived in the southern state for a short period before settling in [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania]]. He worked in a variety of jobs and occasionally made speeches at universities and to [[Vietnamese American]] organizations and meetings.&lt;ref name=post/&gt; According to his relatives, Thi remained popular among the Vietnamese American community, most of whom had come to the US after the [[fall of Saigon]] and were stridently anti-communist. His family said their refugee compatriots often recognized him, and usually refused to let him pay for meals at their restaurants.&lt;ref name=post/&gt; Thi's first marriage to Oanh Nguyen ended in divorce.&lt;ref name=post/&gt; They had five children, four sons and a daughter.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; He later remarried Catherine Nguyen, who bore him a daughter.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; In all, Thi had six children and 12 grandchildren.&lt;ref name=post/&gt; He died at the Hospice of Lancaster County from heart ailments on June 23, 2007.&lt;ref name=post/&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;
