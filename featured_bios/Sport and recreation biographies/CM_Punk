Punk initially came to prominence through his career on the professional wrestling [[independent circuit]], primarily as a member of the ROH roster, where he was the first head trainer of the [[Ring of Honor#ROH Wrestling Academy|ROH wrestling school]] as well as winning both of their championships. In 2005, Punk signed a contract with WWE and was sent to its developmental promotion, [[Ohio Valley Wrestling]] (OVW), where he won every championship available in the promotion. Throughout his career, Punk has consistently used the [[glossary of professional wrestling terms#Gimmick|gimmick]] of being [[straight edge]], a lifestyle he follows in his actual day-to-day life.&lt;ref name=&quot;punkshoot&quot;&gt;{{cite video|people=CM Punk|url=http://www.rfvideo.com/browseproducts/Shoot-with-CM-Punk.html|title=Shoot with CM Punk|medium=DVD| publisher=[[Rob Feinstein#RF Video|RF Video]]|date=November 2003|accessdate=2007-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on Punk's [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Alignment|alignment]] as a [[Face (professional wrestling)|crowd favorite]] or [[Heel (professional wrestling)|villain]], he emphasizes different aspects of the culture to encourage the desired audience [[Heat (professional wrestling)|reaction]].&lt;ref name=&quot;punkshoot&quot; /&gt;

==Professional wrestling career==
===Early career===
[[Image:Punkindependent.jpg|thumb|upright=.75|CM Punk in a match against Danny Dominion at an [[National Wrestling Alliance|NWA Midwest]] event on November 23, 2002 in [[Grayslake, Illinois]].]]
Punk's first venture into wrestling was a stint in a [[backyard wrestling]] federation called the Lunatic Wrestling Federation with his friends and brother Mike Brooks in the mid-late 1990s. He first started using the [[ring name]] CM Punk when he was put into a [[tag team]] named the Chick Magnets with CM Venom after another performer skipped out on the [[Card (sports)|card]].&lt;ref name=&quot;punkshoot&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;chickmagnets&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagowrestling.com/AL/al-cmvenom-12-17-01.htm |title=CM Venom Interview|accessdate=2006-09-26|last=Lagattolla|first=Al|date=2001-12-17|publisher=Chicago Wrestling|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20040222144349/http://www.chicagowrestling.com/AL/al-cmvenom-12-17-01.htm|archivedate=2004-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;jon&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.ign.com/articles/748/748635p1.html| title=CM Punk Interview|accessdate=2007-03-19|last=Robinson|first=Jon|date=2006-12-01|publisher=IGN}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike his friends, Punk genuinely wanted to be a wrestler and saw it as more than simple fun.&lt;ref name=&quot;punkshoot&quot; /&gt; When the promotion started taking off, doing spot shows out of a warehouse in [[Mokena, Illinois]], Punk found out that his brother Mike had embezzled thousands of dollars from the small company, causing them to become estranged. They have not spoken since.&lt;ref name=&quot;GomezPB2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Gomez|first=Luis|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-03-26/entertainment/chi-cm-punk-interview-rock-cena-wwe-20120326_1_pipe-bomb-beth-phoenix-wrestlemania|title=Pipe bomb! More from my interview with WWE Champ CM Punk|date=March 26, 2012|accessdate=April 5, 2012|publisher=Chicago Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He soon left the federation and enrolled as a student at the &quot;Steel Dominion&quot; wrestling school in Chicago, where he was trained by [[Ace Steel]],&lt;ref name=&quot;acesteel&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/superstars/raw/cmpunk/punkblogarchives/cmpunkblog012307|title=Congratulations to Ace|accessdate=2011-01-30|first=CM|last=Punk|date= 2007-01-23|publisher=[[WWE]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Danny Dominion and Kevin Quinn to become a professional wrestler. As part of the training, he wrestled at Steel Domain Wrestling in St. Paul, Minnesota.&lt;ref name=&quot;punkshoot&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;wojick&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wrestlingclothesline.com/Wojcik-Punk.htm|title=Wojick Interview|accessdate=2006-09-26 |last=Wojick|first=Alan|date=2003-06-21|publisher=The Wrestling Clothesline}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was in the Steel Domain that he met Scott Colton,&lt;ref name=&quot;punkcabana&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;joepunk&quot;&gt;{{cite video|people=CM Punk; [[Samoa Joe]]|url=http://www.wrestledvd.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=466&amp;Itemid=40|title=Straight Shootin' with Samoa Joe &amp; CM Punk|medium=DVD|publisher=[[Ring of Honor]]|date=2005-03-10|accessdate=2007-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; who soon adopted the stage name [[Colt Cabana]].  Punk and Cabana became best friends and spent most of their early career together working in the same [[independent circuit]] promotions, as opponents or allies.&lt;ref name=&quot;punkcabana&quot;&gt;{{cite video|people=CM Punk; Colt Cabana|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20070927174133/http://www.rohwrestling.com/shoponline.asp?point=moreinfo&amp;catid=200&amp;id=1397|title=Straight Shootin' with CM Punk &amp; Colt Cabana|medium=DVD|publisher=[[Ring of Honor]]|date=2005-07-01|accessdate=2007-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the independents, Punk, along with fellow Steel Domain graduates Colt Cabana, Chuckee Smooth, [[Adam Pearce]] and manager [[Dave Prazak]], formed an [[glossary of professional wrestling terms#Stable|alliance]] named the Gold Bond Mafia.&lt;ref name=&quot;punkshoot&quot; /&gt;

===Independent Wrestling Association: Mid-South (2000–2005)===
Punk's home [[Professional wrestling promotion|promotion]] for his early career is usually considered to be [[Independent Wrestling Association Mid-South]] (IWA:Mid-South).&lt;ref name=&quot;punkshoot&quot; /&gt; During Punk's time in IWA:Mid-South, he had high profile feuds with Colt Cabana and [[Chris Hero]] while also rising to the top of the roster winning the [[IWA Mid-South Light Heavyweight Championship]] twice and the [[IWA Mid-South Heavyweight Championship]] on five separate occasions, beating stars like [[A.J. Styles]], Cabana and even [[Eddie Guerrero]] for that Championship. Punk's feud with Hero included a 55-minute [[Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match|TLC match]],&lt;ref name=&quot;punkshoot&quot; /&gt; a 93-minute [[Professional wrestling match types#Series variations|two out of three falls match]],&lt;ref name=&quot;wojick&quot; /&gt; and several 60-minute time limit draws.&lt;ref name=&quot;joepunk&quot; /&gt;

Punk's matches with Cabana led him to being hired by the [[Ring of Honor]] promotion.&lt;ref name=&quot;wojick&quot; /&gt; From February 2003 until May 2004, Punk refused to wrestle for IWA:Mid-South, because he claims that this was in protest to [[Ian Rotten]]'s mistreatment of Chris Hero in the company.&lt;ref name=&quot;punkshoot&quot; /&gt; Hero, however, has stated he believes there were other reasons, and Rotten's treatment of him was just an excuse by Punk to stop working for the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|people=[[Chris Hero]]|url=http://www.rfvideo.com/shootwithchrishero.aspx|title=Shoot with Chris Hero|medium=DVD|publisher=[[Rob Feinstein#RF Video|RF Video]]|date=2005|accessdate= 2007-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually Punk returned to IWA:Mid-South and continued to perform as a wrestler and commentator for them until 2005 when he was signed to World Wrestling Entertainment. His last appearance in IWA:Mid-South was on July 2, 2005 in which he competed in a 60-minute time limit draw against [[Delirious (wrestler)|Delirious]].&lt;ref name=&quot;owwpunk&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/c/c-m-punk.html|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|title= Wrestler Profiles}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, Punk joined [[Ring of Honor]] (ROH) as a [[Face (professional wrestling)|crowd favorite]],&lt;ref name=&quot;punkshoot&quot; /&gt; but quickly became a [[Heel (professional wrestling)|villain]] in a feud with [[Raven (wrestler)|Raven]] that featured numerous variants of [[Professional wrestling match types#No Disqualification match|no disqualification matches]].&lt;ref name=ROHresults&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rohwrestling.com/pastresults/|accessdate=April 22, 2009|title=Ring of Honor event results|publisher=[[Ring of Honor]]| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080822123049/http://www.rohwrestling.com/pastresults/| archivedate = August 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their rivalry lasted most of 2003 and was considered one of ROH's top feuds of the year,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dunn|first=JD|title=Dark Pegasus Video Review: Ring of Honor — One Year Anniversary Show|url=http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/video_reviews/40274/Dark-Pegasus-Video-Review:-Ring-of-Honor-%C3%B3-One-Year-Anniversary-Show.htm|publisher=411mania|accessdate=November 27, 2010|date=May 30, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was based around Punk's straight-edge lifestyle, with him likening  Raven to his alcoholic father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dunn|first=JD|title=Dark Pegasus Video Review: Ring of Honor – Death Before Dishonor|url=http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/video_reviews/40724/Dark-Pegasus-Video-Review:-Ring-of-Honor---Death-Before-Dishonor.htm|publisher=411mania.com|accessdate=November 27, 2010|date=June 16, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their rivalry was settled at ''The Conclusion'' in November 2003, where Punk defeated Raven in a Steel Cage match.&lt;ref name=ROHresults/&gt; At the same time, Punk joined the wrestling promotion [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling|NWA Total Nonstop Action]] (TNA), in which he was paired with [[Brian Wohl|Julio Dinero]] as members of Raven's TNA alliance [[Raven's Nest#The Gathering|The Gathering]].&lt;ref name=&quot;punkshoot&quot; /&gt;

Punk started climbing the ranks of ROH, including coming in second at the ''Second Anniversary Show'' during the tournament to crown the first [[ROH Pure Championship|ROH Pure Champion]], losing to [[A.J.

Shortly before a TNA show on February 25, 2004, Punk had a physical scuffle with [[Teddy Hart]] outside of a restaurant that was broken up by [[Sabu (wrestler)|Sabu]]. The scuffle reportedly stemmed from an ROH show in which Hart performed [[Teddy Hart#Ring of Honor and Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2003–2004)|three unplanned spots]] putting several other wrestlers in danger of injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://cmpunk.livejournal.com/2003/11/12/|title=My turn..|accessdate=July 13, 2007|first=CM| last=Punk|date=November 12, 2003|publisher=[[LiveJournal]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestlingobserver.com/wo/news/headlines/default.asp?aID=15350 |title=Derek Burgan reviews Best of Teddy Hart &amp; Jack Evans|accessdate=June 13, 2007|last=Burgan|first=Derek| date=January 28, 2006|format=asp|publisher=[[Dave Meltzer#Wrestling Observer Newsletter|Wrestling Observer Newsletter]]|quote=The interviewer immediately asked Teddy about the situation with CM Punk. &quot;CM Punk, or Phil, whatever he wants to be known as in a shoot interview, took it upon himself to be spokesman for a group of people in ROH that though I took a show into my own hands.&quot; Teddy is referring to the Main Event Spectacles show I wrote about above.

====Pursuit of the World Championship (2004–2005)====
In ROH, Punk faced off against [[ROH World Championship|ROH World Champion]] [[Samoa Joe]] for the championship in a three match series. The first match, on June 12, 2004 at ''World Title Classic'' in Dayton, Ohio, resulted in a 60-minute time limit draw when neither Punk nor Joe could pin or cause the other to submit in the 60 minutes. The second match between Punk and Joe was planned for December 4, 2004; however, due to [[Steve Corino]] being pulled from a match with Joe by [[Pro Wrestling Zero1|Pro Wrestling ZERO-ONE]], the second match was hastily rescheduled on October 11, 2004 for October 16 in Punk's hometown of Chicago.&lt;ref name=&quot;joepunk&quot; /&gt; At ''Joe vs. Punk II'' on October 16, they wrestled to a second 60-minute draw.&lt;ref name=ROHresults/&gt; In addition to ''Joe vs. Punk II'' becoming Ring of Honor's best-selling DVD at the time, the match received a [[5-star match|five-star rating]] by [[Dave Meltzer]]'s ''Wrestling Observer Newsletter''. It was the first match in North America to receive a five-star rating in seven years—the last one being the [[Hell in a Cell]] match between [[Shawn Michaels]] and [[The Undertaker]] at [[Badd Blood: In Your House]] in 1997.&lt;ref name=&quot;joepunk&quot; /&gt; Joe ended the series by defeating Punk in the third and final match on December 4, 2004 at ''All-Star Extravaganza 2'' in which there was a no time limit stipulation.&lt;ref name=ROHresults/&gt;
[[File:CM Punk ROH.jpg|thumb|left|CM Punk in [[Ring of Honor]].]]
In June 2005, Punk accepted a deal with [[WWE#World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wrestling Entertainment]], after a try-out match against [[Sean Morley|Val Venis]] on its ''[[WWE Heat|Sunday Night Heat]]'' show. Even though he had accepted the deal, Punk went on to defeat [[Austin Aries]] with his [[professional wrestling aerial techniques#Super|Pepsi]] [[facebuster#Double underhook facebuster|Plunge]] move, winning the ROH World Championship on June 18, 2005 at ''Death Before Dishonor III''.&lt;ref name=ROH/&gt; Immediately after the match, Punk proceeded to become a villain and started a storyline where he threatened to bring the ROH World Championship to WWE with him. For weeks, Punk teased the ROH locker room and the ROH fans as well as mocking the championship he possessed, going so far as to sign his WWE contract on it. During the storyline, [[Mick Foley]] made several ROH appearances, attempting to convince Punk to do the right thing and defend the title on his way out. On August 12, 2005 in Dayton, Ohio, Punk lost the ROH World Championship to [[Jamie Noble|James Gibson]] in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic elimination matches|four corner elimination match]] consisting of himself, Gibson, Samoa Joe and [[Christopher Daniels]], who re-debuted after a year-and-half absence.&lt;ref name=ROH/&gt; Punk's final scheduled match in Ring of Honor took place at ''Punk: The Final Chapter'' on August 13, 2005 against long-time friend Colt Cabana in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Series variations|two out of three falls match]], which he lost.&lt;ref name=ROHresults/&gt; In his last match, Punk was visibly crying and was showered with streamers when he posed in the middle of the ring.

Punk made a special appearance at the ROH show ''Unscripted II'' on February 11, 2006, when the original card had to be scrapped due to [[Low Ki]] leaving ROH the week prior.&lt;ref name=ROHresults/&gt; In addition, most of the ROH roster contracted to TNA were pulled from the show because of a snowstorm that TNA officials thought might prevent performers from reaching [[TNA Against All Odds 2006|a pay-per-view]] scheduled the next day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/video_reviews/39778/ROH---Unscripted-II-DVD-Review.htm|title=ROH – Unscripted II DVD Review| accessdate=June 13, 2007|last=Ziegler|first=Jacob|date=May 6, 2006|publisher=411mania}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;unscripted2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.pwtorch.com/artman/exec/view.cgi/25/16510|title=DVD Review: ROH, &quot;Unscripted II,&quot; Feb. 11, 2006, with Punk &amp; Dragon vs. Rave &amp; Pearce, Aries-Nigel|accessdate=June 13, 2007|last=Vetter|first=Chris|date=April 12, 2006|publisher=Pro Wrestling Torch |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070617092715/www.pwtorch.com/artman/exec/view.cgi/25/16510 |archivedate=June 17, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the main event, Punk teamed with [[Bryan Danielson]] to wrestle and ultimately defeat [[Jimmy Rave]] and [[Adam Pearce]] in a tag team match.&lt;ref name=&quot;unscripted2&quot; /&gt;

===World Wrestling Entertainment / WWE===
====Ohio Valley Wrestling (2005–2006)====
In September 2005, Punk was assigned to [[Ohio Valley Wrestling]] (OVW), a WWE developmental territory. He made his debut on September 8, 2005, in a [[glossary of professional wrestling terms#Dark match|dark match]], where he, [[Nigel McGuinness]] and [[Paul Burchill]] were defeated by [[Jimmy Reiher, Jr.|Deuce Shade]], [[Elijah Burke]] and [[Steven Adkins|Seth Skyfire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestleview.com/news2005/1126204847.shtml|title=CM Punk debuts in OVW + Shane Helms meets Hurricane Victims &amp; More|accessdate=August 23, 2010|last=Bauer|first=Ben|date=September 8, 2005| work=WrestleView}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 26, 2005 in his OVW television debut, Punk suffered a ruptured eardrum and broken nose after Danny Inferno hit him with an [[Botch (professional wrestling)|overly]] [[glossary of professional wrestling terms#Stiff|stiff]] [[Punch (combat)|right hand]].

On November 9, 2005, Punk became the [[OVW Television Championship|OVW Television Champion]] after defeating [[Kenny Dykstra|Ken Doane]],&lt;ref name=&quot;ovwresults05&quot;/&gt; which immediately led to a feud between Punk and [[Brent Albright]], who had previously been feuding with Doane for the Television Championship and had lost his chance to wrestle Doane after Punk hit him with a chair so he himself could wrestle Doane. They wrestled in series of matches, including one that ended in overtime with Albright having Punk submit to Albright's [[glossary of professional wrestling terms#Finisher|finisher]], the [[Professional wrestling holds#Fujiwara armbar|Crowbar]], but Punk was able to keep the championship, as he had not agreed to the extra time.&lt;ref name=&quot;ovwresults05&quot;/&gt; On January 4, 2006, Punk lost the OVW Television Championship during a [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic elimination matches|three way dance]] among himself, Albright and Doane. Doane was injured halfway through the match and was replaced by [[Aaron Stevens (wrestler)|Aaron &quot;The Idol&quot; Stevens]].

This feud continued for weeks with Punk always getting the better of Albright until a [[glossary of professional wrestling terms#Double turn|double turn]] occurred on February 1, 2006 when Albright became a villain during a tag match, allowing the [[Spirit Squad]] to beat Punk and, in doing so, making Punk a crowd favorite.&lt;ref name=&quot;ovwresults06&quot;/&gt; During this time, Punk had a minor appearance at [[WrestleMania 22]] on April 2, 2006 as one of the [[gangster]]s who rode a 1930s era car to the ring before [[John Cena]]'s entrance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/pictures/c/cmpunk/19.jpg|title=19.jpg|accessdate=September 26, 2006|date=April 2, 2006|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|quote=CM Punk as a gangster during [[John Cena]]'s entrance}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[Matt Cappotelli]] vacated the [[OVW Heavyweight Championship]] because of a [[Astrocytoma|brain tumor]] in February 2006, a tournament was held to crown a new champion. The finals were Brent Albright vs. CM Punk with Albright defeating Punk to become the new champion.&lt;ref name=&quot;ovwresults06&quot;/&gt; Punk and Albright continued their feud, with Albright becoming more unstable and paranoid about maintaining his championship after several close call matches against Punk, resulting in acts such as threatening [[Maria Kanellis|Maria]]. On May 3, 2006, Punk finally defeated Albright in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Strap match|strap match]] to win the OVW Heavyweight Championship.&lt;ref name=&quot;ovwresults06&quot;/&gt; As champion, Punk retained the title in matches against opponents such as [[Cryme Tyme|Shad Gaspard]],&lt;ref name=&quot;ovwresults06&quot;/&gt; [[Ken Anderson (wrestler)|Ken Kennedy]],&lt;ref name=&quot;ovwresults06&quot;/&gt; [[Johnny Jeter]]&lt;ref name=&quot;ovwresults06&quot;/&gt; and [[The Miz|Mike &quot;The Miz&quot; Mizanin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pwtorch.com/artman/publish/article_17333.shtml|title=7/15 OVW in Cordyon, Ind.: C.M.

==Gimmick==
Punk has adopted his real-life following of the [[straight edge]] movement as his professional wrestling [[glossary of professional wrestling terms#Gimmick|gimmick]], but the gimmick uses different elements of Punk's personality and the beliefs of the straight edge movement depending on his [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Alignment|alignment]]. While portraying a crowd favorite, the gimmick tends to be that of Punk's normal personality,&lt;ref name=&quot;punkshoot&quot; /&gt; largely indifferent to others who drink [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]], [[smoking|smoke]] tobacco, partake in [[recreational drug use]] or have [[promiscuity|promiscuous]] [[human sexual behavior|sexual behavior]], but emphasizing the social discipline involved with [[abstinence]]. Conversely, his villainous personality tends to be that of one who is [[Hardline (subculture)|hardline]] or [[Straight edge#1990s|militant straight edge]], exemplifying the elitist attitudes and superiority complexes—defined by Punk's common mantra during villainous-themed [[glossary of professional wrestling terms#Promo|promos]] that, because he is straight edge, he is &quot;better than you&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;punkshoot&quot; /&gt; Punk performs the straight edge symbol of crossing his arms in an X formation while having the letter X written on the back of his hands, usually drawn on his wrist tape.

Originally, the initials CM in his ring name represented the phrase &quot;Chick Magnet&quot;, the name of the tag team he was in as a [[Backyard wrestling|backyard wrestler]].&lt;ref name=&quot;punkshoot&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;jon&quot; /&gt; Punk, however, later changed CM into an [[orphan initialism]], declaring that it has no meaning,&lt;ref name=&quot;wojick&quot; /&gt; though when asked since he has taken to making up meanings that fit the initials, going so far as to make up long stories to explain the origins that do not match the actual origin story at all.&lt;ref name=&quot;wojick&quot; /&gt; Since beginning this practice, Punk has stated CM stands for &quot;[[Cookie Monster]]&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/content/media/video/vms/wweuncut/2007/may29-31/4775196|title=WWE UnCut: CM Punk|accessdate=June 12, 2007|date=May 29, 2007|publisher=[[WWE]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Cookie Master&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.mississauga.com/news/article/8324--sports-heroes-take-on-aids|title=Sport Heroes takes on AIDS|publisher=[[The Mississauga News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;[[#In wrestling|Crooked Moonsault]]&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;cagematchde&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.cagematch.de/?id=2&amp;nr=00000080|title=Datenbank Profil – CM Punk|accessdate=September 26, 2006|publisher=Cagematch.de|language= German}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;[[Chuck Mosley]]&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;cagematchde&quot; /&gt; &quot;[[Mr. Burns|Charles Montgomery]]&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;jon&quot; /&gt; &quot;[[Charles Manson]]&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;jon&quot; /&gt; &quot;Crazy Mariachi&quot;, &quot;Chicago Made&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/espn/thelife/videogames/news/story?id=3681125| accessdate=January 30, 2011|date=November 4, 2008|last=Robinson|first=Jon|title=WWE Smackdown vs. Raw 2009: CM Punk|publisher=[[ESPN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  among others.

An integral part of Punk's gimmick are the numerous [[tattoo]]s that adorn his body, some of which have come to become symbols associated with Punk, as well as [[mantra]]s and declarations that have been integrated into his gimmick. The tattoos as a whole, due to their large quantity and variety, have also become an attribute identifiable to Punk.&lt;ref name=&quot;wwemag&quot; /&gt; The most important of the individual tattoos in Punk's character, whether through association, symbol, or mantra, are:
[[File:CM Punk RAW 800.jpg|thumb|upright|CM Punk at a ''Raw'' taping. Prominently visible are the [[Pepsi Globe]] [[tattoo]] on his left shoulder, the &quot;luck is for losers&quot; [[sleeve tattoo]] on his left arm, and the &quot;straight edge&quot; tattoo across his stomach.]]
*A [[Pepsi Globe]] logo on his left shoulder that inspired the names of two of his [[#In wrestling|signature moves]]. It also became a symbol of Punk himself, who wore the logo on his ring gear in the independent circuit, as well as a slightly modified Pepsi logo being used as part of his [[JumboTron|TitanTron]] entrance video.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|people=CM Punk|date=2006|title=Entrance video|url=http://www.wwe.com/content/media/video/tvshows/ecw/entrance_videos/0724cmpunkentvid|publisher=[[WWE]]}} {{Dead link|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Punk, a keen [[Pepsi]] drinker, chose to receive a Pepsi tattoo to emphasize his straight edge beliefs.&lt;ref name=&quot;wojick&quot; /&gt; The tattoo is also a reference to former [[Minor Threat]] guitarist [[Brian Baker (musician)|Brian Baker]], who had a [[Coca-Cola]] tattoo and explained this by saying &quot;I like Coca-Cola&quot;. When people inquire about Punk's Pepsi tattoo, he often replies &quot;I like Pepsi&quot; in a similar fashion.&lt;ref name=&quot;punkshoot&quot; /&gt;
