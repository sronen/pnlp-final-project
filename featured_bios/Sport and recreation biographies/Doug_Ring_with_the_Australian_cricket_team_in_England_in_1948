[[Doug Ring]] was a member of [[Donald Bradman]]'s famous [[Australian cricket team in England in 1948|Australian cricket team which toured England in 1948]]. Bradman’s men went undefeated in their 34 matches; this unprecedented feat by a Test side touring England earned them the sobriquet ''The Invincibles''.

A [[leg spin]]ner, Ring was not prominent in the team's success. Regarded as the last bowler to be selected for the team, Ring played in only the Fifth Test, taking one wicket for 44 runs (1/44) for the match and scoring nine runs in his only innings after replacing [[off spin]]ner [[Ian Johnson (cricketer)|Ian Johnson]], who was dropped for poor form. Along with [[Ron Hamence]] and [[Colin McCool]], neither of whom played in a Test during the tour, Ring called himself &quot;ground staff&quot; because of the paucity of the trio's on-field duties in the major matches and they often sang ironic songs about their status.

For the entire tour, Ring took 60 first-class wickets at a [[bowling average]] of 21.81, the most expensive among Australia's frontline bowlers. As England agreed to have a [[cricket ball|new ball]] available 55 overs after the start of each innings in the Tests—more frequently than usual—[[fast bowling]] dominated over spin, and Ring was used primarily in the non-Test tour matches. Outside the Tests, only [[Bill Johnston (cricketer)|Bill Johnston]] bowled more overs, and Ring was used to relieve the workload on Bradman's pace spearheads to keep them fresh for the Tests. Ring scored 150 first-class runs at a [[batting average]] of 16.66 during the tour, and a top-score of 53 was his only effort beyond 50.

==Background==
Ring made his Test debut in last international match of the 1947&amp;ndash;48 Australian season, the Fifth Test against [[Indian cricket team|India]]. Australia rested a few of its players and some fringe cricketers such as Ring and [[Sam Loxton]] were given a debut so that their ability could be evaluated before the tour of England. Ring took six wickets for the match and was selected for the tour along with Loxton, who scored 80.&lt;ref&gt;Piesse, pp. 156, 335.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early tour==
Australia traditionally fielded its first-choice team in the tour opener, which was customarily against [[Worcestershire County Cricket Club|Worcestershire]].&lt;ref name=haigh&gt;{{Cite news| title=Gentrifying the game| first=Gideon | last=Haigh| authorlink=Gideon Haigh| url=http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/295893.html |publisher=[[Cricinfo]] |date=2007-05-26| accessdate=2007-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ring was omitted from this match, despite having replaced Colin McCool to make his Test debut in the fifth and final match against India in Australia during the 1947–48 season that preceded the tour of England; Ring had taken six wickets for 120 runs (6/120).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url =http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/18/18368.html |title=Australia v India  |publisher = [[CricketArchive]]| accessdate = 2008-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fellow [[leg spin]]ner McCool and [[off spin]]ner Ian Johnson&amp;mdash;who had been regular Test players since [[World War II]]&amp;mdash;were the two slow bowlers picked as Australia started their campaign with an innings victory.&lt;ref name=worcs&gt;{{Cite web

Ring was called into the team for the second tour match against [[Leicestershire County Cricket Club|Leicestershire]]. He made two runs with the bat before being [[run out]] as Australia ended on 448. Ring took two [[batting order (cricket)|top order]] wickets to leave the hosts at 3/56 before returning to take three late wickets as Leicestershire lost their last four wickets without addition to be all out for 130. Ring ended with 5/45.&lt;ref name=leics/&gt; Made to [[follow on]], Leicestershire scored 147 and lost by an innings. Ring failed to add to his wicket tally in the county's second innings, conceding 26 runs.&lt;ref name=leics&gt;{{Cite web

It was the closest Australia came to defeat on the tour, as they scraped home by four wickets in a low scoring affair.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fingleton, pp. 53&amp;ndash;55.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sched/&gt; The Australians travelled to London to play [[Surrey County Cricket Club|Surrey]] at [[The Oval]], and Ring made two in the tourists' 632. He then took 3/34 in the first innings, removing [[Arthur McIntyre (cricketer, born 1918)|Arthur McIntyre]], [[Alec Bedser]] and [[Jim Laker]]. He bowled five wicketless overs in the second innings as Surrey were defeated by an innings.&lt;ref name=surrey&gt;{{Cite web

In the following match, Australia crushed [[Essex County Cricket Club|Essex]] by an innings and 451 runs, its largest winning margin for the summer.&lt;ref name=sched/&gt; On the first day, Australia set a world record by scoring 721, the most first-class runs made in a single day’s play,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Ring was unable to contribute to the surfeit of scoring, making only one. He bowled 18 overs and conceded a total of 35 runs without success as the hosts were bowled out for 83 and 187.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; This was followed by another innings victory, this time over [[Oxford University Cricket Club|Oxford University]]. After having failed to score more than two runs in any of his first three innings of the tour, Ring came to the wicket at 7/317 and scored 53, adding 87 runs in [[partnership (cricket)|partnership]] with fellow Victorian [[Sam Loxton]] before being bowled.

The next match was against the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] at [[Lord's]]. The MCC fielded seven players who would represent England in the Tests,&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#00f&quot;&gt;N-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;{{Ref label|bat|1|a}} and were basically a full strength Test team, while Australia fielded their first-choice team. It was a chance for both teams to gain a psychological advantage. At this point of the tour, Ring had only taken ten wickets at an [[bowling average|average]] of 28.30,&lt;ref name=o/&gt; while McCool had taken 17 at 14.35. McCool retained the first-choice leg spinner's position and took 4/35 as Australia won by an innings.&lt;ref name=sched/&gt;&lt;ref name=mccool&gt;{{Cite web

He bowled only two wicketless overs as the pacemen skittled the hosts for 86, and did not bat as Australia amassed 5/549 declared. He then took three consecutive wickets as Sussex fell from 5/98 to 8/109 before eventually being bowled out for 138.

Ring's performances were not enough for him to take McCool's place in Bradman's first-choice team.&lt;ref name=sco1/&gt; Instead, [[Bill Johnston (cricketer)|Bill Johnston]], who had taken 10/40 against Yorkshire and 11/117 against Hampshire on damp surfaces,&lt;ref name=sco1/&gt; was given the place on the opening morning of the First Test when rain appeared likely.&lt;ref name=haigh/&gt;&lt;ref name=sco1/&gt;&lt;ref name=mcc/&gt; Johnston then took nine wickets in Australia's victory, cementing his position in the team.&lt;ref name=sco1/&gt; This left Ring jostling with the other spinners&amp;mdash;Johnson and McCool&amp;mdash;for one spot in the Test team.

After the First Test, Ring returned to action as Australia completed an innings victory over [[Northamptonshire County Cricket Club|Northamptonshire]]. He took 1/31 in the hosts' first innings of 119, before making an unbeaten 16 in partnering McCool in an unbroken stand of 39 as Australia declared at 8/352. In the second innings, he took four of the last five wickets and ended with 4/31 as Northamptonshire collapsed from 5/142 to be all out for 169.&lt;ref name=northants&gt;{{Cite web

Ring was overlooked for the Second Test at [[Lord's]] as Bradman retained the same XI, despite the incumbent spinner Johnson managing only 1/85 in the First Test. Australia won convincingly by 409&amp;nbsp;runs.&lt;ref name=sco1/&gt;&lt;ref name=sco2/&gt; The next match was against [[Surrey County Cricket Club|Surrey]], starting the day after the finish of the Test. Ring took 3/51 from 21.2 overs in the first innings, leading the way in terms of wickets and overs; most of the Test bowlers were given a light workload. He then contributed an [[not out|unbeaten]] 15 in Australia's first innings of 389. After Australia took a first innings lead of 168, Ring bowled another 24 overs in the second innings and took 1/54. He twice dismissed [[Jack Parker (cricketer)|Jack Parker]], who had top-scored in each innings with 76 and 81.

After stand-in captain [[Lindsay Hassett]] enforced the follow on&amp;mdash;Bradman had rested himself&amp;mdash;Ring removed Test batsmen Barnett and [[George Emmett]] to leave Gloucestershire at 2/20. After resting he resumed bowling with the score at 4/93 and took three more wickets, as the hosts fell to 9/109 and then 132 all out. Ring took 5/47 and bowled the most overs (25) in the second innings. Johnson, however, took 11/100 in the match and retained his place in the team for the Third Test at [[Old Trafford (cricket ground)|Old Trafford]].&lt;ref name=gloucs&gt;{{Cite web

Ring then played against [[Middlesex County Cricket Club|Middlesex]] in Australia's only match before the Fourth Test. He took one wicket in each innings for a match total of 2/57. After only scoring two in the first innings, Ring opened the batting with McCool in the second innings, with a target of only 22&amp;nbsp;runs.

Immediately after the Headingley Test, Ring scored four as Australia amassed 456 against [[Derbyshire County Cricket Club|Derbyshire]]. He bowled the most overs in the first innings, taking 3/73 from 24&amp;nbsp;overs as the hosts made 240.

Along with the effects of the rain on the pitch, the humid conditions assisted the Australian fast bowlers, who were able to make the ball bounce at variable heights.&lt;ref name=&quot;report5&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title= Fifth Test Match England v Australia |work= [[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack]] |year=1949  |url=http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/152898.html |accessdate=2008-07-02 |publisher=[[Wisden]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Led by Lindwall, who took 6/20, Australia skittled England for 52, and Ring did not get a chance to bowl. Ring then made nine before being caught by [[Jack Crapp]] in the slips as Australia replied with 389.&lt;ref name=sco5/&gt;&lt;ref name=a130&gt;Arlott, p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt;  England started their second innings 337 runs in arrears late on day two and resumed at 1/54 the next morning.&lt;ref name=&quot;sco5&quot;/&gt; During the first session, Ring bowled a tidy spell of 13 overs as [[Denis Compton]] and [[Len Hutton]] added only 67 runs for the session.&lt;ref name=&quot;f189&quot;&gt;Fingleton, p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt; Ring did not bowl consistently or accurately, and although the batsman hit him regularly, they did not place their shots, which often went to the fielders.&lt;ref name=o154&gt;O'Reilly, p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt; There were four men in the off side ring and they had much work to do as Hutton hit the ball there repeatedly.&lt;ref name=a134&gt;Arlott, p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; The English batsmen progressed steadily although Ring had one confident appeal for lbw against Compton.&lt;ref name=o155&gt;O'Reilly, p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the day, Ring dismissed debutant [[Allan Watkins]] for two to take his only wicket of the match.&lt;ref name=&quot;sco5&quot;/&gt; Watkins lofted a delivery from Ring to the [[leg side]] straight into the hands of Hassett, who did not need to move from his position on the boundary,&lt;ref name=&quot;f189&quot;/&gt; leaving England at 6/167. The hosts were eventually bowled out early on the fourth morning for 188, sealing defeat by an innings and 149 runs. Ring had taken 1/44 after sending down the most overs in the innings (28), including 13 [[over (cricket)|maidens]].&lt;ref name=&quot;sco5&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;report5&quot;/&gt;

==Later tour matches==
After the Fifth Test seven matches remained on Bradman's quest to go through a tour of England without defeat.&lt;ref name=sched/&gt; Australia rested Ring for the match against [[Kent County Cricket Club|Kent]], which Australia won by an innings.&lt;ref name=kent&gt;{{Cite web

|accessdate = 2008-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by a game against the [[Gentlemen of England]], the leading amateurs in the country. Ring was not required to bat as Australia amassed 5/610 before declaring. He then bowled the most overs in the first innings, sending down 25.3 and taking the wickets of English Test batsmen [[Bill Edrich]], [[Trevor Bailey]] and [[Freddie Brown (cricketer)|Freddie Brown]]. Ring ended with 3/74 as the hosts were bowled out for 245. Australia enforced the follow on and Ring again shouldered the heaviest workload. He removed [[Reg Simpson]] to break the opening stand of 60. The Gentlemen progressed to 3/217 before Ring dismissed Edrich for 128, followed by [[George Mann (cricketer)|George Mann]] for a duck without further addition to the score. Ring then bowled Yardley and dismissed [[Wilf Wooller]] soon after, leaving the hosts at 7/240; they were eventually all out for 284, which sealed an innings victory for Australia. Ring ended with 5/70 from 32 overs.&lt;ref name=sched/&gt;&lt;ref name=gent&gt;{{Cite web

|accessdate = 2008-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following match against [[Somerset County Cricket Club|Somerset]] followed a similar pattern. Ring did not bat as Australia declared at 5/560. He then took 2/17 in the first innings and was not required to bowl in the second innings as the hosts collapsed for 115 and 71 to cede another innings victory.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;&lt;ref name=sched/&gt;&lt;ref name=sw&gt;{{Cite book

Ring was rested for the match against the [[South of England cricket team|South of England]]. Australia declared at 7/522 before the hosts made 298; rain ended the match before the second innings could start.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Australia's biggest challenge in the post-Test tour matches was against the Leveson-Gower's XI. During the previous Australian tour of England in 1938, this team was effectively a full-strength England outfit, but this time Bradman insisted that only six current England Test players be allowed to play for the hosts.&lt;ref name=plg/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fingleton, pp. 207&amp;ndash;209.&lt;/ref&gt; Bradman then fielded a full-strength team.&lt;ref name=plg&gt;Perry (2005), pp. 253&amp;ndash;254.&lt;/ref&gt; He made only one change from the team that won the Fifth Test, dropping Ring for Johnson. Australia led by 312 runs on the first innings before persistent rain ended the match.&lt;ref name=sco5/&gt;&lt;ref name=lg&gt;{{Cite web

The tour ended with two non-first-class matches against [[Scotland national cricket team|Scotland]]. In the first, Ring made an unbeaten three as Australia scored 236. He bowled five overs without success in the first innings, before removing four of the first five batsmen in the second innings and ending with 4/20.&lt;ref name=scot2&gt;{{Cite web

After Australia declared at 6/407, Ring took the leading figures of 4/30, including the wickets of both [[batting order (cricket)|openers]] as Australia ended the tour with another innings triumph.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;&lt;ref name=scot2/&gt;

The blue line is the average of the five most recent innings; the dots indicate [[not out]]s.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;|alt=Ring started the season with three scores of two or less and then scored his only score beyond 50 on his fourth innings.

His average of the five most recent innings fluctuated between 13 and 28.]]

Although the 1948 tour of England was an unprecedented triumph for the Australians, Ring's [[leg spin]] was not prominent in the success. He jostled with McCool and Johnson for a position as Bradman selected only one specialist spinner in the Tests.&lt;ref name=sco1/&gt;&lt;ref name=sco2/&gt;&lt;ref name=sco3/&gt;&lt;ref name=sco4/&gt;&lt;ref name=sco5/&gt; Headlined by Lindwall, Miller and Johnston, the faster bowlers dominated the bowling attack.&lt;ref name=aus/&gt; With a new ball allowed at intervals of 55&amp;nbsp;overs in Tests, a period that usually elapsed sooner than the 200&amp;nbsp;runs stipulated under the usual rule of the time, spinners were given few opportunities and made little impact in the big matches. Bradman and his fellow tour selectors&amp;mdash;vice-captain [[Lindsay Hassett]] and [[Arthur Morris]]&amp;mdash;picked a pace-dominated attack to exploit the more frequently shiny ball, as a new ball [[swing bowling|swings]] and [[seam bowling|seams]] more for fast bowlers, while slower bowlers can impart more spin with a worn ball.&lt;ref&gt;Perry (2005), p. 223.&lt;/ref&gt; In its summary of the tour, ''[[Wisden]]'' said that Ring &quot;was never a trump card in the pack&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title = [[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack]] | edition = 1949 | publisher = [[Wisden]] | chapter = Australians in England | page = 207 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such was the strength of the bowling that Ring's 60&amp;nbsp;first-class wickets at an average of 21.81 made him the most expensive of the regular bowlers on the tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title = [[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack]] | edition = 1949 | publisher = [[Wisden]] | chapter = Australians in England | page = 214 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the seven frontline bowlers, Ring’s [[Strike rate#Bowling strike rate|strike rate]] of 54.26 was the second least incisive and his [[economy rate]] of 40.20 was the second most expensive. Although McCool was less economical, he had the second highest strike rate, and while Toshack had the worst strike rate, he was the second most economical of the Australians in the first-class fixtures.&lt;ref name=fc&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://stats.cricinfo.com/ci/engine/records/averages/batting_bowling.html?class=4;id=1070;type=tour |publisher=[[Cricinfo]] |title=Batting and bowling averages Australia tour of England, Apr-Sep 1948 - First-class matches|accessdate=2008-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ring did most of his work in the non-Test first-class matches, in which he sent down 3,088&amp;nbsp;deliveries. This was second only to Johnston, who bowled 3,251. In contrast, Lindwall and Miller sent down only 2,105 and 1,749&amp;nbsp;deliveries outside the Tests respectively, as Bradman sought to preserve them for hostile bursts with the new ball against England.&lt;ref name=fc/&gt;&lt;ref name=aus&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://stats.cricinfo.com/ci/engine/records/averages/batting_bowling_by_team.html?id=83;team=2;type=series |publisher=[[Cricinfo]] |title=Batting and bowling averages The Ashes, 1948 - Australia |accessdate=2008-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with Lindwall, Ring was the equal third highest wicket-taker in first-class matches excluding the Tests, with 59 scalps, doing a large part of the work in the county matches so that the leading bowlers could conserve energy for the Tests.&lt;ref&gt;Perry (2005), pp. 223&amp;ndash;227.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ring had limited opportunities with the bat. Along with Toshack and Johnston, he invariably batted in the bottom three positions.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#00f&quot;&gt;N-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;{{Ref label|bat|2|a}} This was because Australia's other frontline bowlers tended to be capable with the bat; Lindwall, Miller, and McCool all made Test centuries and more than nine triple-figure first-class scores, with the latter pair averaging over 30 in Tests. Johnson passed fifty on 21&amp;nbsp;occasions in his first-class career, six of them in Tests.&lt;ref&gt;Cashman, pp. 152, 175, 199, 258.&lt;/ref&gt; The strength of the batting side meant that Ring batted only 14&amp;nbsp;times in his 19&amp;nbsp;first-class matches on the tour, as Australia often batted only once and won by an innings, and several times declared  their first innings closed before Ring could bat.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;&lt;ref name=fc/&gt;&lt;ref name=sched/&gt; Ring scored 150&amp;nbsp;runs at 16.66, an aggregate and average better than only Toshack's. He passed 50 only once, and his tour batting average was lower than his career benchmark of 23.25.&lt;ref&gt;Cashman, p. 258.&lt;/ref&gt; Ring also took 12&amp;nbsp;catches.&lt;ref name=fc/&gt;

Ring and fellow fringe members of the squad McCool and [[Ron Hamence]], would refer themselves as the &quot;ground-staff&quot;, as it was unlikely that the tour selectors would include them in the Test team during the tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title = Doug Ring | url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1434027/Doug-Ring.html| publisher = ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''| date = 2003-06-25| accessdate = 2008-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald Bradman]] referred to these players as the &quot;Groundbowlers&quot; in an appreciation of McCool for the 1959 testimonial year granted by Somerset.{{Cite book| title = Somerset County Cricket Club Year Book | edition = 1958-59 | publisher = [[Somerset County Cricket Club]] | chapter = Colin McCool's Testimonial Year-1959: An Appreciation by Sir Donald Bradman | page = 95 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The trio were known to sing ironic songs about the paucity of their on-field duties during the tour.&lt;ref&gt;Fingleton, p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt;
