Emery was chosen 99th overall by the Senators in the [[2001 NHL Entry Draft|2001 NHL entry draft]]. During the [[2006–07 NHL season|2006–07 season]], Emery signed a three-year deal with the Senators worth $9.5 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;new deal&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.tsn.ca/nhl/news_story/?ID=214453&amp;hubname= |title = Sens avoid arbitration with Emery | publisher=[[The Sports Network|TSN]]|author=Darren Dreger|date=2007-07-24|accessdate=2007-07-24 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070929122848/http://www.tsn.ca/nhl/news_story/?ID=214453&amp;hubname= |archivedate = 2007-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on June 20, 2008, the Ottawa Senators waived Emery, and then bought out his contract after a string of off-ice incidents caused the organization to sour on him.&lt;ref name=&quot;buyout&quot;/&gt; On July 9, 2008, it was announced that Emery had signed a one-year, $2M contract with [[HC Atlant Moscow Oblast|Atlant Mytishchi]] of the Russian KHL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tsn.ca/story/?id=242925 |title=Emery signs one-year deal with Russian team |publisher=TSN.ca |date=2008-07-09 |accessdate=2008-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July, Emery began the grueling and tedious workout and rehabilitation process.

On February 7, 2011, Emery signed a one year, [[two-way contract]] with the [[Anaheim Ducks]] and led the Ducks into the playoffs, finishing tied for fourth in the league and posting a 7–2–0 record with 2.28 goals-against average (GAA) and .926 save percentage (SV%) in 10 regular season NHL appearances.&lt;ref name=&quot;ducks.nhl.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ducks.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=561039&amp;navid=DL|ANA|home |title=Emery Named Finalist for Masterton Trophy – Anaheim Ducks – News |publisher=Ducks.nhl.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=561031 |title=Emery, Langkow, Laperriere up for Masterton – 2011 NHL Awards |publisher=Nhl.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Emery was born the eldest of three brothers, Andrew and Nicholas, to Charlene and Paul Emery.&lt;ref name=&quot;citizen&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;citizen2&quot;/&gt; He grew up on a century-old farmhouse in [[Cayuga, Ontario]], where he attended high school and excelled in sports. He played many sports other than hockey, including golf, baseball, and soccer.&lt;ref name=&quot;citizen2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canada.com/ottawacitizen/news/sports/story.html?id=3e2399c6-4fc2-4640-81e7-b74d783c1345&amp;k=94659|title=A fighter's chance|publisher=[[Ottawa Citizen]]|accessdate=2008-01-24|date=2008-01-20|author=Andrew Duffy}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ice hockey, he originally played [[Defenceman|defence]], but switched to goaltender at nine years old due to a shortage of goaltenders in his league.&lt;ref name=&quot;citizen&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;citizen2&quot;/&gt; He was very competitive and was &quot;his own worst critic&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;citizen&quot;/&gt;  For some time before turning to professional hockey, Emery had an ambition to become an [[architect]].&lt;ref name=&quot;citizen&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;citizen2&quot;/&gt;

==Playing career==
===Pre-NHL===
Emery decided to commit to hockey on the advice of his mother,&lt;ref name=&quot;citizen2&quot;/&gt; and tried out unsuccessfully for eight different junior teams. He started his junior hockey career in 1998 in Junior C with the Dunnville Terriers of the OJHL.&lt;ref name=&quot;legends&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/SearchPlayer.jsp?player=20275 |title=Ray Emery | publisher=[http://www.legendsofhockey.net Legendsofhockey.net] | accessdate=2007-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite winning three games out of 22 played, Emery was named Rookie of the Year.&lt;ref name=&quot;citizen&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.canada.com/ottawacitizen/story.html?id=b44dfd3b-686d-47b4-9c7d-9e6d6ea970f9&amp;k=33072&amp;p=3 | title=The Apprenticeship of Ray Emery | publisher=[[Ottawa Citizen]]|author=Ken Warren|date=2005-12-11 | accessdate=2007-06-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Emery was drafted by [[Ontario Hockey League|OHL's]] [[Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds]] in the 5th round of the 1999 OHL draft.&lt;ref name=&quot;citizen&quot;/&gt; Emery split the 1999–2000 season between the Welland Cougars of the OHA and the Greyhounds in the OHL.&lt;ref name=&quot;legends&quot;/&gt; In 2000–2001 with the Greyhounds, Emery was involved in four on-ice fights. In 2001, Emery was drafted by the Ottawa Senators and subsequently enjoyed his most successful OHL season in 2001–2002.&lt;ref name=&quot;citizen&quot;/&gt; 

In 2002–2003, Emery joined the [[Binghamton Senators]] of the [[American Hockey League|AHL]] for his first professional season. He won 27 of 50 games and was named to the AHL's All-Rookie team. Emery was suspended twice for on-ice incidents the same season, and such behavior continued into the 2003–2004 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.theahl.com/news/league/index.html?article_id=7466 | title=League News | publisher=[[American Hockey League|AHL]]|date=2007-02-19 | accessdate=2007-06-26 | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070914123405/http://www.theahl.com/news/league/index.html?article_id=7466| archivedate = September 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was suspended for three games for bumping a referee,&lt;ref name=&quot;citizen&quot;/&gt; and he was involved in an altercation with [[Denis Hamel]] of the [[Rochester Americans]], when Hamel admittedly uttered a racial slur. Emery retaliated and was suspended for three games.&lt;ref name=&quot;citizen&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;citizen2&quot;/&gt; Emery and Hamel later became teammates in Binghamton, and Hamel apologized for &quot;for not thinking about what I was saying, in the heat of a game&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;citizen&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.canada.com/ottawacitizen/story.html?id=b44dfd3b-686d-47b4-9c7d-9e6d6ea970f9&amp;k=33072&amp;p=4 | title=The Apprenticeship of Ray Emery | publisher=[[Ottawa Citizen]]|author=Ken Warren|date=2005-12-11 | accessdate=2007-06-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2004–05 season would be his last in the AHL; coincidentally, that season was wiped out in the NHL due to a lockout.

===Ottawa Senators (2005–2008)===
[[Image:Ray Emery 2007.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Emery in goal against the [[New Jersey Devils]] in the [[2007 Stanley Cup Playoffs|2007 playoffs]]]]
Emery began his [[National Hockey League|NHL]] career, in the [[2005–06 NHL season|2005–06 season]], by setting a record for wins to start a career. Emery won his first nine games, moving ahead of [[Bob Froese]], who started the [[1982–83 NHL season|1982–83 season]] with eight wins while playing for the [[Philadelphia Flyers]].&lt;ref name=&quot;citizen&quot;/&gt; In March of the same season, Emery won 12 games, tying [[Bernie Parent]]'s 1974 record for the most wins in a month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.tsn.ca/nhl/scores/recap/?id=6328  | title=Game Recap |publisher=[[The Sports Network|TSN]] | accessdate=2007-06-26 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070929120640/http://www.tsn.ca/nhl/scores/recap/?id=6328 |archivedate = 2007-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the 2005–06 season, Emery had won nine straight games during the regular season, as the back-up for [[Dominik Hašek]]. When Hašek injured his groin during the [[2006 Winter Olympics]], Emery became the starting goalie. [[Mike Morrison]] became the backup, after he was picked up off waivers from the [[Edmonton Oilers]]. Emery would be the starting goaltender for the rest of the season, leading the Senators to the second round of the Stanley Cup Playoffs. 

After the 2005–06 season the Senators decided not to bring back Hašek, and they brought in [[Martin Gerber]] to compete with Emery for the starter position. Gerber was the starter at the beginning of the season, but due to his poor play, Emery replaced him in mid-November.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://sportsline.com/nhl/gamecenter/recap/NHL_20070214_FLA@OTT |title=Gerber Collects Shutout in Rare Start for the Senators|publisher=[[CBS]]|date=2007-02-14|accessdate=2007-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Saturday, February 10, 2007, Emery was suspended three games from the NHL for striking [[Montreal Canadiens]] forward [[Maxim Lapierre]] with his stick on his face, after Lapierre crashed into Emery's net.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brawl&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tsn.ca/nhl/news_story/?ID=197431&amp;hubname=  | title=Sens and Sabres renew hostilities |publisher=[[The Sports Network|TSN]]|date=2007-02-24| accessdate=2007-07-09 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071208190458/http://tsn.ca/nhl/news_story/?ID=197431&amp;hubname= |archivedate = 2007-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tsn.ca/nhl/news_story/?ID=195934&amp;hubname |title=Sens' Emery suspended for three games|publisher=[[The Sports Network|TSN]]|date= 2007-02-12|accessdate=2007-07-09 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070929120939/http://www.tsn.ca/nhl/news_story/?ID=195934&amp;hubname |archivedate = 2007-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Twelve days later, after his three-game suspension had ended, Emery was involved in a mêlée between the Senators and the [[Buffalo Sabres]]. He and Sabres goaltender [[Martin Biron]] left their creases to fight each other.&lt;ref name=&quot;fight&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nhl.com/scores/htmlreports/20062007/GS020908.HTM | title=Game Summary | publisher=[[National Hockey League|NHL]]|date=2007-02-22 |accessdate=2007-06-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  After the first fight was finished, Sabres' [[Enforcer (ice hockey)|enforcer]] [[Andrew Peters]] grabbed Emery and a second fight ensued.&lt;ref name=&quot;fight&quot;/&gt;  Both goaltenders received game misconducts, and Emery had the rare feat (for a goaltender) of receiving two five-minute majors for fighting in the same incident. In total, Emery received 22 penalty minutes (two five-minute majors for fighting, a two-minute minor for leaving the crease, and the 10-minute game misconduct) for this altercation.&lt;ref name=&quot;fight&quot;/&gt;  After the altercation, fans and media have dubbed him &quot;Sugar Ray&quot; in reference to retired boxer [[Sugar Ray Robinson]] and Emery's reputation as a fighter.&lt;ref name=&quot;sugar&quot;/&gt;

Prior to the 2007 playoffs, Emery and the Senators won 5–2 against the [[Montreal Canadiens]] on March 30, 2007, which was his 100th NHL game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/Recap.htm?id=2006021159 |title=Senators 5, Canadiens 2 |publisher=[[National Hockey League|NHL]] |date=2007-03-30| accessdate=2007-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emery's strong play in the season continued on in the playoffs, as the Senators defeated the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]], [[New Jersey Devils]] and [[Buffalo Sabres]] each in five games en route to their first Stanley Cup Final appearance since the team returned to the NHL in 1992, where the Senators lost to the Anaheim Ducks in five games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/recap.htm?id=2006030415 | title=Ducks prove to be mightiest of them all | publisher=[[National Hockey League|NHL]] |date=2007-06-07| accessdate=2007-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became a restricted free agent after the end of the season and filed for salary arbitration, but he agreed to a three-year deal with the Senators worth $9.5 million before the hearings were held.&lt;ref name=&quot;new deal&quot;/&gt; 
[[File:Rayemery2.jpg|thumb|Emery playing forr Ottawa, wearing a mask depicting a boxer]]
By the pre-season of the [[2007–08 NHL season|2007–08 campaign]], Emery was injured for a lengthy time, due to a wrist injury which limited him to only 40 minutes of the pre-season and to miss several games early in the [[2007–08 Ottawa Senators season|Senators' season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/2007/09/29/emery_sens_070929|title=Emery to miss opener|author=Ian Mendes|date= 2007-09-29|publisher=Sportsnet}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unspectacular performances by Emery, combined with improved play by Martin Gerber during the first two months of the season, reduced Emery's playing time once he returned. As a result, Gerber was designated as the starting goaltender for the team. In December, Emery was involved in more controversy, as he was sent home by head coach [[John Paddock]] from a practice after claiming that he was feeling ill. It occurred one day after he slammed a stick at another practice expressing his frustration stemming for his reduced playing time this season. Emery later explained that he woke up late and missed the start of that practice. The issue briefly fueled trade rumors. 

On January 28, 2008, Emery showed up late to another practice in [[Long Island]], [[New York (city)|New York]]. Emery said that he mistakenly thought that the session was held at the [[New York Islanders]] arena, the [[Nassau Coliseum]], but it was instead held at the Farmingdale Iceworks. There were also reports that Emery had spent the [[56th National Hockey League All-Star Game|All-Star Weekend]] in [[[[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] but Paddock simply stated that he arrived in [[New York (city)|New York]] from the west.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tsn.ca/nhl/news_story/?ID=228402&amp;hubname=  |title = Sens' Emery late for practice once again|publisher=TSN|accessdate=2007-01-29|date =2008-01-28 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080131155341/http://www.tsn.ca/nhl/news_story/?ID=228402&amp;hubname= |archivedate = 2008-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.canada.com/ottawacitizen/news/sports/story.html?id=d3bc1680-73ee-4ac0-8bb4–71eaa7c3e4d3&amp;k=74748| title = Emery may have pushed Sens too far|author =Ken Warren|publisher=The Ottawa Citizen|accessdate=2008-01-29|date =2008-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; General manager Brian Murray admitted that he had tried to trade Emery, but there were no takers. Due to his recent tardiness, Emery was fined 1/187 of his salary per this year, which was $14,705.88, which was turned into a donation to [[Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario|CHEO]]. In addition, Emery was also involved in separate altercations with [[Brian McGrattan]] and [[Chris Neil]] during practice sessions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.tsn.ca/nhl/news_story/?ID=229340&amp;hubname=  | title = Report: Emery being targeted by police? | publisher = TSN|date=2008-02-10|accessdate=2008-02-10 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080213010206/http://www.tsn.ca/nhl/news_story/?ID=229340&amp;hubname= |archivedate = 2008-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 18, 2008 Murray announced to the media in an end-of-season press conference that Emery would not return to the Senators for the 2008–09 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tsn.ca/nhl/story/?id=234603&amp;lid=headline&amp;lpos=topStory_nhl |title=Murray's plans for Sens don't include Emery |author=TSN.ca staff |publisher=tsn.ca |date=April 18, 2008 |accessdate=2008-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 20, 2008, Emery was waived by the Ottawa Senators, and cleared them three days later; as a result, he became a [[free agent]].&lt;ref name=&quot;buyout&quot;/&gt;

====Mask controversy====
On January 30, 2006, Emery was the target of many critics as a result of a design which was painted on his [[goalie mask]]. Emery, an avid boxing fan, wore a mask with a picture of [[Mike Tyson]] painted on it.&lt;ref name=&quot;CBC Tyson&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/ottawa/story/2006/02/01/ot-tysonmask20060201.html| title=Emery ditches controversial goalie mask | publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] |date=2006-02-01|accessdate=2007-06-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The mask attracted controversy due to Tyson's reputation, notably his past rape conviction. After speaking to the Senators' management, Emery decided to not further wear the mask as they both felt it was inappropriate for hockey.&lt;ref name=&quot;CBC Tyson&quot;/&gt; He wore the Tyson mask for only one game, a 5–0 loss against the [[Boston Bruins]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CBC Tyson&quot;/&gt; During the 2006 NHL playoffs, Emery wore a new mask featuring Canadian heavyweight boxer [[George Chuvalo]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NHL April 22&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.nhl.com/scores/recaps/111_3_recap.html | title=Recap of the Senators 4–1 first round win over the Lightning | publisher=[[National Hockey League|NHL]]|date=2006-04-21 |accessdate=2006-04-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2007–2008 season Emery's mask also featured [[Muhammad Ali]].

Emery signed a one-year, $2 million contract with [[Atlant Moscow Oblast]] of the new [[Kontinental Hockey League]] on July 9, 2008 after he was unsuccessful in obtaining an NHL contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.tsn.ca/nhl/story/?id=242925|title=Emery signs one-year deal with Russian team|author = TSN.ca staff|publisher=tsn.ca|date=2008-07-09|accessdate=2008-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a foreign goaltender, Emery was only allowed to play in 65% of his team's 56 regular season games due to rules that encourage the development of Russian netminders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://slapshot.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/08/08/the-morning-skate-khls-salaries-and-goalies-nhls-future-stars-a-double-shot/ | title=The Morning Skate: K.H.L.’s Salaries and Goalies, N.H.L.’s Future Stars — a Double Shot | publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' | last=Hackel | first=Stu | date=2008-08-08 | accessdate=2008-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://allhockey.ru/articles/33762/ | title=Limits – enemies of the good | publisher=[http://allhockey.ru AllHockey.ru] | last=Safonov | first=Eugene | date=2008-07-24 | accessdate=2008-07-29 | language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; He split duties for the season with former [[Colorado Avalanche]] goaltender [[Vitaly Kolesnik]].

In February 2009, footage surfaced of Emery in a physical altercation with his team's trainer during a KHL game, after Emery had just been pulled after allowing three goals in the first period against Yaroslavl. Emery's agent, J.P. Barry, stated that the goalie did not like being &quot;pestered&quot; by the trainer to wear a sponsor's hat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Hockey/News/2009/01/29/8188041-sun.html  | title=Emery swats KHL trainer | publisher=[http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Hockey/] | last=GARRIOCH | first=BRUCE | date=2009-01-29 | accessdate=2009-08-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  After the following mid-season break, Emery failed to report back to the team due to a financial dispute. With the devaluation of the [[Russian ruble]] during the [[global financial crisis of 2008–2009|global financial crisis]], Emery's salary was consequently devalued; he had wrongly assumed that his contracted salary would be price locked at the [[United States dollar|US dollar]] [[forex]] equivalent. Emery eventually returned to the team and finished out the remainder of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=12:35 |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/blog/index?entryID=3892184&amp;name=lebrun_pierre |title=Sunday roundup: Latest on Hawks, Hossa, Emery and Bruins' run – ESPN |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philadelphia Flyers (2009–2010)===
On June 10, 2009, the Philadelphia Flyers announced that they had agreed to terms on a one-year contract worth $1.5 million dollars with Ray Emery.&lt;ref name=&quot;flyers&quot;/&gt; As the jersey number 1 is retired in Philadelphia in honor of [[Bernie Parent]], he wore number 29. No explanation has been given for his choice. For his mask he has chosen real and fictional boxing figures local to Philadelphia. The left side of his mask shows [[Bernard Hopkins]], the right side has [[Joe Frazier]] and the backplate is adorned by [[Sylvester Stallone]] as the character [[Rocky Balboa]] in the pose with the American flag from the theatrical poster of [[Rocky IV]].

After a successful training camp he marked his return to the NHL with a 2–0 shutout victory against the [[Carolina Hurricanes]] in the first game of the season. In his second regular season game with the Flyers, against the New Jersey Devils, he stopped 24 of 26 shots, in a 5–2 victory.

====Avascular necrosis====
On December 8, Emery was placed on injured reserve to have surgery on a torn muscle in his abdomen. Originally expected to miss about six weeks, the prognosis changed when it was discovered that he had [[avascular necrosis]]. In March 2010, Flyers General Manager Paul Holmgren announced&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt; that Emery would be out for remainder of the season due to the diagnosis and that a bone graft would be done to alleviate his hip issues.&lt;ref name=&quot;tsn.ca&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nhl.com&quot;/&gt;

Doctors were able to catch the disease early on before it spread, unlike the case of baseball and American football player [[Bo Jackson]]. As a result, in April, doctors announced an extremely successful surgery. Jackson spoke out about Emery, speculating that they were the only two athletes to come back after the disease. Jackson added, &quot;I take my hat off [to him]. I want him to know I am in his corner. It's a lot of hard work. To come back and play, it takes a very, very special and driven person. He's got a different makeup to want to do all the little things he needs to compete on a professional level.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;vancouversun1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Walker |first=Ian |url=http://www.vancouversun.com/sports/knows+football+baseball+long+odds+Emery+comeback/4199261/story.html |title=Bo knows football, baseball and long odds of Ray Emery's NHL comeback |publisher=Vancouversun.com |date=2011-01-31 |accessdate=2011-02-24}} {{Dead link|date=March 2012|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Jackson, who required numerous hip replacements, Emery had the benefit of advancements in modern medicine, undergoing a very specialized and complex procedure that involved removing 13-centimetres from his right fibula, and then grafting it to the femur to re-introduce a proper blood supply to the area. Holmgren said that while the surgery went better than expected, he did not know exactly how long Emery's recovery would take. 

On July 1, Emery became an unrestricted free agent as his injury deemed him unable to play until he recuperates. In August, he was given the go ahead to begin the grueling and tedious workout and rehabilitation process. In November 2010, TSN visited Emery during an on-ice workout and were surprised to see him get down into the [[butterfly (ice hockey)|butterfly]] position and play for the first time since surgery. Emery stated that he did not &quot;care if [he could] walk in 7 years&quot;, and he &quot;just [wanted] to play.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;watch.tsn.ca&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://watch.tsn.ca/featured/clip376006#clip375632 |title=TSN Video Player |publisher=Watch.tsn.ca |date=2010-02-17 |accessdate=2011-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; To the surprise of his doctors and trainers, Emery has been doing better than expected.&lt;ref name=&quot;watch.tsn.ca&quot;/&gt; In January 2011, Emery began skating with an OHL team, taking shots and training with [[Eric Lindros]],&lt;ref name=&quot;espn.go.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=9:02 |url=http://espn.go.com/blog/nhl/post/_/id/3592/weekend-wrap-teams-going-overseas-cloustons-future-sharks-coaching |title=Weekend wrap: Teams going overseas, Clouston's future, Sharks' coaching – Cross Checks Blog – ESPN |publisher=Espn.go.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; working with personal trainer Matt Nichol and goalie coach Eli Wilson. According to Wilson, Emery was &quot;as sharp and ready now as he was the summer before Ottawa's Stanley Cup final run.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;torontosun.com&quot;/&gt;

In March 2011, Emery's injury and undefeated return to the NHL with the [[Anaheim Ducks]] garnered much media attention and fascination, with a special segment featured on CBC's Hockey Night in Canada. Remarkably, Emery currently has 13-centimetres of bone missing from his leg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/blogs/elliottefriedman/2011/02/emery-faces-tough-road-back-to-nhl.html | work=CBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=February 7, 2011 |url=http://ingoalmag.com/news/ray-emery-signs-in-anaheim-continues-remarkable-comeback/ |title=Ray Emery signs in Anaheim, continues remarkable comeback – The Goalie Magazine |publisher=InGoalMag.com |date=2011-02-07 |accessdate=2011-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; This later garnered him a nomination for the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy.

===Anaheim Ducks (2011)===
On February 7, 2011, Emery signed a one year, [[two-way contract]] with the [[Anaheim Ducks]],&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tsn.ca/nhl/story/?id=352827 |title=Ducks sign Emery to one-year, two-way contract |publisher=Tsn.ca |date=2011-02-07 |accessdate=2011-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; allowing him to the standard two-week conditioning AHL stint.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;/&gt; Three other NHL teams showed interest in signing Emery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/los-angeles/nhl/news/story?id=6101678&amp;campaign=rss&amp;source=NHLHeadlines |title=Ray Emery clears waivers, joins Anaheim Ducks' AHL team in Syracuse – ESPN Los Angeles |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date=2011-02-08 |accessdate=2011-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was then assigned to the [[Syracuse Crunch]] to begin conditioning. Emery played three games for the Crunch, compiling a 2–1–0 record with a 2.62 goals-against-average and .925 save percentage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.syracusecrunch.com/News/Detail/3171 |title=News: 2010–11 Season |publisher=Syracusecrunch.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emery eventually went on to play a total of five games for the Crunch in their 2010–11 season posting a 4–1–0, 1.98 GAA and .943 save percentage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oursportscentral.com/services/releases/?id=4163250 |title=Anaheim Assigns J.P. Levasseur and Recalls Ray Emery from Syracuse – OurSports Central – Independent and Minor League Sports News |publisher=OurSports Central |date= |accessdate=2011-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After playing 3 games with the Syracuse Crunch, on February 23, 2011, Emery was recalled to the Anaheim Ducks of the NHL. It was his first NHL appearance since he last played in March 2010 with the Flyers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ducks.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=553867&amp;navid=DL|ANA|home |title=Ducks Recall Emery from Syracuse – Anaheim Ducks – News |publisher=Ducks.nhl.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emery made his Anaheim Ducks debut on March 11, 2011 against the [[Phoenix Coyotes]] when he replaced goaltender [[Dan Ellis]].

Emery received his first win as an Anaheim Duck in a 2–1 win against the St. Louis Blues.  Emery then went on to six straight starts to open his Anaheim career, falling one shy of matching the Ducks record for consecutive wins by a goaltender, to Guy Hebert.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2011/03/30/ap/sportsline/main20049063.shtml | work=CBS News | title=Emery wins again, Ducks beat Flames 4–2 | date=2011-03-31 | deadurl=yes}} {{Dead link|date=December 2011|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the week of March 14, Emery was honored with NHL's Second Star of the Week after going 2–0–0 with a 0.99 GAA and .968 SV%&lt;ref name=&quot;ducks.nhl.com&quot;/&gt;

Emery led the Ducks into the playoffs, finishing tied for fourth in the league and posting a 7–2–0 record with 2.28 goals-against average (GAA) and .926 save percentage (SV%) in 10 regular season NHL appearances.&lt;ref name=&quot;ducks.nhl.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

In April, Emery's remarkable comeback was recognized when the Anaheim chapter of the Professional Hockey Writers' Association (PHWA) named Ray Emery as their nominee for the 2011 [[Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/hockey/globe-on-hockey/2011-masterton-trophy-nominees/article1977963 | location=Toronto | work=The Globe and Mail | first=James | last=Mirtle | title=2011 Masterton Trophy nominees | date=2011-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NHL nominated Emery for the Masterton making him one of three named as finalists.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

===Chicago Blackhawks (2011–present)===
[[File:Ray Emery 2012-02-18.JPG|thumb|175px|Emery on the bench for the Blackhawks]]
On July 27, 2011, Emery signed a tryout contract with the Chicago Blackhawks. He was signed to a 1-year contract for the [[2011–12 NHL season]] on October 3, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kuc|first=Chris|title=Emery wins Blackhawks' backup goalie job|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/hockey/blackhawks/chi-emery-wins-blackhawks-backup-goalie-job-20111003,0,2295423.story|accessdate=3 October 2011|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=3 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emery made his Blackhawks debut ten days later with a 4&amp;ndash;3 win over the Winnipeg Jets.

==Personal life==
In June 2010, Emery began dating Canadian singer [[Keshia Chante]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://keshiachante.wordpress.com/2010/09/30/happy-birthday-ray/ |title=Happy Birthday Ray! « KeshiaChante.com: Official Website + Blog |publisher=Keshiachante.wordpress.com |date=2010-09-30 |accessdate=2011-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Emery has numerous tattoos, which include the initials of his parents, Charlene and Paul, and younger brothers Andrew and Nicholas.&lt;ref name=&quot;citizen&quot;/&gt; He has an African symbol for the number one (his jersey number with the Senators), and his nickname &quot;Razor&quot; written across his chest. He also has a tattoo representing his birth symbol,  [[Libra (astrology)|Libra]].&lt;ref name=&quot;citizen&quot;/&gt; He has another tattoo on his right arm which reads, &quot;Anger is a Gift.&quot; Emery stating positively of the tattoo, &quot;If you're passionate enough about something, you'll [get mad enough] to do something about it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Earl McRae |url=http://www.ottawasun.com/news/columnists/earl_mcrae/2011/02/23/17384626.html |title=Emery on road to redemption |publisher=Ottawa Sun |date=2011-02-17 |accessdate=2011-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Emery remains close to good friends and Ottawa Senator teammates, [[Jason Spezza]], whom he was a groomsman at his wedding and [[Brian McGrattan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;citizen&quot;/&gt;
