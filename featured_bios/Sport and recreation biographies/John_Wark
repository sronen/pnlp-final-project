'''John Wark''' (born 4 August 1957) is a [[Scotland|Scottish]] former [[football (soccer)|footballer]] who spent most of his playing time with [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]].  He won a record four [[List of Ipswich Town F.C. Players of the Year|Player of the Year]] awards before becoming one of the four inaugural members of the club's [[Ipswich Town F.C. Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]]. Wark had long spells at the club, which bookended his career, and a third, brief interlude dividing his briefer periods at [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]]. A versatile player, Wark played most of his professional games as a [[midfield]]er, although he sometimes played as a [[central defender]] and on occasion as a [[forward (football)|striker]].

Born in [[Glasgow]], Wark represented [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] in international football, winning 29 caps and scoring seven goals. This included selection for Scotland in the [[1982 FIFA World Cup]] in which he made three appearances and scored twice.

During his playing career, Wark appeared in the film ''[[Escape to Victory]]''. Since retiring as a professional player in 1996, he has continued to work for Ipswich Town—since April 2009 in the corporate hospitality department. His autobiography, ''Wark On'', was published in 2009.

== Early life ==
Wark was born on 4 August 1957, in [[Glasgow Royal Maternity Hospital]] to parents Alex and Helen. The third of four children, he has an older sister Wilma, older brother [[Alex Wark|Alex]] and younger brother Andrew.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Wark | chapter = I belong to Glasgow|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The family lived in a four-storey [[Apartment building#Scotland|tenement block]] in [[Partick]]. The family was impoverished: Wark's parents could not afford a cot and as a small child, he slept in a drawer from a sideboard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Wark | page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although [[Infant baptism|christened]] John, Wark was soon referred to by his family as Johnny, a [[Hypocorism#Diminutive|diminutive]] which stuck throughout his footballing career.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Wark | page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1960s, the family moved to another tenement block, this time in [[Scotstoun]], and Wark's father secured employment at nearby [[Albion Motors]]. The new home accommodated a back yard in which Wark played football from the age of six.  He said &quot;[f]ootball seemed to occupy 99 per cent of my time as a youngster&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Wark | pages=22–24}}&lt;/ref&gt; as he tried to emulate his brother Alex, who had become a professional at [[St. Mirren F.C.|St. Mirren]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Wark | chapter= On trial | page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wark attended [[Scotstoun Primary School]], where he became captain of the football team. On moving to secondary school, he was selected for the Glasgow Schools representative team.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Wark | page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also played for [[Drumchapel Amateur F.C.|Drumchapel Amateurs]] at the under-14 level, where he was, for a period, managed by [[David Moyes]]' father, also named David.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Wark | pages=29–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During Wark's time at Drumchapel, he attracted the attention of [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]]. He trained with the club at their [[Celtic Park|Parkhead]] ground, before receiving an invitation to sign schoolboy forms for the club. As a lifelong [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] fan (with whom Celtic have a notable rivalry)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/5289202.stm | title = A rivalry tied up in religion| publisher = BBC News| accessdate = 2009-05-15| date = 2006-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and with interest from &quot;several English clubs&quot;, including [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]], [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] and [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]], Wark stalled on the offer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Wark | pages=30–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; He trialled with both Ipswich Town and Manchester City, and selected Ipswich when the latter remained non-committal. On arrival at [[Portman Road]], Town manager [[Bobby Robson]], later described by Wark as the person in football &quot;who had the single biggest influence on [him]&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Wark | page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; personally welcomed him and Wark signed with the club as an apprentice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Wark | page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Domestic playing career ==
=== First spell at Ipswich ===
[[File:Bobby Robson Cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Bobby Robson—a reassuring first manager]]
Wark started his career at Ipswich in the youth team, initially playing at [[left back]] before moving to the centre of defence and occasionally occupying the [[right back]] position.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Wark | pages=33–37}}&lt;/ref&gt; He signed up as a professional for the club on his 17th birthday.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Wark|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Selected for the senior squad as a replacement for the injured [[Kevin Beattie]], Wark made his first-team debut on 27 March 1975 in the 3–2 [[FA Cup]] 6th round (3rd replay) victory over [[Leeds United A.F.C.|Leeds United]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20050228073157/http://www.soccerbase.com/results2.sd?teamid=1372&amp;seasonid=104|archivedate= 2005-02-28| url = http://www.soccerbase.com/results2.sd?teamid=1372&amp;seasonid=104 | publisher = Soccerbase| title = Ipswich 1974/1975 results and fixtures|accessdate=2009-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|Ipswich and Leeds United had already featured in three draws in the sixth round of the [[1974–75 FA Cup]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;My debut was in the quarter-final of the FA Cup against the Leeds team of [[Johnny Giles|Giles]] and [[Billy Bremner|Bremner]]. He [Robson] said, 'I wouldn't put you in the team if I didn't think you were good enough'. He was a father figure as well because I was homesick. If it hadn't been for the boss I would have been straight back to Glasgow.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/england/2325875/Tributes-to-Sir-Bobby-Robson.html| title = Tributes to Sir Bobby Robson| accessdate = 2010-10-18 | work = Daily Telegraph | date = 2007-11-16 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Making four more first-team appearances in place of injured regulars, Wark ended the season still on the youth team, and experienced success in the final of the [[FA Youth Cup]], defeating [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] 5–1.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|pages=43–44|last=Wark}}&lt;/ref&gt; He spent much of the 1975–76 season playing for the reserves, and was presented with the club's Young Player of the Year award, despite making just four appearances for the senior team.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | pages=45–46|last=Wark}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moving into [[midfield]], Wark made over 30 appearances in the 1976–77 season, scoring his first goals for the club, (10, in all)&lt;ref name=stats/&gt; taking over [[penalty kick]]ing duty; he also received his first [[Red card (sports)|red card]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | pages=47–49|last=Wark}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the June 1977, Wark was selected for [[Scotland national football team|the Scotland squad]] for the first time, for a friendly match against [[East Germany national football team|East Germany]];&lt;ref name=tocap/&gt; however, a torn hamstring sustained in [[Preseason|pre-season training]] ended any chance of an international debut.&lt;ref name=tocap/&gt; The injury also kept him out of first-team football until January 1978, when he returned for a match against [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] in the third round of the [[1977&amp;ndash;78 FA Cup|1977–78 FA Cup]].&lt;ref name=tocap&gt;{{Cite book | pages=51–52|last=Wark|chapter=To cap it all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indifferent league performances that season meant that Ipswich finished just three points above the [[Promotion and relegation|relegation zone]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.statto.com/football/teams/ipswich-town/1977-1978| title = Ipswich Town 1977&amp;ndash;1978 : Home| accessdate = 2012-03-20|publisher = statto.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the season ended in [[1977&amp;ndash;78 FA Cup|success in the FA Cup]]. Wark scored in a 3–1 victory over [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] in the semi-final,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/suffolk/content/articles/2008/02/19/itfc_1978_in_video_feature.shtml| title = Ipswich's 1978 FA Cup story in video| publisher = BBC Suffolk | accessdate=2009-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and appeared in the [[1978 FA Cup Final|final]] at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]] as part of a side that surprised favourites [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/football-league/richards-closes-the-door-on-ipswich-742886.html|title = Richards closes the door on Ipswich| work=The Independent|accessdate=2009-06-10|date=1999-12-14|first=Conrad|last=Leach | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; winning the game 1–0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/fa_cup/1321993.stm | title = 1978 – Osbourne's year | publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=2009-05-15|date=2000-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wark remarked, &quot;We were underdogs but on the day we hammered them.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-fa-cup-arsenal-fearful-of-a-bakers-dozen-henry-winter-looks-forward-to-the-fa-cup-quarterfinals-1496010.html | work = The Independent | accessdate = 2009-04-28 | date = 1993-03-06 | title = Football: FA Cup: Arsenal fearful of a Baker's dozen: Henry Winter looks forward to the FA Cup quarter-finals | first = Henry|last= Winter | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wark did not touch the ball for the first 18 minutes of the match,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Wark|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as the players left the pitch at half-time, [[David Geddis]] said to Wark, &quot;Make sure you hit it between the [[goalpost|posts]] in the second-half.

Twice in the three seasons that followed, Ipswich came within one game of winning the [[Football League First Division|League championship]], but finished as runners-up to Liverpool and [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]], respectively. However, Ipswich did win the club's only [[UEFA|European trophy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.itfc.co.uk/page/ClubHistory/0,,10272~347323,00.html| title = Club honours| publisher = Ipswich Town F.C. | accessdate = 2009-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; when they lifted the [[1980&amp;ndash;81 UEFA Cup]]. Wark set a competition record by scoring 14 goals—including two, one in each leg—in the [[1981 UEFA Cup Final|final]] as Ipswich overcame [[Netherlands|Dutch]] side [[AZ Alkmaar|AZ 67 Alkmaar]] 5–4 on [[Aggregate score|aggregate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://uk.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/history/season=1980/index.html | title = 1980/81: Ipswich thankful for Thijssen| publisher = Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) | accessdate=2012-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wark's record equalled the long-standing  scoring record in a European competition, set by [[José Altafini]] of [[A.C.

Wark continued to play for Ipswich, but after Robson left to become [[England national football team manager|England manager]] in 1982, the side was gradually broken up by new manager [[Bobby Ferguson (footballer born 1938)|Bobby Ferguson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Wark|page=81|chapter=Goodbye Robson, Hello Wark}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following a rejected demand for a wage increase, Wark submitted a [[transfer request]], which was accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last=Wark|pages=80–84}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He signed for [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] for £450,000 on 10 March 1984, seen as one of three replacements for [[Graeme Souness]], who was leaving to play for [[U.C.

Wark's final full season at [[Portman Road]], [[1982&amp;ndash;83 in English football|1982–83]], had seen him record the highest league goals tally of his career. He scored 20 goals in 42 league games, though it was not enough to prevent Ipswich from slipping to ninth place in the final table – their lowest position since finishing 18th in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.statto.com/football/teams/ipswich-town/history/modern | publisher = statto.com | accessdate = 2012-03-19 | title = Ipswich Town : History 1975 to date}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Liverpool ===
The [[Transfer (football)#Medical examination|medical examination]] for Wark's transfer somewhat surprised him:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;I was rather taken aback when the doctor entered the Anfield [[The Boot Room|boot room]]&quot;, Wark said. &quot;He was small in stature and I could not help but detect the smell of [[alcohol]] on his breath as he introduced himself to me. I was even more surprised when he announced we would stay put to conduct the medical examination. &quot;He took my [[blood pressure]], looked at the reading and muttered 'that's fine'. Then something happened that to this day I still cannot get over. He asked me to bend down and touch my toes. &quot;Trying not to show my surprise, I did exactly as he asked and as I lifted my head he spoke again, this time to announce 'you've passed'. That was it, my Liverpool medical.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;medical&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/liverpool-fc/liverpool-fc-news/2009/04/16/john-wark-s-big-fear-i-may-not-get-a-game-for-liverpool-100252-23401159/|title=John Wark's big fear – I may not get a game for Liverpool p.1|work=Liverpool Echo| accessdate =2009-04-21|date=2009-04-16|first=James |last=Pearce}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wark made his debut for the club on 31 March 1984 in a 2–0 league win against [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] at [[Vicarage Road]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.statto.com/football/teams/liverpool/1983-1984/results |publisher = statto.com| accessdate = 2012-03-20|title = Liverpool 1983&amp;ndash;1984 : Results}}&lt;/ref&gt; and scored Liverpool's opening goal in the 58th minute.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Wark|page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; Liverpool won the English league title [[1983–84 in English football|that season]], and Wark made sufficient appearances to earn himself a medal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Wark|page=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; His unusual ability as a goalscoring midfielder was on display when he finished the [[1984&amp;ndash;85 in English football|1984–85 season]] as the club's top goalscorer, ahead of prolific striker [[Ian Rush]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.bobpaisley.com/Webs/bobpaisley/default.aspx?aid=76 | title = Paisley's opinion on John Wark| publisher=bobpaisley.com| accessdate=2009-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a tally of 27 goals in 62 appearances—a goal every 2.3 games.&lt;ref name=stats/&gt;  Wark's season included three [[hat-trick]]s, one each in the League, the FA Cup and the European Cup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.lfchistory.net/stats_hattricks.asp | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080629101606/http://www.lfchistory.net/stats_hattricks.asp | archivedate = 2008-06-29| title = All hat-tricks in official matches since 1892 | publisher=lfchistory.net|accessdate=2009-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Liverpool qualified for the [[1985 European Cup Final]] but the match was overshadowed by the [[Heysel Stadium Disaster]], a tragedy Wark remembers as &quot;a nightmare memory&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Wark|page=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the [[1985–86 in English football|1985–86]] season, Wark made 18 appearances, scoring six times,&lt;ref name=stats/&gt; but missed out on the club's run-in to their League and FA Cup &quot;[[Double (association football)#England|double]]&quot;, due to a broken ankle suffered just after the turn of 1986, followed by an [[Achilles tendon]] injury.&lt;ref name=p103&gt;{{Cite book|last=Wark|page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He eventually regained his fitness but struggled to regain his place in the Liverpool team until injury to [[Steve McMahon]] allowed him back in.&lt;ref name=p103/&gt;  Wark came on as a late substitute (but according to him, never touched the ball)&lt;ref name=p104&gt;{{Cite book|last=Wark|page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt; when Liverpool lost the [[1987 Football League Cup Final|1987 League Cup Final]] to Arsenal.

Following three seasons of mid-table finishes,{{#tag:ref|Including the season before Wark's return to Ipswich.|group=&quot;nb&quot;}} manager [[John Duncan (footballer)|John Duncan]] was sacked and replaced by [[John Lyall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.itfc.co.uk/page/ClubHistory/0,,10272~342496,00.html |title = Club history | publisher = Ipswich Town F.C. | accessdate = 2009-05-28|date=2009-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; With his contract expiring, Wark received what he considered to be a &quot;derisory&quot;&lt;ref name=p123/&gt; offer from Lyall, which he declined. Once he became a [[free agent]], Wark signed on a [[free transfer (football)|free transfer]] for Second Division rivals [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] in August 1990.&lt;ref name=p123&gt;{{Cite book | last = Wark | page=123}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his two additional seasons with Ipswich, Wark had scored 20 goals,&lt;ref name=stats/&gt; and won the club's [[List of Ipswich Town F.C.

=== Middlesbrough ===
Wark signed for Middlesbrough, the first club to show &quot;a definite interest&quot; in him, on a two-year contract, moving back to play in the centre of defence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Wark|page=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He made regular appearances and helped the team to seventh place by the end of the [[1990–91 in English football|season]] and qualification for the [[Football League One play-offs|Second Division play-offs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.statto.com/football/teams/middlesbrough/1990-1991/table |publisher = statto.com| accessdate=2012-03-20|title = Middlesbrough 1990&amp;ndash;1991 : English Division Two (old) Table}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Following a 1–1 draw with [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]] at [[Ayresome Park]], Wark was informed by manager [[Colin Todd]] that he would not be selected for the second leg.  Wark was outraged; Middlesbrough lost the second leg 1–0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.statto.com/football/teams/middlesbrough/1990-1991/results| title = Middlesbrough 1990&amp;ndash;1991 : Results| accessdate = 2012-03-20|publisher=statto.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Todd departed from the club and was replaced by [[Lennie Lawrence]], who insisted that all players live &quot;within an hour of Ayresome Park&quot;.  Wark was still living in Ipswich at the time and following a &quot;sensible agreement&quot; with Lawrence, Wark's contract was terminated and he became a free agent again.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Wark|page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Third spell at Ipswich ===
Remaining without a club before the start of the [[1991–92 in English football|1991–92 season]], Wark trained with Ipswich to keep fit, and rejected interest in his services from [[Leyton Orient F.C.|Leyton Orient]], [[Colchester United F.C.|Colchester United]] and [[Falkirk F.C.|Falkirk]].&lt;ref name=p126&gt;{{Cite book | last=Wark|pages=126–127|chapter=Renaissance man}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Ipswich suffered a succession of injuries among their defenders, they offered him a contract, initially on a week-by-week basis, before securing a year-long deal.&lt;ref name=p126/&gt;  Wark made 43 appearances in the first season of his third spell with the club.&lt;ref name=stats/&gt; Early results in the season were excellent; the club won seven of their first 11 matches in the league.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.soccerbase.com/results2.sd?teamid=1372&amp;seasonid=121 | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20050506093438/http://www.soccerbase.com/results2.sd?teamid=1372&amp;seasonid=121 | archivedate=2005-05-06| title = Ipswich 1991/1992 results and fixtures|publisher=Soccerbase|accessdate=2009-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the FA Cup, Ipswich progressed to a fifth round encounter against Liverpool; when the tie went to a replay at [[Anfield]], Wark received a standing ovation from both sets of fans.&lt;ref name=p128to129&gt;{{Cite book | last=Wark|pages=128–129}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ipswich lost the match, and their league form subsided somewhat thereafter, but they were still crowned Second Division champions and were promoted into the newly formed [[Premier League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/football_league/article6157523.ece| title = Hopes that glory years will return to Ipswich | work = The Times | first = Tom |last=Dart| accessdate = 2009-04-28|date = 2009-04-24 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Wark ended the season as the club's Player of the Year for the third time.&lt;ref name=poty/&gt;

Wark agreed to a new one-year contract for the [[1992–93 in English football|1992–93 season]] and was asked to feature in a [[Sky Sports]] advertisement to promote the inaugural Premier League competition.&lt;ref name=ref name=p128to129/&gt; Ipswich were the only Premier League club to remain unbeaten after eight games (a sequence that included Wark's first Premier League goal in a 1–1 draw with [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.statto.com/football/teams/ipswich-town/1992-1993/results| title = Ipswich Town 1992&amp;ndash;1993 : Results|publisher = statto.com| accessdate=2012-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ipswich went fourth in February and there was talk of finally winning that title that had eluded them more than once during Wark's first spell there, but 13 consecutive games without a win resulted a 16th place finish in the table, just three points above the relegation zone, and only a win on the final day of the season made sure of their survival.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last=Wark|page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = Ipswich Town 1992&amp;ndash;1993 : English Premier League Table |title = Final 1992/1993 English Premier Table| accessdate = 2012-03-20| publisher = statto.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wark, now aged 37, secured yet another one-year contract shortly before the end of the [[1993–94 in English football|1993–94 season]]. Ipswich were saved from relegation in the last round of matches (for the second season running, another good start had given way to a late season slump), courtesy of an [[injury time]] winning goal scored by [[Mark Stein (footballer)|Mark Stein]] of [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] at [[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge]], which ensured that Ipswich's fellow strugglers [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] went down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football--premiership-relegation-focus-blades-lose-the-final-battle-trevor-haylett-reports-on-sheffield-uniteds-32-defeat-at-chelsea-which-ensured-their-relegation-1434761.html | title = Football / Premiership Relegation Focus: Blades lose the final battle: Trevor Haylett reports on Sheffield United's 3–2 defeat at Chelsea which ensured their relegation|last=Haylett|first=Trevor|accessdate=2009-06-05|work=The Independent| date=1994-05-09 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Wark went on to be voted the club's Player of the Year for a record fourth time.&lt;ref name=&quot;poty&quot;/&gt;

Ipswich and Wark fared worse in the [[1994–95 in English football|1994–95 season]].  The club lost 9–0 to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] during a season in which Ipswich &quot;recorded fewer victories and suffered more defeats than in any campaign in the club's history&quot;.  He was sent off in the away game at Norwich, where the team lost 3–0.&lt;ref name=p136&gt;{{Cite book | last=Wark | page=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Wark made fewer than 20 appearances in the following season, primarily because of a persistent foot injury.&lt;ref name=p136/&gt; Despite his appearance in three more matches in the [[1996–97 in English football|1996–97 season]], and a [[Testimonial match|testimonial]] against [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] at Portman Road, Wark played his last professional match against [[Tranmere Rovers F.C.|Tranmere Rovers]] on 30 November 1996 at the age of 39. By this stage, he was the club's oldest player.&lt;ref name=p136/&gt;  Of a total 826 league matches played by Wark as a professional, he made 679 appearances for Ipswich.&lt;ref name=stats/&gt; {{As of|2009|6|5}}, he is Ipswich Town's third-highest all-time scorer, with 179 goals scored for the club, despite rarely appearing as a striker.&lt;ref name=stats/&gt;

== International playing career ==
From 1979, Wark was selected to play for his country, usually as a defender,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Wark|chapter=Scotland the Brave|page=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; eventually winning 29 caps for [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] and scoring seven goals.&lt;ref name=stats/&gt; [[Jock Stein]] was the Scotland manager who gave him his debut, in a game held on 19 May 1979, a [[1979 British Home Championship|British Home Championship]] match against [[Wales national football team|Wales]] at [[Ninian Park]]; Scotland lost 3–0.&lt;ref name=&quot;PFA&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.givemefootball.com/pfa-centenary/pfa-centenary-auction---more-tributes-to-the-stars|title=PFA Centenary Auction – more tributes to the stars featured in this unique collection|last=Nannestad|first=Ian|date=2007-11-14|publisher=Professional Footballers' Association|accessdate=2009-04-25}} {{Dead link|date=March 2012|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scottishfa.co.uk/international_fixture_details.cfm?page=463&amp;matchID=57471|title=Jock Stein: Wales 3–0 Scotland|publisher=Scottish Football Association|accessdate=2009-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wark scored his first international goal a week later on 26 May, again in a British Home Championship game, this time against [[England national football team|England]] at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]]. Wark's opening effort was not enough, as Scotland were defeated 3–1.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Wark|chapter=International football|page=172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a 3–1 home defeat by [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] in December 1979, Wark was not selected again for his country until February 1981 for the [[1982 FIFA World Cup|1982 World Cup]] qualifying match away against [[Israel national football team|Israel]].&lt;ref name=stats/&gt; Following a successful qualification campaign,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.scottishfa.co.uk/scottish_football.cfm?page=133 | title=World Cup History | accessdate = 2009-06-01|publisher = Scottish Football Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wark was included in the Scotland squad that went to the World Cup in Spain under Stein's leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/archive/edition=59/teams/team=43967.html|title=1982 FIFA World Cup Teams: Scotland|publisher=Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA)|accessdate=2009-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wark played three games and scored two goals,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/statisticsandrecords/players/player=59816/index.html|title=FIFA Player Statistics: John Wark|publisher=Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA)|accessdate=2009-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; both of which were in a single match against [[New Zealand national football team|New Zealand]], a game Scotland won 5–2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/archive/edition=59/results/matches/match=1051/report.html|title=1982 FIFA World Cup Spain: Scotland – New Zealand|publisher=Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA)|accessdate=2009-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scotland were knocked out in the group stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/archive/edition=59/results/index.html | publisher = Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) | accessdate = 2009-04-29 | title = 1982 FIFA World Cup Spain}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wark's final appearance for Scotland came in September 1984, under Stein;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.scottishfa.co.uk/international_fixture_details.cfm?page=463&amp;matchID=57685| title = Scotland v Yugoslavia|publisher = Scottish Football Association| accessdate=2009-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  he was replaced in favour of [[Paul McStay]] at half-time in a 6–1 victory over [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]].&lt;ref name=stats/&gt;

=== Personal life ===
Wark has married twice—first to Toula, on 1 July 1981,&lt;ref name=&quot;Wark 159&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Wark|page=159}}&lt;/ref&gt; with whom he has a son, Andrew, born in June 1983.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wark 159&quot;/&gt; He married Karen at [[Gretna Green]] in April 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1172949/Where-Sportsmail-tracks-Ipswichs-UEFA-Cup-heroes.html | work = Daily Mail | accessdate = 2009-05-15 | title = Where are they now?

=== Film appearance ===

In 1981, Wark was one of several Ipswich players who appeared alongside stars including [[Bobby Moore]] and [[Pelé]] in the [[World War II|Second World War]] football film ''[[Escape to Victory]]'', which starred [[Sylvester Stallone]], [[Michael Caine]] and [[Max von Sydow]].&lt;ref name=&quot;escape&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/scotland/article6005964.ece| title = Terry Butcher calls for Scott Brown to walk in John Wark's footsteps | date = 2009-03-31| accessdate = 2009-04-30 | work = The Times | first = Phil | last = Gordon | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wark played a character called Arthur Hayes,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Wark|page=157}}&lt;/ref&gt; but his only line had to be dubbed due to his broad Glaswegian accent.&lt;ref name=escape/&gt;

=== Since retirement as a player ===
Following his retirement from playing football professionally, Wark continued to live in Suffolk, like many other ex-Ipswich players, including [[Allan Hunter (footballer)|Allan Hunter]], [[Mick Mills]], [[Roger Osborne]] and [[Mick Lambert]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Wark|page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite his retirement from the professional ranks, Wark continued playing football as an amateur, and signed for [[Woodbridge Town F.C.|Woodbridge Town]] in 1999 alongside former Ipswich team-mate [[Paul Mason (footballer)|Paul Mason]].&lt;ref name=&quot;amat&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.oxfordmail.co.uk/archive/1999/02/16/Oxfordshire+Archive/6637151.Wark_and_Mason_to_tackle_Thame/|title = FootballWark and Mason to tackle Thame| work=Oxford Mail|accessdate=2012-03-20|date=1999-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also played veterans football for Windsor and Eton,&lt;ref name=&quot;amat&quot;/&gt; played with [[Soccer AM]]'s ''Badgers'' team at the [[Millennium Stadium]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Wark|page=164}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has represented the Liverpool veterans in the Sky Sports [[Masters Football|Masters]] series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Football: Butcher can give Gers the chop Says John Wark| accessdate = 2009-05-15 | work=Sunday Mirror|date = 2005-03-13 | first = Ewan|last= Smith| url= http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4161/is_20050313/ai_n12944582/}} {{Dead link|date=March 2012|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Wark was voted as the [[BBC]] television programme [[Football Focus]] &quot;all-time cult hero&quot; by Ipswich Town fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/football_focus/4416061.stm | title = Ipswich's cult heroes|publisher = BBC Sport| accessdate = 2009-05-27|date=2005-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--  In March 2007, Wark sold some football memorabilia at auction, including an &quot;Ipswich Town UEFA Cup signed hat-trick ball for £400, and a match-worn swapped [[A.S.

=== Autobiography ===
Wark's autobiography ''Wark On'' was published on 9 April 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.amazon.co.uk/Wark-Autobiography-John/dp/1848185111| title = Wark on: The Autobiography of John Wark (Hardcover)|accessdate = 2009-04-28|publisher = Amazon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book contained material that gained media interest.  Wark stated that he made &quot;a small fortune by [[sales|flogging]] tickets for the FA Cup Final to a [[black market|shady underworld ticket tout]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sun&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/scotsol/homepage/news/article2320610.ece|work=The Scottish Sun | accessdate=2009-05-27|title=Wark: My secret is tout|last=Tait|first=Gordon|date=2009-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Wark used his share of the cash to help pay for his wedding while  a team-mate bankrolled a house extension. He added: &quot;Other teams had done it, so why shouldn’t we?  Nowadays it's illegal but in those days it was regarded as a perk.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sun&quot;/&gt; The report also highlighted Wark's &quot;dig&quot; at the current &quot;crop of stars&quot; at Anfield. He said: &quot;None of that lot would have been good enough in my time at Anfield.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sun&quot;/&gt;

== Playing style and personality ==
Wark played as a central defender,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/brave-ipswich-rely-on-the-wright-stuff-1324470.html|title=Brave Ipswich rely on the Wright stuff |last=Allsop|first=Derick|date=1996-01-17|work=The Independent|accessdate=2009-04-25 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; midfielder and, occasionally, as a striker.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Wark | pages=121–122|quote=... I had a brief run as a makeshift striker alongside [[Chris Kiwomya]]...}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wark was an unusual player; he was able to play as a defensive midfielder yet break forward to score. According to former team-mate [[Terry Butcher]], this was because his colleagues would drop back to cover for him: &quot;I played with John Wark, who was a sitting midfielder but was one of the top scorers in England and Europe. If you see it, then do it, as long as the others spot it and cover for you.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1166006/My-war-rouse-nation-Butcher-calls-Scotland-ice-Icelanders.html?ITO=1490|title = My war cry to rouse a nation: Butcher calls for Scotland to ice the Icelanders| accessdate=2009-05-27|date=2009-03-31|work=Daily Mail|last=McGowan|first=Stephen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wark was not a &quot;supremely talented&quot; player, but, according to football journalist [[Jim White (journalist)|Jim White]],  one who espoused team-work and team spirit: &quot;There is no question that the 'one-for-all, all-for-one' mentality generated in the Anfield dressing room was the engine that drove the great team. With players such as [[Alan Kennedy]], John Wark, [[Sammy Lee (footballer)|Sammy Lee]] and [[Craig Johnston]], nobody could claim this was a collection of top-notch operators in the manner, say, of the current [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]]. Every week, they played as an entity greater than the sum of its parts.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | first = David|last= Bolchover | title = The 90-minute manager| isbn= 0273693840 |publisher=Prentice Hall|page=209}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He has been described as &quot;a defensive midfielder with an astonishing goalscoring record&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/2298557/PFA-Player-of-the-Year-winners-1974-2007.html|title = PFA Player of the Year winners 1974–2007|accessdate= 2009-05-27|date=2008-04-28|first=Emily|last= Benammar|work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years, Wark has become closely associated with his moustache. [[Owen Slot]] described the player as &quot;Ipswich's immortal moustache&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/exhibition--spectator-sport-turning-his-back-on-the-football-field-julian-germain-takes-photographs-of-aspiring-fanatics-owen-slot-calls-the-shots-1394887.html|work = The Independent | accessdate = 2009-05-08 | date = 1994-02-18| title =Spectator sport: Turning his back on the football field, Julian Germain takes photographs of aspiring fanatics.

== Honours ==
In 2006 Wark gained the final place in the poll [[100 Players Who Shook the Kop]], conducted by the liverpoolfc.tv website.&lt;ref name=&quot;tv&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/news/archivedirs/news/2006/oct/8/N153706061008-0859.htm|title=100 PWSTK – The Definitive List|publisher=Liverpool F.C.|accessdate=2009-05-27|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080731063435/http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/news/archivedirs/news/2006/oct/8/N153706061008-0859.htm |archivedate = July 31, 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The list was compiled as a result of a fan survey: &quot;Over 110,000 supporters all nominated their own personal Top 10 players in order of impact made&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;tv&quot;/&gt;
In 2007, the [[Professional Footballers' Association]] polled fans of all Football League clubs, as to &quot;their No 1 player&quot; as part of the &quot;centenary celebrations of the players' union&quot;; Wark was the choice of Ipswich fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/2328937/Best-footballers-Shearer-a-hero-on-two-fronts.html|title=Best footballers: Shearer a hero on two fronts|work=Daily Telegraph|accessdate=2009-05-27 | location=London | first=Martin | last=Smith | date=2007-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the same year, Wark was one of four Ipswich Town players to be inducted into the club's Hall of Fame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10272~1088787,00.html|title=Fab Four are guests of club|publisher=Ipswich Town F.C|accessdate=2009-06-06|date=2007-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
