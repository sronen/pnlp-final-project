Brewer is involved in numerous [[charitable organization]]s.

==Playing career==
===Prince George Cougars===
Brewer was drafted in the sixth round, 81st overall, by the [[Prince George Cougars]] in the [[WHL Bantam Draft|1994 WHL Bantam Draft]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1994 Bantam Draft|url=http://www.whl.ca/news/bantam.php?id=70&amp;showToc=1&amp;|publisher=Western Hockey League|accessdate=2007-04-10| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070927011426/http://www.whl.ca/news/bantam.php?id=70&amp;showToc=1&amp;| archivedate = September 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; After being drafted, he played one final season with the Jardine Blazers, recording 38 points in only forty games.&lt;ref name=&quot;legends&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Eric Brewer|url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/SearchPlayer.jsp?player=11410|publisher=[[Hockey Hall of Fame|Hockey Hall of Fame and Museum]]|accessdate=2007-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, Brewer began his WHL career with the Cougars, playing 63 games in the [[1995–96 WHL season|1995–96 season]]. Brewer finished his rookie WHL season with fourteen points, including four goals, and was named Cougars' Rookie of the Year.&lt;ref name=&quot;profile&quot;/&gt;

In his [[1996–97 WHL season|sophomore season]], Brewer became a leader on the Cougars' [[Hockey rink#Lines|blue line]]. He was named to play for Team [[Bobby Orr|Orr]] in the [[CHL Top Prospects Game|1997 CHL Top Prospects Game]] in February 1997 at [[Maple Leaf Gardens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Prospects game rosters|publisher=''[[Toronto Star]]''|date=February 11, 1997|page=C8|accessdate=2008-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; He doubled his point total from the previous season, finishing with 29 points in 71 games played. Brewer followed his regular season by helping the Cougars go on a [[1996–97 WHL season#WHL Playoffs|playoff]] run.&lt;ref name=&quot;playoffrun&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Dufresne|first=Glen|title=The Spring of '97, oh what a time to be a Cougars fan|publisher=''Prince George Citizen''|date=April 8, 2000|page=8|accessdate=2008-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; After clinching the last spot in the West Division with a losing record, the Cougars defeated the number-one seed [[Portland Winter Hawks]] in the [[1996–97 WHL season#Western Conference|conference quarterfinals]] and the third-ranked [[Spokane Chiefs]] in the [[1996–97 WHL season#Conference semifinals|conference semifinals]] before finally losing to the second-ranked [[Seattle Thunderbirds]] in the [[1996–97 WHL season#Conference finals|Western Conference final]].&lt;ref name=&quot;playoffrun&quot;/&gt; Brewer finished this run with six points in the Cougars' fifteen games.

Brewer's [[1997–98 WHL season|final season]] with Prince George was his best, statistically, in the WHL. After representing Canada at the [[1998 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships]], he was named to the Western Conference team for the WHL All-Star Game in [[Regina, Saskatchewan|Regina]], [[Saskatchewan]], which he missed, as well as much of the season, due to injury.&lt;ref name=&quot;legends&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Portland, Spokane dominate all-star team|publisher=''[[The Vancouver Sun]]''|date=January 6, 1998|page=D3|accessdate=2007-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Brewer finished the year with 33 points in only 34 games, a near one point-per-game average, and was named to the WHL West Second All-Star Team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Varlamov WHL's best|publisher=''Edmonton Journal''|date=May 12, 1998|accessdate=2007-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brewer was the highest ranked defenceman at sixth overall among North American skaters heading into the [[1997 NHL Entry Draft]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kerr|first=Grant|title=Big day fast approaching for hopefuls|publisher=''[[The Daily News (Halifax)|The Daily News]]''|date=June 17, 1997|page=46|accessdate=2007-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was drafted fifth overall by the [[New York Islanders]] in June 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1997 NHL Entry Draft First Round Selections|url=http://www.nhl.com/futures/firstround90_99.html#97|publisher=[[National Hockey League]]|accessdate=2007-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New York Islanders===
Just over a year after being drafted, Brewer signed his first professional contract with his draft team, the New York Islanders, in August 1998. Entering the NHL, Brewer was regarded as a future [[James Norris Memorial Trophy|Norris Trophy]] candidate, and as a result, his contract was an entry level three-year, $2.775-million deal complemented by a $1-million signing bonus, the highest base salary available for a rookie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mason|first=Gary|title=Canucks rally around injured Clipper|publisher=''The Vancouver Sun''|date=November 17, 1998|page=E1|accessdate=2008-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cougs' Brewer NHL's newest millionaire|publisher=''The Vancouver Sun''|date=August 19, 1998|accessdate=2007-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The NHL's new deal|publisher=CBC|date=July 21, 2005|url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/indepth/cba/features/issues_deal.html|accessdate=2008-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brewer made his NHL debut on October 10, 1998, against the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]], and on November 5, Brewer scored his first career goal against the [[Carolina Hurricanes]]' [[Trevor Kidd]].&lt;ref name=&quot;legends&quot;/&gt; Throughout his rookie season, Brewer was considered an integral part of the Islanders' defence, and, along with [[Zdeno Chára]], [[Kenny Jönsson]] and [[Roberto Luongo]], was the only player on the Islanders roster that management considered untouchable at the [[NHL trade deadline#1998–99 NHL season|1999 NHL trade deadline]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Adams|first=Alan|title=Trade winds whisper Wendel|publisher=''[[National Post]]''|date=March 22, 1999|page=B4|accessdate=2008-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brewer finished his rookie season with eleven points in 63 games.

After playing just three games of the [[1999–2000 NHL season]], Brewer was assigned to the Islanders' AHL affiliate, the [[Lowell Lock Monsters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Brewer sent to minors|publisher=''Prince George Citizen''|date=October 13, 1999|page=8|accessdate=2008-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was speculated that the reason behind this move was laziness by Brewer, who was benched during the final thirty minutes by head coach [[Butch Goring]] after losing a race for the puck against [[Mike Knuble]] in the Islanders' October 11, 1999, loss to the [[New York Rangers]].&lt;ref name=&quot;laziness&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Swanson|first=Jim|title=Former Cougar called 'lazy' by New York newspaper|publisher=''Prince George Citizen''|date=October 19, 1999|page=8|accessdate=2008-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brewer also took a bad penalty earlier in the game, putting the Islanders down two men.&lt;ref name=&quot;laziness&quot;/&gt; After a two-week, five-game stint with the Lock Monsters, Brewer was subsequently recalled by the Islanders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Swanson|first=Jim|title=Big-league frustration|publisher=''Prince George Citizen''|date=December 23, 1999|page=8|accessdate=2008-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; After playing 26 games with the Islanders in which he only recorded two assists, Brewer was re-assigned to the Lock Monsters on January 8, 2000, for the remainder of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Milbury challenges Luongo|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D07E4DF1E3BF933A25752C0A9669C8B63|date=January 10, 2000|accessdate=2008-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after joining the Lock Monsters, Brewer suffered a sprained knee and missed the next two-and-a-half months of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Brewer free to leave the Island|publisher=''Prince George Citizen''|date=June 26, 2000|page=12|accessdate=2008-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brewer went on to play 25 games for the Lock Monsters, recording two goals and two assists. He also participated in his first professional playoffs, as the Lock Monsters swept the [[Saint John Flames]] in three games in the first round, before being swept themselves in four games in the Eastern Conference semifinals by the [[Providence Bruins]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Bruins prepare for Lowell|url=http://www.providencebruins.com/press_releases/index.php?id=225|publisher=[[Providence Bruins]]|date=April 3, 2005|accessdate=2008-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Edmonton Oilers===
At the [[2000 NHL Entry Draft]], the [[New York Islanders|Islanders]] traded Brewer, [[Josh Green]] and their second round selection ([[Brad Winchester]]) in the same draft to the [[Edmonton Oilers]] for [[Roman Hamrlík]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Brownlee|first=Robin|title=Hamrlik headed to New York: Lowe deals D-man to Islanders for Green, Brewer|publisher=''Edmonton Journal''|date=June 25, 2000|page=D1|accessdate=2007-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although surprised to be traded, Brewer was excited at the prospect of playing for the Oilers, who saw Brewer as a top-four defenceman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Brownlee|first=Robin|title=Big trade a shock to Hamrlik, Brewer|publisher=''Edmonton Journal''|date=June 25, 2000|page=D2|accessdate=2008-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Brewer's socks fake out team brass|publisher=''Edmonton Journal''|date=September 4, 2000|page=D4|accessdate=2008-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Brewer's Oiler career began on a sour note as he suffered a bruised left [[Hip (anatomy)|hip]] and [[Coccyx|tailbone]] in his first game with the team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Brownlee|first=Robin|title=Salo sensational in opener: Oiler goalie makes 33 saves for victory|publisher=''Edmonton Journal''|date=October 7, 2000|page=D1|accessdate=2008-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brewer missed the next four games before returning to the lineup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Matheson|first=Jim|title=Gage's chance to shine|publisher=''Edmonton Journal''|date=October 15, 2000|page=D4|accessdate=2008-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brewer scored his first goal as an Oiler on November 7, 2000, against the New York Rangers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Leetch reaches milestone|publisher=''Prince George Citizen''|date=November 8, 2000|page=12|accessdate=2008-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brewer finished his first Oiler season with career highs in goals, assists and points, as well as the best [[Plus-minus (ice hockey)|plus/minus]] rating on the Oilers team, a plus-15.&lt;ref name=&quot;profile&quot;/&gt; Further, Brewer gained his first NHL playoff experience, a [[2001 Stanley Cup Playoffs#Dallas Stars v. Edmonton Oilers|quarterfinal series]] versus the [[Dallas Stars]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ireland|first=Joanne|title=Burning the opposition at both ends: Solid defenceman Eric Brewer is also taking it to the net|publisher=''Edmonton Journal''|date=March 30, 2001|page=D3|accessdate=2008-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brewer had six points, but the Oilers were eliminated four games to two by the Stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Barnes|first=Dan|title=Oilers not quite there yet|publisher=''Edmonton Journal''|date=April 22, 2001|page=D1|accessdate=2008-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Oilers re-signed Brewer, who was a free agent, to a one-year, $907,500 contract in August 2001.&lt;ref name=&quot;2002deal&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Ireland|first=Joanne|title=Brew back with Oiler crew: Blue-liner signs two-year, $4M deal at last second|publisher=''[[Edmonton Journal]]''|date=September 13, 2002|page=D1|accessdate=2007-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hockey: Brewer, Suter get new deals|publisher=''[[National Post]]''|date=August 16, 2001|page=B10|accessdate=2007-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his [[2001–02 NHL season|second season]] with the Oilers, Brewer was assigned to play against the opposing teams' best offensive players by Oilers head coach [[Craig MacTavish]].&lt;ref name=&quot;newrole&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Matheson|first=Jim|title=Brewer slowing up big wheels|publisher=''Edmonton Journal''|date=January 28, 2002|page=D3|accessdate=2008-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brewer began to play more minutes in games, typically placing among the NHL leaders in average minutes played per game.&lt;ref name=&quot;newrole&quot;/&gt; With this enhanced role on the team, Brewer finished his season with new career highs in assists and points for the second consecutive season, and matched his career high in goals. Although his single year contract expired, his role on the Oilers had become more important and Brewer expected a large raise for his [[2002–03 NHL season|third season]] with the Oilers.&lt;ref name=&quot;2002deal&quot;/&gt;

After a long [[holdout]] that lasted until the beginning of Oilers training camp, Brewer finally signed a two-year, $4-million contract in September 2002.&lt;ref name=&quot;2002deal&quot;/&gt; At the half of the [[2002–03 NHL season]], Brewer was named to play in his first [[National Hockey League All-Star Game|NHL All-Star Game]], dressing for the [[Western Conference (NHL)|Western Conference]] in the [[53rd National Hockey League All-Star Game|fifty-third edition]] of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Stevens|first=Neil|title=NHL's biggest and newest names get first all-star nod|publisher=''[[Sudbury Star]]''|date=January 18, 2003|page=B2|accessdate=2007-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; He finished with career highs for assists and points and set a career high for goals for the third consecutive season. He appeared in his second NHL playoffs, another [[2003 Stanley Cup Playoffs#(1) Dallas Stars vs. (8) Edmonton Oilers|quarterfinal series]] against the Dallas Stars in which the Oilers were once again eliminated four games to two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Maki|first=Allan|title=Big-money Stars too fast for Edmonton's playoff road|publisher=''The Globe and Mail''|date=April 21, 2003|page=S1|accessdate=2008-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brewer finished the playoffs with four points in the Oilers' six games.

In his [[2003–04 NHL season|fourth season]] with the Oilers, Brewer continued his role as a top defenceman. On November 22, 2003, Brewer was among the participants in the historic [[2003 Heritage Classic]] ice hockey game versus the [[Montreal Canadiens]] at [[Commonwealth Stadium (Edmonton)|Commonwealth Stadium]] in [[Edmonton]]. Brewer scored the Oilers first goal of the game in a 4–3 loss in front of a then record crowd of 57,167.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Roarke |first=Shawn|title=Canadiens hold off Oilers in nightcap |url=http://www.nhl.com/intheslot/read/heritage/night_gamer112203.html|publisher=National Hockey League|date=November 22, 2003|accessdate=2008-02-01}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the season, in a game on January 29, 2004, versus the [[Chicago Blackhawks]], Brewer recorded his one-hundredth career point.&lt;ref name=&quot;profile&quot;/&gt; Since his team depended on Brewer to play against the opposing teams' best offensive players, he finished the season with an average time on ice of 24:39, ranking fourteenth in the league.&lt;ref name=&quot;profile&quot;/&gt; In the final year of his two-year contract, Brewer finished the season with his point totals matching those from his [[2001–02 NHL season]], a slight fall from his career highs set in his third season with the Oilers.

With the Oilers unwilling to pay what he was expecting, Brewer decided to go to salary [[arbitration]] to get a new contract. However, on August 4, 2004, Brewer signed a one-year, $2.65-million contract with the Oilers, avoiding his arbitration hearing set for only a few days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Brewer, Oilers avoid arbitration|publisher=CBC|date=August 5, 2004|url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/story/2004/08/04/brewer040804.html|accessdate=2007-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brewer was unable to play out his new contract due to the [[2004–05 NHL lockout]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lockout over salary cap shuts down NHL|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=February 16, 2005|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/news/story?id=1992793|accessdate=2007-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===St. Louis Blues===

In August 2005, following the lockout, the [[Edmonton Oilers|Oilers]] traded Brewer, [[Jeff Woywitka]] and [[Doug Lynch]] to the [[St. Louis Blues]] for [[Chris Pronger]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Matheson|first=Jim|title=Defensive posturing: Lowe nabs Pronger in deal for Brewer, Lynch and Woywitka|publisher=''Edmonton Journa''l|date=August 3, 2005|page=D1|accessdate=2007-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the trade, Brewer was a restricted free-agent, so on August 15, 2005, Brewer accepted the Blues' qualifying offer, signing a one-year, $2-million contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rutherford|first=Jeremy|title=Brewer signs for one year; Mayers OKs two-year deal|publisher=''[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]''|date=August 16, 2005|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=SL&amp;p_theme=sl&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=10C0A6967286FF60&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM|accessdate=2007-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brewer's [[2005–06 NHL season|first season]] with the Blues was a particularly bad one. After playing the first eighteen games of the season, Brewer separated his [[shoulder]] on November 16, 2005, in a 2–0 victory versus the [[Columbus Blue Jackets]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Blues defenseman suffers shoulder separation|publisher=ESPN|date=November 17, 2005|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/news/story?id=2227568|accessdate=2008-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brewer missed ten games before being activated from the [[injured reserve list]], returning to the St. Louis line-up for a game on December 20, 2005, against the [[Phoenix Coyotes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tkachuk, Drake, Sanford on IR for Blues|publisher=ESPN|date=December 18, 2005|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/news/story?id=2263792|accessdate=2008-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Recap&amp;nbsp;– Blues 5, Coyotes 4|publisher=National Hockey League|date=December 20, 2005|url=http://www.nhl.com/nhl/app?service=page&amp;page=Recap&amp;gameNumber=495&amp;season=20052006&amp;gameType=2|accessdate=2008-02-12}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Less than a month later, in a game on January 13, 2006, against the [[Atlanta Thrashers]], Brewer collided with the Thrashers' [[Centre (ice hockey)|centre]] [[Karl Stewart]], and [[Joint dislocation|dislocated]] his left shoulder, which ended his season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Blues' Brewer could miss season following surgery|publisher=ESPN|date=January 23, 2006|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/news/story?id=2302645|accessdate=2007-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In just 32 games, Brewer finished his season with nine points including six goals, two shy of his career best of eight set in the [[2002–03 NHL season]]. Despite his limited play, the Blues re-signed Brewer to a one-year, $2.014-million contract for the [[2006–07 NHL season|2006–07 season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Zurkowsky|first=Herb|title=Free agents not flocking to Montreal|publisher=''National Post''|date=July 12, 2006|date=B10|accessdate=2008-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Monday's sports transactions|publisher=''[[Pittsburgh Tribune-Review]]''|date=July 18, 2006|accessdate=2008-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brewer's [[2006–07 NHL season|second season]] with the Blues began as a disappointment. By the first half of December 2006, Brewer had only amassed six points and a [[Plus-minus (ice hockey)|plus/minus]] rating of minus-11 and was often referred to as &quot;the worst player on the ice&quot; by the media and fans alike.&lt;ref name=&quot;2006-07&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Eric Brewer game log&amp;nbsp;– 2006–07|publisher=[[Yahoo!]]|url=http://sports.yahoo.com/nhl/players/1792/gamelog;_ylt=AmQKNUvk53gzYp2ueEskAshivLYF?year=2006|accessdate=2008-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;evolution&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Rutherford|first=Jeremy|title=The evolution of Eric Brewer|publisher=''Edmonton Journal''|date=September 23, 2007|page=C2|accessdate=2008-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brewer was often involved in trade rumours as he was set to become an unrestricted free agent following the completion of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Deals could be brewing for Brewer|publisher=''Edmonton Journal''|date=November 12, 2006|page=C3|accessdate=2008-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brewer believed his performance was the result of having only played in 32 NHL games since the [[2003–04 NHL season]].&lt;ref name=&quot;evolution&quot;/&gt; However, after the firing of head coach [[Mike Kitchen]] on December 11, 2006, Brewer began playing much better under new head coach, [[Andy Murray (ice hockey)|Andy Murray]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Slumping Blues make change at top, fire coach|publisher=''[[The Washington Post]]''|date=December 12, 2006|accessdate=2008-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next nineteen games, Brewer changed his minus-11 into a plus-2 and became an integral part of the Blues' defence.&lt;ref name=&quot;evolution&quot;/&gt; His turnaround was rewarded on February 24, 2007, when, rather than being traded as was previously rumoured, Brewer signed a four-year, $17-million contract extension with the Blues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Blues re-sign Brewer and Legace|publisher=[[The Sports Network|TSN]]|date=February 24, 2007|url=http://www.tsn.ca/nhl/news_story/?ID=197451&amp;hubname=nhl|accessdate=2007-04-08| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070929155457/http://www.tsn.ca/nhl/news_story/?ID=197451&amp;hubname=nhl| archivedate = September 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brewer continued his turnaround through the end of the season, finishing the year with six goals and 23 assists for 29 points, tying his career high for points set in the [[2002–03 NHL season]] and setting a new career high for assists.

In his [[2007–08 NHL season|third season]] with the Blues, Brewer continued to do well under Andy Murray. Brewer evolved into one of the top two-way defencemen in the NHL, with comparisons being made between him and former first overall draft pick, [[Chris Phillips]] of the [[Ottawa Senators]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Matheson|first=Jim|title=Brewer becomes defensive stalwart|publisher=''Edmonton Journal''|date=December 8, 2007|page=D3|accessdate=2008-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; His play and leadership abilities were recognized, when on February 8, 2008, Brewer was named as the [[St. Louis Blues (ice hockey)#Team captains|nineteenth]] [[Captain (ice hockey)|captain]] in the history of the St. Louis Blues, filling the vacancy created when former Blues captain [[Dallas Drake]] had his contract [[Buyout|bought out]] following the [[2006–07 NHL season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Coats|first=Bill|title=Brewer will wear 'C' for Blues|publisher=''St. Louis Post-Dispatch''|date=February 9, 2008|url=http://www.stltoday.com/stltoday/sports/stories.nsf/blues/story/9E6D8D688B6F7785862573EA001317D4?OpenDocument|accessdate=2008-02-13}}{{dead link|date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 17, 2008, in a game against the Columbus Blue Jackets, Brewer set a career high for points in a game with four assists, eclipsing his previous career high of three points set on January 16, 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;2006-07&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Blues PP too much for Blue Jackets|publisher=TSN|date=February 17, 2008|url=http://www.tsn.ca/nhl/news_story/?ID=229928&amp;hubname=nhl|accessdate=2008-02-17}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brewer finished the season with only one goal in his 77 games played, his lowest goal total since the [[1999–2000 NHL season]], although he added 21 assists, three short of a career high. At the completion of the season, Brewer underwent [[reconstructive surgery]] on his right shoulder to repair damage suffered in a [[Fighting in ice hockey|fight]] in the Blues' season opening game against the Phoenix Coyotes on October 4, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rutherford|first=Jeremy|title=Surgery for two Blues|publisher=''St. Louis Post-Dispatch''|date=April 9, 2008|url=http://www.stltoday.com/stltoday/sports/stories.nsf/blues/story/0B7B45A104AF6AFC86257426003BE502?OpenDocument|accessdate=2008-06-07|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080410151012/http://www.stltoday.com/stltoday/sports/stories.nsf/blues/story/0B7B45A104AF6AFC86257426003BE502?OpenDocument &lt;!-- Added by H3llBot --&gt;|archivedate=2008-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tampa Bay Lightning===
On February 18, 2011, Brewer was traded to the [[Tampa Bay Lightning]] for [[Brock Beukeboom]] and Tampa Bays' third round selection in the [[2011 NHL Entry Draft]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=O'Neill|first=Dan|title=Blues will trade Brewer to Tampa Bay|url=http://www.stltoday.com/sports/hockey/professional/morning-skate/article_20db4f3e-3ba9-11e0-b975-0017a4a78c22.html|publisher=''St. Louis Post-Dispatch''|date=2011-02-18|accessdate=2011-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 22 games with Tampa Bay, he notched a goal and an assist. He also led the Lightning in average ice time per game with 21:34. Overall in 2010-11, Brewer recorded a career-high nine goals and also amassed 81 penalty minutes, good for the second-highest total of his career. He appeared in a career-high 18 post-season contests with Tampa Bay in 2010-11, registering three goals and 17 points, helping the Bolts to the 2011 Stanley Cup Playoffs for the first time in four seasons, where he also set a career-high with three points in Game 2 of the Eastern Conference Quarterfinals against the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]] and ranked third among all postseason skaters with 51 blocked shots. On June 24, 2011, Brewer signed a four year, $15.4-million contract extension with the Lightning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lightning ink Brewer to four-year deal|url=http://www.tsn.ca/nhl/story/?id=369866|publisher=The Sports Network|date=2011-06-24|accessdate=2011-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout his career, Brewer has represented Canada at various international ice hockey tournaments. He first competed internationally as a member of Team Pacific Canada at the [[World U-17 Hockey Challenge|1995 World U-17 Hockey Challenge]] in [[Moncton]], [[New Brunswick]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mills|first=Ed|title=Pressure on Cougar from Ardrossan|publisher=''Edmonton Journal''|date=August 27, 1995|page=C1|accessdate=2008-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three years later, he represented Canada as a whole as a member of the [[Canada national junior hockey team|national junior team]] at the [[1998 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships]], where he was named an [[Captain (ice hockey)|alternate captain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Holden lifts Canadians into win column, finally|publisher=''The Province''|date=December 29, 1997|accessdate=2007-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the tournament in which Canada had its worst ever showing, an eighth place finish including a loss to [[Kazakhstan national ice hockey team|Kazakhstan]], giving Brewer an unkind welcome to [[International Ice Hockey Federation|IIHF]] international ice hockey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Juniors get warm homecoming|publisher=[[Canadian Online Explorer|SLAM! Sports]]|date=January 5, 1998|accessdate=2008-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although eligible for the [[1999 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships|1999]] edition of the same tournament, Brewer was unable to play due to NHL commitments with the New York Islanders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Spencer|first=Donna|title=With more junior-aged NHLers, could Canada have won the gold?|publisher=''[[Saskatoon StarPhoenix|Star-Phoenix]]''|date=January 7, 1999|accessdate=2007-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brewer made his debut with the [[Canada men's national ice hockey team|Canadian national men's team]] on April 24, 2001, when he joined Canada for the [[2001 Men's World Ice Hockey Championships]] in [[Nuremberg]], [[Cologne]], and [[Hanover]], Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Matheson|first=Jim|title=Oilers' Brew joins Canada's crew
