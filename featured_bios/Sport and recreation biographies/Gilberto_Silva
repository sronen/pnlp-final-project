'''Gilberto Aparecido da Silva''' ({{IPA-pt|ʒiɫˈbeʁtu ˈsiɫvɐ}}; born 7 October 1976), commonly known as '''Gilberto Silva''', is a [[Brazil]]ian [[association football|footballer]] who plays for [[Grêmio FBPA|Grêmio]] as a [[midfielder]].

Gilberto was raised in a poor family and as a child he balanced playing football with various labour jobs.&lt;ref name=&quot;shopsteward&quot;&gt;{{cite news | first=Sue | last=Mott |title=Life is sweet for Brazil's shop steward |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/international/2344777/Life-is-sweet-for-Brazil%27s-shop-steward.html |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph | location=London |date=2 September 2006 |accessdate=30 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began his football career in 1997 with [[América Futebol Clube (MG)|América Mineiro]], where good form earned him a move to [[Clube Atlético Mineiro|Atlético Mineiro]] in 2000. He became a star player for Atlético, playing for three years in the [[Brazilian football league system|Brazilian]] [[Campeonato Brasileiro Série A]]. He came to particular prominence when he helped the [[Brazil national football team|Brazilian national team]] win the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]], playing in all seven of Brazil's matches.&lt;ref name=&quot;4thegameprofile&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.4thegame.com/club/arsenal-fc/player-profile/2975/gilbertosilva.html |title=4thegame Profile |publisher=4thegame.com |accessdate=30 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his first five seasons with the club, he played 208 games and scored 23 goals. On 19 August 2006 he scored Arsenal's first competitive goal at the newly built [[Emirates Stadium]].&lt;ref name=&quot;firstgoal&quot;&gt;{{cite news | first=Simon | last=Austin |title=Arsenal 1–1 Aston Villa |url=http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/4786655.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=19 August 2006 |accessdate=19 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was made [[Captain (association football)#Vice-captain|vice-captain]] of Arsenal in 2006.

In 2007, he was selected as Brazil captain for the [[Copa América]] tournament, which Brazil went on to win.&lt;ref name=&quot;gilbertocaptain&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-460018/Arsenal-cope-midfielder-Gilberto.html |title=dailymail.co.uk – Arsenal will have to cope without midfielder Gilberto |newspaper=Daily Mail |location=London |date=5 August 2007 |accessdate=30 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
As a child, Gilberto lived in the city of [[Lagoa da Prata]] with his father (a [[blacksmith]]), his mother (a [[housewife]]) and three sisters.&lt;ref name=&quot;shopsteward&quot;/&gt; His family lived in a small house which his father built, in the district of Usina Luciânia. Despite financial hardship, causing his sisters and him to share a single room, he had a relatively carefree childhood: he describes it as &quot;[a time when] I had no responsibility in my life, I played football on the street with cousins and friends, and we never had any contact with drugs or violence&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;silvalining&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/the-premiership-interview-highburys-silva-lining-503609.html |last=Wallace |first=Sam |title=The Premiership Interview: Highbury's Silva lining |newspaper=The Independent |location=London |date=20 August 2005 |accessdate=30 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988 (aged 12), he got the chance to break out of poverty by playing football, joining [[América Futebol Clube (MG)|América Mineiro]] as a youth player. It was during these years at América Mineiro that Gilberto was taught defensive discipline by playing as a [[Defender (football)#Centre back|central defender]]. When not playing football, Gilberto was taught furniture-making skills by his father, which he would come to use in the following years. In 1991, Gilberto's father retired leaving the 15-year-old to provide financially for his whole family, a task made more difficult by his mother's ill-health.&lt;ref name=&quot;weightingold&quot;&gt;{{cite news | first=Clive | last=White |title=Silva worth his weight in gold |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/2359646/Silva-worth-his-weight-in-gold.html |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=15 May 2005 |accessdate=30 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the low wage at América Mineiro, he was forced to quit football to take various jobs as a labourer, a carpenter, and a worker in a sweet factory. It looked as if this would be the end of his childhood dream.&lt;ref name=&quot;earnstripes&quot;&gt;{{cite news| first=Jon | last=Brodkin |title=New Gunner Gilberto is quick to earn his stripes |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2002/oct/05/newsstory.sport/print |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |date=5 September 2002 |accessdate=19 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a factory-worker Gilberto earned the equivalent of about £50 a month by 2002 rates.&lt;ref name=&quot;cheese&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/archive/england/news/2002/0731/20020731featthomson.html |title=Cheese is the secret to Silva's success |publisher=ESPN Soccernet |date=31 July 2002 |accessdate=30 July 2008|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110525201921/http://soccernet.espn.go.com/archive/england/news/2002/0731/20020731featthomson.html|archivedate=25 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;shopstewardpg3&quot;&gt;{{cite news | first=Sue | last=Mott |title=Life is sweet for Brazil's shop steward |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/international/2344777/Life-is-sweet-for-Brazil%27s-shop-steward.html |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph | location=London |date=2 September 2006 |accessdate=30 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; After three years of working in a factory, the 18-year-old decided to try his luck at football again by enrolling in the local club's youth academy. His time in the academy did not last long due to the worsening situation at home as a result of his mother's ill health; he returned to work in the sweet factory with little hope of resurrecting his football career.

==Club career==
===Early career===
In 1997, Gilberto's friends convinced him to give football another try, which led to him re-signing for América Mineiro on 1 June 1997, this time as a full-time professional. Aged 22, Gilberto played as a central defender for the first team. During his first season for América Mineiro he was regarded as a key player by the club, despite being criticised by some fans for inconsistency.&lt;ref name=&quot;cheese&quot; /&gt; He helped them win the [[Campeonato Brasileiro Série B|Série B]] division, and consequently gain [[promotion and relegation|promotion]] to [[Campeonato Brasileiro Série A|Série A]].

During Gilberto's third season at América Mineiro, with the team back to Série B after relegation in Série A in 1999, he played 20 games and scored one goal, helping the club to finish runners-up in the league. In 2000, aged 24, he joined rival club [[Clube Atlético Mineiro|Atlético Mineiro]]. In his first season for the club, he fractured his right [[tibia]] and, as a result, missed a number of games.&lt;ref name=&quot;ownworldcup&quot; /&gt; In his second season, he was moved by the [[manager (association football)|manager]] [[Carlos Alberto Parreira]] from central defence to a defensive midfield role where he flourished. He scored three goals in the 2001 season and became a revelation in Brazilian club football.&lt;ref name=&quot;sportsillustrated&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/soccer/world/2002/world_cup/players/brazil/ |title=Brazil player profiles |publisher=CNN Sports Illustrated |accessdate=9 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arsenal===
Gilberto's performance in the 2002 FIFA World Cup caught the attention of many coaches. Gilberto expressed a desire to move to England, saying, &quot;It would be fantastic to play against the likes of [[David Beckham]] again.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;allthingsfootie&quot;&gt;[http://www.allthingsfootie.co.uk/archives/2002_07_01_index.php &quot;All Things Footie Archive&quot;].

Retrieved 25 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, [[Premier League|FA Premier League]] clubs [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] and [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] led the chase to sign him. In August, while still under contract to Atlético Mineiro, Gilberto joined Arsenal on their pre-season tour of [[Austria]]; while he had not yet signed for Arsenal the deal looked set to go ahead. However, complications arose when a transfer embargo was placed on Atlético Mineiro due to unpaid wages to some players at the club, including Gilberto.&lt;ref name=&quot;espnprofile&quot;&gt;[http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=20131&amp;cc=5739 &quot;ESPNsoccernet: Gilberto Silva Profile&quot;].

Upon signing Gilberto, Arsenal manager [[Arsène Wenger]] said, &quot;What I like was the fact that he kept things simple. He can play all across the midfield but the holding role just in front of the defence is what he does best.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;espnprofile&quot; /&gt;

[[File:Gilberto Silva.png|thumb|120px|Gilberto defending a corner for Arsenal at Highbury in April 2006]]
When Gilberto moved to England and began training with Arsenal, he bought a house in [[St Albans]], South [[Hertfordshire]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ofutebol&quot;&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20071014111223/http://ofutebol.com/view.asp?ArticleId=6 &quot;Ofutebol: Gilberto Interview&quot;].

BBC Sport, 9 October 2002. Retrieved 19 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; However, on the pitch, he settled in very quickly. On 11 August 2002 he made his Arsenal debut as a substitute against [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] in the second half of the [[FA Community Shield]] game in which he scored the winning goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

After two substitute appearances, Gilberto finally broke into the starting eleven on 27 August, helping Arsenal to a 5–2 win against [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]]. Gilberto's good form continued as he set a new record for the fastest goal scored in the [[UEFA Champions League]], scoring after 20.07 seconds against [[PSV Eindhoven|PSV]] on 25 September 2002.&lt;ref name=&quot;uefaprofile&quot;&gt;[http://www.uefa.com/competitions/UCL/Players/Player=64769/index.html &quot;uefa.com – Players – Gilberto Silva&quot;]. UEFA. 2 September 2006. Retrieved 25 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; However, his legal problems continued, since his transfer to England still was not fully resolved. As a result Gilberto instructed his lawyers to start legal proceedings against Atlético Mineiro for unpaid wages in November 2002. For the second half of the 2002–03 season, he remained a regular starter in the Arsenal side. Even though he suffered a lapse in form towards the end of the season, he won an [[FA Cup]] winner's medal, playing in the final at the [[Millennium Stadium]] as Arsenal beat [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] 1–0.

[[2003–04 in English football|2003–04]] was an even better season for Gilberto, as he was instrumental in helping Arsenal win the FA Premier League title whilst going the entire season unbeaten. He played in 32 of Arsenal's 38 unbeaten Premier League games during the season. His next season started equally impressively, as he scored the first goal in Arsenal's 3–1 FA Community Shield win over [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] at the Millennium Stadium. During the opening games of the season, he started to experience severe pain in his back, and after a match at [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] on 27 September 2004, a scan revealed he had fractured his back. At first it was reported that he would be out of action for a month.&lt;ref name=&quot;gilbertosidelined&quot;&gt;[http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=311675&amp;cc=5739 &quot;Gilberto sidelined for at least a month&quot;].

He made his footballing comeback in Arsenal's 4–1 victory over [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] on 22 April 2005. During the whole [[FA Premier League 2004–05|2004–05 season]], Gilberto was injured for 7 months and played only 17 games.

On 7 November, he made his debut in the starting line-up of the national team against [[Bolivia national football team|Bolivia]]. His international career continued to flourish in early 2002: he scored twice against Bolivia and once against Iceland. In 2002, he was a surprise inclusion in the [[2002 FIFA World Cup squads#Brazil|Brazil squad]] for the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]] in South Korea and Japan. He was expected to play a small part in the tournament. However, defensive midfielder and Brazilian team captain [[Emerson Ferreira da Rosa|Emerson]] was injured in training just before the first World Cup game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Dominic |last=Fifield |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2002/jun/03/worldcupfootball2002.sport29 |title=High jinks rule Brazil captain out of cup |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |date=3 June 2002 |accessdate=30 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In light of the setback, coach Scolari called upon Gilberto to fill the gap which Emerson left.

On 22 June 2005, Gilberto played in Brazil's 1–1 draw against [[Japan national football team|Japan]], in his only game of the [[2005 FIFA Confederations Cup]]. His absence as a first team regular could be explained by his lack of games, and thus match fitness, for Arsenal during the season leading up to the tournament.

On the back of his good Champions League form, Gilberto was selected for the Brazil national football team for the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]]. Gilberto was substituted on in two games, and started twice due to another injury to Emerson. Brazil were beaten 1–0 by [[France national football team|France]] in the quarter final.

==Style of play==
Gilberto is often called &quot;the invisible wall&quot; in Brazil.&lt;ref name=&quot;ownworldcup&quot;/&gt; His play often goes unnoticed as he positions himself between the two centre backs and the rest of midfield, breaking up opposition attacks before they gather momentum. In this role, he is a part of the defensive unit for both club and country.&lt;ref name=&quot;guidetocoaching&quot;&gt;Jacob Daniel. ''The Complete Guide to Coaching Soccer Systems and Tactics'', pg 106, (Reedswain Inc., 1 March 2004).&lt;/ref&gt; As Arsenal and Brazil are both attack minded teams, he offers cover for attacking [[Defender (associatio football)#Wingback|wing-backs]] and other midfielders who have a poor record of dropping back to help the defence.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} When playing, Gilberto occasionally drops into the centre of defence to cover the central defenders, usually [[Lúcio]] for Brazil and [[Kolo Touré]] for Arsenal, who are both known for their attacking runs forward with the ball.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} Gilberto's style of defending is unlike that of normal midfield enforcers; whereas some midfielders such as [[Robbie Savage]] and [[Roy Keane]] are very strong in the challenge, Gilberto is more passive when he defends.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} Rather than tackle a player, he is more likely to shadow him, thus pushing him back.&lt;ref name=&quot;bragame&quot;&gt;Kopcak, Jim (30 August 2005). [http://soccernet.espn.go.com/columns/story?id=341162&amp;root=world&amp;cc=5739 &quot;O Jogo Bonito&quot;]. ESPN Soccernet. Retrieved 25 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, he has an unusually clean record for a defensive midfielder: he has twice gone 45 games or more without receiving a single [[Misconduct (football)|booking]] during his Arsenal career.&lt;ref name=&quot;soccerbase&quot;&gt;[http://www.soccerbase.com/players_details.sd?playerid=19036 &quot;Gilberto Silva Statistics&quot;]. Soccerbase. Retrieved 25 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gilberto is good at helping to defend against opponents who play a [[Long ball (association football)|long ball]] game because he often [[Man marking|man marks]] the opposition's attacking [[Forward (association football)|target-man]]. This cuts off the opposition's supply to the strikers, and thus forces the long-ball team to play through the midfield, something to which long-ball teams are not particularly suited.&lt;ref name=&quot;coachingtactics&quot;&gt;Phil Wymer, ''Coaching Soccer Tactics'', pg 94, (Soccertactics.com, 22 November 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite Gilberto's high pass completion rate,&lt;ref name=&quot;passing&quot;&gt;[http://arsenal-mania.com/news/2518226/Some-interesting-Opta-stats.html &quot;Some interesting Opta stats&quot;]. Arsenal Mania. Retrieved 25 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; his passing has been described as erratic in the past.&lt;ref name=&quot;erratic&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arsenali.co.uk/2006/10/gilberto-key-to-arsenal-renaissance.html|title=Gilberto the key to the Arsenal renaissance|work=Arsenali.co.uk|date=26 October 2006|accessdate=26 October 2006|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20061118065819/http://www.arsenali.co.uk/2006/10/gilberto-key-to-arsenal-renaissance.html|archivedate=18 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; A possible explanation for this is Gilberto's short passing range.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} He is more likely to offload the ball frequently to midfield players close around him, such as [[Cesc Fàbregas]], thus easily gaining a high pass completion rate.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} These short-range passes often go unnoticed, while relatively infrequent long-range incomplete passes often receive negative attention, although not enough to significantly lower his overall pass completion rate.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

According to ProZone (a data analysis system used by football managers) figures cited by ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' in January 2007, Gilberto was, together with [[Paul Scholes]] of Manchester United and [[Frank Lampard]] of [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], one of the few midfielders in England to attain &quot;the elite Champions League level&quot; of performance.&lt;ref name=&quot;prozone&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Chelski players turn on Ballack |url=http://www.football365.com/story/0,17033,8652_1821621,00.html |publisher=Football365.com |date=7 January 2007 |accessdate=30 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outside football==
[[File:Gilberto Silva Streetleague.jpg|thumb|200px|Gilberto Silva at a photo shoot for The Street League]]
Gilberto is known for his gentlemanly sportsmanship and cool, unfluttered temperament on the pitch.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} He rarely, if ever, gets into on-field confrontations, and is usually seen as a peacemaker during any bust-up.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} Off pitch, he has been described as polite, conscientious and soft-spoken by interviewers.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}
[[File:Gilberto playing mandolin.png|thumb|left|200px|Gilberto playing a [[mandolin]]]]
He is a patron of The Street League, a UK based charity which organises football matches for homeless people, [[refugee]]s and [[asylum seeker]]s. In June 2003, Gilberto travelled to [[Brazil]] on tour with 17 Street League players.&lt;ref name=&quot;charitywork&quot;&gt;Jacob, Gary (26 May 2003). [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/article1136017.ece &quot;Gilberto fights for homeless&quot;]. ''The Times'' (London). Retrieved 13 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The tour included a visit to his home town Lagoa da Prata and games against local [[shanty town]] teams at the [[Estádio do Maracanã|Maracanã stadium]].

Gilberto is a keen musician. In his spare time, he plays the [[mandolin]] and the guitar. When he first moved to England he took up mandolin lessons and played publicly at his local pub in St Albans. He later started learning the guitar instead.&lt;ref name=&quot;guitar&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sify.com/sports/football/fullstory.php?id=14238621|title=Brazil's stars wow with their musical talent|work=Sify Sports|accessdate=25 September 2006|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071014091654/http://sify.com/sports/football/fullstory.php?id=14238621|archivedate=14 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like many Brazilian footballers he plays samba music with his teammates in the Seleção (the Brazilian national team) when they are relaxing in between international matches.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

He has a [[Giant Anteater]] named after him at [[London Zoo]]. Gilberto is an adoptee of the animal, which he received from a London Zoo competition winner. The footballer described the South American animal as &quot;my slightly more hairy brother!&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;anteater&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://www.zsl.org/zsl-london-zoo//news/gilberto-meet-gilberto,126,NS.html &quot;Gilberto meet – Gilberto!&quot;].
