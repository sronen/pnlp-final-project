'''William Felton''' &quot;'''Bill'''&quot; '''Russell''' (born February 12, 1934) is a retired American professional [[basketball]] player who played [[center (basketball)|center]] for the [[Boston Celtics]] of the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA). A five-time winner of the [[NBA Most Valuable Player Award]] and a twelve-time [[NBA All-Star Game|All-Star]], Russell was the centerpiece of the Celtics [[dynasty (sports)|dynasty]] that won eleven [[NBA Finals|NBA Championships]] during Russell's thirteen-year career. Along with [[Henri Richard]] of the [[National Hockey League]]'s [[Montreal Canadiens]], Russell holds the record for the most championships won by an athlete in a North American sports league. Before his professional career, Russell led the [[San Francisco Dons men's basketball|University of San Francisco]] to two consecutive [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA championships]] (1955, 1956). He also won a gold medal at the [[Basketball at the 1956 Summer Olympics|1956 Summer Olympics]] as captain of the [[United States men's national basketball team|U.S. national basketball team]].&lt;ref name = &quot;nbacomsummary&quot;/&gt;

Russell is widely considered one of the best players in NBA history. Listed as between 6'9&quot; (2.06 m) and 6'10&quot; (2.08 m), Russell's [[block (basketball)|shot-blocking]] and [[man-to-man defense]] were major reasons for the Celtics' success. He also inspired his teammates to elevate their own defensive play. Russell was equally notable for his [[rebound (basketball)|rebounding]] abilities. He led the NBA in rebounds four times and tallied 21,620 total rebounds in his career. He is one of just two NBA players (the other being prominent rival [[Wilt Chamberlain]]) to have grabbed more than fifty rebounds in a game. Though never the focal point of the Celtics' [[offense (sports)|offense]], Russell also scored 14,522 career points and provided effective passing.

Playing in the wake of pioneers like [[Earl Lloyd]], [[Chuck Cooper (basketball)|Chuck Cooper]], and [[Sweetwater Clifton]], Russell was the first [[African American]] player to achieve superstar status in the NBA. He also served a three-season (1966–69) stint as [[player-coach]] for the Celtics, becoming the first African American NBA coach.&lt;ref name = &quot;nbacomsummary&quot;/&gt; Frequent battles with [[racism]] left Russell with a long-standing contempt for fans and journalists. When he retired, Russell left Boston with a bitter attitude, although in recent years his relationship with the city has improved. For his accomplishments in the [[Civil Rights Movement]] on and off the court, Russell was awarded the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] by [[Barack Obama]] in 2011.

Russell is a member of the [[Basketball Hall of Fame|Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame]] and the [[National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame]]. He was selected into [[NBA 25th Anniversary Team]] in 1971, into [[NBA 35th Anniversary Team]] in 1980 and named as one of the [[50 Greatest Players in NBA History]] in 1996, one of only four players that selected into all three teams. In 2007, he was enshrined in the [[FIBA Hall of Fame]]. In 2009, the NBA announced that the [[NBA Finals]] MVP trophy would be named the [[Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award]] in honor of Russell.&lt;ref name=finalsmvp&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/2009/news/02/14/russell.trophy/index.html?rss=true|title=The Finals MVP to Receive Bill Russell MVP Award|accessdate=2009-02-14|work=NBA.com|date=2009-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
Bill Russell was born to Charles and Katie Russell in [[Monroe, Louisiana|West Monroe]], [[Louisiana]]. West Monroe was strictly segregated, and the Russells often struggled with racism.&lt;ref name=Current&gt;{{cite web| last = Thompson| first = Tim| title = Bill Russell overcame long odds, dominated basketball| url= http://www.thecurrentonline.com/home/index.cfm?event=displayArticlePrinterFriendly&amp;uStory_id=d9770e44-d716-4359-8710-3a2be480029e|date = 2001-02-19| publisher = thecurrentonline.com| accessdate = 2007-02-08}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once, Russell's father was refused service at a gasoline station until the staff had taken care of all the white customers. When his father attempted to leave and find a different station, the attendant stuck a shotgun in his face, threatening to kill him unless he stayed and waited his turn.&lt;ref name=&quot;Current&quot;/&gt; At another time, Russell's mother was walking outside in a fancy dress when a policeman accosted her. He told her to go home and remove the dress, which he described as &quot;white woman's clothing&quot;.&lt;ref name=Current/&gt; Because large numbers of blacks were moving to [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], [[California]] during WWII to look for work there, Russell's father moved the family out of Louisiana when Russell was eight years old and settled them in Oakland.&lt;ref name=Current/&gt; While there the family fell into poverty, and Russell spent his childhood living in a series of [[Public housing#United States|project homes]].&lt;ref name=Current/&gt;

Charlie Russell is described as a &quot;stern, hard man&quot; who was initially a janitor in a paper factory (a typical low paid, intellectually unchallenging &quot;Negro Job&quot;, as sports journalist John Taylor commented),&lt;ref name=taylor52_56&gt;{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=John|title=The Rivalry: Bill Russell, Wilt Chamberlain, and the Golden Age of Basketball|year=2005|publisher=Random House|location=New York City|isbn=1-4000-6114-8|pages=52–56}}&lt;/ref&gt; but later became a trucker when World War II broke out.&lt;ref name=taylor52_56/&gt; Being closer to his mother Katie than to his father,&lt;ref name=taylor52_56/&gt; Russell received a major emotional blow when she suddenly died when he was 12. His father gave up his trucking job and became a steel worker to be closer to his semi-orphaned children.&lt;ref name=taylor52_56/&gt; Russell has stated that his father became his childhood hero, later followed up by Minneapolis Lakers superstar [[George Mikan|George &quot;Mr. Basketball&quot; Mikan]], whom he met when he was in high school.&lt;ref name=&quot;chat&quot;/&gt;

In his early years, Russell struggled to develop his skills as a basketball player. Although Russell was a good runner and jumper and had extremely large hands,&lt;ref name=taylor52_56/&gt; he simply did not understand the game and was cut from the team in [[junior high school]]. As a [[Tenth grade|sophomore]] at [[McClymonds High School]], Russell was almost cut again.&lt;ref name=&quot;HS&quot;&gt;{{cite book

He worked hard and used the benefits of a growth spurt to become a decent basketball player, but it was not until his [[Eleventh grade|junior]] and [[Twelfth grade|senior]] years that he began to excel.&lt;ref name=&quot;HS&quot;/&gt; Russell soon became noted for his unusual style of defense. He later recalled, &quot;To play good defense... it was told back then that you had to stay flatfooted at all times to react quickly. When I started to jump to make defensive plays and to [[block (basketball)|block shots]], I was initially corrected, but I stuck with it, and it paid off.&quot;&lt;ref name=five&gt;''Wir sind stolz auf Dirk'', Sven Simon, ''FIVE'' magazine, issue 43, 12/2007, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Russell's high school teammates was future [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Baseball Hall-of-Famer]] [[Frank Robinson]].

==College career==
Russell was ignored by college recruiters and did not receive a single letter of interest until Hal DeJulio from the [[University of San Francisco]] (USF) watched him in a high school game. DeJulio was not impressed by Russell's meager scoring and &quot;atrocious fundamentals&quot;,&lt;ref name=taylor50_51&gt;{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=John|title=The Rivalry: Bill Russell, Wilt Chamberlain, and the Golden Age of Basketball|year=2005|publisher=Random House|location=New York City|isbn=1-4000-6114-8|pages=50–51}}&lt;/ref&gt; but sensed that the young [[center (basketball)|center]] had an extraordinary instinct for the game, especially in [[clutch (sports)|clutch]] situations.&lt;ref name=taylor50_51/&gt; When DeJulio offered Russell a scholarship, the latter eagerly accepted.&lt;ref name=&quot;HS&quot;/&gt; Sports journalist John Taylor described it as a watershed in Russell's life, because Russell realized that basketball was his one chance to escape poverty and racism; as a consequence, Russell swore to make the best of it.&lt;ref name=taylor52_56/&gt;

At USF, Russell became the new starting center for coach [[Phil Woolpert]]. Woolpert emphasized defense and deliberate half-court play, concepts that favored defensive standout Russell.&lt;ref name=taylor57_67&gt;{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=John|title=The Rivalry: Bill Russell, Wilt Chamberlain, and the Golden Age of Basketball|year=2005|publisher=Random House|location=New York City|isbn=1-4000-6114-8|pages=57–67}}&lt;/ref&gt; Woolpert was unaffected by issues of skin color. In 1954, he became the first coach of a major college basketball squad to start three [[African American]] players: Russell, [[K.C. Jones]] and Hal Perry.&lt;ref name=&quot;usf&quot;&gt;{{cite web| last = Schneider| first = Bernie| title = 1953–56 NCAA Championship Seasons: The Bill Russell Years|publisher= University of San Francisco| url= http://usfdons.cstv.com/trads/russell_years.html| year = 2006| accessdate = 2006-12-01| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061128191756/http://usfdons.cstv.com/trads/russell_years.html| archivedate = November 28, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his USF years, Russell used his relative lack of bulk to develop a unique style of defense: instead of purely guarding the opposing center, he used his quickness and speed to play help defense against opposing [[forward (basketball)|forwards]] and aggressively challenge their shots.&lt;ref name=taylor57_67/&gt; Combining the stature and shot-blocking skills of a center with the foot speed of a [[guard (basketball)|guard]], Russell became the centerpiece of a USF team that soon became a force in college basketball. After USF kept [[College of the Holy Cross|Holy Cross]] star [[Tom Heinsohn]] scoreless in an entire half, ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' wrote, &quot;If [Russell] ever learns to hit the basket, they're going to have to rewrite the rules.&quot;&lt;ref name=taylor57_67/&gt;
 
However, the games were often difficult for the USF squad. Russell and his African American teammates became targets of racist jeers, particularly on the road.&lt;ref name=&quot;jwr&quot;/&gt; In one notable incident, hotels in [[Oklahoma City]] refused to admit Russell and his black teammates while they were in town for the 1954 All-College Tournament. In protest, the whole team decided to camp out in a closed [[college dorm]], which was later called an important bonding experience for the group.&lt;ref name=&quot;usf&quot;/&gt; Decades later, Russell explained that his experiences hardened him against abuse of all kinds. &quot;I never permitted myself to be a victim,&quot; he said.&lt;ref name=&quot;ConvSI&quot;&gt;{{cite news| publisher = sportsillustrated.cnn.com| title = A conversation with Bill Russell| url= http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/centurys_best/news/1999/05/06/russell/| date = 1999-05-10| accessdate = 2007-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ConvUSA&quot;&gt;{{cite news| publisher = usatoday.com| title = A conversation with Bill Russell| url= http://www.usatoday.com/community/chat/2001-06-06-russell.htm| date = 2001-06-06| accessdate = 2007-02-09}} Note: This source appears to have a typo it was corrected in this article: It reads &quot;I did now want...&quot; in the source, it was changed to the obviously intended form, &quot;I did not want...&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Racism also shaped his lifelong paradigm as a team player.  &quot;At that time,&quot; he has said, &quot;it was never acceptable that a black player was the best. That did not happen...My junior year in college, I had what I thought was the one of the best college seasons ever. We won 28 out of 29 games. We won the National Championship. I was the MVP at the Final Four. I was first team All American. I averaged over 20 points and over 20 rebounds, and I was the only guy in college blocking shots. So after the season was over, they had a Northern California banquet, and they picked another center as Player of the Year in Northern California. Well, that let me know that if I were to accept these as the final judges of my career I would die a bitter old man.&quot;  So he made a conscious decision, he said, to put the team first and foremost, and not worry about individual achievements.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.achievement.org/autodoc/printmember/rus0int-1&lt;/ref&gt;

On the hardwood, his experiences were far more pleasant. Russell led USF to [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA championships]] in 1955 and 1956, including a string of 55 consecutive victories. He became known for his strong defense and shot-blocking skills, once denying 13 shots in a game. [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] coach [[John Wooden]] called Russell &quot;the greatest defensive man I've ever seen&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;usf&quot;/&gt; During his college career, Russell averaged 20.7 [[points per game]] and 20.3 [[rebounds per game]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nbacomsummary&quot;&gt;{{cite web| work=National Basketball Association| publisher=Turner Sports Interactive| title = Bill Russell| url= http://www.nba.com/history/players/russell_bio.html| accessdate = 2006-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides basketball, Russell represented USF in [[track and field]] events. He competed in the 440&amp;nbsp;yard (402&amp;nbsp;m) race, which he could complete in 49.6 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

| accessdate = 2007-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also participated in the [[high jump]]; ''[[Track &amp; Field News]]'' ranked him as the seventh-best high jumper in the world in 1956. That year, Russell won high jump titles at the Central California [[Amateur Athletic Union|AAU]] meet, the Pacific AAU meet, and the West Coast Relays. One of his highest jumps occurred at the West Coast Relays, where he achieved a mark of 6&amp;nbsp;feet 9¼ inches (2.06&amp;nbsp;m).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| publisher = CBS Sportsline.com|title = NCAA Basketball Tourney History: Two by Four| url = http://www.sportsline.com/collegebasketball/mayhem/history/multitalented| accessdate = 2007-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After his years at USF, the [[Harlem Globetrotters]] invited Russell to join their [[exhibition game|exhibition]] basketball squad. Russell, who was sensitive to any racial prejudice, was enraged by the fact that owner [[Abe Saperstein]] would only discuss the matter with Woolpert. While Saperstein spoke to Woolpert in a meeting, Globetrotters assistant coach Harry Hanna tried to entertain Russell with jokes. The USF center was livid after this snub and declined the offer: he reasoned that if Saperstein was too smart to speak with him, then he was too smart to play for Saperstein. Instead, Russell made himself eligible for the [[1956 NBA Draft]].&lt;ref name=taylor66_71&gt;{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=John|title=The Rivalry: Bill Russell, Wilt Chamberlain, and the Golden Age of Basketball|year=2005|publisher=Random House|location=New York City|isbn=1-4000-6114-8|pages=66–71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1956 NBA Draft==
In the 1956 NBA Draft, [[Boston Celtics]] coach [[Red Auerbach]] had set his sights on Russell, thinking his defensive toughness and [[rebound (basketball)|rebounding]] prowess were the missing pieces the Celtics needed.&lt;ref name=&quot;nbacomsummary&quot;/&gt; In perspective, Auerbach's thoughts were unorthodox. In that period, centers and forwards were defined by their offensive output, and their ability to play defense was secondary.&lt;ref name=&quot;nbacompraise&quot;&gt;{{cite web| last = Ryan| first = Bob| title = Timeless Excellence| work=National Basketball Association| publisher=Turner Sports Interactive| url= http://www.nba.com/encyclopedia/players/bill_russell.html| accessdate = 2006-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Boston's chances of getting Russell seemed slim. Because the Celtics had finished second in the previous season and the worst teams had the highest draft picks, the Celtics had slipped too low in the draft order to pick Russell. In addition, Auerbach had already used his territorial pick to acquire talented forward [[Tom Heinsohn]]. But Auerbach knew that the [[Rochester Royals]], who owned the first draft pick, already had a skilled rebounder in [[Maurice Stokes]], were looking for an outside shooting guard and were unwilling to pay Russell the $25,000 signing bonus he requested.&lt;ref name=taylor67_74&gt;{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=John|title=The Rivalry: Bill Russell, Wilt Chamberlain, and the Golden Age of Basketball|year=2005|publisher=Random House|location=New York City|isbn=1-4000-6114-8|pages=67–74}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[St. Louis Hawks]], who owned the second pick, originally drafted Russell, but were vying for Celtics center [[Ed Macauley]], a six-time [[All-Star]] who had roots in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]]. Auerbach agreed to trade Macauley, who had previously asked to be traded to St. Louis in order to be with his sick son, if the Hawks gave up Russell. However the owner of St Louis called Auerbach later and demanded more in the trade. Not only did he want Macauley, who was the Celtics premier player at the time, he wanted [[Cliff Hagan]], who had been serving in the military for three years and had not yet played for the Celtics. After much debate, Auerbach agreed to give up Hagan, and the Hawks made the trade.&lt;ref&gt;Auerbach, Red and John Feinstein. (2004). ''Let Me Tell You a Story: A Lifetime in the Game''. Little, Brown and Company. pp. 75–6. ISBN 0-316-73823-9.&lt;/ref&gt; During that same draft, Boston also claimed guard [[K.C. Jones]], Russell's former USF teammate. Thus, in one night, the Celtics managed to draft three future [[Basketball Hall of Fame|Hall of Famers]]: Russell, K.C. Jones and Heinsohn.&lt;ref name=&quot;nbacomsummary&quot;/&gt; The Russell draft-day trade was later called one of the most important trades in the history of North American sports.&lt;ref name=taylor67_74/&gt;

==1956 Olympics==
Before his NBA rookie year, Russell was the captain of the [[United States men's national basketball team|U.S. national basketball team]] that competed at the [[Basketball at the 1956 Summer Olympics|1956 Olympic tournament]]. [[Avery Brundage]], head of the [[International Olympic Committee]], argued that Russell had already signed a professional contract and thus was no longer an amateur, but Russell prevailed.&lt;ref name=taylor67_74/&gt; He had the option to skip the tournament and play a full season for the Celtics, but he was determined to play in the Olympics. He later commented that he would have participated in the [[high jump]] if he had been snubbed by the basketball team.&lt;ref name=&quot;chat&quot;/&gt; Under coach Gerald Tucker, Russell helped the national team win the [[gold medal]] in [[Melbourne]], defeating the [[Soviet Union]] 89–55 in the final game. The United States dominated the tournament, winning by an average of 53.5 points per game. Russell led the team in scoring, averaging 14.1 points per game for the competition. His Celtics teammate K.C. Jones joined him on the Olympic squad and contributed 10.9 points per game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| publisher = usabasketball.com|title= Games of the XVIth Olympiad–1956| url= http://www.usabasketball.com/news.php?news_page=moly_1956| accessdate=2008-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional career==
===1956–59===
Russell could not join the Celtics for the [[1956-57 NBA season|1956–57 season]] until December, due to his Olympic commitment. After rejoining the Celtics, Russell played 48 games, averaging 14.7 points per game and a league-high [[List of National Basketball Association top rookie rebounding averages|19.6 rebounds per game]].&lt;ref name=&quot;brstats&quot;&gt;{{cite web| work = Basketball-Reference| publisher = Sports Reference LLC| title = Bill Russell Statistics|url= http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/r/russebi01.html| accessdate = 2008-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this season, the Celtics featured six future Hall-of-Famers: center Russell, forwards Heinsohn and [[Jim Loscutoff]], guards [[Bill Sharman]] and [[Bob Cousy]], and forward [[Frank Ramsey (basketball)|Frank Ramsey]], who came off the bench. (K.C. Jones did not play for the Celtics until 1958 because of military service.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Smith| first = Sam| publisher = nbcsports.msnbc.com| title = 2003 draft eventually may be best in history| url= http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/15403154/| date = 2006-10-30| accessdate = 2008-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Russell's first Celtics game came on December 22, 1956 against the St. Louis Hawks, led by star forward [[Bob Pettit]], who held several all-time scoring records.&lt;ref name=taylor74_80&gt;{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=John|title=The Rivalry: Bill Russell, Wilt Chamberlain, and the Golden Age of Basketball|year=2005|publisher=Random House|location=New York City|isbn=1-4000-6114-8|pages=74–80}}&lt;/ref&gt; Auerbach assigned Russell to shut down St. Louis's main scorer, and the rookie impressed the Boston crowd with his man-to-man defense and shot-blocking.&lt;ref name=taylor74_80/&gt; In previous years, the Celtics had been a high-scoring team, but lacked the defensive presence needed to close out tight games. However, with the added defensive presence of Russell, the Celtics had laid the foundation for a dynasty. The team utilized a strong defensive approach to the game, forcing opposing teams to commit many [[turnover (basketball)|turnovers]], which led to many easy [[fast break]] points.&lt;ref name=taylor74_80/&gt; Russell was an elite help defender who allowed the Celtics to play the so-called &quot;Hey, Bill&quot; defense: whenever a Celtic requested additional defensive help, he would shout &quot;Hey, Bill!&quot; Russell was so quick that he could run over for a quick [[double team]] and make it back in time if the opponents tried to find the open man.&lt;ref name=taylor74_80/&gt; He also became famous for his shot-blocking skills: pundits called his blocks &quot;Wilsonburgers&quot;, referring to the [[Wilson Sporting Goods|Wilson]] NBA basketballs he &quot;shoved back into the faces of opposing shooters&quot;.&lt;ref name=taylor74_80/&gt; This skill also allowed the other Celtics to play their men aggressively: if they were beaten, they knew that Russell was guarding the basket.&lt;ref name=taylor74_80/&gt; This approach allowed the Celtics to finish with a 44–28 regular season record, the team's second-best record since beginning play in the [[1946-47 BAA season|1946–47 season]], and guaranteed a post-season appearance.&lt;ref name=&quot;brceltics&quot;&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Russell also received negative attention. Constantly provoked by [[New York Knicks]] center [[Ray Felix]] during a game, he complained to coach Auerbach. The latter told him to take matters into his own hands, so after the next provocation, Russell punched Felix unconscious, paid a 25-dollar fine and was no longer a target of cheap fouls.&lt;ref name=taylor74_80/&gt; With his teammates, Russell had a cordial relationship, with the notable exception of fellow rookie and old rival Heinsohn. Heinsohn felt that Russell resented him because the former was named the 1957 [[NBA Rookie of the Year]]: many people thought that Russell was more important, but Russell also had only played half the season. Russell also ignored Heinsohn's plea to give his cousin an autograph, and openly said to Heinsohn that he deserved half of his 300-dollar Rookie of the Year check. The relationship between the two rookies remained reserved.&lt;ref name=taylor91_99&gt;{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=John|title=The Rivalry: Bill Russell, Wilt Chamberlain, and the Golden Age of Basketball|year=2005|publisher=Random House|location=New York City|isbn=1-4000-6114-8|pages=91–99}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, despite their different ethnic backgrounds and lack of common off-court interests, his relationship with Celtics point guard and fan favorite Bob Cousy was amicable.&lt;ref name = taylor108_111/&gt;

In [[1957 NBA Playoffs|Game 1 of the Eastern Division Finals]], the Celtics met the [[Syracuse Nationals]], who were led by [[Dolph Schayes]]. In Russell's first NBA playoff game, he finished with 16 [[point (basketball)|points]] and 31 [[rebound (basketball)|rebounds]], along with a reported 7 blocks. (At the time, blocks were not yet an officially registered statistic.) After the Celtics' 108–89 victory, Schayes quipped, &quot;How much does that guy make a year?

In the NBA Finals, the Celtics met the St. Louis Hawks, who were again led by Bob Pettit, as well as former Celtic Ed Macauley. The teams split the first six games, and the tension was so high that, in Game 3, Celtics coach Auerbach punched his colleague Ben Kerner and received a $300 fine.&lt;ref name=taylor91_99/&gt; In the highly competitive Game 7, Russell tried his best to slow down Pettit, but it was Heinsohn who scored 37 points and kept the Celtics alive.&lt;ref name=taylor91_99/&gt; However, Russell contributed by completing the famous &quot;Coleman Play&quot;. Here, Russell ran down Hawks guard [[Jack Coleman (basketball)|Jack Coleman]], who had received an outlet pass at midcourt, and blocked his shot despite the fact that Russell had been standing at his own baseline when the ball was thrown to Coleman. The block preserved Boston's slim 103–102 lead with 40-odd seconds left to play in regulation, saving the game for the Celtics.&lt;ref name=nbacompraise/&gt; In the second [[overtime (sports)|overtime]], both teams were in serious foul trouble: Heinsohn had fouled out, and the Hawks were so depleted that they had only 7 players left.&lt;ref name=taylor91_99/&gt; With the Celtics leading 125–123 with one second left, the Hawks had the ball at their own baseline. Reserve guard [[Alex Hannum]] threw a long [[alley oop]] pass to Pettit, and Pettit's tip-in rolled indecisively on the rim for several seconds before rolling out again. The Celtics won, earning their first NBA Championship.&lt;ref name=taylor91_99/&gt;

In the [[1957-58 NBA season|1957–58 season]], Russell averaged 16.6 points per game and a league-record average of 22.7 rebounds per game.&lt;ref name=brstats/&gt; An interesting phenomenon began that year: Russell was voted the [[NBA Most Valuable Player]], but only named to the [[All-NBA]] Second Team. This would occur repeatedly throughout his career. The NBA reasoned that other centers were better all-round players than Russell, but no player was more valuable to his team. The Celtics won 49 games and easily made the first berth in the [[1958 NBA Playoffs]], and made the [[1958 NBA Finals]] against their familiar rivals, the St. Louis Hawks.&lt;ref name=hawks58&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.nba.com/history/finals/19571958.html| title=Pettit Drops 50 on Celtics in Game 6| work=National Basketball Association| publisher=Turner Sports Interactive| accessdate=2008-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The teams split the first two games, but then Russell went down with a foot injury in Game 3 and could no longer participate in the playoffs. The Celtics surprisingly won Game 4, but the Hawks prevailed in Games 5 and 6, with Pettit scoring 50 points in the deciding Game 6.&lt;ref name=hawks58/&gt;

In the following [[1958-59 NBA season|1958–59 season]], Russell continued his strong play, averaging 16.7 points per game and 23.0 rebounds per game in the regular season.&lt;ref name=brstats/&gt; The Celtics broke a league record by winning 52 games, and Russell's strong performance once again helped lead the Celtics through the post-season, as they returned to the NBA Finals.

In the [[1959–60 NBA season|1959–60 season]], the NBA witnessed the debut of legendary 7&amp;nbsp;ft 1 in (2.16 m) [[Philadelphia Warriors]] center [[Wilt Chamberlain]], who averaged an unprecedented 37.6 points per game in his rookie year.&lt;ref name=wiltsummary&gt;{{cite web| work=National Basketball Association| publisher=Turner Sports Interactive| title = Wilt Chamberlain Bio| url= http://www.nba.com/history/players/chamberlain_bio.html| accessdate = 2006-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 7, 1959, Russell's Celtics hosted Chamberlain's Warriors, and pundits called the matchup between the best offensive and best defensive center &quot;The Big Collision&quot; and &quot;Battle of the Titans&quot;.&lt;ref name=taylor3_10&gt;{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=John|title=The Rivalry: Bill Russell, Wilt Chamberlain, and the Golden Age of Basketball|year=2005|publisher=Random House|location=New York City|isbn=1-4000-6114-8|pages=3–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both men awed onlookers with &quot;nakedly awesome athleticism&quot;,&lt;ref name=taylor3_10/&gt; and while Chamberlain outscored Russell 30 to 22, the Celtics won 115–106, and the match was called a &quot;new beginning of basketball&quot;.&lt;ref name=taylor3_10/&gt; The matchup between Russell and Chamberlain became one of basketball's greatest rivalries.&lt;ref name=nbacomsummary/&gt; In that season, Russell's Celtics won a record 59 regular season games (including a then-record tying [[List of National Basketball Association longest winning streaks|17 game win streak]]) and met Chamberlain's Warriors [[1960 NBA Playoffs|in the Eastern Division Finals]].

The Celtics earned another post-season appearance, where they defeated the Syracuse Nationals 4–1 [[1961 NBA Playoffs|in the Eastern Division Finals]].

The [[1961-62 NBA season|following season]], Russell scored a career-high 18.9 points per game, accompanied by 23.6 rebounds per game.&lt;ref name=&quot;brstats&quot;/&gt; While his rival Chamberlain had a record-breaking season of 50.4 points per game and a [[Wilt Chamberlain's 100-point game|100-point game]],&lt;ref name=&quot;wiltsummary&quot;/&gt; the Celtics became the first team to win 60 games in a season, and Russell was voted as the NBA's Most Valuable Player.

The Celtics lost playmaker Bob Cousy to retirement after the [[1962-63 NBA season|1962–63 season]], but they drafted [[John Havlicek]]. Once again, the Celtics were powered by Russell, who averaged 16.8 points and 23.6 rebounds per game, won his fourth regular-season MVP title, and earned MVP honors at the [[1963 NBA All-Star Game]] following his 19 point, 24 rebound performance for the East.&lt;ref name=&quot;brstats&quot;/&gt; The Celtics reached the [[1963 NBA Finals]], where they again defeated the Los Angeles Lakers, this time in six games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In the following [[1963-64 NBA season|1963–64 season]], the Celtics posted a league-best 58–22 record in the regular season.

Russell again excelled during the [[1964-65 NBA season|1964–65 season]].

===1966–69===

Before the [[1966-67 NBA season|1966–67 season]], Celtics coach Red Auerbach retired.

&lt;/ref&gt; The Sixers simply outpaced the Celtics, shredding the famous Boston defense by scoring 140 points in the clinching Game 5 win.&lt;ref name=taylor292_299&gt;{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=John|title=The Rivalry: Bill Russell, Wilt Chamberlain, and the Golden Age of Basketball|year=2005|publisher=Random House|location=New York City|isbn=1-4000-6114-8|pages=292–299}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russell acknowledged his first real loss in his career (he had been injured in 1958 when the Celtics lost the NBA Finals) by visiting Chamberlain in the locker room, shaking his hand and saying, &quot;Great&quot;.&lt;ref name=taylor292_299/&gt; However, the game still ended on a high note for Russell. After the loss, he led his grandfather through the Celtics locker rooms, and the two saw white Celtics player [[John Havlicek]] taking a shower next to his black teammate [[Sam Jones (basketball)|Sam Jones]] and discussing the game. Suddenly, Russell Sr. broke down crying. Asked by his grandson what was wrong, his grandfather replied how proud he was of him, being coach of an organization in which blacks and whites coexisted in harmony.&lt;ref name=taylor292_299/&gt;

In Russell's penultimate season, the [[1967-68 NBA season|1967–68 season]], his numbers slowly declined, but at age 34, he still tallied 12.5 points per game and 18.6 rebounds per game&lt;ref name=&quot;brstats&quot;/&gt; (the latter good for the third highest average in the league).&lt;ref name=&quot;1968 NBA Season&quot;&gt;{{cite web| work = Basketball-Reference| publisher = Sports Reference LLC| title = 1968 NBA Season Summary| url= http://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_1968.html| accessdate = 2007-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[1967 NBA Playoffs|In the Eastern Division Finals]], the 76ers had the better record than the Celtics and were slightly favored. But then, national tragedy struck as [[Martin Luther King]] was assassinated on April 4, 1968.

In Game 2, Philadelphia evened the series with a 115–106 win, and in Games 3 and 4, the Sixers won, with Chamberlain suspiciously often defended by Celtics backup center [[Wayne Embry]], causing the press to speculate Russell was worn down.&lt;ref name=cherry190_199/&gt; Prior to Game 5, the Celtics seemed dead: no NBA team had ever come back from a 3–1 deficit.&lt;ref name=cherry190_199/&gt; However, the Celtics rallied back, winning Game 5 122–104 and Game 6 114–106, powered by a spirited Havlicek and helped by a terrible Sixers shooting slump.&lt;ref name=cherry190_199/&gt; In Game 7, 15,202 stunned Philadelphia fans witnessed a historic 100–96 defeat, making it the first time in NBA history a team lost a series after leading 3–1. Russell limited Chamberlain to only two shot attempts in the second half.&lt;ref name=nbacompraise/&gt; Despite this, the Celtics were leading only 97–95 with 34 seconds left when Russell closed out the game with several consecutive clutch plays. He made a free throw, blocked a shot by Sixers player [[Chet Walker]], grabbed a rebound off a miss by Sixers player Hal Greer, and finally passed the ball to teammate Sam Jones, who scored to clinch the win. Boston then beat the Los Angeles Lakers [[1968 NBA Finals|4–2 in the NBA Finals]], giving Russell his tenth title in 12 years.&lt;ref name=nbacomsummary/&gt; For his efforts Russell was named ''[[Sports Illustrated|Sports Illustrated's]]'' [[Sportsman of the Year]].

However, in the [[1968-69 NBA season|1968–69 season]], Russell seemed to reach a breaking point. Shocked by the [[Robert F. Kennedy assassination|murder]] of [[Robert F.

In Game 4, the Celtics were trailing by one point with seven seconds left and the Lakers having the ball, but then Baylor stepped out of bounds, and in the last play, Sam Jones used a triple screen by [[Bailey Howell]], [[Larry Siegfried]] and Havlicek and hit a [[buzzer beater]] which equalized the series.&lt;ref name=taylor336_353/&gt; The teams split the next two games, so it all came down to Game 7 in L.A., where Lakers owner [[Jack Kent Cooke]] angered and motivated the Celtics by putting &quot;proceedings of Lakers victory ceremony&quot; on the game leaflets.

The Celtics were ahead by nine points with five minutes remaining; in addition, West was heavily limping after a Game 5 thigh injury and Chamberlain had left the game with an injured leg.&lt;ref name=taylor336_353/&gt; West then hit one basket after the other and cut the lead to one, and Chamberlain asked to return to the game.

His time as a coach was lackluster; although he led the struggling SuperSonics into the playoffs for the first time in franchise history, Russell's defensive, team-oriented Celtics mindset did not mesh well with the team, and he left in 1977 with a 162–166 record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| work = Basketball-Reference| publisher = Sports Reference LLC| title = Bill Russell Coaching Record|url= http://www.basketball-reference.com/coaches/russebi01c.html| accessdate = 2008-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ironically, coach [[Lenny Wilkens]] later used a similar concept to help the SuperSonics [[1979 NBA Finals|win the title in 1979]]. Russell's stint with the Kings was considerably worse, his last assignment ending when the Kings went 17–41 to begin the [[1987-88 NBA season|1987–88 season]].

In addition, Russell ran into financial trouble. He had invested $250,000 into a rubber plantation in [[Liberia]], where he had wanted to spend his retirement, but it went bankrupt.&lt;ref name=taylor193_197/&gt; The same fate awaited his Boston restaurant called &quot;Slade's&quot;, after which he had to default on a $90,000 government loan to purchase the outlet. The [[IRS]] discovered that Russell owed $34,430 in tax money and put a lien on his house.&lt;ref name=taylor359_366&gt;{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=John|title=The Rivalry: Bill Russell, Wilt Chamberlain, and the Golden Age of Basketball|year=2005|publisher=Random House|location=New York City|isbn=1-4000-6114-8|pages=359–366}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became a [[vegetarian]], took up [[golf]] and worked as a [[color commentator]], but he was uncomfortable as a broadcaster. He later said, &quot;The most successful television is done in eight-second thoughts, and the things I know about basketball, motivation and people go deeper than that.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;nbacomsummary&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=taylor359_366/&gt; On November 3, 1979, Russell hosted [[Saturday Night Live]], in which he appeared in several sports-related sketches.  Russell also wrote books, usually written as a joint project with a professional writer, including 1979's ''Second Wind''. After spending about a decade living as a recluse on [[Mercer Island]] near [[Seattle]], Russell rose to prominence again at the turn of the millennium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/16/sports/pro-basketball-russell-redux-a-private-man-bursts-back-into-the-public-eye.html?ref=williamfeltonrussell|author=Sandomir, Richard|title=Russell Redux: A Private Man Bursts Back Into the Public Eye|work=New York Times|date=June 16, 2000|accessdate=January 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Russell's Rules'' was published in 2001, and in January 2006, he convinced [[Miami Heat]] superstar center [[Shaquille O'Neal]] to bury the hatchet with fellow NBA superstar and former Los Angeles Lakers teammate [[Kobe Bryant]], with whom O'Neal had a [[Shaq–Kobe feud|bitter public feud]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

:''Bill Russell was the cornerstone of the Boston Celtics' dynasty.''
::— introductory line of Russell's nba.com/history summary.&lt;ref name=&quot;nbacomsummary&quot;/&gt;

Russell is one of the most successful and decorated athletes in North American sports history. His awards and achievements include [[List of NBA players with most championships|eleven NBA championships]] as a player with the Boston Celtics in 13 seasons (including two NBA championships as [[player-coach|player/head coach]]), and he is credited with having raised defensive play in the NBA to a new level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In the interim, Russell collected an Olympic gold medal in 1956. His stint as coach of the Celtics was also of historical significance, as he became the first black head coach in major U.S. professional sports when he succeeded Red Auerbach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In his first NBA full season (1957–58), Russell became the first player in NBA history to average more than 20 rebounds per game for an entire season, a feat he accomplished 10 times in his 13 seasons. Russell's [[List of National Basketball Association players with most rebounds in a game|51 rebounds in a single game]] is the second highest performance ever, only trailing Chamberlain's all-time record of 55. He still holds the NBA record for rebounds in one half with 32 (vs. Philadelphia, on November 16, 1957). Career-wise, Russell ranks second only to Wilt Chamberlain in regular season total (21,620) and average (22.5) rebounds per game, and led the NBA in average rebounds per game four times. Russell is the all-time playoff leader in total (4,104) and average (24.9) rebounds per game, he grabbed 40 rebounds in three separate playoff games (twice in the NBA Finals), and he never failed to average at least 20 rebounds per game in any of his 13 post-season campaigns. Russell also had seven regular season games with 40 or more rebounds, the NBA Finals record for highest rebound per game average (29.5 rpg, 1959) and by a rookie (22.9 rpg, 1957). In addition, Russell holds the [[NBA Finals]] single-game record for most rebounds (40, March 29, 1960 vs. St. Louis and April 18, 1962 vs. Los Angeles), most rebounds in a quarter (19, April 18, 1962 vs. Los Angeles), and most consecutive games with 20 or more rebounds (15 from April 9, 1960 – April 16, 1963).&lt;ref name=stats&gt;{{cite news

| url = http://www.usatoday.com/sports/nba/01playoffs/finals/records.htm
| accessdate = 2007-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also had 51 in one game, 49 in two others, and twelve straight seasons of 1,000 or more rebounds.&lt;ref name=nbacomsummary/&gt; Russell was known as one of the most [[clutch (sports)|clutch]] players in the NBA. He played in 11 deciding games (10 times in Game 7s, once in a Game 5), and ended with a flawless 11–0 record. In these eleven games, Russell averaged 18 points and 29.45 rebounds.&lt;ref name=nbacompraise/&gt;

On the hardwood, he was considered the consummate defensive center, noted for his unmatched defensive intensity, his stellar basketball [[intelligence quotient|IQ]] and his sheer will to win.&lt;ref name=nbacompraise/&gt; Russell excelled at playing man-to-man defense, blocking shots, and grabbing defensive and offensive rebounds.&lt;ref name=nbacomsummary/&gt; He also could score with putbacks and made mid-air outlet passes to point guard Bob Cousy for easy fast break points.&lt;ref name=nbacomsummary/&gt; He also was known as a fine passer and [[pick and roll|pick-setter]], featured a decent left-handed [[hook shot]] and finished strong on alley oops.&lt;ref name=nbacompraise/&gt; However, on offense, Russell's output was limited. His NBA career personal averages show him to be an average scorer (15.1 points career average), a poor [[free throw]] shooter (56.1%), and average overall shooter from the field (44%, not exceptional for a center). In his 13 years, he averaged a relatively low 13.4 field goals attempted (normally, top scorers average 20 and more), illustrating that he was never the focal point of the Celtics offense, instead focusing on his tremendous defense.&lt;ref name=&quot;brstats&quot;/&gt;

In his career, Russell won five regular season MVP awards (1959, 1961–63, 1965)—tied with [[Michael Jordan]] for second all-time behind [[Kareem Abdul Jabbar]]'s six awards. He was selected three times to the [[All-NBA First Team]]s (1959, 1963, 1965) and eight Second Teams (1958, 1960–62, 1964, 1966–68), and was a twelve-time NBA All-Star (1958–1969). Russell was elected to one [[NBA All-Defensive Team|NBA All-Defensive First Team]]. This took place during his last season (1969), and was the first season the NBA All-Defensive Teams were selected. In 1970, ''[[The Sporting News]]'' named Russell the &quot;Athlete of the Decade&quot;. Russell is universally seen as one of the best NBA players ever,&lt;ref name=&quot;nbacomsummary&quot;/&gt; and was declared &quot;Greatest Player in the History of the NBA&quot; by the Professional Basketball Writers Association of America in 1980.&lt;ref name=&quot;nbacomsummary&quot;/&gt; For his achievements, Russell was named &quot;Sportsman of the Year&quot; by ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' in 1968. He also made all three NBA Anniversary Teams: the NBA 25th Anniversary All-Time Team (1970), the NBA 35th Anniversary All-Time Team (1980) and the NBA 50th Anniversary All-Time Team (1996). Russell ranked #18 on ''[[ESPN]]'s 50 Greatest Athletes of the 20th Century'' in 1999. In 2009, ''[[SLAM Magazine]]'' named Russell the #3 player of all time behind Michael Jordan and Wilt Chamberlain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slamonline.com/online/the-magazine/features/2009/06/the-new-top-50/|title=The New Top 50|work=SLAM Magazine|accessdate=June 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On Saturday February 14, 2009, during the 2009 [[NBA All-Star Weekend]] in Phoenix, NBA Commissioner [[David Stern]] announced that the [[NBA Finals]] [[Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award|MVP Award]] would be named after Bill Russell.&lt;ref name=finalsmvp/&gt;

Russell was named as a 2010 recipient of the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2010/11/17/president-obama-names-presidential-medal-freedom-recipients |title=President Obama Names Presidential Medal of Freedom Recipients |date=November 17, 2010 |publisher=The White House |accessdate=November 19, 2010 |work=whitehouse.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Russell was married to his college sweetheart Rose Swisher from 1956 to 1973. They had three children, namely daughter [[Karen Russell]], the television pundit and lawyer, and sons William Jr. and Jacob. However, the couple grew emotionally distant and divorced.&lt;ref name=taylor359_362&gt;{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=John|title=The Rivalry: Bill Russell, Wilt Chamberlain, and the Golden Age of Basketball|year=2005|publisher=Random House|location=New York City|isbn=1-4000-6114-8|pages=359–362}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1977, he married [[Dorothy Anstett]], [[Miss USA]] of 1968,&lt;ref name=taylor359_362/&gt; but they divorced in 1980. In 1996, Russell married his third wife Marilyn Nault,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nelson|first=Murry R.|title=Bill Russell: A Biography|year=2005|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|location=Westport, Connecticut|isbn=0-313-33091-3|pages=xiv|nopp=true}}&lt;/ref&gt; and their marriage lasted until her death in January 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The University of San Francisco Honors the Memory of Marilyn Nault Russell|url=http://usfdons.cstv.com/genrel/012609aaa.html|publisher=University of San Francisco|date=2009-01-26|accessdate=2009-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; His older brother is the noted playwright [[Charlie L. Russell]]. 

During his career, Russell was one of the first big earners in NBA basketball. His rookie contract was worth $24,000, only fractionally smaller than the $25,000 of top earner Bob Cousy.&lt;ref name=taylor74_80/&gt; In contrast to other Celtics, who had to work in the offseason to maintain their standard of living (Heinsohn sold insurance, Gene Guarilia was a professional guitar player, Cousy ran a basketball camp, and Auerbach invested in plastics and a Chinese restaurant),&lt;ref name=taylor174&gt;{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=John|title=The Rivalry: Bill Russell, Wilt Chamberlain, and the Golden Age of Basketball|year=2005|publisher=Random House|location=New York City|isbn=1-4000-6114-8|pages=174}},&lt;/ref&gt; Russell never had to work part-time. When [[Wilt Chamberlain]] became the first NBA player to earn $100,000 in salary in 1965, Russell went to Auerbach and demanded a $100,001 salary, which he promptly received.&lt;ref name=taylor258&gt;{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=John|title=The Rivalry: Bill Russell, Wilt Chamberlain, and the Golden Age of Basketball|year=2005|publisher=Random House|location=New York City|isbn=1-4000-6114-8|pages=258}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personality===
Russell was driven by &quot;a neurotic need to win&quot;, as his teammate Heinsohn observed.&lt;ref name=taylor193_197&gt;{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=John|title=The Rivalry: Bill Russell, Wilt Chamberlain, and the Golden Age of Basketball|year=2005|publisher=Random House|location=New York City|isbn=1-4000-6114-8|pages=193–197}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was so tense before every game that he regularly threw up in the locker rooms; it happened so frequently that his fellow Celtics were more worried when it did ''not'' happen.&lt;ref name=taylor6&gt;{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=John|title=The Rivalry: Bill Russell, Wilt Chamberlain, and the Golden Age of Basketball|year=2005|publisher=Random House|location=New York City|isbn=1-4000-6114-8|pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also known for his natural authority. When he became player-coach in 1967, Russell bluntly said to his teammates that &quot;he intended to cut all personal ties to other players&quot;, and seamlessly made the transition from their peer to their superior.&lt;ref name=taylor280&gt;{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=John|title=The Rivalry: Bill Russell, Wilt Chamberlain, and the Golden Age of Basketball|year=2005|publisher=Random House|location=New York City|isbn=1-4000-6114-8|pages=280}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To teammates and friends, Russell was open and amicable, but was extremely distrusting and cold towards anyone else.&lt;ref name=taylor193_197/&gt; Journalists were often treated to the &quot;Russell Glower&quot;, described as an &quot;icily contemptuous stare accompanied by a long silence&quot;.&lt;ref name=taylor193_197/&gt; Russell was also notorious for his refusal to give autographs or even acknowledge the Celtics fans, so far that he was called &quot;the most selfish, surly and uncooperative athlete&quot; by one pundit.&lt;ref name=taylor193_197/&gt;

===Russell-Chamberlain rivalry===
For most of his career, Russell was close friends with his perennial opponent [[Wilt Chamberlain]]. Chamberlain often invited Russell over for [[Thanksgiving]], and at Russell's place, conversation mostly concerned Russell's electric trains.&lt;ref name=cherry360f&gt;''Wilt: Larger Than Life'', Robert Cherry, Triumph Books (Chicago, 2004), 360–361.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the relationship deteriorated into intense loathing after Game 7 of the [[1969 NBA Finals]], where Chamberlain took himself out of a close game with six minutes left and never returned. Russell accused Chamberlain of being a [[malingerer]] and of &quot;copping out&quot; of the game when it seemed that the Lakers would lose;&lt;ref name=taylor356_357&gt;{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=John|title=The Rivalry: Bill Russell, Wilt Chamberlain, and the Golden Age of Basketball|year=2005|publisher=Random House|location=New York City|isbn=1-4000-6114-8|pages=356–357}}&lt;/ref&gt; in retaliation, Chamberlain (whose knee was so bad that he could not play the entire offseason and ruptured it in the next season) was livid at Russell and saw him as a backstabber.&lt;ref name=taylor356_357/&gt; The two men did not talk to each other for over 20 years until Russell attempted to patch things up, although he never uttered a genuine apology.&lt;ref name=taylor367_371&gt;{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=John|title=The Rivalry: Bill Russell, Wilt Chamberlain, and the Golden Age of Basketball|year=2005|publisher=Random House|location=New York City|isbn=1-4000-6114-8|pages=367–371}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Chamberlain died in 1999, Chamberlain's nephew stated that Russell was the second person he was ordered to break the news to.&lt;ref name=&quot;chat&quot;&gt;{{cite web| last = Russell| first = Bill| title = Chat Transcript: Celtics Legend Bill Russell| work = National Basketball Association| publisher = Turner Sports Interactive| url= http://www.nba.com/celtics/chat/russell_050228.html| accessdate = 2006-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the eulogy, Russell stated that he never considered Chamberlain his rival and disliked the term, instead pointing out that they rarely talked about basketball.

===Racist abuse, controversy and reconciliation===
Russell's life was marked by an uphill battle against [[racism]] and controversial actions and statements in response to perceived racism. As a child, the young Russell witnessed how his parents were victims of racial abuse, and eventually moved into housing projects to escape the daily torrent of bigotry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Current&quot;/&gt; When he later became a standout amateur basketball player at USF, Russell recalled how he and his few fellow African American colleagues were jeered by white students.&lt;ref name=&quot;jwr&quot;&gt;{{cite web| last = Matthews| first = Chris| title = Bill Russell and American racism| url= http://www.jewishworldreview.com/cols/matthews042800.asp| publisher = Jewish World Review| date = 2000-04-28| accessdate = 2007-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even after he became a star on the Boston Celtics, Russell was the victim of racial abuse. When the NBA All-Stars toured the U.S. in the 1958 offseason, white hotel owners in segregated [[North Carolina]] denied rooms to Russell and his black teammates, causing him to later write in his memoir ''Go Up for Glory'', &quot;It stood out, a wall which understanding cannot penetrate. You are a Negro. You are less. It covered every area. A living, smarting, hurting, smelling, greasy substance which covered you. A morass to fight from.&quot;&lt;ref name=taylor108_111&gt;{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=John|title=The Rivalry: Bill Russell, Wilt Chamberlain, and the Golden Age of Basketball|year=2005|publisher=Random House|location=New York City|isbn=1-4000-6114-8|pages=108–111}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the 1961–62 season, Russell refused to play in an exhibition game in [[Lexington, Kentucky|Lexington]], [[Kentucky]] when he and his black teammates were refused service at a local restaurant.&lt;ref name=&quot;espn&quot;&gt;{{cite web| last = Flatter| first = Ron| title = Russell was a proud, fierce warrior| publisher=espn.go.com| url= http://espn.go.com/sportscentury/features/00016449.html

As a consequence, Russell was extremely sensitive to all racial prejudice: according to Taylor, he often perceived insults even if others did not.&lt;ref name=taylor66_71/&gt; He was active in the [[Black Power]] movement and supported [[Muhammad Ali]]'s decision to refuse to be drafted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.aaregistry.com/african_american_history/1603/Athletes_support_Muhammad_Ali|title=Athletes support Muhammad Ali! | publisher=aaregistry.com|accessdate=2008-05-24 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080106095315/http://www.aaregistry.com/african_american_history/1603/Athletes_support_Muhammad_Ali |archivedate = January 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was often called &quot;Felton X,&quot; a mockery of the Nation of Islam's tradition of replacing a European [[slave name]] with an &quot;X,&quot; and even purchased land in Liberia.&lt;ref name=taylor193_197/&gt; Russell's public statements became increasingly militant, so far that he was quoted in a 1963 ''Sports Illustrated'' interview with the words: &quot;I dislike most white people because they are people... I like most blacks because I am black&quot;.&lt;ref name=taylor193_197/&gt; However, when his white Celtics teammate Frank Ramsey asked whether he hated him, Russell claimed to be misquoted, but few believed it.&lt;ref name=taylor193_197/&gt; Also, Taylor remarks that Russell overlooked that his career was only made possible by the white people who were proven anti-racists, namely his white high school coach George Powles (the person who encouraged him to play basketball), his white college coach Phil Woolpert (who integrated USF basketball), white Celtics coach Red Auerbach (who is universally [[Red Auerbach#No color barrier|regarded as an anti-racist pioneer]] and made him the first black NBA coach), and white Celtics owner [[Walter A. Brown]], who gave him a high $24,000 rookie contract, just $1,000 shy of the top earning veteran Bob Cousy.&lt;ref name=taylor359_366/&gt;

Nevertheless, as a result of repeated racial bigotry, Russell refused to respond to fan acclaim or friendship from his neighbors, thinking it was insincere and hypocritical. He decided that since the world hadn't given him anything, he would give the world nothing in return. This attitude contributed to his legendary bad rapport with fans and journalists.&lt;ref name=taylor108_111/&gt; He alienated Celtics fans by saying, &quot;You owe the public the same it owes you, nothing! I refuse to smile and be nice to the kiddies.&quot;&lt;ref name=taylor193_197/&gt; This supported the opinion that Russell (who was the highest paid Celtic) was egotistical, paranoid and hypocritical, and even the [[FBI]] described Russell in his file as &quot;an arrogant Negro who won't sign autographs for white children&quot;.&lt;ref name=taylor193_197/&gt; The already hostile atmosphere between Russell and Boston hit its apex when vandals broke into his house, covered the walls with racist graffiti, damaged his trophies and defecated in the beds.&lt;ref name=taylor193_197/&gt; In response, Russell described [[Boston]] as a &quot;flea market of [[racism]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Zirin| first = Dave| title = Redeeming the Olympic Martyrs of 1968| publisher = zmag.org| date = 2005-09-28| url= http://www.zmag.org/znet/viewArticle/5308| accessdate = 2008-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''King Of The Court'' by Aram Goudsouzian, he was quoted saying, &quot;From my very first year I thought of myself as playing for the Celtics, not for Boston. The fans could do or think whatever they wanted.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Goudsouzian, Aram (2010). ''King of the Court: Bill Russell and the Basketball Revolution''. Berkeley: University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt; After his retirement, he described the Boston press as corrupt and racist; in response, Boston sports journalist Larry Claflin claimed that Russell himself was the real racist.&lt;ref name=taylor361&gt;{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=John|title=The Rivalry: Bill Russell, Wilt Chamberlain, and the Golden Age of Basketball|year=2005|publisher=Random House|location=New York City|isbn=1-4000-6114-8|pages=361}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his refusal to sign autographs, he accepted a $250,000 contract to sign 5,000 pieces of memorabilia.&lt;ref name=taylor364&gt;{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=John|title=The Rivalry: Bill Russell, Wilt Chamberlain, and the Golden Age of Basketball|year=2005|publisher=Random House|location=New York City|isbn=1-4000-6114-8|pages=364}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Russell, who [[Hostile media effect|invariably saw himself as a victim of the media]], wasn't present when his #6 jersey was retired in 1972, or his induction into the Hall of Fame in 1975, shunning the limelight both times.&lt;ref name=&quot;espn&quot;/&gt; While Russell still has sore feelings towards the city, there has been something of a reconciliation;&lt;ref name=&quot;Macquarrie&quot;/&gt; and he has even visited the city on a regular basis in recent years, something he never did in the years immediately after his retirement.&lt;ref name=&quot;Macquarrie&quot;&gt;{{cite news| last = Macquarrie| first = Brian| title = Bitterness subsides|publisher = The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel| date = 2000-11-19| accessdate = 2007-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Russell originally retired, he demanded that his jersey be retired in an empty [[Boston Garden]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Sandomir&quot;&gt;{{cite news| last = Sandomir| first = Richard| title = Russell Redux: A Private Man Bursts Back Into the Public Eye| url= http://partners.nytimes.com/library/sports/basketball/061600bkn-russell.html| publisher = The New York Times| date = 2000-06-16| accessdate = 2007-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, the Celtics left Boston Garden and entered the [[TD Garden|FleetCenter]], now the TD Garden, and as the main festive act, the Boston organization wanted to re-retire Russell's jersey in front of a sellout audience.&lt;ref name=taylor359_366/&gt; Perennially wary of the &quot;racist&quot; city of Boston, Russell decided to make amends and gave his approval. On May 6, 1999, the Celtics re-retired Russell's jersey in a ceremony attended by his on-court rival (and friend) Chamberlain, along with Celtics legend [[Larry Bird]] and Hall of Famer Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. The crowd gave Russell a prolonged standing ovation, which brought tears to his eyes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sandomir&quot;/&gt; Russell was visibly touched at this outpour of adoration. He thanked Chamberlain for taking him to the limit and &quot;making [him] a better player&quot; and the crowd for &quot;allowing [him] to be a part of their lives.&quot;&lt;ref name=taylor359_366/&gt;

On December 2, 2008, Boston Mayor Thomas Menino and The Mayor's Office of New Bostonians awarded Russell the 2008 We Are Boston Leadership Awards. Russell, who according to the mayor flew a &quot;red-eye flight&quot; to be there, attended the annual event with his daughter. He was visibly grateful and shared anecdotes of racial bigotry when he first came to Boston as a player and bought a home in Reading, Massachusetts. Russell congratulated the mayor on wanting to be a &quot;mayor for all of Boston&quot; and commented that it was a city that truly changed.
