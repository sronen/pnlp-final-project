'''Robert Lee''' &quot;'''Bobby'''&quot; '''Eaton''' (born August 14, 1958)&lt;ref name=OWOW&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/b/bobby-eaton.html|title=Bobby Eaton Profile|accessdate=2007-07-13|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an American semi-retired [[Professional wrestling|professional wrestler]], who made his debut in 1976.&lt;ref name=Kprofile1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kayfabememories.com/Wrestlers/WLeaton.htm|title=Bobby Eaton|publisher=Kayfabe Memories|last=Dills|first=Tim| accessdate=2007-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eaton is most famous for his work in [[tag team]]s, especially his days as one-half of the team [[The Midnight Express (professional wrestling)|the Midnight Express]]. Under the [[Manager (professional wrestling)|management]] of [[Jim Cornette]], Eaton originally teamed with [[Dennis Condrey]] and, later on, with [[Stan Lane]].&lt;ref name=tagbook&gt;{{cite book|last=Oliver|first=Greg|coauthors=Johnson, Steve|title=The Pro Wrestling Hall of Fame: The Tag Teams|publisher=ECW Press|year=2005|isbn=978-1-55022-683-6|pages=58–62|chapter=The top 20: 10 the Midnight Express}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also worked with a number of other tag team partners, including [[Koko B. Ware]], [[Steve Keirn]], and [[Darren Matthews|&quot;Lord&quot; Steven Regal]].&lt;ref name=tagbook/&gt;

In his career, Eaton wrestled for extended periods of time for various wrestling promotions: Mid-America Wrestling, [[Continental Wrestling Association]], [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Bill Watts)|Mid-South Wrestling]], [[World Class Championship Wrestling]], [[Jim Crockett Promotions]], [[World Championship Wrestling]], and [[Smoky Mountain Wrestling]]. He has also made brief guest appearances for [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] and [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]], in addition to appearances for a considerable number of [[Independent circuit|independent]] wrestling promotions over the years.&lt;ref name=Kprofile1/&gt; He currently performs part-time, teaming with either Lane and/or Condrey under the Midnight Express name.

==Professional wrestling career==
Growing up in [[Huntsville, Alabama]], Eaton was a fan of professional wrestling, especially the NWA Mid-America [[professional wrestling promotion]]. This promotion was operated by Nick Gulas, who staged wrestling shows in the Alabama and Tennessee region.&lt;ref name=Kprofile1/&gt;  Eaton's first involvement in the sport came at the age of 13, while attending Chapman Middle School, when he helped set up [[wrestling ring]]s in his hometown.&lt;ref name=interview/&gt; He later trained under [[Tojo Yamamoto]] to become a professional wrestler.&lt;ref name=OWOW/&gt;

===Early career===
In 1976, at the age of 17, Eaton made his debut in NWA Mid-America.  He entered his first match, a loss to Bearcat Wright, as a last-minute substitute for Wright's absent opponent.&lt;ref name=interview/&gt; He quickly became a regular in Mid-America and continued to train with the more experienced wrestlers. Before long, fans, as well as promoter Nick Gulas, noticed Eaton's athleticism and showmanship.  Gulas decided to &quot;promote&quot; Eaton up the ranks of NWA Mid-America, giving him matches later in the show, closer to the main event.&lt;ref name=Kprofile1/&gt; The [[List of professional wrestling terms#A|angle]] that really helped elevate Eaton's name up the [[List of professional wrestling terms#C|card]] in the promotion took place after the introduction of the tag team [[Hollywood Blonds#Buddy Roberts and Jerry Brown|The Hollywood Blonds]] ([[Jerry Brown (wrestler)|Jerry Brown]] and [[Dale Hey|Buddy Roberts]]). Eaton fought the Blonds with a variety of partners, including his old trainer Yamamoto and [[Pez Whatley|&quot;Pistol&quot; Pez Whatley]].&lt;ref name=Kprofile1/&gt; When the Blonds decided to move to a different wrestling promotion, the storyline maintained that Eaton was responsible for driving them out of NWA Mid-America.&lt;ref name=tagbook/&gt;

In 1978, Eaton teamed with [[Lanny Poffo|Leapin' Lanny Poffo]] (brother of the more well-known &quot;Macho Man&quot; Randy Savage), and together they won the [[NWA Mid-America Tag Team Championship]] from Gypsy Joe and [[Junkyard Dog|Leroy Rochester]]. It was Eaton's first title win, and he and Poffo held it for a little over a month. Eaton went on to form a team, known as The Jet Set, with George Gulas, Nick Gulas's son. Together, Eaton and Gulas held the tag team title three&amp;nbsp;times.&lt;ref name=titles&gt;{{cite book|title=Wrestling Title Histories|last=Duncan|first=Royal|coauthors=Will, Gary|publisher=Archeus Communications|edition=4th edition|year=2006|isbn=0-9698161-5-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; During their time as a team, the two were involved in a storyline feud with [[Terry Gordy]] and [[Michael Hayes (wrestler)|Michael Hayes]] before Gordy and Hayes became famous under the name [[Fabulous Freebirds|The Fabulous Freebirds]].&lt;ref name=tagbook/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Pro Wrestling Hall of Fame: The Tag Teams|last=Oliver|first=Greg|coauthors=Johnson, Steve|publisher=ECW Press|year=2005|isbn=978-1-55022-683-6|chapter=The top 20: 7 the Fabulous Freebirds|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Singles competition===
In the spring of 1979, Eaton started a [[Feud (professional wrestling)|feud]] with Chris Colt, designed to establish Eaton as more than just a good tag team competitor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Meltzer|first=Dave|authorlink=Dave Meltzer|coauthors=[[Bret Hart|Hart, Bret]]|title=Tributes II: Remembering More of the Worlds Greatest Wrestlers|publisher=Sports Publishing|year=2004|month=October|isbn=978-1-58261-817-3|quote=Feuding with Gulas's territory-killing son George, and the great worker who carried him, Bobby Eaton.|page=195}}&lt;/ref&gt; The feud between the two was so heated that it saw Colt suspended for [[Piledriver (professional wrestling)|piledriving]] Eaton on the concrete floor, making it appear Eaton had been seriously injured. Eaton suffered no injuries, however. At that time, the piledriver was banned in most federations and treated as a move that could potentially paralyze a wrestler. This was done to give the move more &quot;shock value&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lawler|first=Jerry|authorlink=Jerry Lawler|title=It's good to be the King...Sometimes|year=2002|publisher=World Wrestling Entertainment|isbn=978-0-7434-5768-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eaton conclusively defeated Colt, earning a place as one of the top [[Face (professional wrestling)|faces]] (good guys) in NWA Mid-America.&lt;ref name=Kprofile1/&gt; During 1979 and 1980, Eaton worked a series of singles matches against [[Dennis Condrey]], a man he would later team up with to gain world wide fame.&lt;ref name=tagbook/&gt;

At the end of 1979, Eaton turned [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] (bad guy) for the first time in his career by joining Tojo Yamamoto's group of wrestlers, whom the fans hated. Although Eaton is now thought of mainly as a heel, his fans were surprised at the time. Eaton's heel run did not last long before he rescued his former Jet Set partner, George Gulas, from a two-on-one attack by [[Blond Bombers#Larry Latham and Wayne Farris|The Blond Bombers]] ([[Larry Latham (wrestler)|Larry Latham]] and [[The Honky Tonk Man|Wayne Ferris]]) to return to the fan-favorite side once more. After reuniting the team, Eaton and Gulas had one final run with tag team champions and worked an intense feud with Latham and Ferris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kayfabememories.com/Regions/memphis/memphis-cwa7-2.htm|title=Memphis/CWA #7 Page #2|last=Dills|first=Tim|publisher=Kayfabe Memories|accessdate=2007-02-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Nick Gulas' wrestling promotion closed due to dwindling ticket sales, Eaton briefly wrestled for a promotion in Georgia. Before long Eaton returned closer to home, working for promoter [[Jerry Jarrett]]'s [[Continental Wrestling Association]] (CWA), which was centered in [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. During his early days in the promotion, Eaton faced [[Stan Lane]] several times in tag team competition. Eaton's most successful partnership in the CWA, in terms of title wins, was with Sweet Brown Sugar (later known as [[Koko B. Ware]]), nicknamed &quot;the New Wave&quot;. The two wrestlers blended their athleticism and high flying abilities to form a very successful team. The New Wave held the [[AWA Southern Tag Team Championship]] three times (twice with manager [[Jimmy Hart]] in their corner).&lt;ref name=titles/&gt; After achieving success as a tag team, it was decided that Eaton and Sugar should split up and feud with each other. This storyline resulted in Eaton &quot;forcing&quot; Sugar out of the promotion after he won a [[Professional wrestling match types#Loser Leaves Town match|&quot;Losers Leaves Town&quot; match]] against Sugar.&lt;ref name=memphis-10-2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kayfabememories.com/Regions/memphis/memphis-cwa10-2.htm|title=Memphis/CWA #10 Page #2|last=Dills|first=Tim|publisher=Kayfabe Memories|accessdate=2007-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sugar's disappearance was soon followed by the appearance of a masked man called Stagger Lee, who looked and wrestled like Sugar. The storyline of Sugar returning under the mask to fight the heels helped make the masked man instantly popular with the crowd. Eaton, along with the rest of Jimmy Hart's [[List of professional wrestling terms#S|stable]] &quot;the First Family&quot;, tried in vain to unmask Stagger Lee.&lt;ref name=memphis-10-2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kayfabememories.com/Wrestlers/WLeaton-2.htm|title=Bobby Eaton Page 2|last=Dills|first=Tim|publisher=Kayfabe Memories|accessdate=2007-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eaton turned face and re-teamed with Sugar, although they maintained the storyline that Eaton's partner was actually &quot;Stagger Lee&quot; and not Sugar. The team regained the tag team title before losing it to [[The Fabulous Ones]] ([[Stan Lane]] and [[Steve Keirn]]).&lt;ref name=titles/&gt; Afterward, Eaton teamed up with [[Moondogs|The Moondogs]] ([[Randy Colley|Rex]] and [[Larry Latham (wrestler)|King]]) to face [[Jerry Lawler]] and the Fabulous Ones. During the match, one of the Moondogs accidentally hit Eaton with their trademark bone, costing their side the match. After the match ended, the Moondogs, as well as Jimmy Hart, turned on Eaton, beating him down until he was saved by Stagger Lee.&lt;ref name=Kprofile1/&gt;

===The Midnight Express===
{{Main|The Midnight Express (professional wrestling)}}
Soon after Eaton joined [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Bill Watts)#Mid-South Wrestling|Mid-South Wrestling]] under promoter [[Bill Watts]], he became part of the Midnight Express. Eaton teamed with former rival Dennis Condrey under the management of [[Jim Cornette]] to form a new version of the tag team. The Express had previously been a group of wrestlers consisting of Condrey, [[Randy Rose]] and [[Norvell Austin]], but with Eaton's arrival, the Midnight Express  worked exclusively as a two man team.&lt;ref name=tagbook/&gt; To complement the nickname &quot;Lover Boy&quot; Dennis, Eaton was nicknamed &quot;Beautiful&quot; Bobby, a nickname he still uses when wrestling. At first, The Express was booked in an [[List of professional wrestling terms#A|angle]] with the [[UWF Tag Team Championship|Mid-South Tag Team Champions]] [[Magnum T.A.]] and [[Mr. Wrestling II]]. The highlight of the angle saw Eaton and Condrey [[tarring and feathering]] Magnum T.A. in the middle of the ring. The Express first won the tag team title when Mr. Wrestling II turned on Magnum T.A., attacking him during the title match and allowing Eaton and Condrey to win the title without much opposition.&lt;ref name=titles/&gt;

With Mr. Wrestling II and Magnum T.A. splitting up, the Midnight Express needed a new team to defend their newly won title against. They began a long series of matches against [[The Rock 'n' Roll Express]] ([[Ricky Morton]] and [[Reuben Kane|Robert Gibson]]) which ran well into the 1990s and spanned several wrestling promotions.&lt;ref name=tagbook/&gt; The two teams feuded throughout 1984 in Mid-South Wrestling before the Midnight Express left the promotion. The Midnight Express versus Rock 'n' Roll Express series of matches were so well received by the fans that independent promoters all over the United States still book those two teams against each other today, 20 years after the rivalry started.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Watts|first=Bill|authorlink=Bill Watts|coauthors=Williams, Scott|title=The Cowboy and the Cross: The Bill Watts Story: Rebellion, Wrestling and Redemption|date=2006-01-15|publisher=ECW Press|isbn=978-1-55022-708-6|quote=Bill was the first to promote The Midnight Express – The Rock &amp; Roll Express rivalry that would define tag team wrestling in the decade and that would make such an impression that the independent promoters would still be booking the match twenty years later.|page=XIV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Midnight Express had a short stay in [[World Class Championship Wrestling]] in [[Texas]], where they feuded mainly with The [[Fantastics]] ([[James Hines|Bobby Fulton]] and [[Thomas Couch|Tommy Rogers]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/misc/wccw/parade.html#85|title=2nd Von Erich Memorial Parade of Champions|publisher=Pro Wrestling History|accessdate=2007-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===National spotlight===
In 1985 Eaton, Condrey and Cornette signed with [[Jim Crockett Promotions]] (JCP) and were given national exposure on JCP's televised programs on [[TBS (TV network)|SuperStation TBS]].&lt;ref name=tagbook/&gt; Shortly after joining JCP, the Midnight Express reignited their feud with the Rock 'n' Roll Express and won the [[WCW World Tag Team Championship|NWA World Tag team title]] from them in February 1986. During the course of their heated angle, Eaton and Condrey lost the title back to the Rock 'n' Roll Express six months later.&lt;ref name=titles/&gt;  Eaton and Condrey also had long running feuds with [[New Breed (tag team)|The New Breed]] ([[Christopher Ashford-Smith|Chris Champion]] and [[Sean Royal]]) as well as [[Road Warriors|The Road Warriors]] ([[Road Warrior Animal|Animal]] and [[Road Warrior Hawk|Hawk]]). The feud with the Road Warriors included a high profile [[Professional wrestling match types#Scaffold match|Scaffold match]] at [[Starrcade#1986|Starrcade 1986]], which the Midnight Express lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/starrcad.html#86|title=Starrcade 1986|publisher=Pro Wrestling History|accessdate=2007-02-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1987, Condrey left JCP for undisclosed reasons, and &quot;Sweet&quot; Stan Lane took his place as part of the Midnight Express.&lt;ref name=tagbook/&gt; In May 1987, after teaming for only a few months, Eaton and Lane became champions when they won the [[WCW United States Tag Team Championship|NWA United States Tag team title]] for the first time, a title they would win three times during their time together.&lt;ref name=titles/&gt; A year later the team was cheered on despite being heels, as the Midnight Express won the NWA World Tag Team Title from [[Arn Anderson]] and [[Tully Blanchard]] on September 10, 1988. Unfortunately this potentially classic feud was cut short when Anderson &amp; Blanchard signed with the WWF over money issues. The Midnight Express' run with the title lasted a little over a month-and-a-half before the Road Warriors took the gold from them in a brutal match up, which saw the heel Road Warriors brutalize the now-popular Midnight Express.&lt;ref name=titles/&gt;

Now the fan favorites, the Midnight Express had to contend with a team thought to be disbanded forever: The Midnight Express. &quot;The Original Midnight Express&quot; consisted of Dennis Condrey and Randy Rose, who had been previously teaming together under the Midnight Express name in the [[American Wrestling Alliance|AWA]]. The duo was led by long-time Jim Cornette nemesis [[Paul Heyman|Paul E. Dangerously]], in a storyline that saw them trying to prove the originals were better than the new version. The surprise appearance of the Original Midnight Express gave Dangerously's team the initial momentum in the feud, but soon after, Condrey left the promotion once more. This forced the bookers to bring in [[Jack Victory]] as a replacement as Condrey's disappearance cut the promising feud short.&lt;ref name=tagbook/&gt;

The Midnight Express then turned their attention to Paul E.'s new team, The [[Headshrinkers|Samoan S.W.A.T. Team]] as well as a new version of the [[Fabulous Freebirds]]. Eaton and Lane were defeated by the Freebirds in the finals of a tournament for the vacated World Tag Team Titles. Following this loss, the Midnight Express teamed with their former enemies The Road Warriors and [[&quot;Dr. Death&quot; Steve Williams]] to defeat the SST and the Freebirds in a [[WarGames match]] at the [[Great American Bash]]. Following this feud, Lane and Eaton began having issues with a young new team in the NWA known as &quot;the Dynamic Dudes&quot; ([[Shane Douglas]] and [[Johnny Ace]]). The Dudes admitted that the Midnight Express was one of their favorite teams and asked if Cornette would be their manager as well. Cornette agreed to manage the young team, to the displeasure of the Midnight Express. After arguing with the Express, Jim Cornette stopped accompanying Eaton and Lane to the ring, choosing to only actively manage the Dudes. At the [[Clash of the Champions#Class of the Champions IX: New York Knockout|Clash of Champions IX]], the two teams met with Jim Cornette appearing in a neutral corner, forced to choose between the teams. The Express started out very aggressively, especially for a team that was supposed to be fan favorites, and when the night was over, the Midnight Express had once again established themselves as heels with Jim Cornette in their corner; Cornette had never stopped siding with the Express.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/clash.html#IX|title=Clash of the Champions IX|publisher=Pro Wrestling History|accessdate=2007-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After returning to their cheating ways, the Midnight Express started a storyline with the up and coming team of [[Brian Pillman|Flyin' Brian]] and [[Tom Zenk|&quot;Z-Man&quot; Tom Zenk]] over the United States Tag team title. The Express won the title from the young team in early 1990, but lost the belts to [[The Steiner Brothers]] ([[Rick Steiner|Rick]] and [[Scott Steiner|Scott]]) three months later.&lt;ref name=titles/&gt; After a loss at the WCW pay-per-view [[Halloween Havoc#1990|Halloween Havoc 1990]], the Midnight Express split up, as Jim Cornette and Stan Lane left the federation, while Eaton chose to remain in WCW.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/havoc.html#90|title=Halloween Havoc 1990|publisher=Pro Wrestling History|accessdate=2007-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the first time in almost a decade, there was no Midnight Express.&lt;ref name=tagbook/&gt;

===Dangerous Alliance===
{{Main|Dangerous Alliance}}
For the first time since 1979, Eaton was a singles competitor, and he faced an uphill struggle to establish himself. He wrestled his former opponents in tag team competition such as Brad Armstrong, Ricky Morton and &quot;Z-Man&quot; Tom Zenk, but it was not until he turned face during the early parts of 1991 that he started to move up the rankings. At [[SuperBrawl#SuperBrawl I|SuperBrawl I]], Eaton defeated Arn Anderson to win the [[WCW World Television Championship]].&lt;ref name=titles/&gt; Eaton's highest profile match as a singles wrestler came when he faced off against [[WCW World Heavyweight Championship|WCW World Champion]] [[Ric Flair|&quot;Nature Boy&quot; Ric Flair]] at [[Clash of the Champions#Clash of the Champions XV|Clash of the Champions XV]] in a [[Two out of three falls match|two-out-of-three falls match]]. Eaton pinned Flair in the first fall, but ultimately lost to Flair two falls to one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/clash.html#XV|title=Clash of the Champions XV|publisher=Pro Wrestling History|accessdate=2007-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; His TV Title reign was short-lived, as he came face to face with newcomer [[Stone Cold Steve Austin|&quot;Stunning&quot; Steve Austin]], who cheated his way to win the title from Eaton.&lt;ref name=titles/&gt; After dropping out of the Television Title picture, Eaton went on to feud with [[York Foundation|The York Foundation]] until Paul E. Dangerously reappeared in WCW.

Late in 1991, Paul E. Dangerously formed the [[List of professional wrestling terms#S|faction]] [[Dangerous Alliance|The Dangerous Alliance]], where Eaton was joined with Arn Anderson, Steve Austin, [[Rick Rude]] and [[Larry Zbyszko]]. In what seems to be a recurring pattern in Eaton's career, he again teamed up with a former opponent, this time Arn Anderson. Because both Anderson and Eaton had primarily worked as tag team wrestlers, teaming came naturally to them.&lt;ref name=tagbook/&gt; They soon won the WCW World Tag Team Title, defeating [[Ricky Steamboat]] and [[Dustin Rhodes]] for the championship and holding on to the belts for five months before they lost them to the Steiner Brothers.&lt;ref name=titles/&gt;

The Dangerous Alliance was a dominant force in WCW. At one point during 1992, they held every title except the WCW World Title, which was held by their main opponent and arch enemy [[Steve Borden|Sting]]. The war between the Dangerous Alliance and Sting and friends escalated until it was decided to settle it in a double ring [[WarGames match|War Games Match]] at [[WrestleWar#1992|WrestleWar 1992]]. Sting's team won when Sting forced Eaton to give up after Larry Zbyszko accidentally struck Eaton in the arm with a metal rod.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/w-war.html#92|title= WrestleWar 1992|publisher=Pro Wrestling History|accessdate=2007-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; This match would be given a [[Dave Meltzer#Rating system|5-star rating]] from [[Dave Meltzer]] of the ''Wrestling Observer Newsletter''.

In the aftermath of the War Games match, Zbyszko was kicked out of the Alliance for causing the Alliance loss. Soon after the Alliance disintegrated, Paul E. Dangerously left WCW. Eaton and Anderson continued to team after the Alliance fell apart, now managed by Michael Hayes. Eaton and Anderson worked in the tag team division until new WCW booker Bill Watts fired Eaton along with a number of other WCW regulars in a cost-cutting measure.&lt;ref name=interview/&gt;

===Departure and return===
When Eaton found himself without a job, he reached out to former manager Jim Cornette. Cornette had started his own wrestling federation, [[Smoky Mountain Wrestling]] (SMW) and welcomed Eaton with open arms. Eaton joined up with &quot;[[The Heavenly Bodies]]&quot; (Stan Lane and [[Tom Prichard]]), and the three were booked as the top heels of the federation for a while. Eaton also won the federation's version of the TV title, known as the [[SMW Beat the Champ Television Championship]].&lt;ref name=titles/&gt;

When Bill Watts was ousted from his position in WCW in favor of [[Eric Bischoff]], Eaton was rehired. Once back on the roster, Eaton teamed up with a young [[Chris Benoit]] in Benoit's first stint with WCW. Together they were mainly used to help establish rising teams or give established teams opposition. Benoit and Eaton, while gelling in the ring, never showed any signs of being presented as a permanent team; they did not have matching ring outfits or a team name.&lt;ref name=Kprofile2&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.kayfabememories.com/Wrestlers/WLeaton-2.htm|title=Bobby Eaton (2)|publisher=Kayfabe Memories|last=Dills|first=Tim| accessdate=2007-02-19|quote=&quot;Eaton paired up some with Chris Benoit but WCW never pushed them much as a team&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Benoit left to return to Japan, in Eaton's next venture in tag teaming, under the name &quot;Bad Attitude&quot;, he teamed up with Steve Keirn, formerly of the Fabulous Ones. Bad Attitude's single noteworthy moment together came when they were present as Arn Anderson turned on tag team partner Dustin Rhodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/wcw94.htm|title=WCW 1994|publisher=The History of WWE|accessdate=2007-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Otherwise, the team did not get much exposure.

During this time, Eaton also made a couple of appearances in ECW due to a talent trade arrangement between WCW and ECW. His most well known appearance was at the &quot;When Worlds Collide&quot; show on May 14, 1994, where he teamed with [[Terry Brunk|Sabu]] to beat Arn Anderson and [[Terry Funk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/ecw/results/1994b.html#051494|title=When Worlds Collide|publisher=Pro Wrestling History|accessdate=2007-02-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Blue Blood===
{{Main|The Blue Bloods}}
After Bad Attitude quietly ended, Eaton was placed with British snob [[Darren Matthews|&quot;Lord&quot; Steven Regal]]. A series of [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Vignette|vignettes]] followed, in which Regal educated Eaton on how to be a man of class and sophistication&lt;ref name=interview/&gt;. Eaton was then shown being knighted as &quot;[[Earl]] Robert Eaton&quot; by the (supposed) Queen of England on [[WCW Main Event]], April 2nd 1995. The team made their ring debut, dubbed [[The Blue Bloods]], on [[WCW Saturday Night]], April 8th 1995. The duo was later joined by &quot;[[Squire]]&quot; [[Dave Taylor (wrestler)|David Taylor]], with all three alternating in the ring under the name of the Blue Bloods. (Originally, it was supposed to be a tag team consisting of Regal and [[Triple H|Jean-Paul Levesque]], with [[Sherri Martel]] as their valet, but Martel had since managed [[Harlem Heat]], and Levesque had left for the WWF).

The Blue Bloods initially feuded with [[the Nasty Boys]] ([[Brian Knobbs]] and [[Jerry Sags]]), their complete opposites in terms of &quot;sophistication&quot; and presentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/gabash.html#95|title=The Great American Bash 1995|publisher=Pro Wrestling History|accessdate=2007-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BATB&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/beach.html#95|title=Bash at the Beach 1995|publisher=Pro Wrestling History|accessdate=2007-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also feuded with [[Harlem Heat]] ([[Booker Huffman|Booker T]] and [[Lane Huffman|Stevie Ray]]) over the [[WCW World Tag Team Championship]], but never took the belts,&lt;ref name=BATB/&gt; and engaged in a short &quot;Snobs versus Rednecks&quot; program with [[Stud Stable|the Stud Stable]] ([[Jimmy Golden|Bunkhouse Buck]] and [[Dick Slater]]). In all of 1996 the team members made only one [[pay-per-view]] (PPV) appearance, as individuals in the &quot;Lethal Lottery&quot; during May's [[Slamboree#1996|Slamboree]]. The next year &quot;Lord&quot; Steven Regal became [[WCW World Television Championship|WCW World Television Champion]], but the team only appeared on PPV once together, when Regal and Taylor lost to the Steiner Brothers at [[WCW World War 3#1997|World War 3]] in November.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/ww3.html#97 |title=World War 3 1997|publisher=Pro Wrestling History|accessdate=2007-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not long after, Eaton was moved out of the group, [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Turn|turning on]] and feuding with his partners after finally rejecting the snob nature of the [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Gimmick|gimmick]].

The Blue Bloods storyline represented the last serious [[Push (professional wrestling)|push]] that Eaton was given by the WCW booking team. After the run with Regal and Taylor ended, Eaton wrestled mainly on WCW's weekend show, ''[[WCW Saturday Night]]'', occasionally winning against wrestlers low in the rankings and losing to wrestlers above him. He also became a trainer at the [[WCW Power Plant]] and worked backstage for WCW as a [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Agent|road agent]] until he was released in the closing months of the company in 2000.

===Post-WCW===
In 2003, Eaton worked for NWA Mid-Atlantic, forming a new version of the Midnight Express with Ricky Nelson. This Midnight Express version was very short lived, and Eaton instead began touring with Dennis Condrey (and sometimes Stan Lane) as the Midnight Express. This version of the Midnight Express still performs together on select independent wrestling cards in the United States.&lt;ref name=OWOW/&gt;

Eaton made a one night only appearance for [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]] on August 13, 2003, as a part of a [[Kid Kash]] storyline where Kash faced off against a series of 1980s wrestling stars such as Larry Zbyszko and Ricky Morton. Eaton lost to Kid Kash in his only TNA appearance to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/tna/030813.html|title=TNA Results: August 13, 2003|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=2008-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eaton is still competing on the independent wrestling circuit, taking select bookings, mainly in the United States.&lt;ref name=OWOW/&gt;

==Personal life==
Although Eaton has wrestled as a heel for most of his career, he is regarded as one of the nicest guys in the wrestling business. In his 1999 book ''[[Have a Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks|Have a Nice Day]]'', Mick Foley praised Eaton as being at once one of the most underrated superstars in the business, and its nicest, commenting that &quot;it was damn near impossible to pay for anything with Bobby around, though I will confess to not trying that hard&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Foley|first=Mick|authorlink=Mick Foley|title=Have a Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks|publisher=Regan Books|year=1999|isbn=0-06-039299-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This opinion was supported in ''The Stone Cold Truth'' by Steve Austin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Austin|first=Steve|authorlink=Stone Cold Steve Austin|coauthors=[[Jim Ross|Ross, Jim]]; Brent, Dennis|title=The Stone Cold Truth|publisher=Pocket Books|year=2003|isbn=0-7434-7720-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to his personality, he is also popular with other wrestlers due to his wrestling style. Wrestling Eaton is known as &quot;a night off&quot;, because Eaton is so skilled that the action looks very convincing but does not hurt the opponent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Austin|first=Steve|authorlink=Stone Cold Steve Austin |coauthors=[[Jim Ross|Ross, Jim]]; Brent, Dennis|title=The Stone Cold Truth|publisher=Pocket Books|year=2003|isbn=0-7434-7720-0|pages=94–95|quote=But he had incredible timing. He couldn't explain it, but it was a pleasure and an education going out there and working with him.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eaton is married to [[William Crookshanks|Bill Dundee]]'s daughter, Donna. When they first started dating, they had to keep the relationship secret from her father, as her father had forbidden her from dating the wrestlers he was booking. When Dundee found out she was dating Eaton, he relented because Eaton was such a nice guy.&lt;ref name=interview/&gt; Eaton and Donna have three children: Dustin, Dylan, and Taryn.  Dylan is a professional wrestler.&lt;ref name=interview&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ddtdigest.com/features/eaton.htm|title=An Exclusive interview with Bobby Eaton|publisher=DDT Digest|accessdate=2007-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 6, 2006 Dave Meltzer reported that Eaton was hospitalized after suffering a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]].&lt;ref name=OWOW/&gt; Two days later, after being released from the hospital, Eaton released a statement through the Wrestling Observer website saying that he did not have a heart attack but was diagnosed with high blood pressure with a hint of diabetes.&lt;ref name=OWOW/&gt;
