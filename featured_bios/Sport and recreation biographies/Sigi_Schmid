'''Siegfried &quot;Sigi&quot; Schmid''' (born March 20, 1953) is a [[German-American]] [[association football|soccer]] [[Manager (football)|coach]].  Born in [[Tübingen]], West Germany, he moved to the United States with his family when he was a child. He played college soccer from 1972 to 1975 at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]]&amp;nbsp;(UCLA), where he was a starting [[Midfielder (association football)|midfielder]] in each of his four years. He coached his former college team, the [[UCLA Bruins]], between 1980 and 1999. During that period, he became one of the most successful collegiate coaches of all time, leading the Bruins to a record of 322–63–33&amp;nbsp;(wins–losses–draws). The team made 16 consecutive playoff appearances from 1983 to 1998, winning the [[NCAA Men's Division I Soccer Championship|national championship]] in 1985, 1990, and 1997. Schmid also worked with [[United States Soccer Federation|US Soccer]] throughout the 1990s. 

Schmid has coached the [[Los Angeles Galaxy]] and the [[Columbus Crew]] in [[Major League Soccer]]&amp;nbsp;(MLS). He became the head coach of [[Seattle Sounders FC]] in 2009. Despite never having played soccer at a professional level, he has the most coaching wins in MLS history, and was the recipient of the [[MLS Coach of the Year Award]] in 1999 and 2008. Throughout his career, Schmid has received praise from critics for his ability to identify new talent. His defensive tactics are also highly regarded in the press and often cited as a factor in his success. However, their deployment in his final two seasons with Los Angeles led directly to the termination of his contract.

With a [[Bachelor of Economics]] degree from UCLA and a [[Master of Business Administration]] degree from the [[University of Southern California]], he was a [[Certified Public Accountant]]&amp;nbsp;(CPA) before coaching full-time. Schmid and his wife have four children, and he has a younger brother.

The Crew's performance improved remarkably in the [[2008 Major League Soccer season|2008 season]].

Former Sounders FC midfielder [[Peter Vagenas]] has known Schmid since 1995, and he has said that Schmid has evolved as a coach and has become easier to play for. He also told ''[[The Seattle Times]]'': &quot;A lot of coaches talk the talk but don't necessarily walk the walk, and there's nobody that works harder than he does.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;romero200910&quot;/&gt;

After two and a half seasons with the Sounders, Schmid signed a long-term contract extension on July 14, 2011 which could keep him in Seattle through the 2015 MLS season.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.soundersfc.com/News/Articles/2011/07-July/Schmid-signs-extension.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; The extension is dependent on some club options and performance triggers. Although some fans had become frustrated with what they saw as tactical inflexibility and mismanagement of players, general manager [[Adrian Hanauer]] praised Schmid's professionalism and success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sounderatheart.com/2011/7/14/2275876/sigi-schmid-signs-contract-extension-seattle-sounders-2015 | title=Sigi Schmid Signs Contract Extension Could Be With Seattle Sounders Until 2015 | publisher=Sounder at Heart | date=Jul 14, 2011 | accessdate=July 16, 2011 | author=Oshan, Jeremiah}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://sounders.sportspressnw.com/2011/07/15/holmes-despite-critics-schmid-gets-extension/ | title=Holmes: Despite Critics, Schmid Gets Extension | publisher=Sportspress Northwest | date=July 15, 2011 | accessdate=July 16, 2011 | author=Holmes, Stanley}}&lt;/ref&gt; The year ended with the Sounders winning a third consecutive [[2011 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup Final|US Open Cup]], advancing to the knock-out stages of the [[2011–12 CONCACAF Champions League|CONCACAF Champions League]], and an 18–7–9 regular season record.
