'''Arthur Robert Morris''' [[MBE]] (born 19 January 1922) is a former [[Australian]] [[cricketer]] who played 46 [[Test cricket|Test matches]] between 1946 and 1955. An [[batting order (cricket)|opener]], Morris is regarded as one of Australia's greatest left-handed batsmen. He is best known for his key role in [[Don Bradman]]'s ''[[The Invincibles (cricket)|Invincibles]]'' side, which made an undefeated tour of [[England]] in 1948. He was the leading scorer in the Tests on the tour, with three [[Century (cricket)|centuries]]. His efforts in the Fourth Test at [[Headingley Stadium|Headingley]] helped Australia to reach a world record victory target of 404 on the final day. Morris was named in the [[Australian Cricket Board]]'s [[Australian Cricket Board Team of the Century|Team of the Century]] in 2000 and was inducted into the [[Australian Cricket Hall of Fame]] in 2001.

In his youth, Morris excelled at [[rugby league]] as well as cricket, being selected for the state schoolboys' team in both sports. Originally trained in [[spin bowling]], Morris developed as a batsman during his teens and during the 1940–41 season became the first player in the world to score two centuries on his [[First-class cricket|first-class]] debut. His career was interrupted by the [[World War II|Second World War]], during which he served in the [[Australian Imperial Force|Australian Army]] and gained selection in its rugby league team. Upon the resumption of cricket in 1946, Morris made his Test debut against [[England cricket team|England]] and quickly made himself a core member of the team. He made a century in his third match and scored twin centuries in the following Test, becoming only the second Australian to do so in an [[The Ashes|Ashes Test]]. His rise was such that he was made a selector during the ''Invincibles'' tour after only 18 months in the team. 

After the 4–0 series win over England, which was Bradman's farewell series, Morris became Australia's vice-captain and was expected to be its leading batsman. He started well, scoring two centuries during Australia's first series in the post-Bradman era, a tour to [[South Africa]] that saw Australia win the Test series 4–0. By the end of the South African tour, Morris had amassed nine Test centuries and his [[batting average]] was over 65, but thereafter his form declined. Australia increasingly fell on hard times as the core of Bradman's team aged and retired. Morris was overlooked for the captaincy and then briefly dropped as his cricketing prowess waned. His career ended after his first wife became terminally ill. In later life Morris served as a trustee of the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]] for over twenty years.

== Early years ==
The son of a schoolteacher who played for [[Waverley Cricket Club]] in Sydney as a fast bowler, Morris was born in 1922 in the Sydney seaside suburb of [[Bondi, New South Wales|Bondi]] and spent his early years in the city. His family moved when he was five to [[Dungog]], then to [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]] before returning to Sydney in the suburb of [[Beverly Hills, New South Wales|Beverly Hills]]. By this time, Morris' parents had separated.&lt;ref name=&quot;b early&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=r212&gt;Robinson, p. 212.&lt;/ref&gt;

His father encouraged him to play sport and he showed promise in a variety of ball sports, particularly cricket, rugby and tennis. Aged 12, he gained a place as a slow bowler for [[Newcastle Boys High School]]'s cricket team.&lt;ref&gt;Chad Watson, &quot;School reunion - Newcastle Boys' High.&quot; The Newcastle Herald, 17 August 2002, p 5&lt;/ref&gt; On Saturday afternoons he played for Blackwall, a team in the local C-grade competition.&lt;!--is that an actual ranking?--&gt;&lt;!-- yes, third division --&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;b early&quot;&gt;Perry (2001), pp. 76–79.&lt;/ref&gt; Morris attended [[Canterbury Boys' High School]] from 1936 to 1939 where he represented the school at cricket and rugby league, and was appointed [[School Captain|school captain]] (head boy) in Year 11.&lt;ref name=&quot;b early&quot; /&gt; 

In his last two years of high school, he was selected for Combined High Schools teams in both cricket—as captain in both years—and rugby.&lt;ref name=r212/&gt;&lt;ref name=b_early/&gt; At the age of 14, he made his debut for [[St George Cricket Club|St George]], and in 1937–38 he was elevated to the second XI. In a club under-16 competition, the A W Green Shield, Morris took 55 wickets at 5.23, which remains a record.&lt;ref name=&quot;b early&quot; /&gt; The following year he was selected for the team as a batsman, after captain [[Bill O'Reilly (cricketer)|Bill O'Reilly]] decided that his [[left arm unorthodox spin]] had less potential. O'Reilly described him as &quot;moderately skilled&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;b early&quot; /&gt; in bowling and noted that he would not have many opportunities with the ball as future Test bowling world record holder [[Ray Lindwall]] was also in the team. &lt;!-- this is odd - presumably Lindwall was bowling fast and Morris was slow --&gt; O'Reilly quickly moved Morris up to the No. 6 position in the batting order. After scoring a century against [[Sydney University]], O'Reilly moved him into the opening position without prior notice, where he remained.&lt;ref name=&quot;b early&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=r212/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;wisden&quot; /&gt; 

While still at high school, Morris was selected to play for the New South Wales Second XI against [[Victoria (state)|Victoria]] in January 1939,&lt;ref name=wisden/&gt;&lt;ref name=o/&gt; his first taste of representative cricket.&lt;ref name=&quot;wisden&quot; /&gt; However, Morris made only six and three and did not gain further honours.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; After finishing his secondary education at the end of 1939, Morris became a clerk in the Prosecutions Branch at [[Sydney Town Hall]]. He was chosen to make his debut, aged 18, for [[New South Wales Blues|New South Wales]] against [[Queensland Bulls|Queensland]] at the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]] in the 1940–41 [[Sheffield Shield]] season. He scored centuries in both [[Innings (cricket)|innings]], becoming the first player in the world to achieve the feat on debut.&lt;ref name=r212/&gt;&lt;ref name=az/&gt; Morris made 148 in the first innings and participated in a second wicket partnership of 261 with [[Sid Barnes]]; he added 111 in the second innings, completing his feat on 28 December.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/17/17294.html |title=New South Wales v Queensland |accessdate=15 November 2010 |publisher=[[CricketArchive]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He gave chances that were dropped early in both innings, but impressed observers with his ability to remain settled.&lt;ref name=&quot;b early&quot; /&gt; New South Wales went on to win by 404 runs.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; He was unable to maintain the standard of his debut in later performances, but finished the war-shortened season with 385 runs at a strong average of 55.14 in four matches.&lt;ref name=&quot;wisden&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title= Wisden 1949 – Arthur Morris |url=http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/234445.html| year= 1949 |accessdate=21 May 2007| publisher= [[Wisden]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=o/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;az&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Cashman, Franks, Maxwell, Sainsbury, Stoddart, Weaver, Webster | year = 1997 | title = The A-Z of Australian cricketers|pages =215–216}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Second World War and Test debut ==
[[Image:Morris drive.JPG|thumb|left|Morris plays a cover drive in the [[Cricket nets|practice nets]].]]
Morris' first-class cricket career was interrupted by the [[World War II|Second World War]], when domestic matches were cancelled at the end of the season. On 5 January 1943, he enlisted in the [[Second Australian Imperial Force|Australian Imperial Force]], and served in the [[South West Pacific theatre of World War II|South West Pacific]], mostly in [[New Guinea]] with the 8th Movement Control Group, part of the [[Royal Australian Corps of Transport]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/script/veteran.asp?ServiceID=A&amp;VeteranID=250243| title= WW2 Nominal Roll, &quot;MORRIS, ARTHUR ROBERT&quot; |publisher=[[Government of Australia]] |accessdate=12 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p early&quot;&gt;Perry (2000), p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt; During his time in the army, Morris spent more time playing rugby league than cricket. The coach of the Army and Combined Services rugby team, Johnny Wallace, regarded him as the &quot;best [[Rugby league positions|five eighth]] in Australia&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;b early&quot; /&gt; He remained a [[Private (rank)|Private]] throughout his military service and was [[Demobilization|demobb]]ed on 18 June 1946. Despite his eligibility, Morris was not selected for the [[Australian Services XI]] in 1945, something that baffled commentators,&lt;ref name=&quot;b early&quot; /&gt; although he did play a one-off military match in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;Derriman, p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt;

He returned to his pre-war clerical job at the [[Sydney Town Hall]], but soon switched to a job with motor parts distributor Stack &amp; Company, which allowed him more time for cricket commitments.&lt;ref name=&quot;b early&quot; /&gt; Morris was automatically restored to the Sheffield Shield team in 1946–47 upon the resumption of competition. He made 27 and 98 in his first match against [[Queensland Bulls|Queensland]],&lt;ref name=o/&gt; and was selected for an Australian XI match against [[Wally Hammond]]'s [[MCC tour of Australia in 1946–47|tourng MCC team]] when first-choice opener [[Bill Brown (cricketer)|Bill Brown]] was injured. In what was effectively a trial for the Test team, Morris scored 115 and featured in a 196-run partnership with Test captain [[Don Bradman]], who scored 106.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p early&quot; /&gt; It was the beginnings of a productive cricketing relationship. Morris said of Bradman: &quot;He was marvellous. If you had a problem, you could go to him and sort it out. I found him relaxed and straightforward&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;b testdebut&quot;&gt;Perry (2001), pp. 80–84.&lt;/ref&gt; 

After scoring 81 for New South Wales in his next match, against the MCC,&lt;ref name=o/&gt; Morris was selected to make his Test debut in the [[1946-47 Ashes series#First Test – Brisbane|First Test against England in Brisbane]].&lt;ref name=o/&gt;&lt;ref name=testlist/&gt; He failed in his first two Tests, managing just two and five, although Australia won both matches by an innings.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; Despite being criticised for having a &quot;loose technique&quot; by [[Neville Cardus]],&lt;ref name=&quot;p early&quot; /&gt; Bradman advised Morris to stick to his approach.&lt;ref name=&quot;p early&quot; /&gt; Morris responded by scoring 83 and 110 in the traditional pre-Christmas match between New South Wales and [[Victorian Bushrangers|Victoria]] at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]], the top score in both innings.&lt;ref name=b_testdebut/&gt; However, he was unable to prevent an innings defeat.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; He was retained for the [[1946-47 Ashes series#Third Test – Melbourne|Third Test in Melbourne]], but made only 21 in the first innings. If he had failed a fourth time, it could have allowed another player to claim his position,&lt;ref name=&quot;b testdebut&quot; /&gt; but Morris secured his place with his maiden Test century, scoring 155 in the second innings,&lt;ref name=b_testdebut/&gt; and making the most of an ideal batting surface.&lt;ref&gt;Piesse, p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt; After defending stoutly at the beginning of the innings, Morris accelerated his scoring, employing a wide range of strokes to reach 150 in six hours.&lt;ref name=&quot;b testdebut&quot; /&gt; 

Morris managed a century in each innings of the [[1946-47 Ashes series#Fourth Test – Adelaide|Fourth Test at Adelaide]], making 122 and 124 [[not out]] in extremely hot weather. This made him the second Australian after [[Warren Bardsley]] to score two centuries in one Ashes Test.&lt;ref name=&quot;wisden&quot; /&gt; With Australia having fallen to [[Cricket_score#Referring_to_scores|2/24]]&lt;ref&gt;wickets lost/runs scored&lt;/ref&gt; at the end of play on the second day in response to England's first innings score of 460, Morris combined with [[Lindsay Hassett]], who scored 78, to lead a recovery. After England's [[Denis Compton]] scored his second century of the match in the second innings, Morris put in another determined effort to ensure a draw. With the match secure, Morris played more aggressively towards the end in an [[not out|unbeaten]] 99-run partnership with Bradman.&lt;ref name=&quot;b testdebut&quot; /&gt; Ahead of the final Test, Morris made 44 and 47 for New South Wales in a drawn match against Hammond's men.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; He made 57 in the [[1946-47 Ashes series#Fifth Test – Sydney|Fifth Test in Sydney]] to end the series with an aggregate of 503 runs, at an average of 71.85,&lt;ref name=&quot;az&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;testlist&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Statsguru – AR Morris – Tests – Innings by innings list| url=http://statserver.cricket.org/guru?sdb=player;playerid=760;class=testplayer;filter=basic;team=0;opposition=0;notopposition=0;season=0;homeaway=0;continent=0;country=0;notcountry=0;groundid=0;startdefault=1946-11-29;start=1946-11-29;enddefault=1955-06-17;end=1955-06-17;tourneyid=0;finals=0;daynight=0;toss=0;scheduledovers=0;scheduleddays=0;innings=0;result=0;followon=0;seriesresult=0;captain=0;keeper=0;dnp=0;recent=;viewtype=aro_list;runslow=;runshigh=;batposition=0;dismissal=0;bowposition=0;ballslow=;ballshigh=;bpof=0;overslow=;overshigh=;conclow=;conchigh=;wicketslow=;wicketshigh=;dismissalslow=;dismissalshigh=;caughtlow=;caughthigh=;caughttype=0;stumpedlow=;stumpedhigh=;csearch=;submit=1;.cgifields=viewtype| accessdate = 16 July 2007| publisher=[[Cricinfo]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; second only to Bradman.&lt;ref&gt;Piesse, p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt; He ended his first full first-class season with 1234 runs at 68.55, partnering [[Sid Barnes]] at the top of the order at both state and international level.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; [[E.W.

Morris started the 1947–48 Australian season strongly, scoring 162 in his second match as New South Wales crushed the touring [[Indian cricket team|Indians]] by an innings ahead of the Tests.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; He played in the first four Tests, scoring 45 and an unbeaten 100 in the Third Test victory in [[Melbourne]].&lt;ref name=testlist/&gt;&lt;ref name=auslist/&gt; In that match, he dropped down the order as Bradman used the tail-enders to protect the batsmen from a [[sticky wicket]]. Morris then came in and combined with Bradman in a double century stand.&lt;ref&gt;Piesse, p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt; The selectors wished to trial other possible choices for the 1948 tour of England,&lt;ref name=&quot;wisden&quot; /&gt; including Brown in the opening position, so wither Barnes or Morris had to sit out. This was decided by a coin toss.

Morris, the recently appointed co-captain of New South Wales, had greatly impressed Australia captain Don Bradman, to the extent that Bradman made Morris one of the three selectors for the 1948 tour of England.&lt;ref name=&quot;p early&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;the others were Bradman himself and vice-captain [[Lindsay Hassett]]&lt;/ref&gt; Morris was a key part of Bradman's inner circle in planning for the tour.

Morris marked his first-class debut on English soil with a fluent 138 against [[Worcestershire County Cricket Club|Worcestershire]],&lt;ref&gt;Pollard, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; which was scored in only four hours and made him the first Australian centurion on tour.&lt;ref name=worcs&gt;{{cite web

Having lost the opening two games of the series, England were contemplating changes to their team: [[Tom Goddard]] was tipped to replace [[Jim Laker]] as the [[off spin]]ner, having been in prolific form in [[county cricket]].&lt;ref name=&quot;b ashes&quot; /&gt; The English hoped that he would be the weapon to cut through Australia's strong batting line up.&lt;ref name=b_ashes/&gt;&lt;ref name=r213&gt;Robinson, p. 213.&lt;/ref&gt; Morris' assault ended Goddard's hopes of Test selection. His innings was highlighted by his quick assessment of the pitch of the ball, followed by decisive footwork. Morris confidently went out of his crease when the ball was of a [[Fast_bowling#Length|full length]] and rocked onto the back foot to drive and cut if it was short.&lt;ref name=&quot;b ashes&quot; /&gt; On many occasions, he hit Goddard on the full.&lt;ref name=r213/&gt; Unable to contain Morris, Goddard packed the [[leg side]] field and [[leg theory|bowled outside leg stump]].

[[Image:Morris&amp;Bradman.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Morris (left) with Don Bradman: their partnership won the Fourth Test at Headingley in 1948]]
Morris followed his effort in Bristol with two half centuries, 51 and 54 not out in the drawn Third Test.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; He then struck 108 against [[Middlesex County Cricket Club|Middlesex]] in a tour match.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; Morris's century meant that he had amassed 504 runs in just over a week of cricket.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fingleton, p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Fourth Test at [[Headingley Stadium|Headingley]] in [[Leeds]] saw Morris at his finest; England started well with 496 in the first innings and took a 38-run lead as Australia replied with 458, Morris contributing only six.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; England [[Declaration and forfeiture|declared]] at 8/365, leaving Australia to chase 404 runs for victory. At the time, this would have been the highest ever fourth innings score to result in a Test victory for the batting side. Australia had only 345 minutes to reach the target, and the local press wrote them off, predicting that they would be dismissed by lunchtime on a deteriorating wicket expected to favor the spin bowlers.&lt;ref name=&quot;b ashes&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=r213/&gt;&lt;ref name=report4&gt;{{Cite web|title= Fourth Test Match England v Australia |work= [[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack]] |year=1949 |url=http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/152897.html |accessdate=2 July 2008 |publisher=[[Wisden]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=f174&gt;Fingleton, p. 174.&lt;/ref&gt; Morris and Hassett started slowly, with only six runs in the first six [[over (cricket)|overs]]. When Laker was introduced to exploit the spin, 13 runs were taken from his first over, but only 44 runs came in the first hour, leaving 360 runs needed in 285 minutes.&lt;ref name=b_ashes/&gt;&lt;ref name=f174/&gt; Just 13 runs were added in the next 28 minutes before Hassett was dismissed. Bradman joined Morris with 347 runs needed in 257 minutes. Bradman signalled his intentions on his first ball by driving Laker against the spin for a boundary.&lt;ref name=b_ashes/&gt;&lt;ref name=f175&gt;Fingleton, p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt; Morris promptly joined Bradman in the counter-attack, hitting three consecutive fours off [[Len Hutton]]'s bowling as Australia reached lunch at 1/121.&lt;ref name=&quot;p15&quot;&gt;Pollard, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Upon resumption, Morris severely attacked [[Denis Compton]]'s bowling.&lt;ref name=b_ashes/&gt; Morris struck seven fours in two overs of what Fingleton called &quot;indescribably bad bowling&quot;.&lt;ref name=f176&gt;Fingleton, p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt; He reached the 90s just 14 minutes after the interval and hit another boundary to reach his century in just over two hours. Morris had added 37 runs in the 15 minutes since lunch.&lt;ref name=f176/&gt; He had become the first Australian to hit 20 boundaries in his reaching his century in a Test in England.&lt;ref name=r213/&gt; This forced English captain [[Norman Yardley]] to replace Compton,&lt;ref name=report4/&gt; and Australia reached 202—halfway to the required total—with 165 minutes left. When Bradman suffered a [[fibrositis]] attack, Morris had to shield him from the [[List_of_cricket_terms#S|strike]] until it subsided. Morris passed his century and Australia reached tea at 1/288 with Morris on 150. The pair had added 167 during the session. Morris was eventually dismissed for 182, having survived multiple chances and partnered Bradman in a partnership of 301 in 217 minutes.&lt;ref name=report4/&gt;&lt;ref name=f177&gt;Fingleton, p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt; He struck 33 fours in 290 minutes of batting.&lt;ref name=r213/&gt; Australia proceeded to accumulate the remaining 46 runs to secure the victory by seven wickets.&lt;ref name=&quot;b ashes&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p15&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=f177/&gt;

Morris was the batsman at the other end of the pitch in the Fifth Test at [[The Oval]] when Bradman was famously bowled by [[Eric Hollies]] for a duck in his final Test innings.&lt;ref name=b_ashes/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;f187&quot;&gt;Fingleton, p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt; Morris went on to score 196 in an innings noted for his hooking and off-driving before finally being removed by a [[run out]] as Australia reached 389.&lt;ref&gt;Pollard, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;f188&quot;&gt;Fingleton, p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt; He scored more than half the runs as the rest of the team struggled against the [[leg spin]] of Hollies, who took five wickets.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;&lt;ref name=f188/&gt; With England having been bowled out for 52 in their first innings, Australia sealed the series 4–0 with an innings victory.&lt;ref name=&quot;b ashes&quot; /&gt; Morris took four catches,&lt;ref name=o/&gt; including a famous dismissal of Compton, who [[Batting (cricket)#Pull and hook|hooked the ball]]. Morris ran from his position at short square leg to take a difficult catch,&lt;ref name=&quot;f185&quot;&gt;Fingleton, p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt; described by Fingleton as &quot;one of the catches of the season&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;f185&quot; /&gt;

In recognition of his performances, Morris was named as one of the [[Wisden Cricketers of the Year]] in 1949, described as &quot;one of the world's best left-hand batsmen&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;wisden&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;testlist&quot; /&gt; Neville Cardus, his former critic, praised Morris' performance during the ''Invincibles'' tour as &quot;masterful, stylish, imperturbable, sure in defence, quick and handsome in stroke play. His batting is true to himself, charming and good mannered but reliant and thoughtful.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;p ashes&quot; /&gt;

Morris ended the first-class tour with 1,922 runs at 71.18, despite being troubled by a split between the first and second fingers of his left hand caused by constant jarring from the bat as he played the ball. The wound often opened while he was batting, forcing him to undergo a minor operation, which sidelined him from some matches in the latter part of the tour.&lt;ref name=&quot;wisden&quot; /&gt;

== Vice-captain of Australia ==

With the retirement of Bradman following the 1948 tour, Morris was regarded by commentators as Australia's leading batsman.&lt;ref name=&quot;p ashes&quot; /&gt; In the 1948–49 season, he scored 1,049 runs at 66.81 in nine matches with six centuries and two fifties,&lt;ref name=o/&gt; taking his tally for the previous twelve months to 2,991 runs at 69.56, with 13 centuries.&lt;ref name=&quot;p ashes&quot; /&gt; He scored a century in each of his first three matches for the season, making 120 against Queensland, 108 in Bradman's Testimonial and 163 against Western Australia.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; After a match without triple figures, he added 177 against Victoria.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;

In a low-scoring match against Queensland, New South Wales started the final day needing 142 to win. Morris scored 108 in only 80 balls, steering his team to victory before lunch. Previously, only Bradman had scored a century before lunch in a Shield match.&lt;ref name=r214/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Perry (2001), p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; The innings took only 82 minutes and Morris promptly returned to his work as a salesman.&lt;ref name=r214/&gt; Morris rounded off his Shield campaign with 110 against South Australia.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; The [[Western Australian Cricket Association]] attempted to lure Morris to switch states, but he declined.&lt;ref&gt;Derriman, p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt;

Morris was appointed Australian vice-captain under Lindsay Hassett for a five-Test tour of [[South Africa]] in 1949–50,&lt;ref&gt;Pollard, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; narrowly missing out on the captaincy after a 7–6 vote by the board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Chris |last=Harte |year=2003 |title=The Penguin history of Australian cricket|publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |isbn=0-670-04133-5|page=410}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored two centuries in six tour matches before the Tests.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; In his first Test in his new leadership role, Morris was out for a duck in Australia's only innings as the team won by an innings. He made starts in the next two Tests, passing twenty but failing to reach a half-century on all four occasions.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; In the second innings of the Third Test, Morris played fluently to reach 42 on a sticky wicket before [[hit wicket|stepping on his stumps]].&lt;ref&gt;Haigh, pp. 13–14.&lt;/ref&gt; Australia looked set for their first Test defeat to South Africa, but an unbeaten [[Neil Harvey]] century salvaged a win.&lt;ref&gt;Haigh, pp. 14–16.&lt;/ref&gt; Morris returned to form by making 111 and 19 in the drawn Fourth Test in [[Johannesburg]].&lt;ref&gt;Pollard, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; In between, Morris struck two further centuries in the tour matches, against [[Border cricket team|Border]] and [[Transvaal cricket team|Transvaal]].&lt;ref name=o/&gt; He finished with a score of 157 in the Fifth Test in [[Port Elizabeth]], laying the foundation for an innings victory and a 4–0 series result.&lt;ref name=testlist/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Haigh, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; He ended the series with 422 runs at 52.75.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; On either side of the final Test, Morris added centuries against [[Griqualand West cricket team|Griqualand West]] and [[Western Province cricket team|Western Province]],&lt;ref name=o/&gt; and for the entire tour had amassed eight centuries, equal to [[Neil Harvey]].&lt;ref&gt;Pollard, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; At this stage of his career, he had amassed 1,830 runs in 19 Tests at an average of 67.77, with nine centuries.&lt;ref name=&quot;testlist&quot; /&gt; Following the tour, Morris received an invitation from the New South Wales branch of the ruling [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]] asking him to stand as a candidate in the forthcoming state elections, an offer that he declined.&lt;ref&gt;McHarg, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt;

England toured Australia for the [[1950-51 Ashes series]] and Morris started the season strongly. He scored 74, 101 and 78 not out as New South Wales won consecutive matches against Queensland. Morris then warmed up the Tests by amassing 168 for New South Wales against England.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; However, he made a poor start to the Test series by aggregating only 45 runs in the first three Tests, which included two ducks. Four of his five dismissals came at the hands of [[Alec Bedser]], leading commentators to claim that Bedser had a &quot;hoodoo&quot; on Morris and he was called &quot;Bedser's Bunny&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;McHarg, pp. 87–88.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to his struggles in the Tests, Morris played for an Australian XI and New South Wales in two matches against England during this period, and scored 100 and 105.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; In a match against arch-rivals Victoria, Morris hammered 182 and targeted Test teammate [[Jack Iverson]], who responded poorly to being attacked. The match ended in a draw but stopped Victoria's challenge for interstate supremacy. The attack effectively ended Iverson's run at the top of cricket.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Perry (2005), pp. 298–299.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Haigh, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; However, on his 29th birthday, Morris again fell cheaply to Bedser in a tour match and he found himself eating at table 13 ahead of the next Test.&lt;ref name=r215&gt;Robinson, p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt;

Facing omission from the side, Morris recovered in the Fourth Test at the [[Adelaide Oval]], where Hassett shielded him from Bedser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=R. S. |last=Whitington |title=The Book of Australian Test Cricket 1877–1974 |publisher=[[Wren Publishing]] |year=1974|isbn=0-85885-197-0| page=213}}&lt;/ref&gt; This helped Morris to settle in before batting for a day and a half to score 206,&lt;ref name=r215/&gt; his highest Test score and only double century at the highest level. It constituted the majority of Australia's total of 371,&lt;ref&gt;Pollard, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; which set up 274-run victory and a 4–0 series lead, and was his seventh Ashes century, ranking him second only to Bradman at the time for Ashes centuries. Bradman described the innings as &quot;faultless – a terrific Test double hundred&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;p9091&quot; /&gt; comparing it to Morris's 182 and 196 at Headingley and The Oval during the 1948 ''Invincibles'' tour. Morris ended the series with a half-century in Melbourne in Australia's only loss, to give him a series aggregate of 321 runs at 35.66. It was the first Test loss he had played in after 24 matches for Australia.&lt;ref name=&quot;testlist&quot; /&gt; In contrast to his below par Test series, Morris was in strong form during the first-class season; he scored three centuries against England in the tour matches and compiled six in all to finish with 1,221 runs at 58.14.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; Despite these performances, the press continued to emphasise his perceived difficulties against Bedser.&lt;ref name=&quot;p9091&quot;&gt;Perry (2001), p. 90–91.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Difficulties against the West Indies ==

The 1951–52 season saw the second tour to Australia by the [[West Indies cricket team|West Indies]]. Morris experimented with his stance during the winter in response to criticism about his footwork when facing Bedser. Morris felt that his problems had arisen because he attempted to play excessively on the [[leg side]].&lt;ref&gt;McHarg, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; He opened his season by punishing the [[Queensland Bulls|Queenslanders]] with a score of 253 in a Shield match and then scored 210 against Victoria.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;widrop&quot;&gt;Perry (2001), p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; In the first of these innings, Morris had been ill but he struck 253 of his team's 400, with the last 50 coming in only 17 minutes of batting.&lt;ref&gt;Haigh, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; His Test form was unimpressive though; he started steadily, with 122 runs in the first two Tests, which were won by Australia.&lt;ref name=&quot;testlist&quot; /&gt; 

The Third Test in Adelaide was Morris's first Test as captain, after Hassett withdrew on match eve due to a strained hip muscle.&lt;ref name=pwi/&gt; Australia were already one batsman short after the Australian Board of Control had earlier vetoed the selection of Barnes &quot;for grounds other than cricketing ability&quot;, which was widely believed to be a result of Barnes' previous clashes with authority.&lt;ref&gt;McHarg, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Haigh and Frith, pp. 100–106.&lt;/ref&gt; Under board's regulations at the time, a replacement player needed the approval of the entire board. Since it was the weekend, some of the members could not be contacted by phone,&lt;ref name=pwi/&gt; and as a result Hassett could not be replaced by another specialist batsman from outside the twelve man squad.&lt;ref name=&quot;pwi&quot;&gt;Pollard, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, his place was taken by a specialist bowler already in the squad.&lt;ref name=r216&gt;Robinson, p. 216.&lt;/ref&gt; This left Morris leading an extremely unbalanced team with four specialist batsmen and Miller as the all-rounder. Morris had a [[List_of_cricket_terms#T|long tail]] with wicketkeeper [[Gil Langley]] and five specialist bowlers all with batting averages less than 23,&lt;ref&gt;Benaud, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; and was reportedly &quot;in a state of shock&quot;.&lt;ref name=r217&gt;Robinson, p. 217.&lt;/ref&gt; Morris won the toss and elected to bat on a [[sticky wicket]]. Because of a leak in the covers, one end of the pitch was dry and the other was wet.&lt;ref name=r217/&gt; Australia were [[List_of_cricket_terms#B|bowled out]] for a low score of 82 but managed to restrict the West Indies to 105.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pwi&quot; /&gt; In all 22 wickets fell on the first day, the most in a Test on Australian soil in 50 years.&lt;ref name=r217/&gt; Morris proceeded to reverse the batting order in the second innings, with bowler [[Ian Johnson (cricketer)|Ian Johnson]] and Langley opening the batting. They were followed by bowlers [[Geff Noblet]] and [[Doug Ring]], in order to protect the batsmen from a wicket that was still wet. Ring made an unexpected 67 and Morris scored 45 as Australia compiled 255, but it was not enough; the West Indies reached the target with six wickets in hand.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;&lt;ref name=r217/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p cap&quot;&gt;Perry (2000), pp. 186–187.&lt;/ref&gt; 

After scores of 6 and 12 in the Fourth Test, he missed the final Test due to injury, ending an unproductive Test summer in which he managed only 186 runs at 23.25. The series was noted for Morris' difficulties against the spin duo of [[Alf Valentine]] and [[Sonny Ramadhin]], who bowled [[left arm orthodox]] and [[leg spin]] respectively. The pair was responsible for five of his eight dismissals on the tour.&lt;ref name=&quot;p late&quot;&gt;Perry (2000), pp. 190–191.&lt;/ref&gt; Morris did not play a match after the new year and ended the season with 698 runs at 53.69.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; He topped his state's Shield batting averages, leading from the front as New South Wales regained the title.&lt;ref&gt;Derriman, pp. 190–191.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Australia's decline ==

[[Image:ArthurMorris.jpg|right|thumb|Morris]] 
The 1952–53 season started poorly for Morris. He was replaced by Keith Miller as state captain, despite having scored almost 700 runs at a fast rate in the previous Shield season at an average above 50,&lt;ref name=&quot;sack&quot; /&gt; and leading his state to another title.&lt;ref name=s/&gt; As was the norm for the era, Morris was not informed personally and learned of his demotion second-hand.&lt;ref name=h61/&gt; No official reason was given by the [[New South Wales Cricket Association]],&lt;ref&gt;Pollard, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; but it was speculated among the media that his penchant for wearing brightly coloured rubber-soled shoes could have upset the conservative administrators,&lt;ref name=sack/&gt; and that Morris was too genial to be captain.&lt;ref name=sack/&gt; The media made Morris a scapegoat for dwindling public attendances following the retirement of Bradman and lobbied for Miller, who they deemed to be more appealing to the public.&lt;ref name=r217/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;sack&quot;&gt;Benaud, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=h61&gt;Haigh, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ps&gt;Perry (2005), pp. 314–315.&lt;/ref&gt; Morris had led his state to two Shield triumphs, but remained national vice-captain ahead of Miller.&lt;ref name=ps/&gt; [[Richie Benaud]] said that Morris &quot;led the side just as well as Miller but in a less flamboyant manner&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Perry (2005), p. 316.&lt;/ref&gt;

In spite of this, Morris started the new season consistently, scoring four fifties in his first five innings, including 55 and 39 in his state's victory over the touring South Africans ahead of the Tests.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; The on-field action against the South Africans brought no immediate upturn in Morris's Test fortunes. He made only one half-century and a total of 149 runs in the first three Tests as Australia took the series lead 2–1.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; In the Second Test, he had progressed to 42 when he drove [[Hugh Tayfield]] into a close fielder.&lt;ref name=pi171&gt;Piesse, p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt; The ball ballooned to mid-off and Tayfield ran back and dived parallel to the ball's trajectory and caught it.&lt;ref name=pi171/&gt; By the standards of the era, the catch was regarded as miraculous.&lt;ref name=pi171/&gt; He ended the series strongly, with 77 in the second innings of the Fourth Test in [[Adelaide]], before making his best performances of 99 and 44 in [[Melbourne]] in the Fifth Test, which Australia lost by six wickets.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; Morris' 99 occurred when he was involved in a mix-up while batting with debutant [[Ian Craig]], Australia's youngest ever Test cricketer. Morris decided to sacrifice his wicket for Craig's in a [[run out]].&lt;ref name=m103/&gt; His action meant that he had not scored a Test century for two years, and would have to wait another two years to reach the milestone again.&lt;ref name=testlist/&gt; Morris was widely praised for his unselfishness and his sacrifice for his new team-mate.&lt;ref name=&quot;testlist&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=r216/&gt;&lt;ref name=m103&gt;McHarg, p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt; He ended the series with 370 runs at 41.11 and took his maiden Test wicket in Adelaide, that of [[John Watkins (South African cricketer)|John Watkins]]. The series ended 2–2, the first Test series in Morris' career that Australia had not won.&lt;ref name=&quot;testlist&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=auslist/&gt; Morris ended the season with 105 in a warm-up match before the tour of England and totalled 913 runs at 45.65 for the summer.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;

In 1953, Morris [[Australian cricket team in England in 1953|returned to England]], the setting for his three Test centuries five years earlier, for another Ashes series.&lt;ref name=testlist/&gt; In a tour opening festival match against East Molesey, Morris made 103 in eighty minutes.&lt;ref&gt;Haigh, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; After the modest run scoring of the previous three Test seasons, Morris warmed up in 10 lead-in matches that yielded a moderate return of 347 runs at 34.70.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; However, his performances in the first two drawn Tests, in which he struck three half centuries, indicated that might be returning to his earlier form. He was unable to maintain his form however, and did not pass 40 in the last three Tests, ending the series with 337 runs at a modest average of 33.70.&lt;ref name=testlist/&gt; The teams were locked at 0–0 heading into the Fifth Test, and Hassett and Morris thought that the pitch at [[The Oval]] would favour fast bowling.&lt;ref&gt;Haigh, p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; However, they were mistaken, and Morris could manage only 16 and 26 as the hosts' spinners cut down the tourists, while their Australian counterparts watched from the stands.&lt;ref name=testlist/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Haigh, pp. 80–81.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Denis Compton]] pulled Morris's spin for four to seal an English win by eight wickets.&lt;ref&gt;Haigh, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; This meant that the hosts regained the Ashes for the first time in two decades with a 1–0 triumph, and Morris thus tasted a series defeat for the first time in his career.&lt;ref name=auslist/&gt; It was a low-scoring series, and Morris placed third in the Australian Test averages and aggregates, behind Hassett with 365 at 36.50.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Test Batting and Fielding for Australia Australia in British Isles 1953|url=http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Events/ENG/Australia_in_British_Isles_1953/t_Australia_Batting.html|accessdate=17 June 2009 |publisher=[[CricketArchive]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morris's batting was regarded by commentators as being more carefree than during the ''Invincibles'' tour. He took his second and final wicket in Test cricket, that of [[Alec Bedser]], in the Third Test at Old Trafford.&lt;ref name=&quot;testlist&quot; /&gt; Morris also struggled in the first-class matches, making 1,302 runs at 38.09 with only one century, which did not come until almost four months had elapsed on tour, against the [[Gentlemen of England]].&lt;ref name=o/&gt; Morris placed third in the aggregates but only ranked sixth in the averages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=First-class Batting and Fielding for Australia Australia in British Isles 1953|url=http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Events/ENG/Australia_in_British_Isles_1953/f_Australians_Batting.html|accessdate=17 June 2009 |publisher=[[CricketArchive]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made many starts, with 11 fifties, but was only able to capitalise and reached triple figures only once.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; 

Speculation linked his difficulties on the field to his personal relationships: during the tour Morris had fallen in love with English showgirl Valerie Hudson; he spotted her when she was performing in the Crazy Gang vaudeville show at London's [[Victoria Palace]].&lt;ref&gt;Perry (2001), pp. 92–93.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McHarg, p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=r218&gt;Robinson, p. 218.&lt;/ref&gt; The team was also hindered by tension brought on by a generational divide. The senior players, Morris among them, were retired servicemen who were drinkers, while the younger players tended to abstain from alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;Haigh, pp. 28–29.&lt;/ref&gt; The seniors frequently stopped the team bus to drink at pubs, leaving their younger colleagues disgruntled at the fact that the squad travelled at around 16&amp;nbsp;km/h.&lt;ref&gt;Haigh, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career twilight ==

[[Image:Morris Hutton.jpg|thumb|left|[[Len Hutton]] ''(left)'' and Morris toss at the beginning of the Second Test between England and Australia in 1954–55]]

With the retirement of Hassett following the 1953 England tour, the Australian captaincy was open for competition.&lt;ref&gt;Cashman, pp. 119–120.&lt;/ref&gt; No international cricket was scheduled until 1954–55,&lt;ref name=auslist/&gt; so there was a full domestic season in 1953–54 for players to stake their claims. Morris started strongly with consecutive centuries against Queensland and South Australia, but was unable to maintain his form, passing fifty only twice in his remaining eight innings.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; He ended with 487 runs at 54.11 as New South Wales won the Sheffield Shield under Miller's leadership.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;&lt;ref name=pc&gt;Perry (2005), pp. 348–349.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the Australian selectors indicated that they were considering Morris as a captaincy option by making him captain of Morris's XI, which played Hassett's XI in a testimonial match. Morris's XI won by 121 runs.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;&lt;ref name=pc/&gt;

At the start of the next season, Morris was not made Australian captain despite being the incumbent vice-captain. Instead, he was remained as deputy as Victoria's [[Ian Johnson (cricketer)|Ian Johnson]] was recalled to the team and assumed the captaincy. There was speculation that the two Queensland board members voted for Morris, the three New South Wales delegates voted for Miller and, while the remainder voted Johnson.&lt;ref&gt;Perry (2005), pp. 350–350.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Haigh and Frith, p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; When England returned to Australia in 1954–55, Morris made his first Test century in almost four years during the opening Test at Brisbane. After English skipper [[Len Hutton]] won the toss and controversially sent Australia in,&lt;ref name=&quot;Perry 2005, p. 353&quot;&gt;Perry (2005), p. 353.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Haigh, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; Morris made 153 to lay the foundation for a score of 8/601 declared and an innings victory. This included a partnership of 202 runs with [[Neil Harvey]]. The pair scored at a [[run rate|rate]] of nearly four runs per over, despite both players being repeatedly struck by the bowling of [[Frank Tyson]], who was regarded as the fastest bowler of his era.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Perry (2001), pp. 93–94.&lt;/ref&gt; Those were the only centuries made by Australian batsmen for the entire series, and Morris was covered in bruises; he deliberately used his body to fend off short-pitched balls rather than risk a catch.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, pp. 215–216.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Second Test in Sydney, Johnson and Miller were both unavailable due to injury; Morris led the team for the second and final time in Tests.&lt;ref name=r217/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McHarg, p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt; The Australian Board of Control made the surprising move of appointing the young and inexperienced [[Richie Benaud]] as Morris' vice-captain for the match. Benaud, selected as a batsman, had scored just 195 runs at 13.92 in ten Test matches and was not a regular member of the team.&lt;ref name=b92/&gt; Benaud noted that the situation was embarrassing and that Morris had asked him not to be offended if he sought advice from veteran players [[Ray Lindwall]] and Harvey,&lt;ref name=b92/&gt; who had been Test regulars for seven years.&lt;ref&gt;Cashman, pp. 118–119, 174–175.&lt;/ref&gt; Morris won the toss and elected to bat on a green pitch,&lt;ref name=r217/&gt; in match marred by time-wasting.&lt;ref name=r218/&gt; Although Australia took a first innings lead, they lost the low-scoring match by 38 runs after a batting collapse in the face of a Tyson pace barrage on the final day.&lt;ref name=&quot;Perry 2005, p. 353&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=b92&gt;Benaud, p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pollard, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Haigh, pp. 89–90.&lt;/ref&gt; Aided by a powerful tailwind,&lt;ref name=r218/&gt; Tyson bowled at extreme pace and the slips cordon stood 45&amp;nbsp;m away from the wicket.&lt;ref&gt;Piesse, p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt; Morris added a poor personal performance, scores of 12 and 10, to the disappointment of his team's defeat. He failed to pass 25 in either of the following Tests as Australia fell 3–1 behind with a hat-trick of losses and he was dropped for the Fifth Test, ending the series with 223 runs at 31.86.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;testlist&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=auslist/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McHarg, p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from the First Test century, Morris struggled throughout the entire season, passing fifty on only one other occasion and managing only 382 runs at 31.83.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; 

Morris' international farewell was the 1954–55 tour of the West Indies.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;&lt;ref name=testlist/&gt; Prior to the tour, Miller replaced him as Australian vice-captain.&lt;ref&gt;Perry (2005), p. 357.&lt;/ref&gt; He struck 157 against [[Jamaican cricket team|Jamaica]] in his first tour match, earning a recall to the Test team.&lt;ref&gt;Perry (2001), pp. 94–95.&lt;/ref&gt; He made 65 in the First Test victory in [[Kingston, Jamaica]], before making his final Test century (111) in the drawn Second Test in [[Port of Spain]], [[Trinidad]]. He made 44 and 38 in the Third Test win and then missed the Fourth Test with [[dysentery]].&lt;ref name=&quot;testlist&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p late&quot; /&gt; He scored seven in his final Test innings in the Fifth Test, which Australia won by an innings to seal the series 3–0.&lt;ref name=auslist/&gt; Morris ended the Test series with 266 runs at 44.33.&lt;ref name=testlist/&gt; In his final tour in Australian colours, Morris totalled 577 runs at 57.45 in seven first-class matches.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;

Returning to Sydney after the West Indian tour, Morris learned that his new wife Valerie had been diagnosed with [[breast cancer]] in his absence. She had concealed her illness until his return, fearing that it would distract him from his cricket.&lt;ref name=r218/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;psum&quot;&gt;Pollard, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=h251&gt;Haigh, p. 251.&lt;/ref&gt; With his wife's condition deteriorating over the following year despite the removal of a breast,&lt;ref name=h251/&gt; Morris retired at the age of 33,&lt;ref name=&quot;p late&quot; /&gt; as he realised that his wife's condition was terminal and that their marriage would soon be over.&lt;ref name=h251/&gt; Morris scored centuries on his first first-class appearances in four countries: England, South Africa, the West Indies and Australia, a record not equalled as of 1997&lt;!--1997? 2007, maybe? If it was equalled in 1997 say by whom.--&gt;.&lt;ref name=&quot;az&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p late&quot; /&gt; In general, he was known for scoring centuries in his debut appearance at many grounds.&lt;ref name=r213/&gt; His eight centuries against England was second only to Bradman.&lt;ref name=r213/&gt; He was a popular player, highly lauded by Australian and English commentators for both his character, goodwill and ability.&lt;ref name=&quot;az&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;psum&quot; /&gt; His childhood mentor O'Reilly said that he was a &quot;man worth knowing&quot;, while Tyson called him &quot;one of cricket's patricians...endowed with a genteel equanimity, without seeming aloof or less than cordial and friendly&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;mintro&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McHarg, p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McHarg, p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt; The English commentator [[John Arlott]], known for rarely praising an Australian, said that Morris &quot;was one of the best-liked cricketers of all time – charming, philosophical and relaxed&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;McHarg, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Style ==
Morris was seen as an elegant and aggressive player, and is regarded alongside [[Clem Hill]], [[Neil Harvey]] and [[Allan Border]] as one of Australia's greatest left-handed batsmen.&lt;ref name=&quot;az&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;psum&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mintro&quot;&gt;McHarg, pp. 11–12.&lt;/ref&gt; Adept at playing against both [[pace bowling|pace]] and [[spin bowling]], he was known for the variety of his shots on both sides of the wicket.&lt;ref name=&quot;az&quot; /&gt; Despite standing only five&amp;nbsp;feet&amp;nbsp;nine&amp;nbsp;inches&amp;nbsp;(1.75&amp;nbsp;m),&lt;ref name=az/&gt;&lt;ref name=r213/&gt; opponents spoke of his imposing appearance and his apparent air of complete composure at the crease.&lt;ref name=&quot;az&quot; /&gt; He had the ability to decide on his stroke early in the ball's flight and employed an unusual defensive technique, shuffling across the [[stumps]] to get behind the ball. This created a perception that he was vulnerable to [[leg before wicket]] decisions and was vulnerable to losing his leg stump.&lt;ref name=wisden/&gt;&lt;ref name=r214/&gt; Deft placement allowed him to pierce the gaps between fielders, and he was especially noted for his [[Batting (cricket)#Drive|cover driving]], [[Batting (cricket)#Cut|square cutting]] and [[Batting (cricket)#Drive|on-driving]].&lt;ref name=&quot;wisden&quot; /&gt; Most of all, he was known for his back foot play, especially his [[Batting (cricket)#Pull and hook|pulling and hooking]].&lt;ref name=r212/&gt; According to cricket writer [[Ray Robinson (cricket writer)|Ray Robinson]], &quot;no other post-war batsman has rivalled his smashing counter-attacks on bowling swift enough to give the toughest team the tremors…A menacing bouncer colliding with Morris' bat was like a rocky fist against an iron jaw.&quot;&lt;ref name=r212/&gt; While many batsmen tended to evade deliveries aimed at the head, Morris was known for standing and hooking. In one interstate match, Miller, one of the world's leading pacemen, bowled an entire eight-ball over of bouncers. Morris hooked the five balls that he faced in the over for 4, 4, 4, 4 and 3.&lt;ref name=r215/&gt;

According to Bradman, Morris' success was due to his powerful wrists and forearms. Bradman interpreted Morris' unorthodox methods—he often defended with his bat not straight—as a sign of genius.&lt;ref name = &quot;Perry_p27&quot;&gt;Perry (2001), p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ian Johnson (cricketer)|Ian Johnson]] believed that Morris' idiosyncratic technique was a strength, as it disrupted any plans made by the opposition.&lt;ref name=r214/&gt; Contrary to the accepted wisdom of the day, Morris had a penchant for lofting his drives, backing his ability to clear the infield.&lt;ref name=r214/&gt; Benaud rated Morris alongside [[Neil Harvey]] as having the best footwork against [[spin bowling]] among batsmen after the Second World War.&lt;ref&gt;McHarg, p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt; Morris was particularly known for his fast analysis of the length of the ball, and as a result, he quickly and decisively moved forward or back.&lt;ref name=r214/&gt; Morris' productivity declined in the latter half of his career, something he put down to the break-up of his opening pairing with Barnes. Morris' partnerships with his later partners yielded less runs, leading him to remark that &quot;When Siddy [Barnes] went, I lost a lot of support becauses he'd always get ones.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Gideon |last=Haigh|year=1995| title=One Summer, Every Summer |publisher=[[Text Publishing]] |isbn=1-875847-18-9 |page=132}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morris was also known for his unselfishness, often sacrificing his wicket after being involved in mix-ups while running between wickets, and he had a reputation for not attempting to finish [[not out]] to inflate his average.&lt;ref name=r216/&gt;

However, Morris was regarded as the &quot;bunny&quot; of English medium pace bowler [[Alec Bedser]],&lt;ref&gt;McHarg, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; who dismissed him 20 times in first-class cricket, including 18 times in Test matches.&lt;ref name=az/&gt; Bedser dismissed Morris more than any other bowler.&lt;ref name=r215/&gt; Typically, Bedser took Morris' wicket with deliveries pitched on leg stump that moved across him. This perceived dominance is not borne out by statistics; Morris' average was 57.42 in the 37 Test innings in which he faced Bedser, and more than sixty in the 46 first-class innings when the two met.&lt;ref name=&quot;az&quot; /&gt; In their last meeting at Test level in 1954–55, Morris scored 153.&lt;ref name=r215/&gt; The pair were very close friends,&lt;ref name=r215/&gt;&lt;ref name=h180/&gt; and Bedser frequently made the point of rebutting criticism of Morris' performance against him. Bedser noted Morris' gracious demeanour despite his struggles, recalling an incident during the 1950–51 season when Morris reached his century during a tour match against the English. Instead of thinking of his difficulties against Bedser, Morris commented on the plight of his English opponents who had suffered harder times. Morris stated that &quot;[[Bob Berry (cricketer)|Bob Berry]] hasn't got a [[dismissal (cricket)|wicket]] and [[John Warr]] hasn't taken a [[caught (cricket)|catch]] all tour so I'll see what can be done.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;h180&quot; /&gt; Morris was then caught by Warr from Berry's bowling without adding to his score.&lt;ref name=&quot;h180&quot;&gt;McHarg, p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt;

Morris took only two wickets in Tests, one of them Bedser in 1953;&lt;ref name=&quot;az&quot; /&gt; he was rarely used as a bowler and was a reliable catcher.&lt;ref name=&quot;wisden&quot; /&gt; Despite his success, he was a pessimist who claimed to be low on self-confidence, saying that he was always surprised not to be dismissed for a [[duck (cricket)|duck]]. In an interview in 2000, he said, &quot;I wish I had the confidence of some of the players today.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Perry (2001), p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; After reaching Test cricket, Morris began smoking to relieve tension ahead of an innings.&lt;ref name=r214/&gt;

==After cricket ==
[[Image:McCool&amp;Morris1979.jpg|right|thumb|Morris (right) with ''Invincibles'' teammate [[Colin McCool]] at a function in 1979]]
With his wife's death imminent, Morris organised the couple's return to Britain with financial help from Hassett. He worked as a cricket reporter for [[London]]'s ''[[Daily Express]]'' during the [[Australian cricket team in England in 1956|1956 Ashes tour]] while his wife was reunited with her family for the last time. She died soon after they returned to Australia at the end of the tour, aged just 33. They had been married only 18 months.&lt;ref name=r218/&gt;&lt;ref name=h251/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Perry (2001), p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McHarg, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the wake of his personal loss, Morris, known for his sincerity and high personal values, received many offers of work and financial assistance. With a reference from English cricketer [[Doug Insole]], Morris joined British engineering company [[George Wimpey]] for a few years. He then moved back to Sydney to take up a public relations job with security group [[Wormald International]] where he worked until his retirement in the late 1980s.&lt;ref name=&quot;m27&quot;&gt;McHarg, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; He was appointed to the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]] Trust in 1965 and served there for 22 years, eight of them as deputy chairman.&lt;ref name=r218/&gt;&lt;ref name=p_late/&gt; During this time, the ground was modernised and the Bradman Stand erected. In 1968, Morris met and married his second wife Judith Menmuir.&lt;ref name=&quot;p late&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=r218/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McHarg, p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded the [[Order of the British Empire|MBE]] in 1974 for services to sport.&lt;ref name=r218/&gt;&lt;ref name=m27/&gt; In late 1989, Morris and his wife retired to the town of [[Cessnock, New South Wales|Cessnock]] in the [[Hunter Valley]], north of [[Sydney]].&lt;ref name=&quot;m27&quot; /&gt; He continued to play tennis into his late seventies and enjoyed watching [[Test cricket]] although he refused to watch [[One day cricket]], introduced after his playing days, due to his preference for tradition.&lt;ref name=&quot;az&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p late&quot; /&gt;

In 2001, he was inducted into the [[Australian Cricket Hall of Fame]] alongside [[Bill Woodfull]], the fourteenth and fifteenth players to be inducted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Australian Cricket Hall of Fame |url=http://www.mcg.org.au/default.asp?pg=tourshof2000 |publisher=[[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] |accessdate=16 July 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070609091520/http://www.mcg.org.au/default.asp?pg=tourshof2000 |archivedate = 9 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, he was named in the [[Australian Cricket Board]]'s [[Australian Cricket Board Team of the Century|Team of the Century]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Panel selects cricket team of the century |url=http://www.abc.net.au/pm/stories/s93847.htm| accessdate=16 July 2007| date=18 January 2000| publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morris was named as an opening batsman in Bradman's selection of his greatest team in Test history. Bradman described him as the &quot;best left-hand option to open an innings&quot; and characterised his temperament as &quot;ideal&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;Perry_p27&quot; /&gt; On the death of [[Sam Loxton]] in December 2011, he became Australia's oldest living Test cricketer.
