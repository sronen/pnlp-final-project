'''Harbhajan Singh Plaha&lt;ref&gt;http://jalandhar.nic.in/html/sports_personalities.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/in_depth/2001/india_v_australia/1224269.stm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sikhawards.com/content.aspx?contentid=9&lt;/ref&gt;''' ({{lang-hi|हरभजन सिंह}})({{lang-pa|ਹਰਭਜਨ ਸਿੰਘ}} {{audio|Harbhajan_Singh.ogg|pronunciation}}, born 3 July 1980 in [[Jalandhar]], [[Punjab, India|Punjab]], [[India]]), commonly known as '''Harbhajan Singh''',  is an [[India]]n cricketer. A specialist [[bowling (cricket)|bowler]], he has the second-highest number of [[Test cricket|Test]] wickets by an [[off spin]]ner, behind [[Sri Lanka national cricket team|Sri Lanka's]] [[Muttiah Muralitharan]].
'''
Harbhajan made his Test and [[One Day International]] (ODI) debuts in early 1998. His career was initially affected by investigations into the [[Throwing (cricket)|legality of his bowling action]], as well as several disciplinary incidents. However in 2001, with leading [[leg spin]]ner [[Anil Kumble]] injured, Harbhajan's career was resuscitated after [[Indian national cricket captains|Indian captain]] [[Sourav Ganguly]] called for his inclusion in the [[Border-Gavaskar Trophy]] team. In that series victory over [[Australian cricket team|Australia]], Harbhajan established himself as the team's leading spinner by taking 32 [[wicket]]s, becoming the first Indian bowler to take a [[hat trick]] in Test cricket.&lt;ref name=&quot;profile&quot;&gt;{{cite web| first = Sambit| last= Bal| authorlink=Sambit Bal |title = Players and officials: Harbhajan Singh| url= http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/ci/content/player/29264.html| publisher=[[Cricinfo]]| accessdate =2007-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A finger injury in mid-2003 sidelined him for much of the following year, allowing Kumble to regain his position as the first choice [[spin bowling|spinner]]. Harbhajan reclaimed a regular position in the team upon his return in late 2004, but often found himself watching from the sidelines in Test matches outside the [[Indian subcontinent]] with typically only one spinner, Kumble, being used. Throughout 2006 and into early 2007, Harbhajan's accumulation of wickets fell and his [[bowling average]] increased, and he was increasingly criticised for bowling defensively with less loop. Following India's first-round elimination from the [[2007 Cricket World Cup]], Harbhajan was replaced by other spinners in the national squad for both formats. He regained a regular position in the team in late 2007, but became the subject of more controversy. In early 2008, he was given a ban by the [[International Cricket Council]] (ICC) for racially vilifying [[Andrew Symonds]]. The ban was revoked upon appeal, but in April, Harbhajan was banned from the [[2008 Indian Premier League]] and suspended from the ODI team by the [[Board of Control for Cricket in India]] (BCCI) for slapping [[Sreesanth]] after a match. 

He was conferred the [[Padma Shri]], India's fourth highest civilian honour, in 2009.

== Early years and personal life ==
Harbhajan was born into a middle class [[Punjabi people|Punjabi]] [[Sikh]] family. He is the only son of Sardar Sardev Singh, a businessman who owned a [[ball bearing]] and [[valve]] factory.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbcfire&quot;&gt;{{cite news| title= The renaissance of Harbhajan| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/cricket/1638947.stm| date = 5 November 2001 | accessdate=2007-02-12|publisher=BBC }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;rediff&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title=Bhajji and his papa's dream| url=http://clients.rediff.com/philipseyefi/bhaji.htm| publisher=[[Rediff]] | accessdate =2007-02-28| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070203051602/http://clients.rediff.com/philipseyefi/bhaji.htm| archivedate = 3 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Growing up with five sisters, Harbhajan was in line to inherit the family business, but his father insisted that he concentrate on his cricket career and represent India.&lt;ref name=&quot;rediff&quot;/&gt;

Harbhajan was trained as a [[batsman]] by his first coach Charanjit Singh Bhullar, but converted to spin bowling after his coach's untimely death saw him turn to the tutelage of Davinder Arora. Arora credits Harbhajan's success to a work ethic that included a three hour training session in the morning, followed by an afternoon session lasting from 3&amp;nbsp;pm until after sunset.&lt;ref name=&quot;rediff&quot;/&gt;

Following the death of his father in 2000, Harbhajan became the family head, and as of 2001, had organised marriages for three of his sisters.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbcfire&quot;/&gt; In 2002, he ruled out his own marriage until at least 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title= I'll eat anything| url=http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/224663.html|publisher=[[Cricinfo]] | year =2002| accessdate =2007-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, he again fended off marriage rumours linking him to a [[Bangalore]] based bride, stating that he would only make a decision &quot;after a couple of years&quot;, and that he would be seeking a [[Punjabi people|Punjabi]] bride selected by his family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title= Harbhajan denies marriage reports| url=http://www.chennaionline.com/cricket/Features/2005/01news12.asp|publisher=Chennai Online | date =6 January 2005| accessdate =2007-03-02| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071112164249/http://chennaionline.com/cricket/Features/2005/01news12.asp| archivedate = 12 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In a country where cricketers are idolised, Harbhajan's performances have brought him government accolades and lucrative sponsorships. Following his performance against [[Australian cricket team|Australia]] in 2001, the [[Government of Punjab (India)|Government of Punjab]] awarded him [[Indian rupee|Rs.]] 5 [[lakhs]], a plot of land, and an offer to become a Deputy Superintendent of Police in Punjab Police, which he accepted.

Despite having a job with the constabulary, Harbhajan sustained minor injuries in March 2002 in an altercation with police outside the team hotel in [[Guwahati]]. The scuffle broke out when Harbhajan remonstrated with officers after they refused to allow a photographer into the hotel. Harbhajan cut his bowling arm and injured his elbow when he was struck by the police. Extensive negotiations from local officials and organisers were required to dissuade Harbhajan and captain [[Sourav Ganguly]] from leaving the area after Ganguly said that the Indian team would abandon the scheduled match against [[Zimbabwean cricket team|Zimbabwe]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cops&quot;/&gt;

One of his common nicknames, outside India, is ''The Turbanator'', deriving from his skill as a bowler in terminating the innings of the opposing team, and the fact that, as a [[Sikh]], he wears a black [[turban]] whenever he plays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first=Chloe |last=Saltau |title=&quot;I'll be back&quot;, says the Turbanator| url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/12/09/1070732211286.html?from=storyrhs |work=The Age |location=Australia | date=10 December 2003| accessdate=2007-03-01 | location=Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among Indians, Harbhajan is more commonly known as ''bhajji''.&lt;!--meaning? language?--&gt;&lt;!-- HarBHAJan--&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;rediff&quot;/&gt; It was estimated in 2005 that Harbhajan was the most recognised and commercially viable Indian cricketer after [[Sachin Tendulkar]], in part due to his colourful personality and iconic turban, as well as his reputation for enjoying the celebrity social scene.&lt;ref name=&quot;es&quot;/&gt; His signing for English [[county cricket|county team]] [[Surrey County Cricket Club|Surrey]] in 2005, based at [[The Oval]] in London, was partly attributed to his marketability. Harbhajan had generated a large personal following in the western London suburb of [[Southall]], which boasts a majority Punjabi Sikh population, when he lived there in 1998 while training under [[Fred Titmus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;es&quot;&gt;{{cite news|first=Vivek| last=Chaudhary| title=Bank on Turbanator| url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/sport/article-17113853-bank-on-the-turbanator.do| work=[[Evening Standard]] |date=8 March 2005 |accessdate=2007-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Harbhajan's endorsements generated controversy when he appeared without his [[Turban (Sikhism)|turban]] in an advertisement for Royal Stag [[whisky]]. This angered many orthodox Sikhs, leading to anti-Harbhajan protests in the Sikh holy city of [[Amritsar]], with [[effigy|effigies]] of Harbhajan being burnt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title= Strictures for Harbhajan over commercial|url= http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/261738.html| publisher=[[Cricinfo]]|accessdate =2007-02-07| date = 7 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sikh clergy and [[Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee]] demanded an apology from him and asked Seagram's to withdraw the advert, on the basis that it had &quot;hurt the feelings of Sikhs&quot;. Harbhajan quickly issued an apology, but he was also unhappy at the clergy's interference, stating &quot;If they were unhappy, they should have called me and talked to me like a son&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

== Early career ==

[[Image:HarbhajanSinghBowling.png|thumb|300px|left|A graph showing Harbhajan's test career bowling statistics.]]
Harbhajan broke into the [[Punjab cricket team|Punjab]] Under-16s at the age of 15 years and 4 months in November of the 1995–96 season, and took 7/46 and 5/138 on debut against [[Haryana cricket team|Haryana]], setting up a nine-wicket win. He scored 56 in his next match against [[Delhi cricket team|Delhi]] and then took 11/79 in his third match against [[Himachal Pradesh cricket team|Himachal Pradesh]], orchestrating an innings win. He ended with 32 wickets at 15.15 and 96 runs at 48.00 in four matches. He was rewarded with selection for [[North Zone cricket team|North Zone]] Under-16s, a team that represents all of northern India for a one-day series, in which he took two wickets at 43.50 in four matches and scored 18 runs.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; At the end of the season, he was called into the national Under-19 team at the age of 15 years and 9 months for a youth One Day International against South Africa. He took 1/19 from seven overs in an Indian win.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;

In 1996–97, Harbhajan was promoted to the Punjab Under-19s and he took 15 wickets at 20.20 in three matches, although he managed only two runs with the bat. This included match figures of 8/54 in an innings win over [[Jammu and Kashmir cricket team|Jammu and Kashmir]].&lt;ref name=o/&gt;

Harbhajan made his [[first-class cricket]] debut in late 1997 against [[Services cricket team|Services]], during the 1997–98 [[Ranji Trophy]] season. He took a total of 3/35 in an innings win but was dropped back to the Under-19s the following week. He then took 5/75 and 7/44 in two matches to earn a recall to the senior team. He then took a total of 7/123 in the next two matches for Punjab to earn selection for North Zone in the [[Duleep Trophy]].&lt;ref name=o/&gt;

Harbhajan's season was interrupted when he represented India at the Under-19 World Cup in January 1998. He played in six matches, taking eight wickets at 24.75 with a best of 3/5 against [[Kenya cricket team|Kenya]].&lt;ref name=o/&gt;

Returning to India he played in three more Ranji Trophy matches, and from a total of six matches, he took 18 wickets at an [[bowling average|average]] of 22.50, ranking outside the top 20 in wicket taking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= Bowling – Most Wickets| url= http://www1.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1997-98/IND_LOCAL/RANJI/STATS/IND_LOCAL_RANJI_AVS_BOWL_MOST_WKTS.html |accessdate=2007-01-17 |publisher=[[Cricinfo]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He took a total of 5/131 as North lost to [[East Zone cricket team|East Zone]] by five wickets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= East Zone v North Zone at Hyderabad, Dec&amp;nbsp;1–5, 1997| url= http://www1.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1997-98/IND_LOCAL/DULEEP/EAST_NORTH_DULEEP_01-05DEC1997.html |accessdate=2007-01-17 |publisher=[[Cricinfo]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Despite the superior statistics of other bowlers in domestic cricket, Harbhajan was the selected for the Indian Board President's XI to play the touring [[Australian cricket team]] ahead of the Tests. He managed only 1/127,&lt;ref name=o/&gt; and was ignored for the first two Tests before being selected to make his Test debut in the [[Australian cricket team in India in 1997-98|Third Test against Australia]] in [[Bangalore]], where he scored 4 not out and a duck, and recorded the modest match figures of 2/136 as Australia won the match by eight wickets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title= 3rd Test:India v Australia at Bangalore, Mar&amp;nbsp;25–28, 1998| url=http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/india/engine/match/63796.html |accessdate=2007-01-15 |publisher=[[Cricinfo]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was subsequently overlooked for the triangular ODI tournament in India that followed the Tests, involving [[Zimbabwe cricket team|Zimbabwe]] in addition to Australia, but was selected for all group matches in the triangular tournament that followed soon after in [[Sharjah (city)|Sharjah]], where he made his ODI debut against [[New Zealand cricket team|New Zealand]].&lt;ref name=&quot;odilist&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title= Statsguru – Harbhajan Singh – ODIs – Innings by innings list|url=  http://stats.cricinfo.com/guru?sdb=player;playerid=7139;class=odiplayer;filter=basic;team=0;opposition=0;notopposition=0;season=0;homeaway=0;continent=0;country=0;notcountry=0;groundid=0;startdefault=1998-03-25;start=1998-03-25;enddefault=2006-07-02;end=2006-07-02;tourneyid=0;finals=0;daynight=0;toss=0;scheduledovers=0;scheduleddays=0;innings=0;result=0;followon=0;seriesresult=0;captain=0;keeper=0;dnp=0;recent=;viewtype=aro_list;runslow=;runshigh=;batposition=0;dismissal=0;bowposition=0;ballslow=;ballshigh=;bpof=0;overslow=;overshigh=;conclow=;conchigh=;wicketslow=;wicketshigh=;dismissalslow=;dismissalshigh=;caughtlow=;caughthigh=;caughttype=0;stumpedlow=;stumpedhigh=;csearch=;submit=1;.cgifields=viewtype |accessdate=2007-01-17 |publisher=[[Cricinfo]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He took 1/32 from ten overs on debut as India narrowly won by 15 runs. He then took 3/41 in the next match, a defeat against Australia, but then struggled in the second qualifying match against the same team, taking 1/63 in eight overs. He was subsequently dropped for the final against Australia, which India won, and ended the series with five wickets at 33.20 at an economy rate of 4.36.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;

Harbhajan was fined and given a suspended ban for one ODI by the [[Panel of ICC Referees|match referee]] in his first international series, when his on-field behaviour was adjudged to breach the [[ICC Code of Conduct]]. The incident in question was his altercation with [[Ricky Ponting]] after dismissing him.&lt;ref name = &quot;bbcfire&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=  1998: Penalties imposed on players for breaches of ICC Code of Conduct| url= http://www.icc-cricket.com/icc/rules/penalties/1998.html| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070224002342/http://www.icc-cricket.com/icc/rules/penalties/1998.html| archivedate=24 February 2007|publisher=[[International Cricket Council]]| accessdate =2007-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Harbhajan was then omitted from the team during a home triangular ODI tournament against [[Bangladesh cricket team|Bangladesh]] and [[Kenyan cricket team|Kenya]], after taking 0/18 from four overs in his only match of the tournament against the former opponent,&lt;ref name=o/&gt; but was recalled for the [[Singer Trophy]] in Sri Lanka and also involving New Zealand. Playing in all five matches, Harbhajan claimed eight wickets at an average of 24.12 and economy of 4.38 in this tournament, taking at least one scalp in each match. Harbhajan was retained for the final and took 1/57, his worst return for the series, in an Indian win. After being omitted for the [[Sahara Cup]] series against [[Pakistani cricket team|Pakistan]] in Toronto, Harbhajan played in a weakened Indian team at the [[1998 Commonwealth Games]] in [[Kuala Lumpur]], Malaysia. The matches were not given ODI status by the ICC, and India chose to send their better players to the Sahara Cup instead. India won their first two matches against [[Antigua cricket team|Antigua]] and [[Canada cricket team|Canada]], but Harbhajan managed only a total of 1/48 from 11 overs. The Indians then needed to beat a full-strength Australian outfit to win their group and progress to the semi-finals. Harbhajan was punished and went wicketless, conceding 50 runs in eight overs as Australia won by 146 runs, knocking India out of contention.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;

Harbhajan was then recalled to the first-choice team and took five wickets at an average of 22.60 at 3.89 runs an over from three matches on a [[Indian cricket team in Zimbabwe in 1998-99|tour to Zimbabwe]], in what would prove to be his last ODI appearances for India for more than two years.&lt;ref name=&quot;odiseries&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title= Statsguru – Harbhajan Singh – ODIs – Series averages|url= http://stats.cricinfo.com/guru?sdb=player;playerid=7139;class=odiplayer;filter=basic;team=0;opposition=0;notopposition=0;season=0;homeaway=0;continent=0;country=0;notcountry=0;groundid=0;startdefault=1998-04-17;start=1998-04-17;enddefault=2006-12-03;end=2006-12-03;tourneyid=0;finals=0;daynight=0;toss=0;scheduledovers=0;scheduleddays=0;innings=0;result=0;followon=0;seriesresult=0;captain=0;keeper=0;dnp=0;recent=;viewtype=aro_series;runslow=;runshigh=;batposition=0;dismissal=0;bowposition=0;ballslow=;ballshigh=;bpof=0;overslow=;overshigh=;conclow=;conchigh=;wicketslow=;wicketshigh=;dismissalslow=;dismissalshigh=;caughtlow=;caughthigh=;caughttype=0;stumpedlow=;stumpedhigh=;csearch=;submit=1;.cgifields=viewtype |accessdate=2007-01-17 |publisher=[[Cricinfo]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In all, he took 18 ODI wickets at an average of 27.2 during the 1998.&lt;ref name=&quot;odicareer&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title= Statsguru – Harbhajan Singh – ODIs – Career summary|url= http://stats.cricinfo.com/guru?sdb=player;playerid=7139;class=odiplayer;filter=basic;team=0;opposition=0;notopposition=0;season=0;homeaway=0;continent=0;country=0;notcountry=0;groundid=0;startdefault=1998-04-17;start=1998-04-17;enddefault=2006-12-03;end=2006-12-03;tourneyid=0;finals=0;daynight=0;toss=0;scheduledovers=0;scheduleddays=0;innings=0;result=0;followon=0;seriesresult=0;captain=0;keeper=0;dnp=0;recent=;viewtype=aro_summary;runslow=;runshigh=;batposition=0;dismissal=0;bowposition=0;ballslow=;ballshigh=;bpof=0;overslow=;overshigh=;conclow=;conchigh=;wicketslow=;wicketshigh=;dismissalslow=;dismissalshigh=;caughtlow=;caughthigh=;caughttype=0;stumpedlow=;stumpedhigh=;csearch=;submit=1;.cgifields=viewtype |accessdate=2007-01-17 |publisher=[[Cricinfo]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

After taking 2/38 and 3/60 in an innings win in a tour match, Harbhajan was retained in the Test team, taking 2/42 and 3/63 in the only Test on the Zimbabwe tour. He was unbeaten on 15 in the second innings as the final wicket fell and India succumbed to a 51-run defeat.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; 

Returning to India, Harbhajan started the 1998–99 domestic season well, taking 3/54 and 5/39 in an innings win over Services, before following up with 6/69 and 1/93 in the next match against Delhi, claiming his first five-wicket innings haul. He then took 6/63 and scored 31 in the first innings of a match for the Board PResident's XI against a touring West Indies A, and was taken on the tour of New Zealand in December.

Harbhajan was not part of the ODI squad for the Australian tour and upon returning to India in early-2000 needed strong first-class results to maintain his Test position. He went wicketless against Hyderabad, and was selected for the Board President's XI match against the touring South Africans.

Following his run-ins with Indian cricket administrators, there was nothing to indicate that Harbhajan's chances of national selection had improved at the start of 2000–01. Despite Kumble being injured, Harbhajan was again overlooked as Kartik, [[Sunil Joshi]], and debutant [[Sarandeep Singh]] were entrusted with the spin bowling duties in Test matches against Bangladesh and Zimbabwe on the subcontinent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =India in Bangladesh, 2000/01 Test Match Averages | url=http://aus.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/2000-01/IND_IN_BDESH/IND_IN_BDESH_NOV2000_TEST_AVS.html| publisher=[[Cricinfo]]|accessdate=2007-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Zimbabwe in India, 2000/01 Test Series Averages| url=http://aus.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/2000-01/ZIM_IN_IND/STATS/ZIM_IN_IND_NOV-DEC2000_TEST_AVS.html|publisher=[[Cricinfo]]|accessdate=2007-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having made little success in this phase of his international career, averaging 37.75 per Test wicket to date, and overlooked by selectors, Harbhajan faced a difficult decision.&lt;ref name=&quot;testsum&quot;/&gt; His father had recently died; as the family's only son, Harbhajan was now obliged to support his mother and unmarried sisters.

During the first half of the season, still in international exile, Harbhajan continued to pick up wickets on the domestic circuit. In five Ranji Trophy matches, he claimed 28 wickets at 13.96. He claimed 3/29 and 3/39 against Himachal Pradesh, 2/53 and 5/88 against Jammu and Kashmir, 4/77 and 2/33 against Haryana and 5/40 against Services in the first four matches, all of which ended in innings wins for Punjab. He then took a total of 4/32 in a 199-run win over Delhi. Harbhajan's batting, which had rarely been productive up to this point in his career, also improved. He scored a career-best 84 against Haryana and added 52 against Services, aggregating 207 runs at 51.75.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; After taking eight wickets at 21.12 in six one-dayers, Harbhajan was selected for North in the Duleep Trophy, but his early-season form deserted him. He took five wickets at 39.00 in two matches, although he did continue his productive run with the bat, scoring 130 runs at 32.50 with three scores above 35.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;

== Later career ==
Harbhajan's Test success saw him recalled to the ODI team after more than two years. He was unable to reproduce his Test form against Australia, managing only four wickets at an average of 59.25 and economy rate of 5.04. His best performance was a 3/37 in a 118-run win in the third match, and a cameo batting performance of 46 runs from 34 balls, including three sixes, in a losing run chase in the fourth fixture. He was dropped from the ODI team during a subsequent triangular tournament in [[Zimbabwe]] in 2001 after only managing two wickets at 69.00 in four matches although he had been economical at 3.63 runs an over.&lt;ref name=&quot;odiseries&quot;/&gt; Harbhajan was also unable to maintain his form in the [[Indian cricket team in Zimbabwe in 2001|Test series against Zimbabwe]]. Harbhajan began the tour well with 13 wickets in two warm-up matches, including a match haul of 10/80 against the CFX Academy, but could not repeate such performances in the Tests. He took eight wickets at 29.12 in the two-Test series, which was drawn 1–1, but did manage to post his first Test half-century, reaching 66 in the First Test in [[Bulawayo]], before scoring 31 in the first innings of the Second Test as the Indian batsmen struggled and ceded their series lead.&lt;ref name=&quot;testseries&quot;/&gt; The Indians subsequently [[Indian cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2001|toured Sri Lanka]] in mid-2001, enjoying spinning wickets similar to those in India. Harbhajan managed to establish himself in the ODI team with eleven wickets at 21.18 at the low economy rate of 3.42 in seven matches in the ODI tournament with the hosts and New Zealand. Ironically however, his best performances, in which he conceded less than 30 runs in his ten overs three times, all ended in Indian defeats.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; In contrast to his ODI improvement, Harbhajan's Test form deteriorated further, yielding only four wickets at 73.00 in three Tests, while Sri Lankan spinner [[Muttiah Muralitharan]] was named man of the series with 23 wickets, in what was billed as a contest between the world's two leading off-spinners.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbcfire&quot;/&gt; With the Tests locked at 1–1 Harbhajan managed only 2/185 in the Third Test as the hosts accumulated 6/610 declared and won by an innings. He scored 79 runs at 15.80 for the series.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;

Harbhajan was omitted from the Indian team in favour of Kumble as the first-choice spinner on the following [[Indian cricket team in South Africa in 2001-02|tour of South Africa]], only playing in the later matches when India fielded two spinners. Nevertheless, Harbhajan continued to do well in the ODIs, taking nine wickets at 20.44 in six matches at an economy rate of 3.53, winning his first man of the match award in the ODI form in an ODI against South Africa in [[Bloemfontein]] after taking 3/27 from his ten overs.&lt;ref name=&quot;odiseries&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;testseries&quot;/&gt; He scored 62 runs at 15.50, including a rearguard 37 that was not enough to prevent an embarrassing 70-run loss to Kenya.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; After being omitted for the First Test, which India lost, his disciplinary problems continued when he was one of four Indian players fined and given a suspended one match suspension for dissent and attempting to intimidate the umpire by over-appealing in the Second Test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=  2001: Penalties imposed on players for breaches of ICC Code of Conduct| url= http://www.icc-cricket.com/icc/rules/penalties/2001.html| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070224002402/http://www.icc-cricket.com/icc/rules/penalties/2001.html| archivedate=24 February 2007|publisher=[[International Cricket Council]]| accessdate =2007-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; India managed to draw the match, but Harbhajan struggled and took 1/89 and 2/79. The off spinner continued his poor overseas Test form in what would have been the Third Test. However, India defied the ICC by playing banned batsman [[Virender Sehwag]], while [[Mike Denness]], the match referee who handed down the penalties, was locked out of the stadium, so the match was stripped of Test status. Harbhajan continued to be ineffective, taking only 1/104, although he showed resistance with the bat, scoring 29 and 30 when many specialist batsmen failed, as India slumped to an innings defeat.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;

Harbhajan's Test fortunes improved immediately upon the start of the 2001–02 international season in India. Playing in his first international match at his home ground in [[Mohali]], [[Punjab (India)|Punjab]], Harbhajan took match figures of 7/110, including 5/51 in the first innings, to help India win the First Test by ten wickets against the [[English cricket team in India in 2001-02|touring English team]]. He continued his steady form throughout the series with another five wicket haul in the Second Test in [[Ahmedabad]], to end with thirteen wickets at 24.53 for the series, although he went wicketless in 27.1 overs in the Third and final Test.&lt;ref name=&quot;testlist&quot;/&gt; Harbhajan's good home form persisted in the [[Zimbabwean cricket team in India in 2001-02|Test matches against Zimbabwe]], taking twelve wickets at 19.66 in two games.&lt;ref name=&quot;testseries&quot;/&gt; In the First Test, he took 4/46 in the second innings to seal an innings victory after going wicketless in the second innings.

Harbhajan's overseas difficulties returned during the [[Indian cricket team in West Indies in 2001-02|tour]] of the [[West Indies]] in mid-2002. He injured his shoulder while fielding in a tour match in which he started well with a total of 5/70,&lt;ref name=o/&gt; and was forced to miss the First Test in [[Guyana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = Harbhajan on the mend| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/cricket/specials/west_indies_v_india/1932305.stm|publisher=BBC  | date = 16 April 2002| accessdate =2007-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; After taking only six wickets at 38 upon his return to the team for the Second and Third Tests, he was dropped for the Fourth Test, but was recalled again for the Fifth Test at [[Sabina Park]], after Kumble was injured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = Harbhajan set for recall| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/cricket/specials/west_indies_v_india/1991638.stm |publisher=BBC  | date = 16 May 2002| accessdate =2007-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite taking improved match figures figures of 8/180, including 5/138 in the first innings, Harbhajan was unable to prevent an Indian defeat after the batting collapsed in the first innings.&lt;ref name=&quot;testlist&quot;/&gt; He claimed three wickets in the three match ODI series at 33.00, conceding 4.71 runs per over.&lt;ref name=&quot;odiseries&quot;/&gt; 

Despite his performance at Sabina Park, Harbhajan was dropped again when Kumble returned for the First Test on the [[Indian cricket team in England in 2002|tour]] to England at [[Lord's]], where the hosts prevailed. India's coach [[John Wright (cricketer)|John Wright]] later admitted that Harbhajan's omission had been a mistake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = Harbhajan waits on weather| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/cricket/england/2174337.stm|publisher=BBC  | date = 2 August 2002| accessdate =2007-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harbhajan returned for the final three Tests with moderate success, taking 12 wickets at 34.16, improving as the English summer wore on. After claiming 3/175 in the drawn Second Test, he struck form in the tour match against [[Essex CCC|Essex]], taking 7/83 and 1/23. He then took 3/40 and 1/56 as India levelled the series in the Third Test at Headingley, before taking 5/115 in the first innings of the Fourth Test at [[The Oval]], as well as managing his second Test half-century of 54 at [[Trent Bridge]] in the Second Test.&lt;ref name = &quot;testseries&quot;/&gt; He ended the series with 90 runs at 22.50. for the entire tour, Harbhajan aggregated 28 wickets at 27.60.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; Harbhajan had modest results in the Natwest Trophy. After being dropped after one wicketless match, he was dropped and then took 4/46 against Sri Lanka in the last match before the final to ensure his retention, but went wicketless in the decider, which India won. He played in three ODIs and took four wickets at 37.25 at 4.96.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;

The [[2002 ICC Champions Trophy]] in Sri Lanka at the end of the tour brought moderate results with six wickets at 30.66 at an economy rate of only 3.68,&lt;ref name=&quot;testseries&quot;/&gt; and a best of 3/27 from ten overs in the firstwashed out final against the host nation.&lt;ref name=&quot;odiseries&quot;/&gt; Harbhajan helped restrict Sri Lanka to 5/244, but rain ended proceedings with India at 0/14.

This time the hosts made 7/222 and a downpour again thwarted the players, with India at 1/38 when play was called off and the trophy shared.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;

As was the case in the previous season, Harbhajan's return to Indian soil coincided with an improvement in results. He took 1/37 and 7/48 in an innings victory at [[Mumbai]] in the First Test against the [[West Indies cricket team|West Indies]], and then contributed match figures of 3/56, 4/79 and 37 in an eight-wicket victory in [[Chennai]] which saw him named man of the match.&lt;ref name=&quot;testaward&quot;/&gt; A haul of 5/115 in the Third Test at [[Calcutta]] was the best in a high scoring match, and with 20 wickets at 16.75 and 69 runs at 17.25, Harbhajan was named as the man of the [[West Indian cricket team in India in 2002-03|series]].&lt;ref name=&quot;testawards&quot;/&gt; He was unable to transfer his performances to the ODI format, taking only five wickets at 49.00 against the same team at an economy rate of 5.44.&lt;ref name=&quot;odiseries&quot;/&gt; Harbhajan took only five wickets at 18.80 in the subsequent [[Indian cricket team in New Zealand in 2002-03|Test tour]] to New Zealand, in a series where five pace bowlers averaged less than 20 on green, seaming tracks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = India in New Zealand, 2002–03 Test Series Averages| url=http://www.cricinfo.com/link_to_database/ARCHIVE/2002-03/IND_IN_NZ/STATS/IND_IN_NZ_DEC2002-JAN2003_TEST_AVS.html| publisher=[[Cricinfo]] | accessdate =2007-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first=Lynn| last=McConnell |title =Sideways movement taking batsmen out of the game – Fleming| url=http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/113308.html| publisher=[[Cricinfo]] | date = 22 December 2002| accessdate =2007-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; India lost the series 2–0 and Harbhajan's 20 and 18 in the Second Test amounted for more than 15% of India's match total.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; The off spinner then took 1/56 in one ODI before heading for his World Cup debut in South Africa.

Harbhajan had a mixed tournament at the [[2003 Cricket World Cup]], taking 11 wickets at 30.45 with an economy rate of 3.92 in ten matches. He was the first-choice spinner and played in all matches but one, being dropped for the victory against arch-rivals [[Pakistan cricket team|Pakistan]] in the group phase.

Harbhajan was under pressure to perform when [[Sri Lankan cricket team in India in 2005-06|Sri Lanka toured India]] in late 2005 following his attack on Chappell and the replacement of Ganguly, who had frequently supported him during previous career difficulties, with new captain [[Rahul Dravid]].

2006 began with Harbhajan's first [[Indian cricket team in Pakistan in 2005-06|tour]] to arch-rivals Pakistan.

A return to Indian soil for the [[English cricket team in India in 2005-06|Test series]] against England failed to ease Harbhajan's wicket-taking difficulties.

After easing into the season with six wickets in the first two first-class matches, Harbhajan a rich vein of form, taking 4/64 and 5/64 against [[Worcestershire CCC|Worcestershire]], before following up with 5/34 and 6/57 against [[Kent CCC|Kent]], finishing off by scoring 29 to help guide Surrey home by four wickets after they had stumbled in pursuit of 107.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; He ended the first-class campaign with five and six wickets against [[Durham CCC|Durham]] and [[Hampshire CCC|Hampshire]] respectively and totalled 37 wickets at 18.54 in only six outings.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; He was not so successful in the one-dayers, taking six wickets at 29.50 and an economy rate of 4.65 in five matches.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;

== Recall ==
Harbhajan returned to international cricket as part of India's squad for the [[ICC World Twenty20]] tournament in South Africa in September 2007, which India won, having been rank outsiders at the start of the tournament with many senior players opting out of the competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Dileep |last=Premachandran| title=India hold their nerve to win thriller |url=http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/twenty20wc/content/current/story/312320.html |date=27 September 2007 |accessdate=2008-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; He played in all six of India's matches and totalled seven wickets at 26.00 and an economy rate of 7.91. In the opening pool match against Pakistan, Harbhajan hit the stumps in a bowl-out after scores were tied; India won 3–0 after three rounds. In the semi-final against Australia, Harbhajan bowled [[Michael Clarke (cricketer)|Michael Clarke]] and conceded only three runs in his final over, the 18th of the match, to turn the match towards India. The final against Pakistan was the only match in which Harbhajan did not bowl his full quota of four overs, after being struck for three sixes in his third over by [[Misbah-Ul-Haq]], who led a late charge towards the target. India prevailed by five runs in the final over, Misbah being the last man to fall.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;

Harbhajan was recalled to the ODI squad during India's home season in 2006–07, which comprised series against Australia and Pakistan. In ten ODIs, he took seven wickets at 61.71 and an economy rate of 4.59, much higher than his career average.&lt;ref name=&quot;odiseries&quot;/&gt; He scored 101 runs at 33.66 in these matches, including an unbeaten 38 in one match against Pakistan.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; He was then recalled to the Test squad, and with India fielding two spinners in its home series against Pakistan, Harbhajan accompanied Kumble in all three Tests.&lt;ref name=&quot;testlist&quot;/&gt; Playing in Tests for the first time in 16 months, he took 10 wickets at 44.10, much higher than his career average in India.&lt;ref name=&quot;testseries&quot;/&gt; His best result was 5/122 in the first innings of the Second Test at Eden Gardens.&lt;ref name=&quot;testlist&quot;/&gt; He toured Australia and played in three of the four Tests—India persisted with two spinners in all venues except for the Third Test at the pace-friendly [[WACA Ground]].&lt;ref name=&quot;testlist&quot;/&gt; As he was during his previous visits to Australia, Harbhajan was ineffective with the ball. In the First Test in Melbourne, he took match figures of 3/162, before taking 4/200 in the Second Test in Sydney. Upon his recall in Adelaide, he took 1/128 in Australia's only innings on a placid surface, ending the series with eight wickets at 61.25.&lt;ref name=testlist/&gt; However, he did manage to take Ponting's wicket for three consecutive innings in the first two Tests, leading to much speculation about the Australian captain's difficulties against the off spinner. After the third dismissal in the Sydney Test, Harbhajan celebrated by running a distance before twice rolling over on the ground. Harbhajan's most noted contribution with the bat came in the Second Test when he came to the crease with India at 345/7, still 118 runs behind Australia, after a middle-order collapse of 4/52. He made 63 runs in a 129-run partnership with Tendulkar, which enabled India to gain a first-innings lead. In the Fourth Test, he came to the crease at 7/359 and scored 63 in a 107-run rearguard partnership with captain Kumble, allowing India to reach 529. He failed to reach double figures in his four other innings and ended with 142 runs at 23.66.&lt;ref name=testlist/&gt;

==Altercations with Andrew Symonds and Sreesanth ==
{{see also|Second Test, 2007–08 Border-Gavaskar Trophy }}
While Harbhajan was batting during his 63 on the third day of the Second Test at the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]], he became involved in an altercation with Australia's [[Andrew Symonds]]. As a result of this, he was charged with a Level 3 offence of racially abusing Symonds by calling the Australian—of Caribbean descent—a &quot;monkey&quot;. Harbhajan and Tendulkar, his batting partner at the time of the incident, denied this.&lt;ref name=&quot;ban&quot;&gt;{{cite news

On 29 January, following the Fourth Test, the appeal hearing was conducted in [[Adelaide]] by ICC Appeals Commissioner Justice [[John William Hansen|John Hansen]]. The result was that the racism charge was not proved, resulting in the revocation of the three-Test ban imposed by Procter. However, Harbhajan was found guilty of using abusive language and fined 50% of his match fee. Hansen later admitted he &quot;could have imposed a more serious penalty if he was made aware by the ICC of the bowler's previous transgressions&quot;—including a suspended one-Test ban.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In the aftermath of the hearing, Hayden called Harbhajan an &quot;obnoxious weed&quot; during a radio interview, which earned him a code of conduct violation charge from [[Cricket Australia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;charge&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/cricket/hayden-charged-for-obnoxious-weed-comments-788156.html|work=The Independent |location=UK |title=Hayden charged for 'obnoxious weed' comments|first=Julian |last=Linden|date=27 February 2008|accessdate=2008-02-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the appeal, Harbhajan played in all eight of India's round-robin matches in the Commonwealth Bank series, which also involved Sri Lanka, taking five wickets at 39.00. In the two finals matches, Australia suffered a top-order collapse and lost their first three wickets with only 24 and 32 runs on the board respectively. Symonds and Hayden—with whom Harbhajan clashed during the summer—led a recovery with stands of 100 and 89 respectively. In both matches, Harbhajan had a hand in removing both of his bitter opponents. In the first final in Sydney, he removed both in the space of four overs, caught from his bowling. In the second final in Brisbane, he completed the run out of Hayden after a mix-up, and then trapped Symonds leg before wicket in the same over. Australia lost the momentum and their run-rate slowed, and India went on to win the series 2–0.&lt;ref name=odilist/&gt; Harbhajan ended with 2/38 and 1/44 from his 10 overs in the respective matches.

Following the tour of Australia, India hosted South Africa in a three-Test series. The First Test in Chennai was a high-scoring draw in which 1,498 runs were scored for the loss of 25 wickets. Harbhajan was the top wicket-taker for the match, with figures of 5/161 and 3/101. In the Second Test in Ahmedabad, he was India's leading wicket-taker for the third consecutive innings, taking 4/135 as the home team lost by an innings. With India needing a win in the Third Test in Kanpur to avoid series defeat, Harbhajan again took the leading bowling figures in both innings, with 3/52 and 4/44. His second innings effort helped bowl out the tourists for 121 and set up an eight-wicket win. As a result of his efforts, Harbhajan was named man-of-the-series, having taken 19 wickets at 25.94.&lt;ref name=testlist/&gt; In contrast to his efforts in Australia, he struggled with the bat, scoring 11 runs at 2.75. He was troubled by South African paceman [[Dale Steyn]], who dismissed him all four times by breaking through his defences, bowling him once and trapping him lbw the other three times.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;

Harbhajan was involved in further controversy after an [[2008 Indian Premier League]] (IPL) match between [[Mumbai Indians]] and [[Kings XI Punjab]] at [[Mohali]] in April 2008. While the teams were shaking hands, he slapped Punjab paceman and Indian team-mate [[Sreesanth]] in the face.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = Bhajji slaps, Sree sobs | url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1080426/jsp/frontpage/story_9191426.jsp| publisher=[[The Telegraph (Kolkata)|''The Telegraph'']]| date = 24 April 2008| accessdate =2008-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harbhajan, who had stood in as the Mumbai captain for the first three matches of the tournament to that point, all of which were lost, had apparently been angered by Sreesanth's aggressive sending-off of his batsmen as Punjab coasted to a decisive victory.

He would have been eligible for selection after the first two matches of the Asia Cup, but the selectors omitted him entirely.

== International revival ==

Harbhajan returned to international cricket for the tour of Sri Lanka in July and August. In the First Test at Colombo, he took 2/149 as Sri Lanka amassed 600/6 declared and won by an innings. In the Second Test in Galle, he took 6/102 to help India take a first innings lead of 37 and then took 4/51 in the second innings to help India level the series with a 170-run win. It was his fifth ten-wicket match haul and his first outside India. He was again India's leading wicket-taker in the Third Test defeat, with 3/104 and 1/44. He was India's leading wicket-taker with 16 scalps at 28.12, twice as many the second most-prolific Indian.&lt;ref name=testlist/&gt; In the subsequent ODI series, he played in the first four matches, taking six wickets at 18.83 at an economy rate of 3.80, including 3/40 in the win in the fourth match, which sealed the series. He was rested from the final [[dead rubber]].&lt;ref name=odilist/&gt;

At the start of the Indian season, Harbhajan took 2/32 and 4/31 as the Rest of India defeated Delhi in the [[Irani Trophy]].&lt;ref name=o/&gt; This was followed by the First Test against Australia in Bangalore. Harbhajan took Ponting's wicket in taking 1/103 in the first innings, but not before the Australian captain had scored 123. In reply to Australia's 430, India were in trouble at 195/6 when Harbhajan came in to bat. He scored a rearguard 54, putting on 80 with fellow bowler [[Zaheer Khan]], to reduce India's deficit to 70. He then took 2/76 in the second innings as the match ended in a draw.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; Ponting later cited Harbhajan and Zaheer's partnership as the passage of play that prevented an Australian win. In the Second Test at his home ground in Mohali, Harbhajan took 2/60 in the first innings as India took a 201-run first innings lead.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; In the second innings Australia were chasing 516 for victory and had started aggressively, reaching 49/0 after seven overs. Harbhajan was introduced into the attack and removed Hayden and [[Simon Katich]] in his first over and then [[Mike Hussey]] in his next. This triggered Australia's collapse to 58/5 and their eventual defeat by 320 runs. Harbhajan was unable to find a fourth wicket, which would have seen him reach 300 Test wickets on his home ground, and ended with 3/36. He was then ruled out of the drawn Third Test because of a toe injury. Harbhajan returned for the Fourth Test in Nagpur and dismissed Ponting for the tenth time in Tests in the first innings to register his 300th wicket. He ended with 3/94 as India took an 86-run lead. However, a batting collapse meant that India were 6/166 at tea on day four, only 252 runs ahead and facing possible defeat if Australia could clean up the tail quickly. Harbhajan then scored 52, combining in a 107-run partnership with captain [[Mahendra Singh Dhoni]] to guide India out of trouble. India then successfully defended the target of 380 to win by 172 runs, with Harbhajan taking 4/64 including top-scorer Hayden and the final wicket. Harbhajan was the equal-leading wicket-taker for the series along with [[Ishant Sharma]], taking 15 wickets at 28.86.&lt;ref name=testlist/&gt; He also scored 125 runs at 41.66, helping to prevent two defeats.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; The series also saw the end of Harbhajan's partnership with Kumble, who missed the Second Test due to injury and then retired after suffering another wound in the next match. As a result, Harbhajan started a new pairing with leg spinner [[Amit Mishra]].

In the five-match home ODI series against England, Harbhajan took seven wickets at 30.29 and an economy rate of 5.04 as India won 5–0. He took one wicket in each of the matches, except the third match in Kanpur. In that match, he took 3/31, registered his 200th ODI wicket and was named man-of-the match.&lt;ref name=odilist/&gt; During the two Tests, Harbhajan was the equal-leading wicket-taker with eight wickets at 35.00 and he also scored 69 runs at 34.50.&lt;ref name=testlist/&gt; This included a 40 in the first innings of the First Test to help India reach 241 after a top-order collapse, keeping India's deficit to 75; they went on to win the match.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; Harbhajan ended the year as the third-highest wicket-taker in the world, and the highest among Indian players. He was named by ''[[Wisden]]'' in their selection of the Test team of the year.

Harbhajan then missed the ODI tour of Sri Lanka at the beginning of the year with a hamstring injury. He recovered in time to be recalled for the tour of New Zealand. Harbhajan was the leading wicket-taker from both sides in both ODIs and Tests. Harbhajan was India's most economical bowler in the two T20 internationals at the start of the tour, taking a total of 2/34 from eight overs and scoring 21 in the first match; the hosts prevailed in both games. In series that saw four of the five ODIs truncated by rain, Harbhajan took five wickets at 29.60 at an economy rate of 5.69. He took 3/27 in the opening match, and then took 2/56 from ten overs in the third game, in which both teams passed 330, helping India to wins in both matches.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; In the First Test, Harbhajan took 1/57 and 6/63 to help set up a ten-wicket win. It was only the second time that he had taken five wickets in an innings outside the subcontinent. However, he was disappointing in a high-scoring draw in the Second Test, taking 2/120 as the hosts amassed 9/619 declared. In the Third Test, India suffered a middle-order collapse on the first afternoon, and a counterattacking 60 by Harbhajan helped them to 379. He then took 3/43 and 4/59; New Zealand had only two wickets in hand when rain caused the match to end in a draw with more than a day's playing time lost. Harbhajan ended with 16 wickets at 21.37 and 94 runs at 23.50.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;

India won both series, their first series win in New Zealand since 1981 and 1968 for ODIs and Tests respectively.

Harbhajan then played the full [[2009 Indian Premier League]] season in South Africa, taking 12 wickets at 21.33 and an economy rate of 5.81 in 13 matches. He was one of the most economical bowlers in the competition, and took 1/9 in four overs against Punjab to win the man of the match award. He ended the season with 4/17 against Delhi, but it was not enough to prevent a four-wicket defeat.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;

Harbhajan was part of the Indian team that attempted to defend their crown at the [[2009 World Twenty20]]. However they lost all three of their matches in the Super 8s round and were eliminated. Harbhajan took 3/30 in one of those matches against England, and ended the tournament with five wickets at 26.20 and an economy rate of 6.55.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; During the tour of the West Indies that followed, Harbhajan took three wickets at 45.33, conceding almost a run a ball in three ODIs as India prevailed 2–1.

In September, Harbhajan took 5/56 in the final of the Compaq Cup to help secure a 46-run Indian win over the hosts Sri Lanka. It was his first five-wicket haul in three years and capped off a tournament in which he took six wickets at 22.00 in three matches. He then struggled at the [[2009 ICC Champions Trophy]] in South Africa, taking 1/71 from ten overs against Pakistan and 0/54 from nine overs against Australia. India lost to Pakistan and the latter match was washed out. He then took 2/14 from eight overs against the West Indies, but it was not enough to prevent India from being eliminated in the first round, despite winning the match.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;

[[File:Harbhajan Singh bowling against Australia, October 2010.jpg|thumb|Harbhajan bowling during India's two-match Test series against Australia in October 2010.]]
After his travails in South Africa, Harbhajan started the Indian season with eight wickets at 12.87 in three Challenger Trophy one-dayers for India Blue.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; He then played in a home ODI series against Australia taking eight wickets at 33.87 at an economy rate of 4.51 in six games. This included a best of 2/23 in the sixth match, but he made a more influential contribution in the first match with the bat, striking 49 at the death as India came within striking distance of their target before he fell in the last over and the hosts ended five runs adrift of the target. He scored a similarly rapid 31 in the fourth match, but India fell 24 runs short. Harbhajan ended the series with 81 runs at 20.25.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;

In the three home Tests against Sri Lanka, Harbhajan was the highest wicket-taker with 13 scalps, but these came at an average cost of 41.00. After taking 2/189 in the drawn First Test, he aggregated 5/152 and 6/192 as India took the next two fixtures by an innings.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; In the subsequent ODI series, he took six wickets at 35.00 at an economy rate of 4.88 as India won 3–1. He took 2/58 from his ten overs in th first match, which proved to be tidy in the context of a match in which both teams passed 410 and India prevailed by three runs.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;

During the tri-series in Bangladesh in January 2010, Harbhajan took six wickets at 24.00 in three matches. He missed the First Test due to neck pain but returned to take a total of 2/123 as India completed a clean sweep with a ten-wicket win in the Second Test.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;

During New Zealand's tour of India in November 2010, Harbhajan scored his maiden Test century during the First Test in Ahmedabad. This was the 100th century by an Indian in the second innings and he reached triple figures with a six. His 115, along with Laxman's 91 saved the game for India after they had collapsed to 5/15. Harbhajan was named man of the match. He followed on in the next test with 111* in India's 1st innings, becoming the first no. 8 batsman to score back-to-back test centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.espncricinfo.com/india-v-new-zealand-2010/content/story/487144.html India v New Zealand: Brendon McCullum leads New Zealand's quest for safety | India v New Zealand, 2nd Test, Hyderabad, 4th day Report | Cricket News | ESPN Cricinfo&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

After an ordinary performance with the ball in the 5-match ODI series in West Indies in June 2011 (where he was the [[captain (cricket)|vice captain]] to skipper [[Suresh Raina]]) (took 4 wickets from 3 matches, best of 3/32), he helped his team revive from dire straits in the 1st Test in [[Sabina Park]] at [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]], Jamaica. With India struggling at 85/6, he along with [[Suresh Raina]] initiated a counter-attack to string an aggressive 146-run partnership with [[Suresh Raina]](82 of 115 balls, 15 fours) to help India reach 246. Harbhajan scored 70 from 74 balls (10 fours, 1 six).

== 2011 Exclusion ==
Following a few poor performances, Harbhajan was injured in India's tour of England in the summer/monsoon of 2011 and was ruled out of the rest of the series.  He returned to competitive cricket to lead the [[Mumbai Indians]] to [[2011 Champions League]] title, but fell out of favor with the national selectors.  He was not chosen in the squad against West Indies and was excluded from the Australian tour as well. Mumbai Indians won their first ever championship under his captaincy. MI won Champions league by 31 runs. Harbhajan was man of the match for his contribution.

Among off spinners, Harbhajan is the second highest wicket-taker in Test history, behind [[Muttiah Muralitharan]] of Sri Lanka. He is the third-highest Test wicket-taker among all Indians.&lt;ref name=&quot;report&quot;/&gt; Harbhajan [[bowling average|average]] with the ball in home Test matches hovers in the mid-20s.

Harbhajan's off spin complements Kumble's leg spin. While Harbhajan is known for his emotional and extroverted celebrations, which are part of a deliberate strategy of aggression, Kumble is known for his undemonstrative and composed approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first= Vijay| last=Lokapally| title=Contrasting styles of the spin masters| url=http://www.hindu.com/2004/11/19/stories/2004111904521700.htm|work=The Hindu |location=India | date=18 November 2004| accessdate=2007-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both spinners have opined that they bowl more effectively in tandem via persistent application of pressure to batsmen, but statistics have shown that while Kumble has performed better when paired with Harbhajan, Harbhajan has been more effective in Kumble's absence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first= S| last=Rajesh| title=Indian spin twins in tandem, and Murali magic in England| url=http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/columns/content/story/249982.html| publisher=[[Cricinfo]] | date=9 June 2006| accessdate=2007-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harbhajan has been particularly successful against Australian batsman [[Ricky Ponting]], taking his wicket on ten occasions in Test cricket.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title= Krejza's eight and Harbhajan's 300| url=http://content-www.cricinfo.com/indvaus2008/content/story/377345.html|date=7 November 2008|accessdate=2008-11-12|publisher=[[Cricinfo]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview in 2001, Harbhajan stated his ambition to become an [[all-rounder]].&lt;ref name=&quot;allround&quot;&gt;{{cite news| title= Harbhajan aims to be an all-rounder| url=http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/india/content/story/103792.html|date=28 June 2001|accessdate=2007-01-15|publisher=[[Cricinfo]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he has recorded a few half-centuries at Test level, his [[batting average]] hovers around 15 in both Tests and ODIs. However, in the span of four years starting from 2003, he has shown improved performance, averaging around 20 with the bat.&lt;ref name=&quot;testsum&quot;/&gt; His style is frequently described as unorthodox, with pundits agreeing with his self-assessment attributing his batting achievements to his hand-eye coordination, rather than his footwork or technique.&lt;ref name=&quot;tail&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;allround&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title= India Squad Profiles – Harbhajan Singh| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/in_depth/2001/india_in_south_africa/india_squad_profiles/1569256.stm|publisher=BBC  | accessdate=2007-02-28 | date=28 September 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aggression in Harbhajan's bowling also extends to his batting, with a Test [[strike rate]] in the 60s, placing him in the ten highest strike rates among players who have scored more than 1000 runs in Test cricket.&lt;ref name=&quot;profile&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Best batting strike rate |url=http://www.icc-cricket.com/test/stats/bat_best_strike_rate.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070220113218/http://www.icc-cricket.com/test/stats/bat_best_strike_rate.html |archivedate=20 February 2007 |publisher=[[International Cricket Council]]| accessdate=2007-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Players with Best Scoring Rate (Min 1000 Runs) |url=http://howstat.com.au/cricket/Statistics/Batting/BattingAverages.asp?Stat=3 |publisher=[[International Cricket Council]]| accessdate=2008-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harbhajan Singh Is also a useful lower-down the order batsman. For mumbai Indians he had made valuable 49 runs of 18 balls to guide the MI to a seemingly impossible win over the DC. In the 2011 test, he also scored quickfire 70 of 72 balls to stabilise India's batting
