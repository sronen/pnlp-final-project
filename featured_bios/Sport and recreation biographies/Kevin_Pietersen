He is a right-handed [[batsman]] and occasional [[off spin]] [[Bowler (cricket)|bowler]] who plays for [[England cricket team|England]] and [[Surrey County Cricket Club|Surrey]]. He had also played for [[Indian Premier League]] team [[Royal Challengers Bangalore]] for its second and third seasons, captaining the side in his first, prior to being bought by the [[Deccan Chargers]] for the fourth season of the competition. He was captain of the England [[Test cricket|Test]] and [[One Day International]] teams from 4 August 2008 to 7 January 2009 but resigned after just three tests and nine One Day Internationals, following a dispute with England coach [[Peter Moores (cricketer)|Peter Moores]], who was sacked the same day.&lt;ref name=kpout&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/england/7815038.stm |title= England captain Pietersen resigns |publisher=BBC Sport   |date=7 January 2008 |accessdate=7 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pietersen had a less successful time in the three Test matches against [[Pakistan national cricket team|Pakistan]], which England lost 2–0. He made little impact in the first and third test. His first Test match innings since his match winning 158 against Australia was brief as he was caught at short leg for 5. In the second innings, he was criticised for his dismissal. Chasing just 198, he was caught behind after a horrible slog on 19 as England went onto lose by 22 runs. In the third test, he made 34 before edging behind in the first innings. With England indifficulty, Pietersen edged [[Danish Kaneria]] to short leg when only on one, as England were to be defeated by an innings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/2005-06/ENG_IN_PAK/SCORECARDS/ENG_PAK_T1_12-16NOV2005.html Pakistan v England First Test, 12–16 November 2005], Cricinfo.

He pulled a ball from [[Sreesanth]] onto his stumps. His 87 in the second innings of the first match came during England's acceleration period, helping push the required target over 300.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/2005-06/ENG_IN_IND/SCORECARDS/ENG_IND_T1_01-05MAR2006_BBB-COMMS.html India v England, First Test, 1–5 March 2005 Ball-by-ball commentary], Cricinfo; Retrieved on 30 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt; England then declared overnight, and India successfully batted out the final day to secure a draw.

This took him past the milestone of 1,000 Test runs, in his 12th Test match, and he became the first batsman since [[Graham Gooch]] in 1990 to score a century in three successive Test innings on English soil.&lt;ref&gt;Kumar, Manish. &quot;[http://www.cricketzone.com/news/news_columns/2007-03-08-98.html Will England rise from the Ashes for the World Cup?]&quot;, cricketzone.com, 8 March 2007.

=== England in Australia, 2006–07 ===
{{See also|2006-07 Ashes series|English cricket team in Australia in 2006–07}}
In the much-anticipated Ashes series in Australia, Pietersen was hyped up as England's best player and this was justified as he scored 490 runs in five matches and averaged over fifty, despite Australia's obvious targeting of him.  &quot;I was interested to see how he would get on in Australia in 2006–07 on pitches with more bounce&quot;, wrote Warne, &quot;because bowlers had tried to test him with the short ball. He was still England's best batsman.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Warne 2008&quot;&gt;Warne 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

He started well, in the First Test. Despite a failure of 16 in the first test, he produced a fine spell of batting with a good 92 in the second innings. This wasn't enough to save England from a 277 run defeat.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/england/6185580.stm Australia v England – 1st Test]&quot;, BBC Sport, 27 November 2006.

When he was eventually run out, his first reaction was to &quot;giggle&quot; because it was the third time in his Test career that he had scored exactly 158 runs, which was, at that point, his highest Test score. However, he made 2 in a disastrous second innings collapse which cost England dear.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Andrew. &quot;[http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/ausveng/content/story/270774.html Pietersen and Collingwood share the limelight]&quot;, Cricinfo, 2 December 2006.

In the first innings, Pietersen's dismissal was to be the source of much controversy. He edged his fifth ball to [[Chamara Silva]] at slip, who flicked the ball up for wicketkeeper [[Kumar Sangakkara]] to complete the catch. The two on-field umpires conferred over the validity of the catch, as it was unclear whether the ball had touched the ground ''prior'' to Silva flicking the ball up. [[Daryl Harper]], standing at the bowler's end gave the decision that the wicket had been taken, but while walking off the field, Pietersen saw a replay on the big screen and questioned the validity of the decision.

On England's tour against [[New Zealand national cricket team|New Zealand]], Pietersen averaged 33.00 in the ODI series, with one score of 50 in the tied fourth match; England lost the series 3–1.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stats.cricinfo.com/ci/engine/records/averages/batting_bowling_by_team.html?id=3309;team=1;type=series Batting and bowling averages: England in New Zealand ODI Series, 2007/08 – England], Cricinfo. Retrieved on 24 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; He also made a top score of 43 in the first of two comfortable [[Twenty20 International|Twenty20]] matches.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/300435.html First T20I: New Zealand v England], 2008-02-05, Cricinfo. Retrieved on 24 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Pietersen had a quiet first two Test matches, making little impression with the bat. He produced 42 and 6 as England collapsed in their second innings. In the next test, he fared little better making 31 and 17. However, in the first innings of the [[McLean Park|Napier]] Test he rescued England from a disastrous start of 4–3, guiding them to 259 with 129, his 11th Test century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/300444.html 3rd Test: New Zealand v England], 2008-03-26, Cricinfo. Retrieved on 24 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

New Zealand then came to tour England and Pietersen again struggled in the first two Test matches, scoring 3 in the first match. He improved slightly in the second but only making 26 in the first innings and then running himself out on 42 having looked well set.&lt;ref&gt;Lillywhite, Jamie (2008). &quot;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/7420284.stm Strauss ton inspires England win]&quot;, 2008-05-26, BBC Sport. Retrieved on 26 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt; He seemed to be struggling particularly against [[Daniel Vettori]] but he showed no signs of that as he struck a century in the third Test, forming a valuable partnership with [[Tim Ambrose]], making a crucial 115.&lt;ref&gt;Lillywhite, Jamie (2008). &quot;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/england/7432111.stm Pietersen century rescues England]&quot;, 2008-06-05, BBC Sport. Retrieved on 6 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Pietersen hit a winning 42 not out in the Twenty20 match.

==== The switch-hit ====
In the first ODI of the NatWest series, Pietersen hit two sixes by &quot;switch-hitting&quot; en route to 110 not out. While facing the bowling of medium pace [[Scott Styris]], Pietersen turned his body around and switched hands (effectively batting as a left-hander) hitting two sixes over [[Fielding (cricket)|cover]] and long off. Because Pietersen not only reversed his hand position (as some batsman do while playing the [[Batting (cricket)#Reverse sweep|reverse sweep]]), but changed his stance by rotating his body, these &quot;switch-hit&quot; shots were immediately followed by calls to outlaw them from the game.&lt;ref&gt;Luke, Will (2008). &quot;[http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/engvnz/content/story/354876.html Pietersen stars in crushing win]&quot;, 2008-06-15, Cricinfo. Retrieved on 24 June 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Although a similar shot was played when Pietersen reverse-swept [[Muttiah Muralitharan]] for six in Sri Lanka in 2006, he only switched hands and executed &quot;the switch&quot; after the ball was bowled, and not before, as in this case.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Several commentators claim that because Pietersen changed from being a right-handed to a left-handed batsman as the bowler approached his delivery stride, he was gaining an unfair advantage.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} [[Gideon Haigh]] said that &quot;A bowler must advise a batsman when he's changing direction, why should the batsmen not; given that where the bowler's aiming will depend on the placement of the off stump&quot;. [[Ian Healy]] seconded this by saying &quot;It just should be outlawed straightaway. If you want to hit to one side of the field, you've got to do it in a cross fashion, and not swap the way you're facing or your grip. Otherwise you are going to start to allow the bowlers to go round the wicket, over the wicket, and keep swapping during their run-ups.&quot; This ideal was echoed by former fast-bowler [[Michael Holding]], who rather than calling for the shot to be banned, advocated the latter scenario whereby bowlers do not have to inform the umpire, or batsman, of a change of delivery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/355276.html The shots that rang around the world], 2008-06-16, Cricinfo. Retrieved on 24 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pietersen countered these claims by saying: &lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;That's ridiculous, absolutely stupid. The reverse-sweep has been part of the game for however long. I am just fortunate that I am able to hit it a bit further. Everybody wants brand new ideas, new inventions and new shots. That is a new shot played today and people should be saying it's a new way to go. There are new things happening for cricket at the moment and people shouldn't be criticising it all the time.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/engvnz/content/story/354980.html Pietersen defends switch-hitting], 2008-06-16, Cricinfo. Retrieved on 24 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another citation for the shot being outlawed was that the possibility of being out LBW (&quot;a player is out LBW if...the ball pitches in line between wicket and wicket or on the off side of the striker's wicket&quot;) is removed, as the off side become the leg side and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;In simple terms, a player is not LBW if the ball pitches outside the leg stump.&lt;/ref&gt; The shots were considered by the [[Marylebone Cricket Club|MCC]], governors of the game, who came to the conclusion that the shot was legal, believing that the LBW law (which continues &quot;The off side of the striker's wicket shall be determined by the striker's stance at the moment the ball comes into play for that delivery&quot;) adequately covers the scenario.&lt;ref&gt;The ball comes into play when the bowler starts his run-up.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Marylebone Cricket Club]], 2003. &quot;[http://www.lords.org/laws-and-spirit/laws-of-cricket/laws/law-36-leg-before-wicket,62,AR.html Law 36 (Leg before wicket)]&quot;. Retrieved on 24 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; They cited the variations bowlers can make, such as bowling a googly or a slower ball, and also the inherent risk in the shot to the batsman, in the justification of their decision.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/england/7456149.stm MCC approves Pietersen switch hit]&quot;, 2008-06-17, BBC Sport. Retrieved on 18 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are still calls for further review of the stroke, with [[Jonathan Agnew]] giving a scenario in which a right-handed batsman can take his stance as a left-hander, then switch stance as the bowler runs in, thus being able to kick away any balls that land outside his now off stump. He also calls for the wide law to be adjusted in one-day cricket, as bowlers are penalised for most deliveries that pass down the leg side.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jonathan Agnew|Agnew, Jonathan]], 2008. &quot;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/tms/2008/06/laws_should_change_for_switchh.shtml Laws should change for switch-hitters]&quot;, 2008-06-18, BBC.

==== England captaincy ====
===== Success against South Africa =====
Pietersen captained England in the fifth ODI against New Zealand after [[Paul Collingwood]] was banned for four games for a slow over-rate during the previous match. New Zealand won to finish the series 3–1 and Pieterson scored only 6. England's unofficial vice-captain since Collingwood's appointment in June 2007, Pietersen was named as the stand-in captain for three further matches in August.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/england/7476025.stm Pietersen named stand in captain]&quot;, 2008-06-26, BBC Sport. Retrieved on 26 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Pietersen at The Oval.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Pietersen on his first day as England Test captain at [[The Oval]] in August 2008.]] With [[Michael Vaughan]] as captain for the first three tests, Pietersen seemed to thrive in his first Test series against his former countrymen scoring 152 in the opening match of the series. During the third Test against South Africa, Pietersen was criticised for throwing his wicket away attempting a six to complete a century when on 94. [[Jonathan Agnew]] and [[Alec Stewart]] called the stroke &quot;irresponsible&quot; and Agnew continued, suggesting that Pietersen therefore ruled himself out of the potential reckoning for the England captaincy with [[Michael Vaughan|Vaughan]]'s place in the starting line-up in doubt after failing to score runs.&lt;ref&gt;Agnew, Jonathan. &quot;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/tms/2008/08/pietersen_fails_to_complete_re.shtml Pietersen fails to complete rescue operation]&quot;, 2008-08-01, BBC Sport. Retrieved on 4 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In the event, having lost the match, Vaughan resigned and Pietersen was made the permanent captain of both the Test and ODI sides ([[Paul Collingwood]] relinquished the ODI captaincy at the same time).&lt;ref name=CaptainKP&gt;{{cite news |title=Pietersen named England captain |publisher=BBC Sport  |date=4 August 2008

Following the news that he had been made England Test and ODI captain, Pietersen paid tribute to both outgoing captains but announced that he would look to captain the team in his own style.&lt;ref name=CaptainKP/&gt; He scored a century in his debut match as captain in the [[dead rubber]] fourth Test, and went on to defeat South Africa 4–0 in the ODI matches. In that series he made 90 not out and got 2–22 with the ball. In the fourth ODI, another dead rubber as England were 3–0 up, he hit a quick 40 to guide England to victory.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

===== Derailment against India =====
Pietersen continued to lead the team during a 5–0 defeat to India in ODI matches; the series was supposed to consist of seven matches, but was abandoned after the fifth due to the [[2008 Mumbai attacks]].{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} Pietersen however had a decent series with the bat hitting a quick 63 in the first match and 111 not out in the fifth match. Pietersen's men returned to England before resuming the tour amid unprecedented security, to play a two-Test series. Pietersen was highly vocal in regards to the resumption of the tour, citing a need to stand up to terrorism. He had an aggregate of 5 runs in 2 innings in the first test being dismissed by [[Yuvraj Singh]] in the second innings which showed Pietersen's struggles against Yuvraj from the ODI series carried on. England were defeated in the first, however the team recovered to draw the second with Pietersen scoring 144.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

In January 2009, following England's losses in India, the media reported that Pietersen had asked the [[England and Wales Cricket Board]] (ECB) to hold emergency meetings to discuss Moores' coaching role with the team.&lt;ref name=cricinfo_crisis_talks&gt;{{cite news |url=http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/england/content/story/384869.html|title=Pietersen wants crisis talks with ECB |publisher=[[Cricinfo]] |date=1 January 2009 |accessdate=7 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Days later, Pietersen made remarks to the media about there being an 'unhealthy situation' that needed to be resolved in the England camp. The media speculated that Moores would shortly be replaced if there was a Pietersen–Moores rift. Moores and Pietersen were believed to be in disagreement on several issues, including the team's training regimen, and the possible selection of former England captain [[Michael Vaughan]] for the upcoming [[English cricket team in West Indies in 2008–09|tour of the West Indies]].&lt;ref name=bbc_resigns/&gt; On 7 January 2009, Moores was removed as England's coach by the ECB, and Pietersen unexpectedly resigned as captain.&lt;ref name=bbc_resigns&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/cricket/england/7815038.stm |title=England captain Pietersen resigns |publisher=BBC Sport   |date=7 January 2009 |accessdate=7 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the immediate aftermath of Pietersen's resignation, several commentators connected with English cricket indicated that they believed that Pietersen had miscalculated by openly advocating for the removal of Moores, particularly in making their dispute public.&lt;ref name=reaction&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/cricket/england/7815729.stm |title=Reactions to England cricket chaos |publisher=BBC Sport   |date=7 January 2009 |accessdate=7 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In an interview several days after his resignation, Pietersen revealed that he had not intended to resign as captain, but was told by ECB officials that he was resigning.&lt;ref name=Pietersenforced&gt;{{cite web |url=http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/england/content/current/story/386067.html |title=Cricinfo – Pietersen says he was forced to quit |date= 11 January 2009 |accessdate=11 January 2009|publisher=[[Cricinfo]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Dennis Amiss]], the vice-chairman of the ECB, went on record backing up Pietersen in his statement that the story of the rift with Moores had not been leaked to the media by him, saying, &quot;We don't believe Kevin Pietersen leaked the information, we understand his frustration at it being leaked by other parties.&quot;&lt;ref name=Pietersendidntleak&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/cricket/international/england/4217380/Kevin-Pietersen-didnt-leak-England-cricket-crisis-talks-ECB.html|title= Kevin Pietersen didn't leak crisis talks: ECB|accessdate=15 January 2009 |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK |date=11 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pietersen was captain for three Test matches, and 10 One Day International matches. It was announced that [[Andrew Strauss]] would take over the captaincy.&lt;ref name=kpout/&gt;

=== 2009 ===
==== England in West Indies ====

In his first match after resigning from the captaincy he scored 97 in the first innings of the first test. West Indies had a lead of 74 and incredibly England were bowled out for 51 with Pietersen making just 1 being bowled by a beautiful out-swinger by [[Jerome Taylor]] as England collapsed to an innings defeat. After the second test was abandoned, he scored 51 in the &quot;third test&quot;. His good form carried on as he scored 72 not out to give England the draw at Barbados. In the fifth and final test, with England needing to win, Pietersen hit his quickest test century with 102 of 92 balls including the switch-hit and an incredible flick of his legs. He struggled in the one-day series that followed with his top score being 48.

==== Indian Premier League ====

In February 2009, [[Royal Challengers Bangalore]] of the [[Indian Premier League]] bought Pietersen for USD 1,550,000 which made him the highest-paid IPL player along with [[Andrew Flintoff]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/7871703.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |title=England players top IPL auction |date=6 February 2009 |accessdate=18 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following month RCB owner [[Vijay Mallya]] announced that Pietersen would succeed [[Rahul Dravid]] as captain. He won two out of his six matches in charge before leaving to fulfil his international commitments with England; [[Anil Kumble]] took over the captaincy and led the Bangalore team to the IPL final.&lt;ref name=&quot;shine off&quot;/&gt; Kevin Pietersen was later bought by Delhi Daredevils for 2million USD as he moved from Royal Challengers Bangalore to Delhi Daredevils.

==== West Indies and the World Twenty20 ====
Pietersen began 2009 with questions over his form, where many pundits viewed him to be in a slump.&lt;ref name=&quot;shine off&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/401882.html|title=The shine's off KP|last=Steen|first=Rob|date=29 April 2009|publisher=Cricinfo|accessdate=2 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was dismissed first ball in the first Test against the touring West Indies side dismissed by the full, swinging ball (a delivery which he seemed to struggle against), but in the second Test made a quick 49 before falling to an attacking shot. He then suffered what seemed only a minor right Achilles injury and was subsequently ruled out of the ODI series, which England also won.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/engvwi2009/content/story/405293.html|title=Pietersen ruled out of one-day series|date=20 May 2009|publisher=Cricinfo|accessdate=2 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In June 2009, Pietersen played in England's World Twenty20 warm-up match against [[Scotland cricket team|Scotland]], registering an unbeaten 53 in a six-wicket England victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/wt202009/engine/current/match/393739.html|title=ICC World Twenty20 Warm-up Matches, England v Scotland at Nottingham, Jun&amp;nbsp;2, 2009 |publisher=Cricinfo|accessdate=2 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also appeared in the news after accidentally hitting a [[Reece Topley|15-year old school boy]] with a cricket ball from a straight-drive after the boy had bowled to him. Pietersen left the boy, from [[Suffolk]], with a signed bat as compensation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/leicestershire/8079143.stm|title=Boy is floored by Pietersen shot |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=2 June 2009 | date=2 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pietersen's Achilles injury began flared up ahead of England's first Twenty20 match, against the [[Netherlands national cricket team|Netherlands]] not long after.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/cricket/international/england/5478939/Kevin-Pietersen-could-break-down-at-any-time.html Kevin Pietersen could break down at any time]. telegraph.co.uk., 9 June 2009.

==== 2009 Ashes ====

Pietersen joined the England Ashes squad in June 2009 for the upcoming [[2009 Ashes]] series. Despite failing to surpass single figure scores during a warm-up match against Warwickshire,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/engvaus2009/content/story/413007.html|title=Through the hype, Pietersen relishes the contest|last=Miller|first=Andrew|date=6 July 2009|publisher=CricInfo|accessdate=9 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; he helped England to a score over 400 on 8 July during the first day of the first Test at the [[SWALEC Stadium]], [[Cardiff]] with 69 before being dismissed by [[Nathan Hauritz]], top-edging a sweep to a ball outside off stump; the dismissal was heavily criticised. He also seemed to flare up his Achilles injury again suddenly which hampered his batting a bit. In the second innings he was bowled for 8 after leaving a straight ball from [[Ben Hilfenhaus]]. Many pundits thought the criticism of England's key batsman from the first innings possibly affected him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/engvaus2009/content/story/413362.html|title=Pietersen thrills but gives it away|last=Miller|first=Ander|date=8 July 2009|publisher=CricInfo|accessdate=9 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the first innings at Lords, after proving his fitness, he came at 222–2 and played some trademark shots before being caught behind off [[Peter Siddle]]. In the second innings he came in when England had a lead of almost 300 and he and [[Ravi Bopara]] batted for time. Pietersen limped when he ran and many shots ran off the inside edge which raised serious doubts for the rest of the series. He actually did well to reach 44 before being caught behind off Siddle again. After struggling in the field as England won, Pietersen was ruled out of the rest of the series with an Achilles injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/england/8162048.stm|title=Pietersen to miss rest of Ashes|publisher=[[BBC Online]]|date=22 July 2009|accessdate=22 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This brought to an end 54 consecutive Test matches. As his recovery slowed, Pietersen was not included in the [[2009 ICC Champions Trophy]] and Andy Flower speculated that due to an infection of the wound Pietersen &quot;may miss this winter's tour of South Africa because of slow progress in recovery from surgery.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Articles/11/11465.html|title=Pietersen might not make SA tour: Flower|date=22 September 2009|publisher=Cricket Archive|accessdate=26 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Career in 2010 ===
Pietersen returned from injury in time to play a part in the 2009–10 winter tour of South Africa. His contributions, nevertheless, have been significantly below his pre-injury range with an average innings of just 27. He has shown several lapses of concentration, leading some to suggest that off-field distractions and lingering issues with his removal from the captaincy are still affecting his form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/cricket/international/england/6852744/South-Africa-v-England-Kevin-Pietersens-moment-of-madness-should-be-forgiven.html|author=Simon Briggs|title=South Africa v England: Kevin Pietersen's moment of madness should be forgiven|date=20 December 2009|accessdate=17 January 2010 | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former England batsman and commentator [[Geoffrey Boycott]] detected a new technical fault of playing across full-length deliveries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/cricket/article-1243728/Can-real-Kevin-Pietersen-save-England-series-South-Africa-close-kill.html|title=Can the real Kevin Pietersen save England and the series as South Africa close in for the kill? |author=Peter Hayter|date=16 January 2010|accessdate=17 January 2010 | location=London | work=Daily Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pietersen went into the [[English cricket team in Bangladesh in 2009–10|two-match tour of Bangladesh]] on the back of poor performances since his return from injury lead to speculation Pietersen's England place was under pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/oliverbrett/2010/03/pietersen_must_banish_the_demo.html|title=Oliver Brett's Blog: Pietersen must banish the demons forthwith|date=9 March 2010|author=Oliver Brett|work= BBC.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, an important first innings of 99 in the first Test and a series clinching score of 74 not out in the second, during a stand of 167 not out with [[Alastair Cook]], saw Pietersen return to much more respectable figures. England won the series 2–0 and Pietersen finished with total runs of 250 and an average for the series of 83.33.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/records/batting/most_runs_career.html?id=5510;type=series Records / England in Bangladesh Test Series, 2009/10 / Most runs], Cricinfo.

Pietersen joined up with his [[Royal Challengers Bangalore]] team following the conclusion to [[English cricket team in Bangladesh in 2009–10|England's tour of Bangladesh]]. Pietersen showed further signs of a return to form in the IPL by scoring 236 runs with a high score of 66[[not out|*]], with an average of 59.00, which was the highest in the IPL.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Events/IND/Indian_Premier_League_2009-10/Batting_by_Average.html Batting and Fielding in Indian Premier League 2009/10]&lt;/ref&gt;

Pietersen was selected in England's 15 man squad for the [[2010 ICC World Twenty20]] in the [[West Indies]].

Following the conclusion of this match, Pietersen returned home to England to be present at the birth of his son.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cricket365.com/news/story/6142044/Pietersen-to-return-home Pietersen to return home]&lt;/ref&gt; Pietersen returned in time for England's semi-final against [[Sri Lanka national cricket team|Sri Lanka]], where he scored a vital 42* from 26 balls, guiding England home to a 7 wicket victory&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/250/250766.html England v Sri Lanka, ICC World Twenty20 2010 (Semi-Final)]&lt;/ref&gt; and a place in their first ICC tournament final since the [[2004 ICC Champions Trophy]]. In the final against old foes [[Australia national cricket team|Australia]], he scored 47 runs from 31 balls, which included 4 fours and 1 six. Pietersen shared in a vital stand of 111 with Kieswetter, before holing out to [[David Warner (cricketer)|David Warner]] off the bowling of [[Steve Smith (cricketer born 1989)|Steve Smith]]. Pietersen's knock was vital in helping England secure a 7 wicket victory and their first ever major ICC tournament victory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/250/250768.html England v Australia, ICC World Twenty20 2010 (Final)]&lt;/ref&gt; After the match Pietersen was named man of the series for his vital contributions with the bat, which ended with Pietersen being the second highest run scorer with 248 runs at an average of 62.00 and a strike rate of 137.77.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stats.cricinfo.com/world-twenty20-2010/engine/records/batting/most_runs_career.html?id=5195;type=tournament ICC World Twenty20, most runs]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Bangladesh, Australia and Pakistan====
[[Image:Kp walks out.JPG|thumb|left|Pietersen walks out to bat against Australia at the Rose Bowl in his 100th ODI]]
Pietersen played in the Bangladesh home series, however contributed only 18 in the first innings before assisting England in chasing down a modest total with 10*. He made 64 in the second Test, however.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/england-v-bangladesh-2010/content/story/462316.html|title=Rust removed ahead of sterner Tests |  Cricket Features | England v Bangladesh 2010 | Cricinfo.com|work=[[Cricinfo]]|accessdate=17 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the Test series, attention was drawn to Pietersen's lack of games for Hampshire&amp;nbsp;– having not played a County Championship at the Rose Bowl since 2005. Having made one Twenty20 appearance for them against [[Surrey County Cricket Club|Surrey]] after the Bangladesh Test series, it was announced that he would be leaving Hampshire, stating that &quot;Geographically it just doesn't work. I live in Chelsea.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;leaving hampshire cricinfo&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/countycricket2010/content/current/story/463579.html|title=Kevin Pietersen set for Hampshire talks|last=Dobell|first=George|work=[[Cricinfo]]|accessdate=17 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 June, Pietersen played his 100th ODI against Australia at his home ground, [[Rose Bowl, Southampton|the Rose Bowl]]{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}
[[Image:Kevin Pietersen Trent Bridge.JPG|thumb|right|Pietersen bowled for 9 in the first Test v Pakistan at [[Trent Bridge]] July 2010]]

Pietersen struggled for form in an [[Australian cricket team in England in 2010|ODI series against Australia]] and then a [[Pakistani cricket team in England in 2010|Test series against Pakistan]]. England beat Australia 3–2, but Pietersen could only manage a top-score of 33. England beat Pakistan 3–1, and although Pietersen top-scored for England with 80 in the second Test, it was the only time he passed 50 and ended the series with a golden duck.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} His poor form, and an admission by Pietersen before the final Test that he was low on confidence, led to many in the media, including [[Geoffrey Boycott]], to suggest that Pietersen could do with playing County Cricket to regain his form before the [[2010–11 Ashes series]].{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Pietersen was omitted from both of England's limited-overs squads to face Pakistan. However, the ECB brokered a loan move to [[Surrey County Cricket Club|Surrey]] for the remainder of the [[2010 English cricket season]] which enables him to play first-class cricket whilst the England side plays Pakistan in the limited overs leg of the tour.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} Pietersen announced the omission and loan-move to Surrey early through a Twitter message, which contained a swear-word and was quickly removed, and he apologised the following day. The online outburst drew some criticism of him, with national selector [[Geoff Miller]] one of those criticising the message. During the lead up to the 2010/11 Ashes Series Pietersen signed up for two first class games in the South African competition with the KwaZulu Natal Dolphins.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

====The Ashes down under====
Pietersen went into the [[2010–11 Ashes series]] without a century since March 2009, and many felt that England would be unable to retain the Ashes unless he found form. In the first Test at [[The Gabba]], [[Brisbane]], Pietersen hit 43 in the first innings but wasn't required in the second as England posted 517–1 declared before a draw was declared.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

In the second Test in [[Adelaide]], where he hit 158 on the previous Ashes tour, Pietersen joined opener [[Alastair Cook]] (148) to make a century partnership before going onto to score his 17th Test century. He finished with 227, a Test-best and his second Test double-century, as England declared on 620–5. Given a rare bowl at the end of the fourth day, Pietersen claimed the wicket of [[Michael Clarke (cricketer)|Michael Clarke]] (80) to leave Australia 238–4. England then proceeded to bowl Australia out in the final morning to win by an innings and 71 runs, and Pietersen was named man-of-the-match.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.espncricinfo.com/the-ashes-2010-11/engine/current/match/428750.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Career in 2011===
[[File:Pietersen batting at Lord's, 2011.jpg|thumb|left|Pietersen batting during his innings of 72 against Sri Lanka at Lord's]]
Pietersen was part of England's 15-man squad for the [[2011 Cricket World Cup|2011 World Cup]] hosted by Bangladesh, India and Sri Lanka between February and March. In the warm-up matches he was asked to open the batting in anticipation that he would assume the position for the whole tournament. He had opened the batting just six times in one-day games and never for England, although had done so for England&amp;nbsp;A in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/icc_cricket_worldcup2011/content/story/501272.html |title=Pietersen excited by new opener's role |publisher=Cricinfo |date=16 February 2011 |accessdate=7 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pietersen returned home early due to injury. A [[hernia]] required immediate surgery and the recovery time of around six weeks meant he would miss the rest of the tournament and potentially the IPL. Eoin Morgan took Pietersen's place in the squad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/icc_cricket_worldcup2011/content/current/story/504584.html |title=Pietersen ruled out of World Cup |publisher=Cricinfo |date=7 March 2011 |accessdate=2011-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pietersen earned some criticism after being sighted at a nightclub in London while injured, however he dismissed the criticism as unwarranted.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pietersen out to silence detractors&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/england-v-sri-lanka-2011/content/story/516530.html|title=Pietersen out to silence detractors|last=Miller|first=Andrew|date=24 May 2011|publisher=CricInfo|accessdate=29 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He returned from injury for the home series against Sri Lanka in May 2011.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pietersen out to silence detractors&quot; /&gt; Pietersen was also picked to play against [[India cricket team|India]] in July 2011, and scored 202 not out at [[Lord's Cricket Ground|Lord's]] in the 1st Test. During the innings, Pietersen passed 6,000 runs in Tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/302/302314.html |title=f53294 t2000 England v India: India in England 2011 (1st Test) |publisher=[[Cricketarchive]] |accessdate=11 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The feat took exactly six years, which is the fastest in terms of time taken, and 128&amp;nbsp;innings.&lt;ref&gt;Sixteen players have reached 6,000&amp;nbsp;Test runs in fewer than 75&amp;nbsp;innings. {{cite web|url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/records/283183.html|title=Records / Test matches / Batting records / Fastest to 6000 runs|publisher=CricInfo|accessdate=10 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the fourth Test he scored 175 runs and shared a partnership of 350 runs with Ian Bell. Pietersen was rested for the ODI series against that followed the Tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/england-v-india-2011/content/story/529919.html |title=Pietersen rested for India ODIs |publisher=Cricinfo |date=26 August 2011 |accessdate=31 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;


===Career in 2012===

Pietersen played a pivotal role in England's tour of Sri Lanka. By scoring a century in the Second of 2 tests, not only did he move to 20 centuries for England, but he levelled the series at 1-1, ensuring England retain their No.1 Test Ranking status. On April 10th, Pietersen started his first match in the [[2012 Indian Premier League]] for new team, the [[Delhi Daredevils]].
