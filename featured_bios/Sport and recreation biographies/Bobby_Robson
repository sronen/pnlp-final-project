'''Sir Robert William''' &quot;'''Bobby'''&quot; '''Robson''', [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] (18 February 1933&amp;nbsp;– 31 July 2009)&lt;ref name=&quot;bbcdeath&quot;&gt;{{cite news | title = Football legend Robson dies at 76 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/8177945.stm | publisher=news.bbc.co.uk | date = 31 July 2009 | accessdate =31 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an English [[Association football|footballer]] and manager, who coached seven European clubs and the [[England national football team|England national team]] during his career.

His professional playing career as an [[Forward (association football)#Second striker|inside-forward]] spanned nearly 20 years, during which he played for three clubs: [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]], [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]], and, briefly, [[Vancouver Royals|Vancouver]]. He also made 20 appearances for England, scoring four goals.

After his playing career he found success as both a club and international manager, winning league championships in both the [[Netherlands]] and [[Portugal]], earning trophies in England and Spain, and taking England to the semi-final of the [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990 World Cup]]. His last management role was as a mentor to the manager of the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Irish national football team]].

Robson was created a [[Knight Bachelor]] in 2002, was inducted as a member of the [[English Football Hall of Fame]] in 2003, and was the honorary president of [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]]. From 1991 onwards he suffered recurrent medical problems with cancer, and in March 2008, put his name and efforts into the [[Sir Bobby Robson Foundation]], a cancer research charity. In August 2008, his lung cancer was confirmed to be terminal; he said: &quot;My condition is described as static and has not altered since my last bout of [[chemotherapy]]...I am going to die sooner rather than later. But then everyone has to go sometime and I have enjoyed every minute&quot;. He died just under a year later.

== Early life ==
Born in [[Sacriston]], County Durham, Robson was the fourth of five sons of Philip and Lilian Robson (née Watt).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

As a boy, he was often taken by his father to watch [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] at [[St James' Park]], requiring a bus ride or a walk of several miles.&lt;ref name=&quot;mail on sunday&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dream to manage Newcastle&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/football/news/432906.stm

Although Robson had signed professionally, his father insisted he continue to work as an electrician. He spent the day working at the [[Fest

=== International playing career ===
During his first spell at Fulham, Robson participated in two ambassadorial Football Association tours in the [[Caribbean|West Indies]] in 1955 and South Africa in 1956.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robson&quot; /&gt;  However, it was during his time at [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] that he graduated to the full England squad, with his first call-up in 1956. His manager, Vic Buckingham, advocated the &quot;[[push and run]]&quot; approach to the game, a precursor to &quot;[[total football]]&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | last = Robson

 | last = Robson
 | title = Farewell but Not Goodbye
 | pages = 33–35
 | isbn = 0-340-84064-1

He went on to make 20 appearances for the [[England national football team|England national team]], making his debut in a November 1957 victory against [[France national football team|France]], scoring twice in a 4–0 victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

 | pages = 48–49
 | isbn = 0-340-84064-1
 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was, however, selected for the [[1958 FIFA World Cup|1958 World Cup]] squad, ahead of [[Nat Lofthouse]] and [[Stanley Matthews]] but returned from Sweden disappointed, as England were defeated by the [[USSR national football team|Soviet Union]] in a group play-off match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Following the [[1958 FIFA World Cup|1958 World Cup]], Robson became an established member of the England squad, enjoying considerable success in a period between October 1960 and March 1961 when he played in six England victories, including scoring a goal in the record 9–3 defeat of Scotland at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

== Managerial career ==
=== Early club management ===
In 1959, the then [[England_national_football_team#Managers|England manager]] and [[the Football Association]] director of coaching [[Walter Winterbottom]] suggested to Robson that he take a coaching course at [[Lilleshall Hall|Lilleshall]].&lt;ref name=&quot;p33to35&quot;/&gt;  Robson made his debut as a manager in January 1968 at his former club Fulham, against Macclesfield Town, then in the Cheshire League, in the third round of the FA Cup. Fulham were struggling with 16 points from 24 games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

He moved on to [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] in 1969 and it was there that he established his reputation as a successful manager.

Before the 1990 World Cup, the FA told Robson that they would not renew his contract as England manager, so he moved on to the [[Netherlands]] to coach [[PSV Eindhoven|PSV]] of [[Eindhoven]],&lt;ref name=espn/&gt; who sought a manager capable of instilling discipline into a fractious squad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kuper |first=Simon |title=Football against the enemy |publisher=Orion |location=London |year=1996 |isbn=0-7528-4877-1|pages =93}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robson described the move as &quot;a culture shock&quot; but felt &quot;...a sense of adventure.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

After every match here, the substitutes come and visit me.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Kuper, p96&lt;/ref&gt; Another of his challenges at PSV was handling the [[Brazil national football team|Brazilian international]] [[Romário]].

Porto|Porto]], [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], [[F.C. Internazionale Milano|Internazionale]] and [[Real Madrid C.F.]] manager.

On 31 July 2009, Robson died of lung cancer at his home in County Durham,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jonathan Stewart |url=http://www.4ni.co.uk/northern_ireland_news.asp?id=97315 |title=Football legend Sir Bobby Robson dies |publisher=4ni.co.uk |accessdate=31 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; aged 76, after a long battle with the disease.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbcdeath&quot;/&gt; After the news of his death, leading figures from the world of football and politics paid tribute to him. [[Manchester United]] manager [[Alex Ferguson|Sir Alex Ferguson]] called him a &quot;great friend, a wonderful individual and tremendous football man.&quot; UEFA president [[Michel Platini]] said: &quot;He will be remembered not only for his playing career and his outstanding managerial career at both club and international level, but also because he was a truly warm and passionate human being.&quot; [[Gary Lineker]] said: &quot;It is a sad day and a great loss. He was a wonderful man and will be deeply missed by everybody in the country. I never played for a more enthusiastic man. He gave so much to the game.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/8177945.stm | title= Legend Sir Bobby Robson, 76, dies |work=BBC News  | date=31 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, [[Tony Blair]], described Sir Bobby as a &quot;real Geordie gentleman.&quot;&lt;ref name=Tributes&gt;{{cite news

By his decency, his humour, his love of the game's traditions and origins and confusion at what it had become, he made present day football look what it is – shabby by comparison. I can think of no more fitting epitaph.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.michaelparkinson.tv/week-in-words,bobby-robson_137.htm | title= Bobby Robson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robson's funeral, a private family ceremony, took place on 5 August 2009. The location remained undisclosed at the request of his family until the funeral had taken place. It was later revealed to be [[Esh, County Durham]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Funeral&quot;&gt;

In July 2010 plans were unveiled for a memorial garden to Robson to be built in Newcastle. It was to be created by the city council in partnership with the regeneration company NE1Ltd, and located on [[Newcastle upon Tyne City Centre#Gallowgate|Gallowgate]] street close to the Newcastle United stadium [[St James' Park]]. Work began on the site in November 2010, with an expected completion of Spring 2011. The garden is to cover 400 square meters, and feature a tiered seating area and sculpted stone plinths reflecting aspects of his life and work. The area is also to host a 400 square metre memorial garden to [[Sir Bobby Robson]], with work beginning in November 2010, to be opened in Spring 2011.&lt;ref name=BBC26Jul2010GardenPlans&gt;{{cite news

With a keen interest in cricket as well as football, Robson was to have replaced [[Mike Gatting]] as President of the [[Lord's Taverners]] charity and cricket club in 2007, but this was prevented by his ill-health.
