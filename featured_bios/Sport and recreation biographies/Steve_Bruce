}}
'''Stephen Roger &quot;Steve&quot; Bruce''' (born 31 December 1960) is an [[England|English]] [[association football|football]] [[coach (sports)|manager]] and former player. Born in [[Corbridge]], [[Northumberland]], he was a promising schoolboy footballer but was rejected by a number of professional clubs. He was on the verge of quitting the game altogether when he was offered a trial with [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]]. Bruce was offered an apprenticeship and went on to play more than 200&amp;nbsp;games for the club before joining [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] in 1984.

In 1987, he moved to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], with whom he achieved great success, winning the [[Premier League]], [[FA Cup]], [[Football League Cup]] and [[European Cup Winner's Cup]]. He also became the first English player of the twentieth century to captain a team to [[Double (association football)|The Double]]. Despite his success on the field, he was never selected to play for the [[England national football team|England national team]]. Commentators and contemporaries have described him as one of the best English players of the 1980s and 1990s never to play for his country at full international level.

Bruce began his managerial career with [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]], and spent short periods of time managing [[Huddersfield Town F.C.|Huddersfield Town]], [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]] and [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] before joining [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] in 2001. He twice led Birmingham to [[Promotion and relegation|promotion]] to the [[Premier League]] during his tenure of nearly six years, but resigned in 2007 to begin a second spell as manager of Wigan.  At the end of the [[2008-09 in English football|2008–09 season]] he resigned to take over as manager of [[Sunderland A.F.C|Sunderland]], a post he held until he was dismissed in November 2011.

Bruce, a boyhood fan of [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]], claims to have sneaked into [[St James' Park]] without paying to watch the team play, saying &quot;I have always been a [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] lad and when I was a kid, I crawled under the turnstiles to get in to try and save a [[Shilling|bob]] or whatever it was.

Having been turned down by a number of professional clubs, including Newcastle United, [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]], [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] and [[Southport F.C.|Southport]], Bruce was about to start work as an apprentice plumber at the [[Swan Hunter]] dockyard when he was offered a trial by [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] club [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]], whose manager [[Gerry Summers]] had seen him playing for Wallsend in an international youth tournament.&lt;ref name=&quot;SB39&quot;&gt;{{cite book | first=Steve|last= Bruce | title=Heading for Victory: An Autobiography| pages=39–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; He travelled down to [[Kent]] with another player from the Wallsend club, [[Peter Beardsley]], but although Gillingham signed Bruce as an apprentice, they turned Beardsley away.&lt;ref name=&quot;Buster2&quot; /&gt; At the time Bruce was playing as a [[midfielder]], but he was switched to the centre of defence by the head of Gillingham's youth scheme, [[Bill Collins (footballer)|Bill &quot;Buster&quot; Collins]], whom Bruce cites as the single biggest influence on his career.&lt;ref name=&quot;Buster2&quot;&gt;{{cite web

==Playing career==
===Gillingham===
[[File:Priestfield1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Priestfield Stadium]], home of [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]], where Bruce began his playing career]]
Bruce spent the [[1978-79 in English football|1978–79 season]] in Gillingham's [[reserve team]] and, despite playing in defence, scored 18&amp;nbsp;goals to finish the season as top scorer.&lt;ref name=&quot;triggs&quot; /&gt; In January 1979, he was selected to represent the [[England national under-18 football team|England Youth]] team, and he went on to gain eight caps, participating in the 1980 [[UEFA European Under-19 Football Championship|European Under-18 Championship]].&lt;ref name=&quot;SB52&quot;&gt;{{cite book | first=Steve|last= Bruce | title=Heading for Victory: An Autobiography| pages=52–53}}&lt;/ref&gt; He came close to making his debut for the club's senior team in May 1979, but Summers decided at the last minute that, as Gillingham were chasing [[Promotion and relegation|promotion]] from the Third Division, Bruce was not yet ready to handle the pressure of the occasion.&lt;ref name=&quot;SB53&quot;&gt;{{cite book | first=Steve|last= Bruce | title=Heading for Victory: An Autobiography| pages=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; He eventually made his senior debut in a [[Football League Cup]] tie against [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]] on 11 August 1979,&lt;ref name=&quot;First season&quot; /&gt; and made an immediate impact in the team, winning the club's Player of the Year award at the end of the [[1979-80 in English football|1979–80 season]].&lt;ref name=&quot;SB57&quot;&gt;{{cite book | first=Steve|last= Bruce | title=Heading for Victory: An Autobiography| pages=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to make more than 200&amp;nbsp;appearances for the club,&lt;ref name=&quot;triggs&quot;&gt;{{cite book | first=Roger|last= Triggs | title=The Men Who Made Gillingham Football Club| publisher=Tempus Publishing Ltd | year=2001| isbn=0-7524-2243-X|pages=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was twice voted into the [[Professional Footballers' Association]]'s Third Division Team of the Year.&lt;ref name=&quot;triggs352&quot;&gt;{{cite book | first=Roger|last= Triggs | title=The Men Who Made Gillingham Football Club| pages=352}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Confident that he was being targeted by clubs from higher divisions, Bruce resolved not to sign a new contract with Gillingham when his existing deal expired at the end of the [[1983-84 in English football|1983–84 season]].&lt;ref name=&quot;SB60&quot;&gt;{{cite book | first=Steve|last= Bruce | title=Heading for Victory: An Autobiography| pages=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an April 1983 match against [[Newport County A.F.C.|Newport County]] he attempted, in a moment of anger, to deliberately injure opposition player [[Tommy Tynan]], but connected awkwardly and succeeded only in breaking his own leg, leaving him unable to play again for six months.&lt;ref name=&quot;SB62&quot;&gt;{{cite book | first=Steve|last= Bruce | title=Heading for Victory: An Autobiography| pages=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; He returned in time to play a key role in Gillingham achieving two draws against [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] in the [[FA Cup]] in 1984, attracting the attention once again of [[Scout (sports)|scouts]] from [[Football League First Division|First Division]] clubs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Buster2&quot; /&gt; [[Arthur Cox (footballer)|Arthur Cox]], manager of Bruce's beloved Newcastle United, expressed an interest in signing the player, but resigned from his job before any further action could be taken.&lt;ref name=&quot;SB65&quot;&gt;{{cite book | first=Steve|last= Bruce | title=Heading for Victory: An Autobiography| pages=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bruce eventually opted to sign for [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] in August 1984 for a fee variously reported as £125,000&lt;ref name=&quot;sang&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.soccerbase.com/transfers_by_value.sd?seasonid=114|title=Transfers between £ 0 and £ 99999999 in 1984/1985

Following the lifting of the five-year ban on English clubs from European competitions, which had been imposed after the [[Heysel Stadium Disaster]], United became England's first entrants into the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup]] in the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup 1990–91|1990–91 season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bateson|first=Bill|coauthors=Albert Sewell|title=News of the World Football Annual 1990–91|publisher=Invincible Press|year=1990|pages=129|isbn=0-85543-207-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bruce played regularly, and scored three goals, in the team's progress to [[1991 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup Final|the final]] against [[FC Barcelona]].&lt;ref name=&quot;stret91&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stretfordend.co.uk/seasons/season1991.html|title=Season 1990/91|publisher=StretfordEnd.co.uk|accessdate=2008-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; He came close to scoring the first goal, only for [[Mark Hughes]] to deflect the ball over the line and claim the goal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:AWNB:LTIB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0F91EC6FB2495ECE&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=0D0CB57AB53DF815|title=Hughes provides the spark – Football|work=The Times|author=Stuart Jones|date=1991-05-16|accessdate=2008-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and United went on to win the game 2–1.

At the height of his success with United, Bruce was contacted by [[Jack Charlton]], manager of the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland national team]], who had discovered that, due to his mother's place of birth, Bruce was eligible to play for Ireland. Bruce states in his autobiography that further investigation revealed that, while his earlier appearance for England B in a [[Exhibition match|friendly match]] was not an issue, his appearances for the England Youth team in a [[UEFA]]-sanctioned tournament prohibited him from playing for the senior team of another country.&lt;ref name=&quot;SB89&quot;&gt;{{cite book | first=Steve|last= Bruce | title=Heading for Victory: An Autobiography| pages=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has subsequently claimed, however, that he chose not to play for Ireland as it would have caused problems for his club at a time when the Premier League restricted the number of foreign players that a club could include in its team.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ireland&quot; /&gt; 

United dominated English football in the [[1993-94 in English football|1993–94 season]], winning a second consecutive Premier League title and then defeating Chelsea in the [[1994 FA Cup Final|FA Cup final]] to become only the fourth team, and Bruce the first English captain, to win [[Double (association football)|The Double]] in the twentieth century,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:AWNB:LTIB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0F924217D546CF4E&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=0D0CB57AB53DF815|title=United worthy of place among elite – FA Cup|work=The Times|author=Rob Hughes|date=1994-05-16|accessdate=2008-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The other twentieth century Double-winning captains were [[Dave Mackay (footballer born 1934)|Dave Mackay]] and [[Alan Hansen]], both from [[Scotland]], and [[Danny Blanchflower]] from [[Northern Ireland]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SB1&quot;&gt;{{cite book | first=Steve|last= Bruce | title=Heading for Victory: An Autobiography| pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[1994-95 in English football|1994–95 season]] was a disappointing one for Bruce and United, however, as the club failed in its bid to win a third consecutive Premier League title and lost to Everton in the [[1995 FA Cup Final|FA Cup final]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:AWNB:LTIB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0F9247A0E0BFBA03&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=0D0CB57AB53DF815|title=Everton's Royle revival crowned by Rideout – Football|work=The Times|author=Rob Hughes|date=1995-05-22|accessdate=2008-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style of play==
During the early part of his career, Bruce's sometimes over-enthusiastic playing style, which he later described as &quot;rampaging&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Buster2&quot; /&gt; caused him disciplinary problems.

At the time, [[Mark Wright (footballer born 1963)|Mark Wright]] of Liverpool was said to be the only other central defender able to match Bruce's level of skill in these areas.&lt;ref name=&quot;recovery&quot; /&gt; 

Bruce was also known for his unusually high goalscoring rate for a central defender, resulting from a combination of his ability to powerfully head the ball and his effectiveness in taking [[penalty kick]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.setanta.com/Templates/News/NewsArticle.aspx?id=8896&amp;epslanguage=EN|publisher=Setanta Sports|title=The XI at 11: Goalscoring centre backs|author=Adam Marshall|date=2007-10-02|accessdate=2008-09-10| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080514074757/http://www.setanta.com/Templates/News/NewsArticle.aspx?id=8896&amp;epslanguage=EN| archivedate = 14 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although lacking poise and grace,&lt;ref name=&quot;IP&quot; /&gt; and often criticised for his lack of pace,&lt;ref name=&quot;IP&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:AWNB:LTIB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0F924308782B4AB3&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=0D0CB57AB53DF815|work=The Times|title=Cantona key to United's ignition – Football|author=Rob Hughes|date=1994-11-23|accessdate=2008-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; his bravery and willingness to take knocks from opposition players made him the &quot;heart&quot; of the defence during his time with Manchester United.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester_united/s/1017296_vidic_succeeds_as_king_bruce_|work=Manchester Evening News|title=Vidic succeeds as king Bruce|author=Mike Whalley|date=2007-09-22|accessdate=2008-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was well known for continuing to play even when injured,&lt;ref name=&quot;IP&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.examiner.ie/story/sport/qlkfsnmhql/rss2/|work=Irish Examiner|title=Masked ball for 50 in-a-row ‘Killer’|author=Liam Mackey|date=2008-09-10|accessdate=2008-09-22|quote=But Steve Bruce — I think he played with 20 broken bones!}}&lt;/ref&gt; including returning to the United team at short notice in 1992 even though he was awaiting an operation on a hernia.&lt;ref name=&quot;recovery&quot; /&gt; His indomitable spirit and motivational abilities were deemed vital to the United team,&lt;ref name=&quot;IP&quot; /&gt; and Alex Ferguson has commented on his &quot;determination and heart&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/clubfootball/news/newsid=657703.html|publisher=Fédération Internationale de Football Association |title=Fergie compares captain Rooney to greats|date=2007-12-11|accessdate=2008-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Managerial career==
===Early managerial career===
In his first season as a manager, Bruce guided Sheffield United to eighth place in the [[Football League First Division|First Division]], nine points away from a place in the play-offs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Bruce felt that the &quot;Gunners&quot; had broken an unwritten rule of sportsmanship by failing to return the ball to United, who had intentionally kicked it out of play to allow an injured player to be attended to. Although the game eventually continued to a finish, it was later declared void and replayed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

===Other activities===
In addition to an autobiography, &quot;Heading for Victory&quot;, Bruce has published three novels, &quot;Sweeper!&quot;, &quot;Defender!&quot; and &quot;Striker!&quot;, featuring the exploits of fictional footballer manager Steve Barnes. &quot;Sweeper!&quot; was described as &quot;surprisingly punchy and pacey, although the plot is essentially ludicrous&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
