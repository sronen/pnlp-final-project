[[Sid Barnes]] was a key member of [[Donald Bradman]]'s famous [[Australian cricket team in England in 1948|Australian cricket team, which toured England in 1948]]. The team went undefeated in their 34 matches; this unprecedented feat by a [[Test cricket|Test side]] touring England earned them the sobriquet ''The Invincibles''. A right-handed [[batting order (cricket)|opening batsman]], Barnes was part of Bradman's first-choice team and played in four of the five Tests&amp;mdash;he missed one match due to injury&amp;mdash;partnering the left-handed [[Arthur Morris]].

Barnes ended the [[first-class cricket|first-class matches]] with 1,354 [[run (cricket)|runs]] at a [[batting average]] of 56.41 including three [[century (cricket)|centuries]], placing him fifth in the aggregates and sixth in the averages among the Australians. Barnes found his best form in the Tests, yielding 329 runs at 82.25, ranking him third in the aggregates and second in the averages. He scored half-centuries in both innings of the First Test at [[Trent Bridge]], before compiling a hard-hitting 141 in the second innings of the Second Test at [[Lord's]], helping to set up victory in both matches. In the Third Test, Barnes was injured and hospitalised after being hit in the ribs by a [[Dick Pollard]] [[batting (cricket)|pull shot]]. He returned the next day and attempted to bat, but collapsed again and had to be taken back to hospital for an extended stay, missing two weeks of cricket. After missing the Fourth Test, Barnes returned to score his third half-century for the series as Australia completed a 4–0 win with an [[Result (cricket)#Statement of result|innings victory]] in the Fifth Test.

Aside from his run-scoring, Barnes, who was well known for being eccentric, gained fame throughout the season for his [[fielding (cricket)|fielding]] at [[Cricket fielding positions|short leg]]—just a few metres from the batsman—where he took 19 [[catch (cricket)|catches]] for the season. Barnes stood much closer than others who fielded in the position, placing one foot on the edge of the [[cricket pitch|pitch]]. His extreme proximity prompted questions about the legitimacy of his action and English captain [[Norman Yardley]] later admitted that Barnes had intimidated his batsmen.

==Background==
Barnes had been a regular member of the [[Australian cricket team]] since [[World War II]] and was on his second trip to England after making his Test debut there in 1938 before the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| publisher = [[Cricinfo]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1946–47 Australian season, which saw [[England cricket team|England]] tour for five Tests, the home nation's senior opening batsman [[Bill Brown (cricketer)|Bill Brown]] was injured. Barnes and debutant [[Arthur Morris]] had [[batting average|averaged]] 73.83 and 71.85 respectively, playing in all five matches.&lt;ref name=ash/&gt; 

Barnes went to England in the Australian winter of 1947. In his autobiography, he claimed to have gone as a representative for an alcohol company, although appears to have dealt in commodities that were in short supply due to rationing.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, pp. 139–147.&lt;/ref&gt; Once in England, he was approached by [[Burnley Cricket Club|Burnley]] to play as a professional in [[Lancashire League (cricket)|Lancashire League]] cricket, which he did briefley before becoming disinterested and resigning.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt; Barnes returned to Australia for the 1947–48 season, keen to win a place on the 1948 tour to England. He was worried that having played as a professional in the Lancashire League would damage his chance of further Test cricket, as the Australian authorities frowned on those who played professionally in England. There was also concern that, with his wife now living in Scotland, he would breach the [[Cricket Australia|Australian Board of Control's]] rule that wives were not allowed to travel with players, by being in the same overseas country.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, pp. 151–158.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Brown, Barnes and Morris shared the opening duties against the visiting [[India national cricket team|Indians]]; their batting averages were 43.00, 52.25 and 42.66 respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Events/AUS/India_in_Australia_1947-48/t_Australia_Batting.html |title=Test Batting and Fielding for Australia India in Australia 1947/48 |publisher=[[CricketArchive]] |accessdate=2009-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; With Brown recovered, the Australian selectors dropped Barnes for the first two Tests against the Indians. However, Brown struggled and made only 18 and 11 [[run (cricket)|runs]]&amp;mdash;Australia batted once in both Tests&amp;mdash;and was then dropped for Barnes, who made only 12 and 15 in the Third Test. Retained for the Fourth Test, Barnes made 112 in an Australian victory. Morris&amp;mdash;whose place was secure&lt;ref name=pie/&gt;&amp;mdash;was rested for the Fifth and final Test to give Brown another chance to show that he was worthy of selection. Barnes made 33 while Brown made 99 [[run out]] as Australia completed a 4&amp;ndash;0 series win.&lt;ref name=pie&gt;Piesse, pp. 153&amp;ndash;156.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Player Oracle WA Brown |url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/cgi-bin/player_oracle_reveals_results2.cgi?playernumber=636&amp;opponentmatch=exact&amp;playername=Meckiff&amp;resulttype=All&amp;matchtype=All&amp;teammatch=exact&amp;startwicket=&amp;homeawaytype=All&amp;opponent=&amp;endwicket=&amp;wicketkeeper=&amp;searchtype=InningsList&amp;endscore=&amp;playermatch=contains&amp;branding=cricketarchive&amp;captain=&amp;endseason=&amp;startscore=&amp;team=&amp;startseason= |accessdate=2009-05-14 |publisher=[[CricketArchive]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Player Oracle SG Barnes|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/cgi-bin/player_oracle_reveals_results2.cgi?playernumber=711&amp;opponentmatch=exact&amp;playername=Meckiff&amp;resulttype=All&amp;matchtype=All&amp;teammatch=exact&amp;startwicket=&amp;homeawaytype=All&amp;opponent=&amp;endwicket=&amp;wicketkeeper=&amp;searchtype=InningsList&amp;endscore=&amp;playermatch=contains&amp;branding=cricketarchive&amp;captain=&amp;endseason=&amp;startscore=&amp;team=&amp;startseason= |accessdate=2009-05-14 |publisher=[[CricketArchive]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the end, all three were selected for the England tour,&lt;ref name=pie/&gt; though Barnes had to give assurances about the amount of contact he would have with his wife&amp;mdash;still living in Scotland&amp;mdash;before he was confirmed.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt; As specialist opening batsmen, the trio were competing for the two opening positions in Bradman's first-choice team.&lt;ref name=ash&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Events/AUS/Marylebone_Cricket_Club_in_Australia_1946-47/t_Australia_Batting.html |title=Test Batting and Fielding for Australia Marylebone Cricket Club in Australia 1946/47|publisher=[[CricketArchive]] |accessdate=2009-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barnes brought along half a tonne of baggage on the sea voyage to England, including a lot of food and drink, particularly alcohol, which was scarce due to the war and subject to rationing. There Barnes would sell his goods.&lt;ref&gt;Perry (2008), p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; During the journey, the players had to sign autographs on 5,000 sheets of paper with the team list. Barnes had a stamp of his signature made, and paid a young boy drinks to deal with the sheets, but he landed himself in trouble with captain [[Don Bradman]] and manager [[Keith Johnson (cricket administrator)|Keith Johnson]] when the boy stamped the sheets erratically, sometimes not adjacent to Barnes's position on the team list.&lt;ref&gt;Perry (2008), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early tour==
Australia traditionally fielded its strongest possible team in the tour opener, which was customarily against [[Worcestershire County Cricket Club|Worcestershire]].&lt;ref name=haigh&gt;{{cite news| title=Gentrifying the game| first=Gideon | last=Haigh| authorlink=Gideon Haigh| url=http://www.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/295893.html |publisher=[[Cricinfo]] |date=2007-05-26| accessdate=2007-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barnes [[batting order (cricket)|opened]] with Morris, while reserve opener Brown batted out of position in the [[batting order (cricket)|middle order]]. The hosts won the toss and batted first, and Barnes took the last two [[catch (cricket)|catches]] as Australia [[dismissal (cricket)|dismissed them]] for 233. He delivered nine [[over (cricket)|overs]] with his [[leg spin]] and was the most [[economy rate|economical]] Australian [[bowler (cricket)|bowler]], conceding ten runs without taking a [[Wicket (dismissal)|wicket]].&lt;ref name=worcs&gt;{{cite web

During the second innings, Barnes took his first wicket for the tour, having [[Laddy Outschoorn]] [[List of cricket terms#C|caught behind]] by [[Don Tallon]] to spark a [[List of cricket terms#C|collapse]] that saw the home side [[Wicket (dismissal)|lose their last five wickets]] for 47 runs. Barnes ended with 1/25 and took two catches in the second innings; all four of his catches for the match were from [[spin bowling|spinners]].&lt;ref name=worcs/&gt;

Morris was rested for the following match against [[Leicestershire County Cricket Club|Leicestershire]], so Barnes partnered Brown at the [[Batting order (cricket)|top of the order]]. [[Partnership (cricket)|The pair put on]] 46 before Brown fell. Barnes then put on 111 with Bradman for the second wicket before falling for 78 at 2/157 to a [[leg before wicket]] (lbw) decision the tourists regarded as a clear error.&lt;ref&gt;Perry (2008), p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; Unhindered, Australia made 448 and won by an innings. Barnes took two catches in the first innings, both from [[spin bowling|spinners]], and bowled four overs without success in the second innings.&lt;ref name=sched/&gt;&lt;ref name=leics&gt;{{cite web

&lt;!--[[File:Arthur Morris.jpg|thumb|left|Arthur Morris (pictured), Barnes's Test opening partner.]]--&gt;Barnes returned for the subsequent fixture against [[Surrey County Cricket Club|Surrey]] at [[The Oval]] in [[London]], where Australia won the [[toss (cricket)|toss]] and batted first.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;&lt;ref name=sched/&gt; Barnes attacked immediately,&lt;ref&gt;Fingleton, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; and put on an [[partnership (cricket)|opening partnership]] of 136 with Morris, before the latter fell. Bradman and Barnes put on another 207 for the second wicket before Barnes fell for 176. The tourists continued to build on the foundation laid by the top order and were eventually [[dismissal (cricket)|bowled out]] for 632.

It caused a stoppage in play by evading the players and police for a few minutes. Eventually, Barnes used the ball to bait and trap the dog, which he then  presented to Skelding stating: &quot;You must need a dog.

Bradman chose Barnes and Morris as his preferred opening pair, while Brown continued out of position in the middle order. Barring one change in the bowling department, the same team lined up in the First Test, with the top six batsmen in the same position.&lt;ref name=sco1/&gt;&lt;ref name=mcc/&gt; For players on both sides, it was a chance to gain a psychological advantage ahead of the Tests. Australia won the toss and batted and Morris fell with the score at 1/11. Barnes added 160 for the next wicket with Bradman before falling for 81 with the score at 2/171. Bradman's men went on to amass 552 and bowled out the hosts for 189 and 205 to win by an innings; Barnes caught [[John Deighton (cricketer)|John Deighton]] and [[Jack Robertson]] and took 0/15 from four overs.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;  During the match, Barnes again gained attention for placing himself extremely close to the batsman when fielding at [[Cricket fielding positions|short leg]],&lt;ref name=f73/&gt; with one foot on the edge of the [[cricket pitch|cut strip]].  According to retired Australian Test batsman [[Jack Fingleton]], himself a former fielder in the [[Fielding (cricket)#Off and leg side fields|leg trap]], &quot;[Barnes’s position] was the closest I have ever seen any fieldsman on the leg side&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;f73&quot;/&gt; Bradman had suggested Barnes do so when leading English batsman [[Len Hutton]] was playing, in an attempt to distract or intimidate him. Barnes later claimed he was at little risk as Hutton was reluctant to [[Batting (cricket)|hook]] Australia's pace bowlers towards him and preferred to duck [[bouncer (cricket)|bowling aimed at his upper body]]. He said Hutton often talked pessimistically to teammates and that the Australians would benefit if they dampened Hutton's confidence.&lt;ref&gt;Perry (2008), pp. 68&amp;ndash;69.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Hutton top-scored in both innings, scoring 52 and 64, Barnes said the batsman's eyes betrayed discomfort. The theatrical Barnes also decided to test the umpire's patience by hovering his foot over the pitch, as though he were about to place it down on the batting surface, which was against the [[laws of cricket]].

England and MCC captain [[Norman Yardley]] later admitted Barnes's close proximity throughout the season had a psychological affect on his batsmen, although the Australian did miss catches because he was too close to react to the oncoming ball.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fingleton, p. 74&quot;&gt;Fingleton, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt;

==First Test==
{{Main|First Test, 1948 Ashes series}}
Having overcome food poisoning leading up to the match,&lt;ref&gt;Perry (2008), pp. 104&amp;ndash;106.&lt;/ref&gt; Barnes was selected for the First Test at [[Trent Bridge]], as were the other two openers in the squad.&lt;ref name=sco1/&gt; England elected to bat first,&lt;ref name=f82&gt;Fingleton, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; and Australia's fast bowlers reduced the home side to 8/74 before finishing them off for 165 late on the first afternoon.&lt;ref name=sco1/&gt; In Australia's reply, Barnes partnered Morris at the top of the order, while Brown played out of position in the middle order.&lt;ref name=sco1/&gt; The pair had less than 15 minutes of batting before the scheduled close of play. Barnes made an [[list of cricket terms#L|appeal against the light]] after the first ball of the innings, which was a [[wide (cricket)|wide]] by [[Bill Edrich]].&lt;ref name=&quot;report1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author=Hayter, R.

Ideal batting conditions and clear skies greeted the players on the second morning.&lt;ref name=report1/&gt; Barnes batted assuredly, while Morris was hesitant and shuffled around the [[crease (cricket)|crease]]. At one stage, Morris scored only seven runs in 55 minutes. Barnes was involved in some interplay with umpire Chester when the latter stopped a [[Drive (cricket)|drive]] from Morris with his foot. Barnes picked the ball off the wicket and [[handled the ball|handed it]] to the bowler, prompting Chester to wag his finger in disapproval. Barnes responded by admonishing the umpire for blocking the ball.&lt;ref&gt;Fingleton, pp. 88–89.&lt;/ref&gt;

Barnes and Morris took the score to 73 before the latter was out for 31 after two hours of batting.&lt;ref name=sco1/&gt; Bradman came in and Yardley set a defensive field, employing [[leg theory]] to slow the scoring. The hosts’ captain packed the [[leg side]] with fielders and ordered Bedser to bowl at [[Stump (cricket)#Part of the wicket|leg stump]].&lt;ref name=f90&gt;Fingleton, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; Barnes reached his half-century after 135 minutes at the crease with a [[Pull shot|pull]] for [[four (cricket)|four]] from [[Charlie Barnett (cricketer)|Charlie Barnett]].&lt;ref name=f91&gt;Fingleton, p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; The score progressed to 121 before Barnes [[Batting (cricket)#Cut|cut]] [[Jim Laker]] onto the thigh of [[wicket-keeper]] [[Godfrey Evans]]. The ball bounced away, but the gloveman turned around and took a one-handed diving catch to dismiss Barnes for 62.&lt;ref name=report1/&gt;&lt;ref name=f91/&gt; Umpire [[Ernest Cooke]] was unsure of whether Barnes had hit the ball into the ground before Evans took the catch, and consulted with Chester, who had been standing at point on the other side of the field, before ruling the batsman out.&lt;ref name=o38&gt;O'Reilly, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Keith Miller]] came in and was dismissed for a duck without further addition to leave Australia's total at 3/121.&lt;ref name=&quot;sco1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;report1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=f91/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p235&quot;&gt;Perry (2005), p. 235.&lt;/ref&gt; Australia went on to reach 509 all out on the third day, yielding a 344-run first innings lead.&lt;ref name=sco1/&gt;

With leading paceman [[Ray Lindwall]] injured, Australia’s bowling stocks were stretched and Barnes was brought on during England's second innings and as the fifth bowler to give the others some time to rest. Barnes delivered five overs and conceded 11 runs.&lt;ref name=sco1/&gt;&lt;ref name=f97&gt;Fingleton, p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; In foggy and misty conditions,&lt;ref name=o50&gt;O'Reilly, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joe Hardstaff junior]] brought up England's 200 with a firmly-struck [[Pull shot|hook]] that almost hit Barnes, who was standing at point-blank range at short leg and could not duck before the ball went past.&lt;ref name=f101&gt;Fingleton, p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt;

England were eventually out for 441 on the final day, leaving Australia a target of 98. Bradman’s men progressed quickly at the start of the chase. Barnes took 13 runs from the opening over by Bedser, including three boundaries,&lt;ref name=a50&gt;Arlott, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; whereas Morris again lacked fluency. However, Barnes continued to score quickly, and 24 runs came from the first four overs.&lt;ref name=a50/&gt;&lt;ref name=f105/&gt; The tourists proceeded steadily to 38 from 32 minutes before Morris fell for nine.&lt;ref name=f105&gt;Fingleton, p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; Bradman came to the crease and fell for a duck after 12 minutes in the middle.&lt;ref name=&quot;report1&quot;/&gt; This left Australia at 2/48; dark clouds began to close in on the ground, and rain appeared to be a possible saviour for England.&lt;ref name=a51&gt;Arlott, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it never came; [[Lindsay Hassett]] joined Barnes and they took the tourists to the target without further loss after 87 minutes of batting.&lt;ref name=sco1/&gt;&lt;ref name=a51/&gt; Barnes gave [[Jack Young (cricketer)|Jack Young]] an opportunity for a return catch, but the ball was dropped.&lt;ref name=a51/&gt; Barnes tied the scores with a [[Batting (cricket)#Sweep|swept]] [[boundary (cricket)#Scoring runs|boundary]] and ran off the field with a souvenir stump, believing the match was over. He tossed his souvenir back into the playing arena and returned to the field after noticing the reaction of the amused crowd and realising his mistake; Hassett proceeded to hit the winning run. Barnes ended unbeaten on 64 with 11 boundaries; he scored prolifically with his [[Batting (cricket)#Cut|square cut]].&lt;ref name=&quot;sco1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;report1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=f105/&gt; The next morning, he perused all of the newspapers, expecting to be heavily rebuked by analysts for reckless batting on the final day, but they instead focused on his captain's failure to score.&lt;ref&gt;Perry (2008), p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between Tests, Barnes played in the match against [[Northamptonshire County Cricket Club|Northamptonshire]], which started the day after Trent Bridge. Barnes made 11 and bowled three wicketless overs as Australia cruised to victory by an innings.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;&lt;ref name=sched/&gt;&lt;ref name=northants&gt;{{cite web

==Second Test==
{{Main|Second Test, 1948 Ashes series}}

Australia opted to field an unchanged lineup for the Second Test at [[Lord's]], the home of cricket.&lt;ref name=sco1/&gt;&lt;ref name=sco2/&gt; Before the match, Barnes wagered £8 at 15/1 on himself to score a century,&lt;ref name=&quot;insideedge&quot;&gt;{{cite news|author= |title=The 50 Greatest Australian Cricketers |work=Inside Edge (magazine)|publisher=ACP |year=2001|page=56 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and trained especially diligently in the lead-up to the Lord's fixture.&lt;ref&gt;Perry (2008), p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt; He was motivated because the Australian Board of Control had given his wife rare permission to attend the match, and the refusal of the authorities at Lord's to allow him to practise there when he was in London a year earlier; Barnes saw a strong personal performance as an ideal response to what he regarded as a snub.&lt;ref&gt;Perry (2008), pp. 128&amp;ndash;129.&lt;/ref&gt; On the first morning, Bradman won the toss and elected to bat,&lt;ref name=&quot;sco2&quot;/&gt; and Barnes continued his run of low scores since the First Test. The first over bowled by Bedser to Barnes was watchfully played to complete a maiden.&lt;ref name=a56&gt;Arlott, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; The debutant [[Alec Coxon]] opened the bowling with Bedser and removed Barnes for a duck in his second over, caught by [[Len Hutton]] at [[Cricket fielding positions|short fine leg]].&lt;ref name=f108/&gt; Barnes tried to knock the short delivery through [[Cricket fielding positions|square leg]] but misjudged the pace of the wicket and played his shot too early, mishitting the ball to Hutton,&lt;ref name=o60&gt;O'Reilly, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; and leaving Australia at 1/3.&lt;ref name=f108&gt;Fingleton, p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;report2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Hayter, R. J.|title= Second Test Match England v Australia |work= [[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack]] |year=1949  |url=http://www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/152895.html |publisher=[[Wisden]] |accessdate=2008-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; They eventually reached 350 and bowled England out for 215 early on the third day.&lt;ref name=sco2/&gt;

The weather was fine as Australia started their second innings just after noon.&lt;ref name=f112/&gt; On the second ball of the innings—bowled by Bedser—Barnes got off the mark to avoid his [[pair (cricket)|pair]].&lt;ref name=f112&gt;Fingleton, p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; Coxon took the new ball at [[List of cricket terms#E|the other end]] and Barnes and Morris saw it off.&lt;ref name=report2/&gt;&lt;ref name=f113/&gt; In contrast to their English counterparts, the Australian opening pair began cautiously, avoiding the hook shot and not playing at balls that were not going to hit the stumps, establishing a solid start for themselves.&lt;ref&gt;O'Reilly, pp. 72&amp;ndash;73.&lt;/ref&gt; Keen to win his bet, Barnes was particularly determined. He survived a [[stump (cricket)#Manner of dismissing a batsman|stumping]] opportunity from Laker when he was 18; he came [[List of cricket terms#D|down the pitch]] and the ball bounced out of the [[List of cricket terms#F|footmarks]] past the bat and narrowly missed the leg stump, but Evans fumbled the ball, which went away for four [[bye (cricket)|byes]], giving Barnes [[List of cricket terms#L|a life]].&lt;ref name=report2/&gt;&lt;ref name=f113&gt;Fingleton, p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=o73&gt;O'Reilly, p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=a65&gt;Arlott, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; Barnes took advantage of the let-off to combine with Morris for an opening stand of 122,&lt;ref name=sco2/&gt; as Yardley made frequent bowling changes in an attempt to disrupt the Australian pair.&lt;ref name=f113/&gt; Morris stopped shuffling, while Barnes adopted a strategy of pre-emptively moving down the pitch to attack  the [[off spin]] of Laker. Earlier in the tour, Barnes had often been [[bowled]] or trapped [[leg before wicket]] (lbw) while trying to force [[off break]]s into the leg side [[List of cricket terms#F|from the crease]]. On this occasion, he drove Laker into the [[List of cricket terms#P|pavilion]] for [[six (cricket)|six]] and Australia reached 0/73 at the luncheon adjournment with Barnes on 25, an overall lead of 208.&lt;ref name=sco2/&gt;&lt;ref name=f140&gt;Fingleton, p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--[[Image:Bradman Barnes 234.jpg|left|Bradman (left) and Barnes in an earlier Test. They put on 174 in the second innings of the Second Test|thumb]]--&gt;
After lunch, Morris was bowled for 62.&lt;ref name=f116&gt;Fingleton, p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; Bradman joined Barnes and the Australian skipper played and missed a few times before settling down.&lt;ref name=f116/&gt; Barnes responded to his captain's difficulties by manipulating the strike and shielding Bradman from Bedser. The Australian opener had little trouble against the leg trap Bedser set for him, scoring freely into the leg side and taking the shine off the second new ball.&lt;ref name=o74&gt;O'Reilly, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; Generally however, Barnes also scored sedately after lunch, and after one extended period of defence, he drove Laker for four through the [[Cricket fielding positions|covers]], eliciting a round of ironic applause. Barnes responded to the public gallery by placing his hand on his chest and bowing to the spectators.&lt;ref name=f117&gt;Fingleton, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; Barnes had started slowly, but accelerated after reaching his half-century.&lt;ref name=report2/&gt; He reached 96 with Australia at 1/222 half an hour after tea.&lt;ref name=f117/&gt; By this time, the pace of the pitch appeared to have slowed, making batting relatively easy.&lt;ref name=o74/&gt;

Barnes lingered for a further ten minutes on 96 before reaching his century with a [[Drive (cricket)|straight drive]] from Laker. He had taken 255 minutes and hit ten fours in reaching triple figures.&lt;ref name=f117/&gt; Having registered his century and fulfilled his bet,&lt;ref name=insideedge/&gt; Barnes became particularly aggressive.&lt;ref name=report2/&gt; He stepped out of his ground to attack Laker, but missed, as did Evans, who was unable to stop the ball as it spun down the leg side.&lt;ref name=f117/&gt; Barnes dispatched one Laker over for 21 runs, including two consecutive shots over the [[Long on|long on boundary]] and two fours.&lt;ref name=f117/&gt; Barnes was finally removed for 141, caught on the boundary by [[Cyril Washbrook]] from the bowling of Yardley.&lt;ref name=&quot;report2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=f118&gt;Fingleton, p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; He struck 14 boundaries and two sixes in his innings and the speed of his batting had allowed Australia to reach 2/296 in 277 minutes after a 174-run partnership with Bradman.&lt;ref name=&quot;sco2&quot;/&gt; Hassett was bowled first ball,&lt;ref name=f118/&gt; so Miller came to the crease at 3/296 to face the [[hat-trick]] ball. He survived a loud lbw appeal to deny Yardley his hat-trick; Australia consolidated and eventually declared at 7/460 on the fourth day.&lt;ref name=sco5/&gt;

England faced a target of 596, which would have required a world record Test run-chase—no team had successfully chased down more than 400 for victory.&lt;ref name=sco2/&gt; Early on, Washbrook [[Pull shot|pulled]] Lindwall for a four, almost collecting Barnes in the nose in his customary short leg position.&lt;ref name=f121&gt;Fingleton, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; Australia bowled out the hosts for 186 to win by 409 runs and take a 2–0 lead.&lt;ref name=sco2/&gt;

The next match was against [[Surrey County Cricket Club|Surrey]] and started the day after the Test. After 16 days of cricket in 20 calendar days,&lt;ref name=o/&gt;&lt;ref name=sched/&gt; Barnes was rested as Australia completed a 10-wicket win.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;&lt;ref name=sched/&gt;&lt;ref name=surrey2&gt;{{cite web

At times, Barnes wandered about aimlessly between various positions, but Hassett, captaining in place of the resting Bradman, did not attempt to command him.&lt;ref&gt;Perry (2008), pp. 152&amp;ndash;156.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Third Test==
{{Main|Third Test, 1948 Ashes series}}

The teams reassembled at Old Trafford for the Third Test. Australia dropped Brown, who had scored 73 runs at 24.33 in three Test innings in his unfamiliar position in the middle order.&lt;ref name=&quot;sco1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;sco2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;sco3&quot;/&gt; Yardley won the toss and elected to bat, and England made 363.&lt;ref name=&quot;sco3&quot;/&gt; Barnes caught his first victim for the Test series, the diminutive debutant opener [[George Emmett]], who was surprised by a [[bouncer (cricket)|rising ball]] from [[Ray Lindwall]]. Emmett took his eyes from the ball and fended with one hand on the horizontally-held bat, while ducking his head down below his arms;&lt;ref name=o88&gt;O'Reilly, p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; the ball bounced slowly off the pitch and after hitting Emmett’s bat, rebounded gently up in the air to Barnes, leaving England at 2/28.&lt;ref name=&quot;sco3&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=o88/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;report3&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Hayter, R.

However, Crapp did not capitalise and was out soon after.&lt;ref name=a83&gt;Arlott, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=f132&gt;Fingleton, p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; During the same middle session, Yardley hit Toshack to Barnes, who was again unable to complete the reflex catch. However, Yardley was dismissed shortly after for 22.&lt;ref name=sco3/&gt;&lt;ref name=o92&gt;O'Reilly, p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; Tail-ender [[Dick Pollard]] came to the crease on the second morning and pulled a ball from [[Ian Johnson (cricketer)|Ian Johnson]] into the left ribs of Barnes, who was standing at short leg, almost on the edge of the cut strip.&lt;ref name=f136&gt;Fingleton, p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Fingleton, Barnes &quot;dropped like a fallen tree&quot;,&lt;ref name=f136/&gt; and a minority of spectators loudly celebrated the injury.&lt;ref name=p165&gt;Perry (2008), p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt; Briefly paralysed on his left side,&lt;ref name=p165/&gt; he had to be carried from the ground by four policemen and taken to hospital for an examination.&lt;ref name=&quot;report3&quot;/&gt;

Australia came out to bat halfway through the middle session on the second day, after England had ended on 363.&lt;ref name=f136/&gt; Having dropped Brown, Barnes's injury left Australia with only one specialist opener, Morris. Johnson—a bowler—was deployed as Australia's makeshift second opener and fell for one.&lt;ref name=sco3/&gt; On the third morning, Barnes came out to bat upon [[Keith Miller]]'s dismissal at 4/135, even though he had collapsed from the aftereffects of his injury while practising in the nets. Barnes had refused to stay in hospital and returned to the ground despite his ribs being discoloured from the bruising.&lt;ref name=f139&gt;Fingleton, p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt; Bradman was not aware of Barnes's collapse in the nets, but had told all rounder [[Sam Loxton]] to bat before Barnes to give the bruised opener more rest. Loxton told Barnes of Bradman's wishes, but when Miller was dismissed, Barnes defied team orders and walked out to bat, shaking Pollard's hand at the start of his innings.&lt;ref name=p167&gt;Perry (2008), p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt;

He made a painful single in 25 minutes of batting before it became too much. The bruising severely restricted his mobility and breathing, and he turned down a single after being called through by Loxton, who had come in at the fall of Morris. Soon after, the pair took a single, and Barnes collapsed after completing the run.&lt;ref name=p167/&gt; Barnes was taken from the ground with the assistance of Bradman among others, and sent back to hospital to recuperate for several days.&lt;ref name=f140/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;report3&quot;/&gt; He took no further part in the match, which ended in a rain-affected draw; Johnson again fell for single figures in the second innings.&lt;ref name=sco3/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;report3&quot;/&gt; After the Test, Barnes&amp;mdash;still injured&amp;mdash;missed the ten-wicket victory over [[Middlesex County Cricket Club|Middlesex]] at Lord's.

Barnes returned from injury after two and a half weeks on the sidelines immediately after the Fourth Test.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;&lt;ref name=sched/&gt; He made 24 as Australia amassed 456 and defeated [[Derbyshire County Cricket Club|Derbyshire]] by an innings.

==Fifth Test==
{{Main|Fifth Test, 1948 Ashes series}}

Australia headed south to [[The Oval]] for the Fifth Test. Barnes resumed his opening position, while Hassett returned to his customary position in the middle order.&lt;ref name=sco4/&gt;&lt;ref name=sco5/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;report5&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Preston, Hubert|title= Fifth Test Match England v Australia |work= [[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack]] |year=1949  |url=http://www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/152898.html |accessdate=2008-07-02 |publisher=[[Wisden]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; England won the toss and elected to bat on a rain-affected pitch.&lt;ref name=&quot;report5&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;f183&quot;&gt;Fingleton, p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt; Propelled by [[Ray Lindwall]]'s 6/20, Australia skittled England for 52 in 42.1 overs on the first afternoon.&lt;ref name=sco5/&gt;&lt;ref name=report5/&gt;

In contrast, Australia batted with ease,&lt;ref name=&quot;report5&quot;/&gt; as the overcast skies cleared and the sun came out.&lt;ref name=&quot;sco5&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;f186&quot;/&gt; Morris and Barnes passed England's first innings total by themselves, taking less than an hour to push the Australians into the lead.&lt;ref name=o151/&gt; O’Reilly felt the Australian openers wanted to prove &quot;the pitch itself had nothing whatever to do with the English batting debacle&quot;.&lt;ref name=o151&gt;O'Reilly, p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt; The only chance came when Barnes powerfully square cut Bedser low to point, where Young spilled the catch.&lt;ref name=o151/&gt; When Young came on to bowl, his finger spin was expected to trouble the batsmen on a rain-affected surface, but he delivered little variation in pace and trajectory and Barnes in particular hit him repeatedly through the off side field.&lt;ref name=o151/&gt; Australia reached 100 at 17:30, with Barnes on 52 and Morris on 47.&lt;ref name=&quot;f186&quot;&gt;Fingleton, p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt; They took the score to 117 before Barnes was caught behind from [[Eric Hollies]] for 61, ending a 126-minute stand.&lt;ref name=&quot;sco5&quot;/&gt; Barnes stumbled forward to a fast-turning leg break that caught his outside edge. He had overbalanced and would have been stumped if he had failed to make contact with the ball.&lt;ref name=o151/&gt; Australia finished at 389 on the second day and bowled out the hosts for 188 in the second innings, sealing victory by an innings and 149 runs to complete a 4–0 series win.&lt;ref name=sco5/&gt;

==Later tour matches==
Seven matches remained on Bradman's quest to go through a tour of England undefeated.&lt;ref name=sched/&gt; Barnes was rested as Australia defeated [[Kent County Cricket Club|Kent]] by an innings immediately after the Fifth Test.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;&lt;ref name=kent&gt;{{cite web

Australia's biggest challenge in the post-Test tour matches was against the [[H. D. G. Leveson-Gower|Leveson-Gower's]] XI. During the last Australian campaign in 1938, this team was effectively a full-strength England outfit, but this time Bradman insisted only six current England Test players be allowed to represent the hosts. After his opponents had finalised their selection, Bradman fielded a full-strength team;&lt;ref&gt;Perry (2005), pp. 253–254.&lt;/ref&gt; the only difference from the Fifth Test team was Johnson’s inclusion at the expense of [[Doug Ring]]. The Australian bowlers skittled the hosts for 177, and Barnes put on 102 with Morris before the latter fell for 62. Bradman joined Barnes and the pair put on 225 for the second wicket. Barnes finished with 151, including 15 fours and 4 sixes, after throwing his wicket away to Laker's bowling, and Australia declared at 8/469. The hosts were 2/75 when the match ended in a draw after multiple rain delays.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;&lt;ref name=sco5/&gt;&lt;ref name=lg&gt;{{cite web

The tour ended with two non-first-class matches against [[Scotland national cricket team|Scotland]]. Barnes made five as Australia scored 236 in the first match. He then bowled nine overs&amp;mdash;including seven [[over (cricket)|maidens]]&amp;mdash;and conceded nine runs as Australia won by an innings. Barnes was rested for the second match, which also ended in an innings victory.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;&lt;ref name=sched/&gt;&lt;ref name=scot1&gt;{{cite web

==Role==
[[Image:Sid Barnes graph 1948.PNG|300px|right|thumb|A chart showing Barnes's batting performance during the tour.

The blue line is the average of the five most recent innings and the dots indicate [[not out]]s.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;]]

Barnes played in four of the five Tests as a right-handed opening batsman, partnering the left-handed Morris, although he batted at No. 6 in the Third Test due to his rib injury.&lt;ref name=sco1/&gt;&lt;ref name=sco2/&gt;&lt;ref name=sco3/&gt;&lt;ref name=sco4/&gt;&lt;ref name=sco5/&gt; Three opening batsmen were taken on the tour, Brown being the third. During the tour matches, which were usually played consecutively with one or no days between fixtures,&lt;ref name=sched/&gt; Bradman rotated the trio, generally to rest one from the match while the other two opened.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#00f&quot;&gt;N-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;{{Ref label|bat|2|a}} Notable exceptions occurred in the first two Tests, the opening match against Worcestershire and the warm-up match against the MCC. In those matches, Australia fielded its first-choice team and as a result, Brown played out of position in the middle order while Morris and Barnes opened.&lt;ref name=worcs/&gt;&lt;ref name=sco1/&gt;&lt;ref name=sco2/&gt;&lt;ref name=mcc/&gt; An occasional [[leg spin]] bowler, Barnes delivered only 65.4 overs during the first-class matches, five of which were in Tests. He took two wickets, both outside the Test arena.&lt;ref name=fc&gt;{{cite web| url=http://stats.cricinfo.com/ci/engine/records/averages/batting_bowling.html?class=4;id=1070;type=tour |publisher=[[Cricinfo]] |title=Batting and bowling averages Australia tour of England, Apr–Sep 1948 – First-class matches|accessdate=2008-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=aus&gt;{{cite web| url=http://stats.cricinfo.com/ci/engine/records/averages/batting_bowling_by_team.html?id=83;team=2;type=series |publisher=[[Cricinfo]] |title=Batting and bowling averages The Ashes, 1948 &amp;ndash; Australia |accessdate=2008-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barnes ended the first-class tour with 1,354 runs at 56.41 including three centuries, placing him fifth in the aggregates and sixth in the averages among the tourists. Barnes's form peaked in the Tests, scoring 329 runs at 82.25; among the Australians he ranked third in the aggregates and second in the averages.&lt;ref name=fc/&gt;&lt;ref name=aus/&gt;

An eccentric and strong-willed character who was not afraid to go against convention,&lt;ref name=prof/&gt; Barnes stationed himself as close to the bat as possible when fielding at either [[Cricket fielding positions|forward short-leg or silly point]]. The tour report in the 1949 edition of ''[[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack]]'' judged Barnes's fielding to be as important as his batting in the team’s success: {{quote|Probably a number of batsmen were sufficiently affected by his close attendance to cause them to lose concentration on the bowler [[run-up (cricket)|running up]], but equally important was the fact that the knowledge of his presence influenced opponents to avoid strokes in that direction. The Barnes demeanour in the field illustrated the general purposefulness of the Australians.&lt;ref name=&quot;1949wisden&quot;/&gt;}}

However, Barnes received criticism for this approach,&lt;ref name=prof&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; including from Fingleton, who fielded there during his playing career.&lt;ref name=f73/&gt; A letter was published in English newspapers, questioning Bradman on whether Barnes's position was legitimate—the writer thought Barnes's close proximity yielded an unfair advantage over the batsmen. Bradman later touted Barnes as the best fieldsman he had seen in the position, while England skipper Yardley admitted  Barnes had worried the home team's players. Fingleton said that if the position was unfair, then it was the umpires' duty to take action. He further said the batsmen should have tried to deter Barnes from standing so close by aiming shots at him, deeming the Australian to be &quot;of great value in a nuisance capacity throughout the tour&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fingleton, p. 74&quot;/&gt; After several near-misses,&lt;ref name=f73&gt;Fingleton, p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; he was finally hit in the Third Test and missed two weeks of cricket,&lt;ref name=&quot;report4&quot;/&gt; but he was not injured again after his resumption.&lt;ref name=&quot;1949wisden&quot;&gt;{{Cite book

== Aftermath ==
{{main|Keith Johnson (cricket administrator)}}
Barnes used the opportunity of travelling around England to pursue his business interests, cutting many deals.&lt;ref name=&quot;h107&quot;&gt;Haigh and Frith, p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; When he was rested from the first match against Yorkshire, he stayed in the capital and made deals at the London Exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;Perry (2008), pp. 39&amp;ndash;41.&lt;/ref&gt; During breaks in play, or when Australia was batting and he had already been dismissed, he often spent the time inspecting local factories and talking to other businesspeople.&lt;ref&gt;Perry (2008), p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; An important concern for Barnes, when returning to Australia by boat after the tour, was to avoid paying [[Duty (economics)|customs duties]] on the enormous amount of goods he acquired through various deals during the tour. This included fine English cloth, which was in very short supply in Australia. Hearing a rumour that customs officers were waiting in Sydney for him, Barnes disembarked at Melbourne and travelled to Sydney by train. The move worked and he sold his stock at a substantial profit, conservatively estimated to be equal to his tour fee.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt; Upon returning to Australia, Barnes opted out of first-class cricket to focus on business interests. He wrote a newspaper column, in which he often criticised cricket administrators and the small share of revenue they gave to players.&lt;ref name=&quot;Haigh&amp;Frith&quot;&gt;Haigh and Frith, pp. 107–111.&lt;/ref&gt; Barnes wrote in a confrontational manner, often lampooning and angering the authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Harte, pp. 401–402.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the 1951–52 season, Barnes returned to the New South Wales team in a bid to regain his Test position, and performed well. He was chosen by the selectors but the board disallowed his selection for conduct reasons rather than ability. The media figured this out and publicised it, and Barnes was overlooked for the whole season.&lt;ref name=&quot;Haigh&amp;Frith&quot;/&gt; Speculation abounded as to the nature of his supposed misdeeds. These included jumping the turnstile at a ground when he forgot his player's pass, insulting the royal family, theft from team-mates, drunkenness, stealing a car,&lt;ref name=&quot;Harte1&quot;&gt;Harte, pp. 422&amp;ndash;423.&lt;/ref&gt; parking his car in someone else's space, or that Barnes had lampooned the board in the narration accompanying the home movies he made of the 1948 tour.&lt;ref name=h108&gt;Haigh and Frith, p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pollard, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; In later years, a file of unknown authorship was found; it accused Barnes of allowing young spectators to enter the playing arena to field the ball instead of doing so himself, and of denigrating umpires by making gestures implying they were blind.&lt;ref name=h107/&gt;

The Board had a secret dossier documenting Barnes's behaviour and they doctored the minutes of the meeting at which they discussed his selection. The matter came to a head when a letter attributed to man named Jacob Raith was published in the paper, criticising Barnes's character, and praising the board, which prompted Barnes to sue with the intention of prising out an explanation for his omission.&lt;ref name=slee&gt;Slee, pp. 216&amp;ndash;217.&lt;/ref&gt; Cricket administrators were called to testify about the matter and more details became public.&lt;ref name=&quot;Haigh&amp;Frith&quot;/&gt; According to cricket historian [[Gideon Haigh]], &quot;it was effectively the Board, not Raith, in the dock&quot;.&lt;ref name=h109&gt;Haigh and Frith, p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Keith Johnson (cricket administrator)|Keith Johnson]], the team manager during the 1948 tour, became the centre of attention. He wrote and had always claimed that the touring party had been completely harmonious and loyal.&lt;ref name=h107/&gt; A series of administrators came forward to say that Barnes had misbehaved on the 1948 tour, even though Johnson's official report had made no mention of any problems.&lt;ref name=b216&gt;Barnes, p. 216.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=h110&gt;Haigh and Frith, p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt; There were also positive reports. [[Aubrey Oxlade]], the chairman of the board,&lt;ref name=h109/&gt; said that the batsman's indiscretions were &quot;childish things&quot; and &quot;not serious at all&quot;.&lt;ref name=h109/&gt; [[Frank Cush]], another board member who had supported Barnes's inclusion, replied &quot;none at all&quot; when asked if there were any legitimate reasons for excluding Barnes.&lt;ref name=h110/&gt; Selector [[Chappie Dwyer]] said &quot;I have a very high opinion of him as a cricketer&amp;nbsp;... and I have no objection to him as a man&quot;.&lt;ref name=h110/&gt;

Johnson was called as a witness,&lt;ref name=h109/&gt; and under questioning, a different story came out.&lt;ref name=h109/&gt; Johnson agreed that his written report of the 1948 tour had said that the team had behaved &quot;in a manner befitting worthy representatives of Australia&quot; and that &quot;on and off the field their conduct was exemplary&quot;.&lt;ref name=b216/&gt;&lt;ref name=h110/&gt; However, in a verbal report, Johnson said he had drawn the board's attention to various misdemeanours by Barnes during the 1948 tour that, in his opinion, were sufficiently serious to warrant the player's exclusion from future Australian Test sides. Johnson said that Barnes had shown a &quot;general reluctance for anything savouring of authority&quot;.&lt;ref name=h110/&gt; The misdeeds included taking pictures as the Australian team was presented to the royal family on the playing arena during the Second Test at Lord's, asking permission to travel alone in England&amp;mdash;Barnes' family was living in Scotland at the time&amp;mdash;and &quot;abducting&quot;  [[List of cricket terms#T|twelfth man]] Toshack to play tennis during the match at Northamptonshire on a court &quot;300 yards from the pavilion&quot;.&lt;ref name=h109/&gt;&lt;ref name=h110/&gt; Under cross-examination, Johnson said that Barnes's photography of the royal family at Lord's was the most serious incident. He admitted he had not known that Barnes had received permission to take the photos. Barnes's lawyer then established that his client had then shown the films to raise money for various charities.&lt;ref name=h109/&gt; He further showed that Barnes had not agitated when reminded of the policy against players meeting with family members on tour.&lt;ref name=h110/&gt; However, Johnson believed that the cumulative effect of the misdeeds &quot;warranted omission from the team&quot; and he saw no problem in the fact that his verbal advice to the board recommending Barnes' exclusion was at odds with the written report on the 1948 tour.&lt;ref name=h110/&gt; Under cross-examination, Johnson admitted that &quot;I don't always write what I think&quot;,&lt;ref name=h110/&gt; and ended up being embarrassed by Barnes's lawyer.&lt;ref name=h110/&gt; The case collapsed on its second day, after Barnes was issued with a public apology regarding the letter.&lt;ref name=h111&gt;Haigh and Frith, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pollard, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; After the libel trial, Johnson resigned from all cricket administration, while Barnes continued to be overlooked.&lt;ref name=h112&gt;Haigh and Frith, p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;wisdenobit&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/228453.html|title=Obituaries in 1972|publisher=[[Wisden]], [[Cricinfo]]|accessdate=2009-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=h113&gt;Haigh and Frith, p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the court case portrayed &quot;an awful image of the chaos and bigotry under which Australian cricket was administered&quot;, it did little to alter the board's culture towards players.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harte1&quot;/&gt;
