'''William Hodgson''' &quot;'''Hod'''&quot; '''Stuart''' (February 20, 1879 – June 23, 1907) was a [[Canadians|Canadian]] professional [[ice hockey]] [[defenceman (ice hockey)|cover-point]] (now known as a defenceman) who played nine seasons for several teams in different leagues. He also played briefly for the [[Ottawa Rough Riders]] [[Canadian football|football]] team. With his brother [[Bruce Stuart|Bruce]], Stuart played in the first professional ice hockey league, the American-based [[International Professional Hockey League]] (IPHL), where he was regarded as one of the best players in the league. 

Frustrated with the violence associated with the IPHL, he left the league late in 1906 and returned to Canada, where in 1907 he helped the [[Montreal Wanderers]] win the [[Stanley Cup]], the championship trophy for hockey. Two months later, he died in a diving accident. To raise money for his widow and children, the [[Eastern Canada Amateur Hockey Association]] hosted an all-star game, the first of its kind to be played in any sport.&lt;ref name=&quot;Podnieks 2000 2&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Podnieks|2000|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; An estimated 3,800 spectators attended the Hod Stuart Memorial Game on January 2, 1908, described by the ''Montreal Herald'' as &quot;unique in the history of hockey in Montreal, if not in the whole of Canada&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Diamond 562&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Diamond|2002|p=562}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In an era when [[defencemen]] were expected to stay behind during the play, Stuart became known for his ability to score goals while playing a defensive role, and for his ability to remain calm during matches that often turned violent.{{Sfn|Vinneault|2000}} He also became known for his work to reduce that violence and to increase the salaries of hockey players.&lt;ref name=&quot;McKinley 46&quot;/&gt; His efforts were acknowledged when the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]] was created in 1945 and he became one of the first twelve players to be inducted.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hockey Hall of Fame|2003|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was joined there by his brother Bruce in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hockey Hall of Fame|2003|p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Stuart was born in Ottawa, Ontario, the eldest son of William Stuart and Rachel Hodgson.{{Sfn|Ottawa Citizen|1961|p=12}} He had two brothers, Alex and Bruce, and two sisters, Jessie and Lottio.{{Sfn|Ottawa Citizen|1907|p=9}} Stuart was involved in sports from an early age. His father had been a good [[curling|curler]] and was once point [[skip (curling)|skip]] of the [[Ottawa Curling Club]], and both Hod and Bruce played hockey from a young age, often for the same teams.{{Sfn|The Gazette|1907|p=16}} Stuart also played [[Rugby football|rugby]] and [[Canadian football|football]], and played for the local professional football team, the [[Ottawa Rough Riders]].{{Sfn|Vinneault|2000}} 

Outside of hockey Stuart worked as a bricklayer, and later in his life he also worked with his father in construction. He was said to have been a quiet person, and unlike other athletes of his era was not one to talk about his exploits, except with close friends.{{Sfn|The Gazette|1907|p=16}} Loughlin, his wife, came from Quebec; around 1903 they were married and had two children together.{{Sfn|Vinneault|2000}}

==Playing career==
Stuart first joined a senior hockey team when he spent the winter of 1895–1896 with the [[Kenora Thistles|Rat Portage Thistles]], a team in northwestern Ontario. Along with his brother Bruce, Stuart joined the [[Ottawa Senators (original)|Ottawa Hockey Club]] of the [[Canadian Amateur Hockey League]] (CAHL) for the [[1899 CAHL season|1899 season]].{{Sfn|Hockey Hall of Fame|2010}} He played the [[1900 CAHL season|1900 season]] for Ottawa, captaining the team.{{Sfn|The Globe|1899|p=8}} Through his father's business contacts, Stuart got a job in Quebec and moved there in 1900; upon arriving there he joined the [[Quebec Bulldogs]], also of the CAHL. He scored seven goals in fifteen games with the team over the next two seasons.&lt;ref name=&quot;All Star 1&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Podnieks|2000|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They are arranged in three rows, five men in the back and middle row, two in the front. The back row is standing, the middle row sitting, and the front row lying on their side towards each other. Ten of the men are wearing a dark wool sweater with an overlaping &quot;P&quot; and &quot;L&quot; with wings, each holding a hockey stick and wearing skates. The other two men are dressed in suits.]]
In 1902, the [[Pittsburgh Bankers]] of the [[Western Pennsylvania Hockey League]] signed Stuart to a professional contract; this was disputed between the Bankers and the [[Pittsburgh Victorias]], who also claimed him.{{Sfn|Pittsburgh Press|1902|p=20}} Eventually the Bankers won the dispute and kept Stuart; the following year they would also sign Bruce.&lt;ref name=&quot;All Star 1&quot;/&gt; Stuart was offered a salary of US$15–20 per week, plus steady income from a day job in Pittsburgh.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McKinley|2009|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stuart scored seven goals and had eight assists and was named the best cover-point in the league in [[1903 WPHL season|1903]].&lt;ref name =&quot;Diamond 625&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Diamond|2002|p=625}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After one season in Pittsburgh, Stuart moved to the [[Portage Lakes Hockey Club]], a team in northern Michigan, for the 1903–1904 season and played in fourteen exhibition games, finishing fourth on the team with thirteen goals scored.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Diamond|2002|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the formation of the [[International Professional Hockey League]], Stuart left Portage Lake for the [[Calumet Miners]], where he accepted the positions of coach and manager, in addition to playing cover-point, for $1,800.&lt;ref name=&quot;McKinley 46&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|McKinley|2009|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored eighteen goals for Calumet in [[1904–05 IPHL season|1904–1905]], helped the team with the league championship and was named to the end of season all-star team as the best cover-point in the league.&lt;ref name=&quot;Diamond 625&quot;/&gt;{{Sfn|Pittsburgh Press|1906|p=8}}

He is wearing a white sweater with a dark band around his chest; in the middle of the band is an encircled &quot;W.&quot; There is a noticeable crease on the image, going from the top left towards the middle of the bottom.]]
On December 11, 1905, before the start of the [[1905–06 IPHL season|1905–06 season]], Stuart was suspended from the league after the western teams complained that he had won too many championships and was too rough for the league.{{Sfn|Pittsburgh Press|1902|p=16}} He was reinstated by the league on December 30, and joined the [[Pittsburgh Professionals]].{{Sfn|Pittsburgh Press|1905|p=4}} After Pittsburgh finished their season, Stuart joined Calumet for one game so they could try to win the league championship, which they lost to the Portage Lakes Hockey Club.{{Sfn|Pittsburgh Press|1906|p=12}} Once again he was named best cover-point in the IPHL as he scored eleven goals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Diamond 625&quot;/&gt; A big man with a fluid skating stride, he was considered the finest defenceman of his era for his outstanding play on both offence and defence.{{Sfn|Hockey Hall of Fame|2010}}

As the IPHL convinced players to move to the United States and get paid to play, hockey teams in Canada were forced to match the salaries in order to keep their players. Stuart, who was unhappy playing in Pittsburgh because of the violence involved in games, heard from [[Dickie Boon]] that the [[Montreal Wanderers]], defending [[Stanley Cup]] winners, of the Eastern Canada Amateur Hockey Association (ECAHA) were willing to make Stuart the highest paid player in hockey if he were to join the team. On December 13, 1906, Stuart had a letter published in the ''Montreal Star'' that detailed his problems with the IPHL. Stuart's chief concern was the officiating; he said they &quot;don't know how to run hockey over here, the rink people appoint the most dumb and incompetent referees that could be found.&quot;{{Sfn|Pittsburgh Press|1906|p=18}} In December 1906 Pittsburgh refused to play a game against [[Michigan Soo Indians|Michigan Soo]], claiming they did not like the choice of referee. While a common problem in the IPHL, Pittsburgh's management believed Stuart was behind the action, and released him from the team.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McKinley|2000|p=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; No longer bound to any team, Stuart joined the Wanderers; his first game with the team was watched by 6,069 fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McKinley|2009|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; He took part in the Wanderers' Stanley Cup challenge against the [[New Glasgow Cubs]], a team from Nova Scotia, on December 27 and 29, 1906, and along with teammates [[Riley Hern]], [[Frank Glass]], [[Moose Johnson]] and [[Jack Marshall (ice hockey)|Jack Marshall]], became the first professional hockey players to compete for the Stanley Cup.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goyens|Orr|2000|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote box| quote =&quot;They could not offer me money enough here to go through what I went through last year in this league. Everybody had a slur at me and I could not lift my stick off the ice. That is a fact. I never took my stick off the ice, except in shooting, all winter, and never checked a man with the stick.&quot;|align=right |width=30%|source=Excerpt from letter written by Stuart to the ''Montreal Star'' on December 13, 1906 detailing his issues with the IPHL.{{Sfn|Pittsburgh Press|1906|p=18}}}}

Stuart did not escape violence in the ECAHA. On January 12, 1907, the Wanderers faced the Ottawa Senators, a game the Wanderers ultimately won 4–2. [[Charles Spittal]] of Ottawa was described as &quot;attempting to split [[Cecil Blachford]]'s skull&quot;, [[Alf Smith]] hit Stuart &quot;across the temple with his stick, laying him out like a corpse&quot;, and [[Harry Smith (ice hockey)|Harry Smith]] cracked his stick across [[Ernest Johnson (ice hockey)|Ernie &quot;Moose&quot; Johnson]]'s face, breaking Johnson's nose.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coleman 135&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Coleman|1966|p=135}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stuart was commended for his actions during the game; it was said that he neither flinched nor retaliated, even after bearing most of the hits.{{Sfn|The Gazette|1907|p=16}} At a league meeting on January 18, the [[Montreal Victorias]] proposed suspending Spittal and Alf Smith for the season in response to their actions, but this was voted down and the president of the league, Fred McRobie, resigned.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coleman 135&quot;/&gt; The next time the Senators visited Montreal for a game, the police arrested Spittal, Alf and Harry Smith, leading to $20 fines for Spittal and Alf, and an acquittal for Harry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coleman 135&quot;/&gt; Even with the persistent violence, Stuart helped the Wanderers to an undefeated season; they then accepted a challenge from the [[Kenora Thistles]] for the Stanley Cup. The Thistles won the series, held in January, but lost a rematch between the teams in March, giving the Cup back to the Wanderers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Coleman|1966|p=137}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stuart participated in both challenges, and though did not score a goal in any of the four games,{{Sfn|Vinneault|2000}} he was said to have played the best game of his career in the first game of the series, even with a broken finger.{{Sfn|The Gazette|1907|p=4}} Regarded as the most important player on the Wanderers, Stuart was said to know how to play every position on the ice, and passed his knowledge of the game onto his teammates.{{Sfn|The Gazette|1907|p=16}}

==Death==

The man not wearing a sweater, standing on the far right, is simply wearing a dark shirt.]]
Tired of the constant violence, Stuart quit hockey after the Stanley Cup championship in 1907 and joined his father in construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McKinley|2000|p=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of this job, Stuart was sent to Belleville, Ontario, to oversee the building of the Belleville Drill Shed, one of his father's contracts.{{Sfn|Hockey Hall of Fame|2010}} While in Belleville, he continued to receive offers to join a new hockey team. He was asked if he wanted to manage the Belleville team; a similar offer came from Peterborough, Ontario, while a town outside Toronto was said to have offered a railroad president's salary if Stuart would join them.{{Sfn|Ottawa Citizen|1907|p=8}} On the afternoon of June 23, 1907, Stuart went to the Bay of Quinte, near Belleville, to swim with some friends. Stuart swam to the nearby lighthouse, about half a kilometre away from his group, climbed onto a platform and dived into the shallow water. He dived head first onto jagged rocks, gashing his head and breaking his neck. He was killed instantly.{{Sfn|Hockey Hall of Fame|2010}}&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McKinley|2009|p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; His body was brought back to Ottawa, where a service was held at his family's home before he was buried at [[Beechwood Cemetery (Ottawa, Ontario)|Beechwood Cemetery]].{{Sfn|Ottawa Citizen|1907|p=9}}

===All-star game===
To raise money for Stuart's widow and two children, the ECAHA decided to host an all-star game, the first of its kind to be played in any sport.&lt;ref name=&quot;Podnieks 2000 2&quot;/&gt; An estimated 3,800 spectators attended the Hod Stuart Memorial Game on January 2, 1908, with tickets selling out days in advance.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Whitehead|1980|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; Described by the ''Montreal Herald'' as &quot;unique in the history of hockey in Montreal, if not in the whole of Canada,&quot; the event featured the [[Montreal Wanderers]], Stuart's former team, playing against a squad of top players from the other teams in the ECAHA.&lt;ref name=&quot;Diamond 562&quot;/&gt; The [[Westmount Arena]] agreed to host the event for no charge, and all proceeds from the game went to Stuart's family, totalling over $2,100.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weir|Chapman|Weir|1999|p=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fans were asked to mail in choices of who should play on the all-star team, with the contest winners given two tickets to the game.&lt;ref name=&quot;Diamond 562&quot;/&gt; The Wanderers, an established team, played better than the All-Stars, who had to learn to play together, and led 7–1 after the first half of the game; though the All-Stars played better in the second half, the Wanderers won by a score of 10–7.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Podnieks|2000|pp=2–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
