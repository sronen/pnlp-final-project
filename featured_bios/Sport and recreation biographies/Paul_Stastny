Of [[Slovaks|Slovak]] lineage, Stastny is the son of [[Hockey Hall of Fame]]r [[Peter Šťastný|Peter Stastny]], who played for the Avalanche's predecessor, the [[Quebec Nordiques]]. Paul's older brother [[Yan Stastny|Yan]] has played for the [[Boston Bruins]], the [[Edmonton Oilers]], the [[St. Louis Blues (ice hockey)|St. Louis Blues]] and the [[Vancouver Canucks]], and his uncles [[Anton Stastny|Anton]] and [[Marián Šťastný|Marian Stastny]] both played in the NHL during the 1980s, also for the Nordiques franchise.

Stastny began his junior hockey career with the [[River City Lancers]] of the [[United States Hockey League]] before moving to the [[University of Denver]] [[Denver Pioneers|Pioneers]] in 2004.

On November 17, 2008, Stastny signed a US$33-million, five-year contract extension with the Colorado Avalanche.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}  The contract begins in the [[2009–10 NHL season|2009–10 season]] and runs through [[2013–14 NHL season|2013–14]]; he will be paid an average of $6.6 million a year. Stastny earned $710,000 during the [[2008–09 NHL season|2008–09 season]].

In a December 23, 2008 game against the Phoenix Coyotes, Paul suffered a fractured forearm after being struck by a shot from Phoenix's [[Olli Jokinen]] in the last regulation minute of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Stastny injured, out indefinitely: Wolski could move to center |url= http://www.denverpost.com/sports/ci_11306854 |first= Adrian |last= Dater |work= [[The Denver Post]] |date= 2008-12-25 |accessdate = 2008-12-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He successfully underwent surgery on his arm and missed 24 games, but also his chance to play in the [[57th National Hockey League All-Star Game|2009 All-Star Game]] in Montreal. This was the second consecutive season that he missed such an opportunity. He was injured again later in the season when he broke his foot while blocking a shot during a March 17, 2009 game against the [[Minnesota Wild]], putting him out of play for the remainder of the season.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090325/ap_on_sp_ho_ne/hkn_avalanche_stastny_out;_ylt=AsaDa5jr8TKVRGdFDL0zQu41y7QF Stasny Out 2-4 Weeks with Broken Foot] Yahoo Sports, March 25, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; He scored 36 points in just 45 games that year.

The 2009–10 season proved successful for Stastny and the Avalanche. Paul managed to stay healthy and uninjured the entire season, and only missed one game as a healthy scratch after the Avalanche clinched a playoff spot the previous evening. His 79 points (20 goals, 59 assists) is a career best, and he led the team in both points and assists. Tied with [[Alexander Ovechkin]], only five players in the league ended up with more assists. Stastny's second career appearance in the post season ended after the [[San Jose Sharks]] eliminated the Avs in the first round.

On January 26, 2011, Stastny was named to his 2nd NHL All-Star Game.  He and his father became the 8th father-son duo in NHL history to both play in an All-Star Game.  Paul recorded a goal and an assist during the game as a member of Team Staal.
