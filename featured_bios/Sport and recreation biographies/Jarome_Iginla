A six-time [[National Hockey League All-Star Game|NHL All-Star]], he is the Flames' all-time leader in goals, points, and games played, and is second in assists to [[Al MacInnis]]. Named the Flames [[Captain (ice hockey)|captain]] at the start of the [[2003–04 NHL season|2003–04 season]], Iginla was the first [[Black people|black]] captain in NHL history. He has represented Canada internationally on numerous occasions, helping [[Canada men's national ice hockey team|Team Canada]] to its first Olympic gold medal in 50 years at the [[2002 Winter Olympics]] and another gold medal at the [[2010 Winter Olympics]] in [[Vancouver]].

As a [[junior hockey|junior]], Iginla was a member of two [[Memorial Cup]]-winning teams with the [[Kamloops Blazers]], and was named the [[Western Hockey League]]'s [[Four Broncos Memorial Trophy|Player of the Year]] in [[1995–96 WHL season|1996]]. He was selected 11th overall by the [[Dallas Stars]] in the [[1995 NHL Entry Draft]], but was later traded to Calgary and has played his entire professional career with the Flames.  He led the NHL in goals and points in [[2001–02 NHL season|2001–02]], and won the [[Lester B. Pearson Award]] as its most valuable player as voted by the players.  In [[2003–04 NHL season|2003–04]], Iginla led the league in goals for the second time and captained the Flames to the [[2004 Stanley Cup Finals|Stanley Cup Finals]], leading the league in playoff scoring.  Iginla [[List of NHL players with 50 goal seasons|scored 50&amp;nbsp;goals]] in a season for a second time in [[2007–08 NHL season|2007–08]], has scored [[List of NHL players with 500 goals|500 goals]] and [[List of NHL players with 1000 points|1,000 points]] in his career and is one of seven players in NHL history to score 30 goals in 11 consecutive seasons.  Known for his polite and generous nature, Iginla participates in numerous community events and donates $2,000 to charity for each goal he scores.

==Early life==
Iginla was born in [[St. Albert, Alberta]], on July 1, 1977.  His father, a lawyer, was born in [[Nigeria]] and changed his first name from Adekunle to Elvis when he arrived in Canada.&lt;ref name=&quot;SI2007&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Cazeneuve |first=Brian |url=http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1107127/index.htm |title=Jarome Iginla |work=Sports Illustrated |date=2007-03-05 |accessdate=2008-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His surname means &quot;Big tree&quot; in [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]], his father's native language.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blaze1129&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Board |first=Mike |title=Overtime: #12's Top 10 |journal=Blaze Magazine |publisher=Calgary Flames Hockey Club |date=2008-11-29 |pages=6–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iginla's mother, Susan, is originally from [[Oregon]], and has worked as a massage therapist and music teacher.  Iginla grew up with his mother and grandparents after his parents divorced when he was a year old.&lt;ref name=&quot;SI2007&quot; /&gt; While his mother is a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]], he identifies himself as [[Christian]], his father's faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.calgarychristian.com/articles/2004/406-jarome_iginla.htm |last=Gulbranson |first=Davin | title=Jarome Iginla—The Smile Says It All |work=City Light News |accessdate=2009-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to hockey, Iginla played [[baseball]] as a young man and was the [[catcher]] on the Canadian national junior team.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blaze1129&quot; /&gt; He credits his grandfather for his career, as with his mother working and father attending law school, he would not have had the opportunity to play sports at a high level if not for his grandfather's support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Spector |first=Mark |url=http://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/2010/05/27/spector_iginla_roots/ |title=Strong roots |publisher=Rogers Sportsnet |date=2010-05-27 |accessdate=2010-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Iginla grew up admiring other black hockey players, including [[Edmonton Oilers]] [[goaltender]] [[Grant Fuhr]].  Emulating Fuhr, Iginla played goaltender in his first two years of organized hockey before switching to the [[Winger (hockey)|right wing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Amber |first=David |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/columns/story?id=2205382 |title=Facing Off: Q&amp;A with Jarome Iginla |publisher=ESPN |date=2005-10-28 |accessdate=2009-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He played his entire minor hockey career in St. Albert, leading the [[Alberta Midget Hockey League]] in scoring as a 15-year-old with 87&amp;nbsp;points for the St. Albert Midget Raiders in 1992–93.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blaze1129&quot; /&gt;

==Junior career==
Iginla played three years with the [[Kamloops Blazers]] of the [[Western Hockey League]] (WHL).  As a 16-year-old in [[1993–94 WHL season|1993–94]], he recorded six goals and 29&amp;nbsp;points in 48 regular season games before playing an additional 19 in the playoffs.&lt;ref name=&quot;LOH&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/SearchPlayer.jsp?player=10613 |title=Player Profile—Jarome Iginla |publisher=Hockey Hall of Fame |accessdate=2008-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Blazers captured both the [[Ed Chynoweth Cup|league title]] and the [[1994 Memorial Cup|1994]] [[Memorial Cup]], Canada's national junior championship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|editor=Flett, Cory and Watts, Jessie|title=2008–09 WHL Guide|publisher=Western Hockey League|page=206}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In reference to the Blazers' dominance of the league at the time (they had won their third WHL title in five seasons), Iginla described the expectations of success as being similar to those placed on the [[Montreal Canadiens]], the NHL's most successful franchise: &quot;When you put on a Blazers jersey, it's like putting on the Canadiens'.  You've got to perform.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lapp |first=Richard |last2=Macaulay |first2=Alec |title=The Memorial Cup: Canada's National Junior Hockey Championship |publisher=Harbour Publishing |year=1997 |isbn=1-55015-170-4 |page=260}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Iginla scored 33&amp;nbsp;goals and 71&amp;nbsp;points in [[1994–95 WHL season|1994–95]], his first full WHL season.&lt;ref name=&quot;LOH&quot; /&gt; The Blazers repeated as league champions, earning a trip to the [[1995 Memorial Cup]].  Iginla scored five goals in the tournament to lead the Blazers to a second consecutive national championship.  He received the [[George Parsons Trophy]] as the most sportsmanlike player of the tournament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lapp |first=Richard |last2=Macaulay |first2=Alec |title=The Memorial Cup: Canada's National Junior Hockey Championship |publisher=Harbour Publishing |year=1997 |isbn=1-55015-170-4 |page=267}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Dallas Stars]] selected Iginla with their first pick, 11th overall, in the [[1995 NHL Entry Draft]]; however, on December 20, 1995, they traded him to the [[Calgary Flames]], along with [[Corey Millen]], for the rights to forward [[Joe Nieuwendyk]], then in a contract dispute with the Flames.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Duhatschek |first=Eric |title=Flames bank on future |work=Calgary Herald |date=1995-12-21 |page=C1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his final season in Kamloops in [[1995–96 WHL season|1995–96]], Iginla finished fourth in league scoring with 136&amp;nbsp;points, including 63&amp;nbsp;goals in 63&amp;nbsp;games played, and was awarded the [[Four Broncos Memorial Trophy]] as the league's most outstanding player.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|editor=Flett, Cory and Watts, Jessie|title=2008–09 WHL Guide|publisher=Western Hockey League|page=199}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Blazers were upset in the Western Conference final by the [[Spokane Chiefs]], but Iginla still finished fourth in playoff scoring, recording 29 points in 16 games.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|editor=Flett, Cory and Watts, Jessie|title=2008–09 WHL Guide|publisher=Western Hockey League|page=165}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His performance during the season earned him an invitation to play for [[Canada men's national junior ice hockey team|Team Canada]] at the [[1996 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships]] in [[Boston]], where he led the tournament in scoring with 12 points and helped Canada to its fourth consecutive gold medal.&lt;ref name=&quot;TSN-WJHC&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tsn.ca/World_jrs/feature/?fid=1047&amp;hubname= |title=1996 - Boston, United States |publisher=The Sports Network |accessdate=2008-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==NHL career==
[[Image:Iginla warming up.jpg|thumb|right|170px|Iginla warming up before a game in March 2006.]]
Iginla made his NHL debut in the [[1996 Stanley Cup Playoffs]], as he was signed to a contract and flown to Calgary immediately after his junior season ended in Kamloops.  He appeared in two games for the Flames in their series against the [[Chicago Blackhawks]].  In doing so, he became the first 18-year-old to play for the Flames since [[Dan Quinn]] in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='Iguana' enjoys heat |last=Board |first=Mike |work=Calgary Herald |date=1996-04-22 |page=D3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In his first NHL game, Iginla assisted on a [[Theoren Fleury]] goal to record his first point;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Duhatschek |first=Eric |title=A quick learner |work=Calgary Herald |date=1996-04-23 |page=D1}}&lt;/ref&gt; he scored his first goal in his second game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Duhatschek |first=Eric |title=Heartbreak |work=Calgary Herald |date=1996-04-24 |page=C1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He remained with the Flames, and played his first NHL season in [[1996–97 NHL season|1996–97]].  He earned a spot on that year's [[NHL All-Rookie Team]] and finished as the runner-up to [[Bryan Berard]] in voting for the [[Calder Memorial Trophy]] as rookie of the year after leading all first-year players in scoring with 50&amp;nbsp;points.&lt;ref name=&quot;0809MediaGuide&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=2008–09 Calgary Flames Media Guide |publisher=Calgary Flames Hockey Club |editor=Hanlon, Peter and Kelso, Sean |pages=59–61 |url=http://downloads.flames.nhl.com/other/2008CalgaryFlamesMediaGuide_web.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By his third season, [[1998–99 NHL season|1998–99]], Iginla led the Flames in goals with 28.&lt;ref name=&quot;0809MediaGuide&quot; /&gt;  His success complicated negotiations for a new contract, as he and the Flames struggled to agree on a new deal following the season.  Hoping to help resolve the contract impasse, he agreed to attend training camp without a contract, and purchased his own insurance as the team would not have been responsible financially if he suffered an injury.  He remained without a contract at the start of the [[1999–2000 NHL season|1999–2000 season]] and missed the first three games as a holdout before signing a deal worth [[United States dollar|US$]]4.9 million, plus bonuses.&lt;ref name=&quot;0809MediaGuide&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Board |first=Mike |title=Iginla signs 3-year deal |work=Calgary Herald |date=1999-10-09 |page=E1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He finished the year with career highs in goals (29) and points (63). He then topped both marks in [[2000–01 NHL season|2000–01]] by recording 31&amp;nbsp;goals and 71&amp;nbsp;points.&lt;ref name=&quot;0809MediaGuide&quot; /&gt;

After participating in Canada's Olympic summer camp before the season, Iginla again set new personal highs in [[2001–02 NHL season|2001–02]] when he registered 52&amp;nbsp;goals and 96&amp;nbsp;points. This season elevated Iginla to superstar status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Allen |first=Kevin |url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/hockey/columns/allen/2002-03-05-allen.htm |title=Iginla ready to break the bank |work=USA Today |date=2002-03-05 |accessdate=2008-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He earned the [[Art Ross Trophy|Art Ross]] and [[Maurice &quot;Rocket&quot; Richard Trophy|Maurice Richard]] trophies as the NHL's leading point and goal scorer, respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;0809MediaGuide&quot; /&gt;  He was also awarded the [[Lester B. Pearson Award]] as the league's most valuable player as voted by his peers, and was a nominee for both the [[Hart Memorial Trophy]] and the [[King Clancy Memorial Trophy]].  The Hart Trophy voting proved to be controversial: Iginla tied Canadiens goaltender [[José Théodore]] in voting points, but received fewer first place votes than Théodore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Harris |first=Cecil |title=Breaking the Ice: The Black Experience in Professional Hockey |publisher=Insomniac Press |year=2003 |isbn=1-894663-58-6 |page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, one voter, rumoured to be from [[Quebec]]—Théodore and the Canadiens' home province—inexplicably left Iginla off his ballot.  As a result of the controversy that followed, the Professional Hockey Writers Association changed the rules on how its members voted for the award to prevent a recurrence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Dowbiggin |first=Bruce |url=http://www2.canada.com/calgaryherald/news/story.html?id=5550ffa5-080c-439f-8a58-c4ea3ea66b70 |title=Hart irony may burn Iginla |work=Calgary Herald |date=2008-03-07 |accessdate=2009-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iginla was a member of [[Canada men's national ice hockey team|Team Canada]]'s [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] [[gold medal]]-winning hockey team in 2002 at Salt Lake City and in 2010 at Vancouver.

There were fears Iginla would again hold out after his contract expired following the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/story/2002/08/20/iginla020820.html |title=Jarome Iginla may hold out: report |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |date=2002-08-21 |accessdate=2008-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; These fears were unfounded, however, as he signed a two-year, $13 million deal before the season and was looked on to again lead the Flames offensively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Dolezar |first=John A. |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/hockey/news/2002/09/16/2002_flamespreview/ |title=2002–03 season preview – Calgary Flames |publisher=CNN Sports Illustrated |date=2002-09-16 |accessdate=2008-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Iginla fell back to 67&amp;nbsp;points in [[2002–03 NHL season|2002–03]] as injuries, including a lingering finger dislocation following a fight, diminished his play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Canella |first=Stephen |url=http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1031196/index.htm |title=Catching Fire |work=Sports Illustrated |date=2004-02-16 |accessdate=2009-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; His 35 goals were still enough to lead the Flames for the fourth time in five seasons.&lt;ref name=&quot;0809MediaGuide&quot; /&gt;  Despite his offensive contributions, the Flames missed the playoffs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=2008–09 Calgary Flames Media Guide |publisher=Calgary Flames Hockey Club |editor=Hanlon, Peter and Kelso, Sean |page=133 |url=http://downloads.flames.nhl.com/other/2008CalgaryFlamesMediaGuide_web.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Captaincy===
At the start of the [[2003–04 NHL season|2003–04 season]], Iginla was named the 18th captain in Flames franchise history, and 14th since the team moved to Calgary from [[Atlanta]] in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=2008–09 Calgary Flames Media Guide |publisher=Calgary Flames Hockey Club |editor=Hanlon, Peter and Kelso, Sean |page=131 |url=http://downloads.flames.nhl.com/other/2008CalgaryFlamesMediaGuide_web.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His predecessor as captain, [[Craig Conroy]], cited Iginla's experience and leadership for his decision to relinquish the captaincy to Iginla. &quot;He was a leader on that team and old enough to where he'd been there a long time. It was time for him. He took us to the Stanley Cup Final that year so it worked out pretty well.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Captain&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=396926 |title=Iginla honored to be captain of Flames |publisher=National Hockey League |last=Rosen |first=Dan |date=2008-12-09 |accessdate=2008-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iginla was reported to be the first black captain in NHL history,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/wire?id=1633595 |title=Iginla becomes first black captain in NHL history |accessdate=2008-04-17 |date=2003-10-08 |publisher=ESPN}}&lt;/ref&gt; though former Blackhawks captain [[Dirk Graham]], who is of African descent, has also been said to hold that honour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=McKeon |first=Ross |url=http://ca.sports.yahoo.com/nhl/news?slug=rm-oree011708&amp;prov=yhoo&amp;type=lgns |title=O'Ree had vision as NHL pioneer |publisher=Yahoo!

[[File:Jarome Iginla silver stick.JPG|thumb|left|[[Darryl Sutter]] presents Iginla with a silver stick in honour of his becoming the Flames all-time scoring leader.]]

The Flames were unable to defeat the [[Tampa Bay Lightning]], however, falling to the [[Eastern Conference (NHL)|Eastern Conference]] champions in seven games.

On December 7, 2006, Iginla reached a career milestone when he scored his 300th career goal and 600th career point against the [[Minnesota Wild]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/story/2006/12/09/canucks-flames.html |title=Flames, Canucks clash in Calgary |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |date=2006-12-09 |accessdate=2009-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was expected to play in the [[55th National Hockey League All-Star Game|2007 NHL All-Star Game]] in Dallas; however he missed the game with a knee injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/allstar2007/news/story?id=2731958 |title=Brodeur, Selanne, 28 others join list of NHL All-Stars |publisher=ESPN |date=2007-01-18 |accessdate=2009-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The injury kept him out of 12 games in [[2006–07 NHL season|2006–07]].

He was named an all-star and the tournament's top forward.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blaze1129&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;TSN-WJHC&quot; /&gt;  One year later, Iginla played in his first tournament with the [[Canada men's national ice hockey team|senior team]], competing at the [[1997 Men's World Ice Hockey Championships|1997 World Championships]] as a 19-year-old, the youngest player on the team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hockeycanada.ca/index.php/ci_id/4722/la_id/1.htm |title=1997 IIHF World Championship |publisher=Hockey Canada |accessdate=2008-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He recorded two goals and three assists in 11&amp;nbsp;games as Canada won the gold medal.&lt;ref name=&quot;LOH&quot; /&gt;

==Playing style==
[[File:Iginla v Lecavalier.JPG|thumb|right|Iginla faces off against [[Vincent Lecavalier]].]]
Iginla is considered to be one of the NHL's most prominent [[Power forward (ice hockey)|power forwards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Nichols |first=Chris |url=http://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/2008/09/18/nichols_power_forwards/ |title=NHL Power Brokers |publisher=Rogers Sportsnet |date=2008-09-18 |accessdate=2009-01-04}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Upon entering the league, he tried to emulate players like [[Brendan Shanahan]] and [[Keith Tkachuk]], hoping to match their combination of finesse and physicality.&lt;ref name=&quot;Impact&quot; /&gt;  He is one of the most consistent scorers in the league; between 1998 and 2008, only [[Jaromír Jágr]] scored more NHL goals than Iginla.&lt;ref name=&quot;Consistency&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Cruikshank |first=Scott |url=http://www2.canada.com/saskatoonstarphoenix/news/sports/story.html?id=7f057796-13e3-4995-b54c-5a5028b0d108 |title=Iginla's scoring consistency amazes most |work=Saskatoon Star-Phoenix |date=2008-01-04 |accessdate=2009-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, scouting reports have argued that Iginla's lack of speed makes it easier for opponents to isolate him and restrict his ability to move if his teammates rely on him too much to lead the offence.&lt;ref name=&quot;TSN2004Bio&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Yorio |first=Kara |title=Scouting Report: Jarome Iginla, RW, Calgary Flames |work=The Sporting News |date=2004-03-15 |volume=228 |issue=11 |page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The abuse he faced at the hands of opponents early in his NHL career prompted Iginla's coaches to work at developing his physical play.  While he was not enthusiastic about fighting, Iginla accepted then head coach [[Brian Sutter]]'s arguments that he needed to adopt a more aggressive style to improve as a player.  Iginla is most effective when he has room to manoeuvre, and to create that space, he had to intimidate his opponents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Maki |first=Allan |title=Sutter tries to light flame under Iginla |work=Globe and Mail |date=1998-10-16 |page=S5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The lessons Iginla learned have carried throughout his career.   &quot;You've got a power forward who does it all,&quot; said [[Craig Conroy]]. &quot;I mean, he'll fight, and hit, and score goals.  Maybe it's not the end-to-end rushes, but he does all those little things that win games and get things done.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Avery&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Hall |first=Vicki |url=http://www.canada.com/calgaryherald/news/sports/story.html?id=717c5c54-855e-42cd-9d43-d02fba8080bc |title=Avery takes jab at Iginla |work=Calgary Herald |date=2008-10-09 |accessdate=2009-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; His opponents also respect his play.  [[Rob Blake]] said that while Iginla is not known for fancy play, &quot;he'll run you over. Or he'll fight somebody. And then he'll score a goal. He does pretty much everything you'd want a guy to do.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Consistency&quot; /&gt;

Iginla has recorded several [[Gordie Howe hat trick]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;0809MediaGuide&quot; /&gt; His fights, including one with Tampa Bay star [[Vincent Lecavalier]] in the [[2004 Stanley Cup Finals]], have had a motivating effect on his play and that of his teammates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/playoffs2004/news/story?id=1812373 |title=Calgary wins with intensity, goaltending |publisher=ESPN |date=2004-05-30 |accessdate=2009-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Iginla has suffered injuries as a result of his fighting, including a broken hand from a 2003 fight with [[Bill Guerin]] of the [[Dallas Stars]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Maki |first=Allan |url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/article734282.ece |title=Iginla says fight not to blame for injured knee |work=Globe and Mail |accessdate=2009-05-28 |location=Toronto |date=2007-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His physical style of play also leads to a greater risk of persistent injuries and [[Penalty (ice hockey)|penalties]].&lt;ref name=&quot;TSN2004Bio&quot; /&gt;

He commands the respect of his peers, and has been known to stand up to the coaching staff to defend a fellow player.  Former teammate [[Andrew Ference]] once described following Iginla as like &quot;following a friend&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Consistency&quot; /&gt; Preferring to lead by example, Iginla is not regarded as a vocal captain.  He likes to speak with players individually, and tries to ensure that all of his teammates are comfortable.&lt;ref name=&quot;Captain&quot; /&gt;  He was named the recipient of the [[Mark Messier Leadership Award]] in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tsn.ca/nhl/story/?id=282273 |title=Ovechkin caputres Hart and Pearson Awards in Las Vegas |publisher=The Sports Network |date=2009-06-18 |accessdate=2009-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Off the ice ==
Iginla married his high school sweetheart, Kara, and the couple has three children: daughter Jade and sons Tij and Joe. They had been dating since they were in the eighth grade.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blaze1129&quot; /&gt; He has two half-brothers, Jason and Stephen, and two half-sisters, Theresa and Elizabeth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Elicksen |first=Debbie |url=http://books.google.com/?id=xiekI_Yuph8C&amp;pg=PA49&amp;lpg=PA49&amp;dq=Jarome+Iginla+NHL+diversity |title=Positive Sports |publisher=Freelance Communications |year=2003 |page=90 |isbn=0-9730237-3-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He is an avid golfer and a regular participant in the Calgary Flames Celebrity Charity Golf Classic.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blaze1129&quot; /&gt;

He is well known for his kind-hearted nature.  Former Flames general manager [[Craig Button]] described Iginla as being grounded: &quot;he doesn't carry himself with any attitude or arrogance. He's confident in his abilities. He's self-assured. He's genuine. He's a better person than he is a player, and we all know what kind of player he is.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ross |first=Sherry |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/sports/2002/10/06/2002-10-06_fanning_the_flames__jarome_i.html |title=Jarome Iginla becoming hottest ticket in Canada |work=New York Daily News |date=2002-10-06 |accessdate=2009-01-02}} {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2002, while in [[Salt Lake City]] for the [[2002 Winter Olympic Games|Winter Olympic Games]], Iginla struck up a conversation with four Calgarians sitting next to his table, and found out they were sleeping in their car outside of the hotel. He excused himself from the conversation, and booked them accommodations at his own expense at the hotel his family was staying in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Francis |first=Eric |url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Columnists/Francis/2007/11/30/4697730-sun.html |title=Iggy's Salt of the Earth |work=Calgary Sun |date=2007-11-03 |accessdate=2009-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2002,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.canoe.ca/WHLNews0102/0726.html |title=Willie O'Ree to appear at Jarome Iginla Hockey School |publisher=Canoe.ca |date=2002-07-26 |accessdate=2008-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; he has operated the Jarome Iginla Hockey School in Calgary as a non-profit organization, donating proceeds to the Diabetes Research Association.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blaze1129&quot; /&gt; In 2004, he was awarded the [[NHL Foundation Player Award]] for his community service and the [[King Clancy Memorial Trophy]] in recognition of his humanitarian contributions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/SilverwareTrophyWinner.jsp?tro=KCT&amp;year=2003-04 |title=2003–04 King Clancy Memorial Trophy winner – Jarome Iginla |publisher=Hockey Hall of Fame |accessdate=2008-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Iginla supports many charities. In 2000, he began donating $1,000 per goal he scored to [[KidSport]], a figure he doubled to $2,000 in 2005.  Between 2000 and 2012, he donated $550,000 from this initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Busby |first=Ian |title=Many happy returns |work=Calgary Sun |date=2012-02-20 |page=S4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Iginla is a part owner of the [[Kamloops Blazers]] of the [[Western Hockey League]], for whom he played during his junior hockey days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blazerhockey.com/content/team/owners.php |title=Meet the Kamloops Blazers owners |publisher=Kamloops Blazers Hockey Club |accessdate=2009-01-02| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080302110819/http://www.blazerhockey.com/content/team/owners.php| archivedate = March 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He purchased a minority share in the franchise, along with fellow NHL players [[Shane Doan]], [[Mark Recchi]] and [[Darryl Sydor]], in October 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whl.ca/article/whl-board-of-governors-approve-sale-of-the-kamloops-blazers/75463|title=WHL Board of Governors Approve Sale of the Kamloops Blazers |publisher=Western Hockey League |date=2007-10-10 |accessdate=2009-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He is also an ambassador with the [[NHL Diversity]] program, which supports youth hockey organizations that offer economically disadvantaged kids the opportunity to play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Elicksen |first=Debbie |url=http://books.google.com/?id=xiekI_Yuph8C&amp;pg=PA49&amp;lpg=PA49&amp;dq=Jarome+Iginla+NHL+diversity |title=Positive Sports |publisher=Freelance Communications |year=2003 |page=49 |isbn=0-9730237-3-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since 2008, he has been a hockey spokesperson for [[Scotiabank]], appearing in commercials and at events supporting its grassroots hockey programs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnw.ca/fr/releases/archive/October2008/02/c2694.html |title=Calgary Flames Captain Jarome Iginla Laces Up to Join Scotiabank's 2008-2009 NHL Lineup as Special Advisor on Hockey |publisher=Bank of Nova Scotia |date=2008-10-02 |accessdate=2009-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as for [[Samsung Group|Samsung Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Dickie |first=Mary |url=http://www.strategymag.com/articles/magazine/20090101/biz.html |title=Samsung's human touch |work=Strategy Magazine |date=2009-01 |publisher=Brunico Communications |page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Iginla visited Canadian troops in Afghanistan on May 30, 2011, in a surprise whirlwind visit with Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper]].  While on the visit, Iginla played some ball hockey, attended a barbecue with troops, and signed autographs.  &quot;It was an honor and a privilege to be asked by the Prime Minister to be part of this trip to come and meet and spend time with our troops&quot;, Iginla told calgaryflames.com.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://flames.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=564222|title=Jarome Iginla in Afghanistan|date=2011-05-30|accessdate=2011-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
