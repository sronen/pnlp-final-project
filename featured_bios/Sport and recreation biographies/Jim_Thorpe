'''James Francis &quot;Jim&quot; Thorpe''' ([[Fox language|Sac and Fox (Sauk)]]: ''Wa-Tho-Huk'', translated to &quot;Bright Path&quot;)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jim Thorpe Biography|url=http://www.notablebiographies.com/St-Tr/Thorpe-Jim.html|work=Encyclopedia of World Biography|accessdate=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; (May 28, 1888&amp;nbsp;– March 28, 1953)&lt;ref name=&quot;BD&quot;&gt;Magill. pg. 2320&lt;br /&gt;* Gerasimo and Whiteley. pg. 28 &lt;br /&gt;* [http://www.americaslibrary.gov/jb/gilded/jb_gilded_thorpe_1.html &quot;World-Class Athlete Jim Thorpe Was Born May 28, 1888,&quot;] americaslibrary.gov, accessed April 23, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; was an [[United States|American]] athlete of mixed ancestry (Caucasian and Native American). Considered one of the most versatile athletes of modern sports, he won [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] gold medals for the 1912 [[pentathlon]] and [[decathlon]], played [[American football]] (collegiate and professional), and also played professional [[baseball]] and [[basketball]]. He lost his Olympic titles after it was found he was paid for playing two seasons of semi-professional baseball before competing in the Olympics, thus violating the [[amateurism]] rules.  In 1983, 30 years after his death, the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) restored his Olympic medals.

Of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] and [[European American]] ancestry, Thorpe grew up in the [[Sac and Fox Nation|Sac and Fox]] nation in [[Oklahoma]]. He played as part of several All-American Indian teams throughout his career, and &quot;[[Barnstorm (athletics)|barnstormed]]&quot; as a professional basketball player with a team composed entirely of American Indians.

He played professional sports until age 41, the end of his sports career coinciding with the start of the [[Great Depression]].  Thorpe struggled to earn a living after that, working several odd jobs.  Thorpe suffered from [[alcoholism]], and lived his last years in failing health and poverty.

In a poll of sports fans conducted by [[ESPN on ABC|ABC Sports]], Thorpe was voted the Greatest Athlete of the Twentieth Century out of 15 other athletes including [[Muhammad Ali]], [[Babe Ruth]], [[Jesse Owens]], [[Jack Nicklaus]] and [[Michael Jordan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wide World of Sports athlete of the century|url=http://espn.go.com/endofcentury/s/century/wwos.html|publisher=ESPN Network|date=14 January 2000|accessdate=6 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jim Thorpe: All-Around Athlete and American Indian Advocate|url=http://americanhistory.si.edu/sports/exhibit/champions/thorpe/index.cfm|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|accessdate=6 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Information about Thorpe's birth, name, and ethnic background varies widely.&lt;ref name=&quot;County&quot;&gt;O'Hanlon-Lincoln. pg. 129&lt;/ref&gt; He was born in [[Indian Territory]], but no [[birth certificate]] has been found. Thorpe was generally considered born on May 28, 1888,&lt;ref name=&quot;BD&quot;/&gt; near the town of [[Prague, Oklahoma|Prague]], [[Oklahoma]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTobit&quot;/&gt; He was christened &quot;Jacobus Franciscus Thorpe&quot; in the [[Catholic Church]].

Thorpe's parents were both of mixed-race ancestry. His father, Hiram Thorpe, had an [[Ireland|Irish]] father and a [[Sac and Fox Nation|Sac and Fox]] Indian mother. His mother, Charlotte Vieux, had a [[France|French]] father and a [[Potawatomi]] mother, a descendant of Chief [[Louis Vieux]]. Thorpe was raised as a Sac and Fox, and his native name was ''Wa-Tho-Huk'', translated as &quot;path lighted by great flash of lightning&quot; or, more simply, &quot;Bright Path&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;County&quot;/&gt; As was the custom for Sac and Fox, Thorpe was named for something occurring around the time of his birth, in this case the light brightening the path to the cabin where he was born. Thorpe's parents were both [[Roman Catholic]], a faith which Thorpe observed throughout his adult life.&lt;ref&gt;O'Hanlon-Lincoln. pg. 131&lt;/ref&gt;

Thorpe attended the Sac and Fox Indian Agency School in [[Stroud, Oklahoma|Stroud]], Oklahoma, with his twin brother Charlie.  Charlie helped Jim through school, but died of [[pneumonia]] when they were nine years old.&lt;ref name=&quot;cgm&quot;&gt;[http://www.cmgww.com/sports/thorpe/facts/facts.html Jim Thorpe&amp;nbsp;– Fast facts], cgmworldwide.com, accessed April 23, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter, Thorpe [[truancy|ran away]] from school on several occasions. Hiram Thorpe then sent him to the [[Haskell Indian Nations University|Haskell Institute]], an [[Native American boarding schools|&quot;Indian&quot; boarding school]] in [[Lawrence, Kansas|Lawrence]], [[Kansas]], so that he would not run away again.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oly30&quot;/&gt; When his mother died of childbirth complications two years later,&lt;ref name=&quot;Hoxie&quot;/&gt; Thorpe became depressed. After several arguments with his father, the teenaged Thorpe left home to work on a horse ranch.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oly30&quot;&gt;[http://www.olympics30.com/30greatest/jim-thorpe-hero.asp Jim Thorpe – Olympic Hero and Native American], olympics30.com, accessed April 23, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1904, the sixteen year old Thorpe returned to his father and decided to attend [[Carlisle Indian Industrial School]] in [[Carlisle, Pennsylvania]]. There, his athletic ability was recognized and he was coached by [[Glenn Scobey Warner|Glenn Scobey &quot;Pop&quot; Warner]], one of the most influential coaches of early American football history.&lt;ref name=&quot;CNN&quot;/&gt; Later that year, Hiram Thorpe died from [[gangrene]] poisoning after being wounded in a hunting accident.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hoxie&quot;&gt;Hoxie. pg. 628&lt;/ref&gt; Thorpe again dropped out of school. He resumed farm work for a few years and then returned to Carlisle Indian Industrial School.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oly30&quot;/&gt;

== Amateur career ==
=== College career ===
[[File:Jim Thorpe.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Jim Thorpe in [[Carlisle Indian Industrial School]] uniform, about 1909]]
Thorpe reportedly began his athletic career at Carlisle in 1907 when he walked past the track and beat the school's [[high jump]]ers with an impromptu 5-ft 9-in jump while still wearing street clothes.&lt;ref name=&quot;bookrag&quot;&gt;''Encyclopedia of World Biography''. [http://www.bookrags.com/Jim_Thorpe Jim Thorpe], [[Thomson-Gale]], Bookrags, June 2005, accessed April 23, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; His earliest recorded [[track and field]] results are from 1907. He also competed in football, baseball, [[Lacrosse (sport)|lacrosse]] and even [[ballroom dancing]], winning the 1912 inter-collegiate ballroom dancing championship.&lt;ref name=&quot;SI2004&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2004/olympics/2004/08/08/bc.olympics.athletics.thorpe/|title=Sports Illustrated : Jim Thorpe cruelly treated by authorities.|accessdate=2008-04-15|work=[[CNN]]|date=August 8, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reportedly, [[Glenn Scobey Warner|Pop Warner]] was hesitant to allow Thorpe, his best track and field athlete, to compete in a physical game such as football.&lt;ref name=&quot;Warner&quot;&gt;Jeansonne. p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; Thorpe, however, convinced Warner to let him participate in some plays against the school team's defense; Warner assumed he would be tackled easily and give up the idea.&lt;ref name=&quot;Warner&quot;/&gt; Thorpe &quot;ran around past and through them not once, but twice.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Warner&quot;/&gt; He then walked over to Warner and said, &quot;Nobody is going to tackle Jim,&quot; while flipping him the ball.&lt;ref name=&quot;Warner&quot;/&gt;

Thorpe gained nationwide attention for the first time in 1911.&lt;ref name=&quot;Redskin&quot;&gt;[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F60C12FC3B5E13738DDDA10A94DC405B828DF1D3 &quot;Indian Thorpe in Olympiad: Redskin from Carlisle Will Strive for Place on American Team,&quot;] ''The New York Times'', April 28, 1912, accessed April 2, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; As a [[running back]], [[defensive back]], [[placekicker]], and [[Punter (football position)|punter]], Thorpe scored all of his football team's points—four field goals and a touchdown—in an 18–15 upset of [[Harvard]], a top ranked team in those early days of the [[National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association#History|National Collegiate Athletic Association]] .&lt;ref name=&quot;Warner&quot;/&gt; His team finished the season 11–1. In 1912, Carlisle won the national collegiate championship largely as a result of his efforts – he scored 25 [[touchdown]]s and 198 points during the season.&lt;ref name=&quot;CNN&quot;/&gt;

Carlisle's 1912 record included a 27–6 victory over [[United States Military Academy|Army]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTobit&quot;/&gt; In that game, Thorpe's 92-yard touchdown was nullified by a teammate's penalty; the next play, Thorpe scored a 97-yard touchdown.&lt;ref name=&quot;usoc&quot;&gt;[http://www.usoc.org/26_37888.htm Jim Thorpe], usoc.org, accessed April 26, 2007. {{Wayback|url=http://www.usoc.org/26_37888.htm|date =20070930201621|bot=DASHBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Future President [[Dwight Eisenhower]], who played against him that season, recalled of Thorpe in a 1961 speech:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Here and there, there are some people who are supremely endowed. My memory goes back to Jim Thorpe. He never practiced in his life, and he could do anything better than any other football player I ever saw.&lt;ref name=&quot;CNN&quot;&gt;Botelho, Greg. [http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/europe/07/09/jim.thorpe/ Roller-coaster life of Indian icon, sports' first star], CNN.com, July 14, 2004, accessed April 23, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Thorpe was awarded [[All-America]]n honors in both 1911 and 1912.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTobit&quot;/&gt;

Football was—and would remain—Thorpe's favorite sport.&lt;ref&gt;O'Hanlon-Lincoln. p. 144 &lt;br /&gt;* [http://www.profootballhof.com/hof/member.jsp?player_id=213 Jim Thorpe], profootballhalloffame.com, accessed April 23, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; He competed only sporadically in track and field. Nevertheless, track and field became the sport in which Thorpe gained his greatest fame.

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the spring of 1912 he started training for the Olympics. He had confined his efforts to the jumps, the hurdles and the shot-put but now he undertook the pole vault, the javelin, discus, the hammer and the fifty-six-pound weight. In the Olympic trials held at Celtic Park in New York, his all-round ability stood out in all these events and so he riveted a claim to a place on the team that went to Sweden.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTobit&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Olympic career ===
[[File:Jim Thorpe olympic.png|thumb|upright|Thorpe at the 1912 Summer Olympics]]
For the [[1912 Summer Olympics]] in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]], two new multi-event disciplines were included, the [[pentathlon]] and the [[decathlon]]. A pentathlon based on the ancient Greek event had been organized at the [[1906 Summer Olympics]]. The 1912 version consisted of the [[long jump]], the [[javelin throw]], 200-meter dash, the [[discus throw]] and the 1500-meter run.

The decathlon was a relatively new event of modern athletics, although it had been part of American track meets since the 1880s and a version had been featured on the program of the [[1904 Summer Olympics|1904 St. Louis Olympics]]. The events of the new decathlon differed slightly from the American version. Both events seemed appropriate for Thorpe, who was so versatile that he alone had constituted Carlisle's team in several track meets.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTobit&quot;/&gt; He could run the 100-yard dash in 10 seconds flat, the 220 in 21.8 seconds, the 440 in 51.8 seconds, the 880 in 1:57, the mile in 4:35, the 120-yard high hurdles in 15 seconds, and the 220-yard low hurdles in 24 seconds.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTobit&quot;&gt;[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F40A15FF3D59107A93CBAB1788D85F478585F9 Jim Thorpe Is Dead On West Coast at 64], ''[[The New York Times]]'', March 29, 1953, accessed April 23, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; He could long jump 23&amp;nbsp;ft 6&amp;nbsp;in and high-jump 6&amp;nbsp;ft 5&amp;nbsp;in.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTobit&quot;/&gt; He could [[pole vault]] 11&amp;nbsp;feet, [[shot put|put the shot]] 47&amp;nbsp;ft 9&amp;nbsp;in, [[javelin throw|throw the javelin]] 163&amp;nbsp;feet, and throw the [[discus throw|discus]] 136&amp;nbsp;feet.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTobit&quot;/&gt;

Thorpe entered the U.S. Olympic trials for both the pentathlon and the decathlon. He won the awards easily, winning three events, and was named to the pentathlon team, which also included future [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) president [[Avery Brundage]]. There were only a few candidates for the decathlon team, and the trials were cancelled.

His schedule in the Olympics was busy. Along with the decathlon and pentathlon, he competed in the long jump and high jump. The first competition was the pentathlon; Thorpe won four of the five events and placed third in the javelin, an event in which he had not competed before 1912. Although the pentathlon was primarily decided on place points, points were also earned for the marks achieved in the individual events. He won the gold medal. The same day, Thorpe qualified for the high jump final. He placed fourth and also took seventh place in the long jump.

Thorpe's final event was the decathlon, his first—and as it turned out, only—Olympic decathlon. Strong competition from local favorite [[Hugo Wieslander]] was expected. Thorpe, however, easily defeated Wieslander by more than 700 points. He placed in the top four of all ten events.  Thorpe's Olympic record of 8,413 points would stand for nearly two decades.&lt;ref name=&quot;bookrag&quot;/&gt; Overall, Thorpe won eight of the 15 individual events of the pentathlon and decathlon.

As was the custom of the day, the medals were presented to the athletes during the closing ceremonies of the games. Along with the two gold medals, Thorpe also received two challenge prizes, which were donated by King [[Gustav V of Sweden]] for the decathlon and Czar [[Nicholas II of Russia]] for the pentathlon. Several sources recount that, when awarding Thorpe his prize, King Gustav said, &quot;You, sir, are the greatest athlete in the world,&quot; to which Thorpe replied, &quot;Thanks, King.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Flatter&quot;&gt;Flatter, Ron. [http://espn.go.com/sportscentury/features/00016499.html Thorpe preceded Deion, Bo], [[ESPN.com]], accessed April 23, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Jim Thorpe, Sac and Fox Athlete&quot; by Bob Berontas, Chelsea House Publications (London, 1993), ISBN 978-0-7910-1722-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thorpe's successes had not gone unnoticed at home, and he was honored with a [[ticker-tape parade]] on [[Broadway (New York City)|Broadway]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Flatter&quot;/&gt; He remembered later, &quot;I heard people yelling my name, and I couldn't realize how one fellow could have so many friends.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Flatter&quot;/&gt;

Apart from his track and field appearance, Thorpe also played in one of two exhibition [[Baseball at the 1912 Summer Olympics|baseball games at the 1912 Olympics]], which featured two teams composed of U.S. track and field athletes. It was not Thorpe's first try at baseball, as the public would soon learn.

=== All-Around Champion ===
After his victories at the Olympic Games in Sweden, on September 2, 1912, Thorpe returned to Celtic Park, the home of the [[Irish American Athletic Club]], in [[Queens, New York]] (where he had qualified four months earlier for the Olympic Games), to compete in the [[Amateur Athletic Union]]'s All-Around Championship. Competing against [[Bruno Brodd]] of the [[Irish American Athletic Club]], and J. Bredemus of [[Princeton University]], he won seven of the ten events contested, and came in second in the remaining three. With a total point score of 7,476 points, Thorpe broke the previous record of 7,385 points set in 1909, (also set at Celtic Park), by [[Martin Sheridan]], the champion athlete of the Irish American Athletic Club.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Indian Thorpe is Best Athlete&amp;nbsp;— Olympic Champion Wins All-Around Championship and Breaks Record.&quot;''The New York Times, Sept. 3, 1912.&lt;/ref&gt; Sheridan, a five-time Olympic gold medalist, was present to watch his record broken, and approached Thorpe after the event. He shook his hand saying, &quot;Jim my boy, you're a great man. I never expect to look upon a finer athlete.&quot; Sheridan told a reporter from ''[[The New York World]]'', &quot;Thorpe is the greatest athlete that ever lived. He has me beaten fifty ways. Even when I was in my prime, I could not do what he did today.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler, 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Controversy ===
In 1913, strict rules regarding amateurism were in effect for athletes participating in the Olympics. Athletes who received money prizes for competitions, were sports teachers, or had competed previously against professionals, were not considered amateurs and were barred from competition.

In late January 1913, the ''[[Worcester Telegram]]'' published a story announcing that Thorpe had played professional baseball, and other U.S. newspapers followed up the story.&lt;ref name=&quot;Flatter&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'&quot;Jim&quot; Thorpe Admits He Is Professional, and Retires from Athletics', ''[[The Washington Post]]'', January 28, 1913, p. 8. &quot;Charges that Thorpe had played professional baseball in Winston Salem, N.C. were first published in a Worcester (Mass.) newspaper last week.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Thorpe had indeed played professional baseball in the [[Eastern Carolina League]] for [[Rocky Mount, North Carolina|Rocky Mount]], [[North Carolina]], in 1909 and 1910, receiving meager pay; reportedly as little as [[US Dollar|$]]2 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|2|1910|r=0}}}} today) a game and as much as $35 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|35|1910|r=0}}}} today) a week.&lt;ref name=&quot;Anderson&quot;/&gt; College players, in fact, regularly spent summers playing professionally, but most used aliases, unlike Thorpe.&lt;ref name=&quot;CNN&quot;/&gt;

Although the public did not seem to care much about Thorpe's past,&lt;ref name=&quot;Schaff&quot;&gt;Schaffer and Smith. p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Amateur Athletic Union]] (AAU), and especially its secretary [[James Edward Sullivan]], took the case very seriously.&lt;ref&gt;Schaffer and Smith. p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; Thorpe wrote a letter to Sullivan, in which he admitted playing professional baseball:&lt;ref name=&quot;Flatter&quot;/&gt;

{{Cquote|...I hope I will be partly excused by the fact that I was simply an Indian schoolboy and did not know all about such things. In fact, I did not know that I was doing wrong, because I was doing what I knew several other college men had done, except that they did not use their own names....}}

His letter did not help. The AAU decided to withdraw Thorpe's amateur status retroactively and asked the [[International Olympic Commission]] (IOC) to do the same. Later that year, the IOC unanimously decided to [[List of stripped Olympic medals|strip]] Thorpe of his Olympic titles, medals, and awards, and declared him a professional.

Although Thorpe had played for money, the AAU and IOC did not follow the rules for disqualification. The rulebook for the 1912 Olympics stated that protests had to be made ''within'' 30 days from the closing ceremonies of the games.&lt;ref name=&quot;usoc&quot;/&gt; The first newspaper reports did not appear until January 1913, about six months after the Stockholm Games had concluded.&lt;ref name=&quot;usoc&quot;/&gt; There is also some evidence that Thorpe's amateur status had been questioned long before the Olympics, but the AAU had ignored the issue until being confronted with it in 1913.

The only positive element of this affair for Thorpe was that, as soon as the news was reported that he had been declared a professional, he received offers from professional sports clubs.&lt;ref&gt;Rogge, Johnson, and Rendell. pg. 60&lt;/ref&gt;

== Professional career ==
=== Baseball free agent ===
Because the minor league team that last held Jim Thorpe's contract had disbanded in 1910, he found himself in the rare position of being a sought after [[free agent]] at the major league level during the era of the [[reserve clause]], and thus had a choice of baseball teams for which to play.&lt;ref&gt;[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F60E11F93D5B13738DDDA80894DA405B838DF1D3 Thorpe is to Play Ball with Giants; Famous Indian Athlete Accepts McGraw's Terms Over the Telephone.], ''The New York Times'', February 1, 1913, accessed April 2, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1913 Thorpe turned down a starting position with the [[1912 St. Louis Browns season|American League bottom dweller]] [[Saint Louis Browns]], choosing instead to join the [[1912 New York Giants season|1912 National League champion]] [[San Francisco Giants|New York Giants]]. The Giants, with Thorpe participating in 19 of 151 games, would repeat as the [[1913 New York Giants season|1913 National League champion]].  Immediately following the Giants October loss of the [[1913 World Series]], Thorpe and the Giants joined the [[Chicago White Sox]] for a world tour.&lt;ref&gt;[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F70B1EF93E5B13738DDDAE0A94DF405B838DF1D3 Sox and Giants on World's Tour; Comiskey-McGraw Party Leaves Chicago Oct. 19 and Arrives in New York March 6.], ''The New York Times'', , accessed April 23, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Barnstorming across the United States and then around the world, Thorpe was the celebrity of the tour.&lt;ref&gt;Elfers. pg. 210&lt;/ref&gt; Thorpe's presence increased the publicity, attendance and [[gate receipts]] for the tour. He met with [[Pope Pius X]], [[Abbas II of Egypt|Abbas II Hilmi Bey]] (the last [[khedive]] of [[Egypt]]), and played before 20,000 people in London including [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]]. While in [[Rome]], Thorpe was filmed wrestling with another baseball player on the floor of the [[Coliseum]]. No copy of that film is known to exist.

=== Baseball, football, and basketball ===
Thorpe signed with the [[San Francisco Giants|New York Giants]] baseball club in 1913 and played sporadically with them as an outfielder for three seasons. After playing in the minor leagues with the [[Milwaukee Brewers (minor league baseball team)|Milwaukee Brewers]] in 1916,&lt;ref&gt;[http://flickr.com/photos/10795049@N02/2216883254/ Jim Thorpe's Speed Big Hit In A.A.] ''The Janesville Daily Gazette '', July 10, 1916, accessed February 19, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; he returned to the Giants in 1917 but was sold to the [[Cincinnati Reds]] early in the season. In the &quot;double [[no-hitter]]&quot; between [[Fred Toney]] of the Reds and [[Hippo Vaughn]] of the [[Chicago Cubs]], Thorpe drove in the winning run in the 10th inning.&lt;ref&gt;Daley, Arthur.

Again, he played sporadically for the Giants in  1918 and was traded to the [[Atlanta Braves|Boston Braves]] on May 21, 1919, for [[Pat Ragan]]. In his career, he amassed 91 [[runs scored]], 82 [[runs batted in]] and a .252 [[batting average]] over 289 games.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baseball-reference.com/t/thorpji01.shtml Jim Thorpe], baseball-reference.com, accessed April 23, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; He continued to play baseball with teams in the [[minor league baseball|minor leagues]] until 1922.

But Thorpe had not abandoned football either. He first played professional football in 1913, as a member of the Indiana-based [[Pine Village, Indiana#Football|Pine Village Pros]], a team that had a several-season winning streak against local teams during the 1910s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/history/chronology/1911-1920|title=NFL History by Decade, 1911–1920|publisher=[[National Football League]]|accessdate=September 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1915, Thorpe had signed with the [[Canton Bulldogs]] They paid him $250 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|250|1915|r=0}}}} today) a game, a tremendous wage at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;page18&quot;&gt;Neft, Cohen, and Korch. pg. 18&lt;/ref&gt; Before Thorpe's signing, Canton was averaging 1,200 fans a game; 8,000 showed up for his debut against the [[Massillon Tigers]].&lt;ref name=&quot;page18&quot;/&gt; The team won titles in 1916, 1917, and 1919. Thorpe reportedly ended the 1919 championship game by kicking a wind-assisted 95-yard punt from his team's own 5-yard line, effectively putting the game out of reach.&lt;ref name=&quot;page18&quot;/&gt; In 1920, the Bulldogs were one of 14 teams to form the [[American Professional Football Association]] (APFA), which would become the [[National Football League]] (NFL) two years later. Thorpe was nominally the APFA's first president; however, he spent most of the year playing for Canton and a year later was replaced by [[Joseph Carr]].&lt;ref&gt;Neft, Cohen, and Korch. pg. 20&lt;/ref&gt; He continued to play for Canton, coaching the team as well. Between 1921 and 1923, Thorpe helped organize and played for the [[LaRue, Ohio]], ([[Marion County, Ohio|Marion County]], [[Ohio]]) [[Oorang Indians]], an all-Native American team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=3TIr7zpw7B8C&amp;pg=PA11|title=Native athletes in sport &amp; society: a reader|author=C.

Thorpe never played for an NFL championship team. He retired from professional football at age 41,&lt;ref name=&quot;cgm&quot;/&gt; having played 52 NFL games for six teams from 1920 to 1928.

[[File:WFI.jpg|left|thumb|World Famous Indians letterhead]]
Until 2005, most of Thorpe's biographers were unaware of his basketball career.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pbs.org/opb/historydetectives/pdf/310_jimthorpe.pdf Jim Thorpe Ticket] ([[Portable Document Format|PDF]]), pbs.org, accessed April 23, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; A ticket discovered in an old book that year revealed his career in [[basketball]]. By 1926, he was the main feature of the &quot;World Famous Indians&quot; of [[LaRue, Ohio|LaRue]], which sponsored traveling football, baseball, and basketball teams. &quot;Jim Thorpe and His World-Famous Indians&quot; barnstormed for at least two years (1927–28) in parts of New York, Pennsylvania, and [[Marion, Ohio]]. Although pictures of Thorpe in his WFI basketball uniform were printed on postcards and published in newspapers, this period of his life was not well documented.

== Marriage and family ==
In 1913, Thorpe married Iva Miller,&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTobit&quot;/&gt; whom he had met at Carlisle. They had four children: Jim Jr. (who died at age 2), Gale, Charlotte and Grace.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTobit&quot;/&gt; Miller filed for divorce from Thorpe in 1925, claiming desertion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,720180,00.html List of marriages, divorces, births, and deaths], ''[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]'', April 6, 1925, available online via time.com, accessed May 21, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1926, Thorpe married Freeda V. Kirkpatrick (September 19, 1905 – March 2, 2007). She was working for the manager of the baseball team for which he was playing at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author = [[Associated Press]]|url = http://www.seattlepi.com/local/306603_thorpe08.html|title = Freeda Thorpe, former wife of Jim Thorpe, dies at 101], Seattle Post-Intelligencer|date = March 7, 2007|accessdate = 2007-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had four sons: Carl, a [[lieutenant colonel]] in the U.S. Army,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arlingtoncemetery.net/cpthorpe.htm|title=Carl P. Thorpe, Lieutenant Colonel, United States Army|publisher=[[Arlington National Cemetery]]|date=December 11, 2006|accessdate=January 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; William, Richard and John &quot;Jack&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTobit&quot;/&gt;  Kirkpatrick divorced Thorpe in 1941 after 15 years of marriage.

Lastly, Thorpe married Patricia Askew, who was with him when he died.

== Later life ==
After his athletic career, Thorpe struggled to provide for his family. He found it difficult to work a non-sports job and never held a job for an extended period of time. During the [[Great Depression]] in particular, Thorpe had various jobs, among others as an [[extra (drama)|extra]] for several movies, usually playing an American Indian chief in [[Western movie|Westerns]]. He also worked as a construction worker, a [[bouncer (doorman)|doorman (bouncer)]], a [[security guard]], and a ditch digger, and he briefly joined the [[United States Merchant Marine]] in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;O'Hanlon-Lincoln. pgs. 144–5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,774347,00.html Briefs], ''TIME'', February 22, 1943, available online via time.com, accessed May 21, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Thorpe was a chronic alcoholic during his later life.&lt;ref&gt;Jeansonne. pg 61&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1950s, Thorpe had no money left. When he was hospitalized for lip [[cancer]] in 1950, he was admitted as a charity case.&lt;ref name=&quot;lip&quot;&gt;Associated Press. [http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0E1EF63A5A127B93C2A8178AD95F458585F9 &quot;Thorpe Has Cancerous Growth Removed From Lip in Hospital at Philadelphia,&quot;] ''The New York Times'', November 10, 1951, accessed April 23, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; At a press conference announcing the procedure, Thorpe's wife Patricia wept and pleaded for help, saying, &quot;[W]e're broke.... Jim has nothing but his name and his memories. He has spent money on his own people and has given it away. He has often been exploited.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;lip&quot;/&gt;

== Death ==
In early 1953, Thorpe suffered his third [[myocardial infarction|heart failure]], while eating dinner with his wife Patricia in their home in [[Lomita, California]]. He was briefly revived by [[artificial respiration]] and was able to speak to those around him, but lost consciousness shortly afterward and died on March 28 at the age of 64.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTobit&quot;/&gt;

== Racism ==
Thorpe, whose parents were both half Caucasian, was raised as an American Indian. His accomplishments occurred during a period of racial inequality in the United States. It has often been suggested that his medals were stripped because of his ethnicity.&lt;ref&gt;Watterson. pg. 151&lt;br /&gt;* Elfers. pg. 18&lt;/ref&gt; While it is difficult to prove this, the public comment at the time largely reflected this view.&lt;ref&gt;Schaffer and Smith. pg. 50&lt;/ref&gt; At the time Thorpe won his gold medals, not all Native Americans were recognized as US [[citizen]]s. (The US government had wanted them to make concessions to adopt European-American ways to receive such recognition.) Citizenship was not granted to all American Indians until 1924.&lt;ref&gt;Lincoln and Slagle. pg. 282&lt;/ref&gt;

While Thorpe attended Carlisle, students' ethnicity was used for marketing purposes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bloom&quot;/&gt; A photograph of Thorpe and the 1911 football team emphasized the racial differences between the competing athletes. The inscription on the football reads, &quot;1911, Indians 18, Harvard 15.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historicalsociety.com/thorpe.html Jim Thorpe Photo Collection], historicalsociety.com, accessed May 14, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the school and journalists often categorized sporting competitions as conflicts of Indians against whites. Newspaper headings such as &quot;Indians Scalp Army 27–6&quot; or &quot;Jim Thorpe on Rampage&quot; made stereotypical journalistic play of the Indian nature of Carlisle's football team.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bloom&quot;&gt;Bloom quoted in Bird. pg. 97&lt;/ref&gt; The first notice of Thorpe in ''[[The New York Times]]'' was headlined &quot;Indian Thorpe in Olympiad.; Redskin from Carlisle Will Strive for Place on American Team&quot;;&lt;ref name=&quot;Redskin&quot;/&gt; his accomplishments were described in a similar racial context by other newspapers and sportswriters throughout his life.&lt;ref&gt;Demaree, Al.

== Legacy ==
=== Olympic awards reinstated ===
Over the years, supporters of Thorpe attempted to have his Olympic titles reinstated.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Dave. [http://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F10E17FE355F15768FDDAB0A94DE405B858BF1D3 &quot;Jim Thorpe's Medals,&quot;] ''The New York Times'', June 22, 1975, accessed April 23, 2007. {{Wayback|url=http://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F10E17FE355F15768FDDAB0A94DE405B858BF1D3|date =20071021031041|bot=DASHBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; US Olympic officials, including former teammate and later president of the IOC [[Avery Brundage]], rebuffed several attempts, with Brundage once saying, &quot;Ignorance is no excuse.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Reuters]].

They succeeded in having the AAU and [[United States Olympic Committee]] (USOC) overturn its decision and restore Thorpe's amateur status prior to 1913.&lt;ref&gt;Wethe, David and Whiteley, Michael. [http://www.bizjournals.com/dallas/stories/2002/07/22/newscolumn1.html &quot;Legends lunches begin this fall with Bob Lilly,&quot;] ''[[Dallas Business Journal]]'', July 19, 2002, accessed April 27, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, Wheeler and Ridlon established the Jim Thorpe Foundation and gained support from the [[U.S. Congress]]. Armed with this support and evidence from 1912 proving that Thorpe's disqualification had occurred after the 30-day time period allowed by Olympics rules, they succeeded in making the case to the IOC. In October 1982, the IOC Executive Committee approved Thorpe's reinstatement.&lt;ref name=&quot;Anderson&quot;/&gt; In an unusual ruling, they declared that Thorpe was co-champion with Bie and Wieslander, although both of these athletes had always said they considered Thorpe to be the only champion. In a ceremony on January 18, 1983, the IOC presented two of Thorpe's children, Gale and Bill, with commemorative medals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Anderson&quot;&gt;[[Dave Anderson (sportswriter)|Anderson, Dave]].

===Honors===
[[File:Jim Thorpe (Indiana).jpg|thumb|right|165px|Thorpe as backfield coach for Indiana, 1915]]
Thorpe's monument, featuring the quote from Gustav V (&quot;You, sir, are the greatest athlete in the world.&quot;), still stands near the town named for him, Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hoxie&quot;/&gt; The grave rests on mounds of soil from Thorpe's native [[Oklahoma]] and from the stadium in which he won his Olympic medals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roadsideamerica.com/tip/3583 Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania – Jim Thorpe's Tourist Attraction Grave at] [[Roadside America]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Thorpe's achievements received great acclaim from sports journalists, both during his lifetime and since his death. In 1950, an [[Associated Press]] poll of almost 400 sportswriters and broadcasters voted Thorpe the &quot;greatest athlete&quot; of the first half of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761574686/Jim_Thorpe.html &quot;Jim Thorpe&quot;], encarta.msn.com, accessed April 23, 2007.

[http://www.usatoday.com/sports/ssat2.htm Top 100 athletes of the 20th century], ''[[USA Today]]'', December 21, 1999, accessed March 15, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; [[ESPN]] ranked Thorpe seventh on their list of best [[North America]]n athletes of the century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://espn.go.com/sportscentury/athletes.html &quot;Top N. American athletes of the century,&quot;] espn.com, accessed March 15, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thorpe was inducted into the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] in 1963, one of seventeen players in the charter class.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.profootballhof.com/hof/years.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt; Thorpe is memorialized in the Pro Football Hall of Fame rotunda with a larger-than-life statue. He was also inducted into halls of fame for college football, American Olympic teams, and the national track and field competition.&lt;ref name=&quot;CNN&quot;/&gt;

[[President of the United States|President]] [[Richard Nixon]], as authorized by [[U.S. Senate]] Joint Resolution 73, proclaimed Monday, April 16, 1973 as &quot;Jim Thorpe Day&quot; to promote the nationwide recognition of Thorpe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=76664 Richard Nixon: Proclamation 4209 – Jim Thorpe Day]&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1986, the Jim Thorpe Association established an award with Thorpe's name. The [[Jim Thorpe Award]] is given annually to the best [[defensive back]] in [[college football]]. The annual [[Thorpe Cup]] athletics meeting is named in his honor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zehnkampfteam.de/statistiken/thorpe-cup/historie/geschichte.html|title=16 Jahre &quot;Thorpe Cup&quot;|work=Zehnkampf.de|accessdate=10 August 2010|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania===
Thorpe's wife Patricia was angry after his death when the government of Oklahoma would not erect a memorial to honor him.&lt;ref name=&quot;wsj&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Hagerty|first=James R.|title=Is There Life After Jim Thorpe For Jim Thorpe, Pa.?|newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=July 21, 2010|page=A14}}&lt;/ref&gt; When she heard that the small Pennsylvania towns of [[Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania|Mauch Chunk and East Mauch Chunk]] were desperately seeking to attract business, she made a deal with officials. The towns bought Thorpe's remains, erected a monument to him, merged and renamed the newly united town in his honor,  [[Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania]]. Thorpe had never been there.&lt;ref&gt;O'Hanlon-Lincoln, pg. 148&lt;/ref&gt; The monument site contains his tomb, two statues of him in athletic poses, and historical  markers describing his life story.

In June 2010, Thorpe's son, Jack, filed a federal lawsuit against the borough of Jim Thorpe, seeking to have his father's remains returned to his homeland and re-interred near other family members in Oklahoma. Citing the [[Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act]], Jack Thorpe is arguing to bring his father's remains to the reservation in Oklahoma. There Thorpe's remains would be buried near his father, sisters, and brother, and would be one mile away from the place he was born. Jack Thorpe says the agreement between his stepmother and borough officials was made against the wishes of other family members. They want him buried in Native American land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Lee, Peggy |title=Son Of Jim Thorpe Sues for His Remains |url=http://www.wnep.com/wnep-carb-son-sues-jim-thorpe-body,0,1168347.story |work=wnep.com |date=June 24, 2010 |accessdate=2010-06-25}} {{Dead link|date=March 2012|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dale, Maryclaire.

== In film ==
In the 1930s, Thorpe appeared in several short films and features.  Usually, his roles were cameo appearances as an Indian, although in the 1932 comedy, ''Always Kickin'', Thorpe was prominently cast in a speaking part as himself, a kicking coach teaching young football players to drop-kick.  In 1931, during the Great Depression, he sold the film rights to his life story to [[MGM]] for $1,500 (${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|1500|1931|r=-3}}}} today).{{inflation-fn|US}} &lt;ref&gt;O'Hanlon-Lincoln. pg. 145&lt;/ref&gt; The movie included archival footage of the 1912 and 1932 Olympics, as well as a banquet in which Thorpe was honored. Thorpe was seen in some long shots in the film; and one scene showed him as a coaching assistant. It was also distributed in the [[United Kingdom]], where it was called ''Man of Bronze''.

Thorpe was memorialized in the [[Warner Bros.]] film ''[[Jim Thorpe – All-American]]'' (1951) starring [[Burt Lancaster]], with [[Billy Gray (actor)|Billy Gray]] performing as Thorpe as a child. The film was directed by [[Michael Curtiz]]. Although there were rumors that Thorpe received no money, he was paid $15,000 by Warner Bros. plus a $2,500 donation toward an annuity for him by the studio head of publicity.&lt;ref&gt;Kate Buford, ''Native American Son, The Life and Sporting Legend of Jim Thorpe'', Alfred A. Knopf (New York, 2010), ISBN 97803754132477{{Please check ISBN|reason=Invalid length.}}, p.356&lt;/ref&gt;

He is mentioned twice in Disney's 1973 film ''[[The World's Greatest Athlete]]''.

Thorpe is featured as a ghost figure in the 1994 film ''WindRunner: A Spirited Journey'', where he is portrayed by [[Russell Means]].
