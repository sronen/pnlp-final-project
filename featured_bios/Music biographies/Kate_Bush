'''Catherine &quot;Kate&quot; Bush''' (born 30 July 1958)&lt;ref name=Allmusicbio&gt;{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p3805|pure_url=yes}} |title=allmusic ((( Kate Bush &gt; Biography ))) |publisher=Allmusic |accessdate=20 May 2009 |last= Eder|first= Bruce}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an English singer-songwriter, musician and record producer. Her [[eclectic]] musical style and [[Idiosyncrasy|idiosyncratic]] vocal style have made her one of the United Kingdom's most successful solo female performers of the past 30&amp;nbsp;years. 

In 1978, at the age of 19, Bush topped the [[UK Singles Chart]] for four weeks with her debut single &quot;[[Wuthering Heights (song)|Wuthering Heights]]&quot;, becoming the first woman to have a UK number one with a self-written song.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Graeme Thomson |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2010/may/13/kate-bush-only-tour-live |title=Kate Bush's only tour: pop concert or disappearing act? The Guardian 13 May 2010 |work=Guardian |date= 13 May 2010|accessdate=29 May 2010|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has since released ten albums, three of which topped the [[UK Albums Chart]], and has had 25 UK [[Top 40]] hit singles including the Top 10 hits &quot;[[Wuthering Heights (song)|Wuthering Heights]]&quot;, &quot;[[Running Up that Hill]]&quot;, &quot;[[King of the Mountain (song)|King of the Mountain]]&quot;, &quot;[[Babooshka (song)|Babooshka]]&quot;, &quot;[[The Man with the Child in His Eyes]]&quot;, and &quot;[[Don't Give Up (Peter Gabriel and Kate Bush song)|Don't Give Up]]&quot;.

In 1987, she won a [[Brit Award]] for Best British Female Solo Artist, and in 2002, her songwriting ability was recognised with an [[Ivor Novello Award]] for Outstanding Contribution to British Music.  During the course of her career, she has also been nominated for three [[Grammy Awards]]. After her 1979 tour — the only concert tour of her career — Bush released the 1980 album ''[[Never for Ever]]'', which made her the first British solo female artist to top the UK album charts and the first female artist ever to enter the album chart at Number 1.&lt;ref name=&quot;chartstats.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chartstats.com/albuminfo.php?id=5079 |title=Kate Bush – Never For Ever |publisher=Chart Stats |accessdate=29 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is also the first (and to date only) female artist to have Top 5 albums in the UK charts in 5 successive decades.

==Early life==
Bush was born in [[Bexleyheath]], Southeast London, to English physician Robert Bush and his Irish wife, Hannah Daly.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sweeting&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title = Kate Bush: Return of the recluse| work=The Independent|author=Sweeting, Adam|url = http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/kate-bush-return-of-the-recluse-509224.html| date =2 October 2005|accessdate = 15 May 2008|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was raised in their farmhouse in [[East Wickham]] with her older brothers, John and [[Paddy Bush|Paddy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;salon.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title = Kate Bush |publisher=Salon.com|url = http://archive.salon.com/people/bc/2001/03/20/kate_bush/index.html |accessdate = 22 April 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bush came from an artistic background: her mother was a former Irish folk dancer, her father was an accomplished pianist, Paddy worked as a musical instrument maker and John was a poet and photographer. Both brothers were involved in the local [[folk music]] scene.&lt;ref name=&quot;Haunting Kate Bush&quot;&gt;{{cite news  |last=Young |first=David |title = Haunting Kate Bush |work=NZ Listener |date=2 December 1978 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

John was a [[karateka]] at [[Goldsmiths, University of London|Goldsmiths College]] karate club and Kate also trained there, becoming known as &quot;Ee-ee&quot; because of her squeaky [[kiai]]. One of the instructors, [[Dave Hazard]], later noted in his autobiography that her dance moves seemed to owe something to karate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Born Fighter|last= Hazard|first= Dave|year= 2007|publisher=John Blake Publishing|location= London|isbn= 978-1-84454-480-6|page= 114}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Her family's musical influence inspired the young Kate to teach herself to play the piano at the age of 11. She also played the organ in a barn behind her parents' house and studied the violin.&lt;ref name=Allmusicbio&gt;{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p3805|pure_url=yes}}|title=Allmusic Kate Bush Biography}}&lt;/ref&gt; She soon began writing her own tunes and eventually added [[lyrics]] to them.&lt;ref name=&quot;rebel&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last = Gaar|first = Gillian|title = She's a Rebel |year=1993 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Bush attended St Joseph's Convent Grammar School (later the St Joseph's campus of [[Bexley College]]) and a Catholic girls' school on Woolwich Road in [[Abbey Wood]], London, in the mid-1970s. During this time her family produced a demo tape with over 50 of her compositions, which was turned down by record labels. [[David Gilmour]] of [[Pink Floyd]] received the demo from Ricky Hopper, a mutual friend of Gilmour and the Bush family. Impressed with what he heard, Gilmour helped the sixteen-year-old Bush get a more professional-sounding demo tape recorded that would be more saleable to the record companies.&lt;ref name=&quot;NStatesman&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last = Cowley |first = Jason |title = The Wow Factor |work=The New Statesman|date=7 February 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tape was produced by Gilmour's friend [[Andrew Powell]], who would go on to produce Bush's first two albums,&lt;ref name=&quot;rebel&quot;/&gt; and sound engineer [[Geoff Emerick]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=The Rightful Heir?| work=Q Magazine #48 |date=September 1990 |accessdate=2011-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tape was sent to [[EMI]] executive Terry Slater.&lt;ref name=Soundscape/&gt; Slater was impressed by the tape and signed her.&lt;ref name=&quot;EMI&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title = Kate Bush |publisher=EMI|url = http://www.emi-premier.co.uk/loader.html |accessdate = 3 April 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The British record industry was reaching a point of stagnation.&lt;ref name=Soundscape&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.icce.rug.nl/~soundscapes/DATABASES/TRA/Kate_Bush.shtml |title=Kate Bush: Enigmatic chanteuse as pop pioneer |last=Kruse |first=Holly |year=2000 |month=November |journal=Soundscapes.info, Online Journal on Media Culture|volume=3 |issn=1567-7745 |accessdate=7 May 2009  }}, Originally published in {{cite journal|title=Tracking: Popular Music Studies |year=1988|volume=1 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Progressive rock]] was very popular and visually oriented rock performers were growing in popularity, thus record labels looking for the next big thing were considering experimental acts.&lt;ref name=Soundscape/&gt;

Bush was put on retainer for two years by Bob Mercer, managing director of EMI group-repertoire division. According to Mercer he felt Bush's material was good enough to be released but felt that if the album failed it would be demoralizing and if it was successful Bush was too young to handle it.&lt;ref name=Mercer&gt;[http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=UyFOAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=QRMEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6211,4646428&amp;dq=kate-bush&amp;hl=en Kate Bush: hot new act fuses music, theater Rolling Stone reprinted by Wilmingtom Morning Star 21 September 1979]. News.google.com (1979-09-21). Retrieved on 2011-08-01.&lt;/ref&gt;  For the first two years of her contract, Bush spent more time on school work than making an album. She left school after doing her mock [[Advanced Level (UK)|A-levels]] and having gained ten GCE [[O-Level]] qualifications.&lt;ref name=&quot;MightyB&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last = Williamson |first = Nigel |title = The Mighty Bush |work=Scotland on Sunday|date=2 October 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, Bush stated in an interview with [[Mark Radcliffe]] on [[BBC Radio 2]] that she believed EMI signed her before she was ready to make an album so that no other record company could offer her a contract. After the contract signing, EMI forwarded her a sizeable advance which she used to enrol in [[interpretive dance]] classes taught by [[Lindsay Kemp]], a former teacher of [[David Bowie]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Today's Style And Looks&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title = Today's Style And Looks |work=Face &amp; Figure  |year=1979 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and mime training with [[Adam Darius]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Adam Darius|Darius, A]]. (1984) ''The Adam Darius Method'', page 236-240. Latonia. ISBN 0-9502707-2-5 [http://www.mimecentre.com/ Mime Centre]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bush also wrote and made demos of close to 200 songs, a few of which today can be found on bootleg recordings and are known as the ''[[Phoenix Recordings]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Demos: The Phoenix recordings |publisher=Last.fm|url = http://www.last.fm/music/Kate+Bush/Demos%253A+The+Phoenix+recordings+%252F+Studio+Sessions |accessdate = 3 April 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; From March to August 1977, she fronted the KT Bush Band at public houses around London – specifically at the Rose of Lee public house (now Dirty South) in Lewisham. The other three band members were [[Del Palmer]] (bass), Brian Bath (guitar), and Vic King (drums). She began recording her first album in August 1977,&lt;ref name=&quot;rebel&quot;/&gt; although two tracks had been recorded during the summer of 1975.

===''The Kick Inside'' and ''Lionheart''===

As part of her preparation for entering the studio, Bush toured pubs with the KT Bush Band. However, for her debut album ''[[The Kick Inside]]'' (1978) she was persuaded to use established session musicians, some of whom she would retain even after she had brought her bandmates back on board.&lt;ref name=&quot;lyricsystem.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title = Kate Bush Biography |publisher=Lyricsystem.com|url = http://www.lyricsystem.com/kate-bush/ |accessdate = 22 April 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her brother Paddy played the harmonica and mandolin, unlike on later albums where he would play more exotic instruments such as the [[balalaika]] and [[didgeridoo]]. [[Stuart Elliott (drummer)|Stuart Elliott]] played some of the drums and would become her main percussionist on subsequent albums.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lyricbooks&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title = Lyrics booklets from Kate Bush's albums|publisher=EMI }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bush released ''The Kick Inside'' when she was 19 years old, but some of the songs had been written when she was as young as 13. EMI originally wanted the more rock-oriented track &quot;James and the Cold Gun&quot; to be her debut single, but Bush insisted that it should be &quot;[[Wuthering Heights (song)|Wuthering Heights]]&quot;. Even at this early stage of her career, she had gained a reputation for her determination to have a say in decisions affecting her work.&lt;ref name=&quot;rebel&quot;/&gt; &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; topped the UK and Australian charts and became an international hit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theofficialcharts.com/artist/_/kate%20bush/#singles |title=Kate Bush in the UK singles charts |work=The Official Charts |accessdate=21-1-2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bush became the first woman to reach number one in the UK charts with a self-penned song.&lt;ref name=&quot;GuardianProfile&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last = Barkham |first = Patrick|title = Guardian profile: Kate Bush|url = http://arts.guardian.co.uk/features/story/0,,1581815,00.html|work=The Guardian|date=30 September 2005|accessdate = 10 September 2007|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second single, &quot;The Man with the Child in His Eyes&quot;, reached number six in the UK charts.&lt;ref name=&quot;songfacts.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title = The Man with the Child in His Eyes |publisher=Songfacts.com|url = http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=4831 |accessdate = 22 April 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It also made it onto the American [[Billboard Hot 100]] where it reached number 85 in early 1979. Bob Mercer felt that Bush's relative lack of success in the United States compared to the rest of the world was due to her music being a poor fit for American radio formats and that there were no outlets for the visual presentation central to Bush's appeal.&lt;ref name=Mercer/&gt; &quot;The Man with the Child in His Eyes&quot; went on to win her an [[Ivor Novello Award]] in 1979 for Outstanding British Lyric.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = Awards Database|publisher=The Envelope|url = http://theenvelope.latimes.com |accessdate = 3 April 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

EMI capitalised on Bush's appearance by promoting the album with a poster of her in a tight pink top that emphasised her breasts. In an interview with ''[[NME]]'' magazine in 1982, Bush criticised the marketing technique, stating: &quot;People weren't even generally aware that I wrote my own songs or played the piano. The media just promoted me as a female body. It's like I've had to prove that I'm an artist in a female body.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;rebel&quot;/&gt; In late 1978, EMI persuaded Bush to quickly record a follow-up album, ''[[Lionheart (Kate Bush album)|Lionheart]]'', to take advantage of the success of ''The Kick Inside''. Bush has often expressed dissatisfaction with ''Lionheart'', feeling that she had needed more time to get it right. The album was produced by Andrew Powell, assisted by Bush. While it had spawned several hit singles, most notably &quot;[[Wow (Kate Bush song)|Wow]]&quot;, it did not garner the same reception as her first album, reaching number six in the UK album charts.&lt;ref name=&quot;WholeStory&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title = The Whole Story album lyrics booklet |publisher=EMI |year=1986  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bush was displeased with being rushed into making the second album. She set up her own publishing company, Kate Bush Music, and her own management company, Novercia, to maintain complete control over her work. Bush herself, along with members of her family, comprised the company's board of directors.&lt;ref name=&quot;rebel&quot;/&gt; Following the album's release, she was required by EMI to undertake heavy promotional work and an exhausting tour, the only one of her career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Stand By Your Mantra |work=Classic Rock |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tour, named [[The Tour of Life]], began in April 1979 and lasted six weeks. This live show was co-devised and performed on stage with magician [[Simon Drake]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.magicweek.co.uk/magic_profiles/magicprofile_0001_simon_drake.htm|title=Simon Drake – The Illusionist|year=2000|publisher=magicweek.co.uk|accessdate=15 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typical of her determination to have control, she was involved in every aspect of the show's production, choreography, set design, and staff recruitment.&lt;ref name=&quot;rebel&quot;/&gt; The shows were noted for her dancing, complex lighting and her 17 costume changes per show. Because of her intention to dance as she sang, her sound engineers used a wire coat hanger and a [[Wireless microphone|radio microphone]] to fashion the first headset mic to be used by a rock performer since the Swedish group [[Spotnicks]] used a very primitive version in the early 1960s.&lt;ref name=Allmusicbio/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Badhorn|first=Philippe|title=Interview in Rolling Stone (France)|work=Rolling Stone |date=February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Released in September 1980, ''[[Never for Ever]]'' saw Bush's second foray into production, co-producing with Jon Kelly. Her first time as a producer was on her ''[[On Stage (EP)|Live On Stage]]'' [[Extended play|EP]], released after her tour the previous year. The first two albums had resulted in a definitive sound evident in every track, with orchestral arrangements supporting the live band sound. The range of styles on ''Never for Ever'' is much more diverse, veering from the straightforward rocker &quot;Violin&quot; to the wistful waltz of hit single &quot;[[Army Dreamers]]&quot;. ''Never for Ever'' was the first Kate Bush album to feature synthesisers and drum machines, in particular the [[Fairlight CMI]], to which she was introduced when providing backing vocals on [[Peter Gabriel]]'s [[eponymous]] [[Peter Gabriel (1980 album)|third album]] in early 1980.&lt;ref name=&quot;rebel&quot;/&gt; It was her first record to reach the top position in the UK album charts, also making her the first female British artist to achieve that status,&lt;ref name=&quot;MightyB&quot;/&gt; and the first female artist ever to enter the album chart at the top.&lt;ref name=&quot;chartstats.com&quot;/&gt; The top-selling single from the album was &quot;[[Babooshka (song)|Babooshka]]&quot;, which reached number five in the UK singles chart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |title = Kate Bush|publisher=UnderGroundOnline|url = http://www.ugo.com/channels/music/features/bandsondemand/artist.aspx?artist=katebush&amp;cat=Alternative&amp;full=Kate%20Bush |accessdate = 27 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1980, she released the [[Christmas music|Christmas single]] &quot;[[December Will Be Magic Again]]&quot;, which reached number 29 in the UK charts.

September 1982 saw the release of ''[[The Dreaming (album)|The Dreaming]]'', the first album Bush produced by herself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |title = Something from Kate, at last| publisher=''The Age''| url = http://www.theage.com.au/news/music/something-from-kate/2005/10/06/1128562936076.html?page=3| date = 8 October 2005 |accessdate = 21 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also a major departure for Bush, being initially composed on the Fairlight CMI rather than piano, with songs extensively revised and rebuilt in the studio, rather than merely arranged there.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} With her new-found freedom, she experimented with production techniques, creating an album that features a diverse blend of musical styles and is known for its near-exhaustive use of the Fairlight CMI. ''The Dreaming'' received a mixed critical reception in the UK at first. Many were baffled by the dense soundscapes Bush had created, and some critics accused the album of being over-produced.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} In a 1993 interview with ''[[Q magazine|Q]]'', Bush stated: &quot;That was my 'She's gone mad' album.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;rebel&quot;/&gt; However, the album was hailed as a &quot;masterpiece&quot; and a &quot;musical ''tour-de-force''&quot; by critics in America, and the album became her first to enter the US charts, albeit only reaching number 157.&lt;ref name=&quot;rebel&quot;/&gt; The album entered the UK album chart at number three, but is to date her lowest-selling album, garnering only a gold disc.

&quot;[[Sat in Your Lap]]&quot; was the first single from the album to be released. It pre-dated the album by over a year and peaked at number 11 in the UK.&lt;ref name=OfficialCharts&gt;{{cite web  |title =  Kate Bush| publisher=TheOfficialCharts.com|url = http://www.theofficialcharts.com/artist/_/kate%20bush/|accessdate = 21 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The album's [[The Dreaming (song)|title track]], featuring the talents of [[Rolf Harris]] and [[Percy Edwards]], stalled at number 48, while the third single, &quot;[[There Goes a Tenner]]&quot;, failed to chart, despite promotion from EMI and Bush. The track &quot;[[Suspended in Gaffa]]&quot; was released as a single in Europe, but not in the UK.

Continuing in her storytelling tradition, Bush looked far outside her own personal experience for sources of inspiration. She drew on old crime films for &quot;There Goes a Tenner&quot;, a documentary about the [[Vietnam war|war in Vietnam]] for &quot;Pull Out the Pin&quot;, and the plight of [[Indigenous Australians]] for &quot;The Dreaming&quot;. &quot;Houdini&quot; is about [[Harry Houdini|the magician]]'s death, and &quot;Get Out Of My House&quot; was inspired by [[Stephen King]]'s novel ''[[The Shining (novel)|The Shining]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Dreamtime Is Over |author=Simper, Paul |work=Melody Maker |date=16 October 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Hounds of Love]]'' was released in 1985. Because of the high cost of hiring studio space for her previous album, she built a private studio near her home, where she could work at her own pace.&lt;ref name=&quot;comeback&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last = Ellen| first =Barbara| title = Comeback Kate|work=The Observer| url = http://arts.guardian.co.uk/features/story/0,,1582789,00.html|date =2 October 2005| accessdate = 4 April 2007|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Hounds of Love'' ultimately topped the charts in the UK, knocking [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s ''[[Like a Virgin]]'' from the number one position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Fitzgerald Morris |first = Peter |title = Hounds of Love lyrics booklet  |publisher=EMI |year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The album takes advantage of the vinyl format with two very different sides. The first side, ''Hounds of Love'', contains five &quot;accessible&quot; pop songs, including the four singles &quot;[[Running Up that Hill]]&quot;, &quot;[[Cloudbusting]]&quot;, &quot;[[Hounds of Love (song)|Hounds of Love]]&quot;, and [[The Big Sky (song)|&quot;The Big Sky&quot;]]. In August 1985, ''NME'' featured Bush in a &quot;Where Are They Now&quot; article. &quot;Running Up that Hill&quot; reached number&amp;nbsp;3 in the UK charts and also re-introduced Bush to American listeners, climbing to number&amp;nbsp;30 on the Billboard Hot 100 in November 1985. The second side of the album, ''The Ninth Wave'', takes its name from [[Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson|Tennyson's]] poem, &quot;Idylls of the King&quot;, about the legendary King Arthur's reign, and is one continuous piece of music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Kate Bush radio interview|publisher=Rock Over London with Paul Cooke  |year=1985 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The album earned Bush nominations for Best Female Solo Artist, Best Album, Best Single, and Best Producer at the 1986 [[BRIT Awards]]. In the same year, Bush and [[Peter Gabriel]] had a UK top ten hit with &quot;[[Don't Give Up (Peter Gabriel and Kate Bush song)|Don't Give Up]]&quot; ([[Dolly Parton]], Gabriel's original choice, turned his offer down),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/peter-gabriel/59311 |title=Peter Gabriel: 'Kate Bush replaced Dolly Parton on 'Don't Give Up'&amp;#39; NME 19 September 2011 |publisher=Nme.com |date=19 September 2011 |accessdate=2012-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and EMI released her &quot;greatest hits&quot; album, ''[[The Whole Story]]''. Bush provided a new lead vocal and refreshed backing track on &quot;Wuthering Heights,&quot; and recorded a new single, &quot;Experiment IV,&quot; for inclusion on the compilation. At the 1987 BRIT Awards, Bush won the award for Best Female Solo Artist.

===''The Sensual World'' and ''The Red Shoes''===
The increasingly personal tone of her writing continued on 1989's ''[[The Sensual World]]'', with songs about unexpressed and unrequited love (&quot;Love and Anger&quot; and &quot;Never Be Mine&quot;, respectively), and the pressures on modern relationships (&quot;Between a Man and a Woman&quot;).{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} One of the quirkiest tracks on the album, touched by Bush's [[black humour]], is &quot;Heads We're Dancing&quot;, about a woman who dances all night with a charming stranger only to discover in the morning that he is [[Adolf Hitler]].&lt;ref name=Telegraphdream/&gt; The [[The Sensual World (song)|title track]] drew its inspiration from [[James Joyce]]'s novel ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]''.&lt;ref name=Telegraphdream&gt;{{cite web |title = Kate Bush's dream world|publisher=''The Telegraph''|url = http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=2fYlAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=TfwFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7016,7079481&amp;dq=hitler+heads-we-re-dancing+kate-bush&amp;hl=en|date = 26 November 1989|accessdate = 21 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Sensual World'' went on to become her biggest-selling album in the US, receiving an RIAA Gold certification four years after its release for 500,000&amp;nbsp;copies sold.

In 1990, the boxed-set ''[[This Woman's Work (box set)|This Woman's Work]]'' was released and included all of her albums with their original cover art, as well as two discs of all single B sides recorded from 1978–1990. In 1991, Bush released a cover of Elton John's &quot;[[Rocket Man (song)|Rocket Man]]&quot;, which reached number&amp;nbsp;12 in the UK singles chart&lt;ref name=&quot;everyhit&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title =UK Top 40 Hit Database|publisher=EveryHit.com|url = http://www.everyhit.com/|accessdate =15 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2007, was voted the greatest cover ever by readers of ''[[The Observer]]'' newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/omm/ttremastered/story/0,,2166706,00.html|work=The Observer|title = The top 50 greatest covers as voted by you|accessdate = 26 October 2007|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; She recorded &quot;Candle in the Wind&quot;, as the single's b-side.&lt;ref name=&quot;TheGreatRockDiscographyPage218&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=The Great Rock Discography |last=Strong |first=Martin|year=1994 |publisher=Cannongate |isbn=1-84195-615-5 |page=218}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Red Shoes (album)|The Red Shoes]]'' was released in November 1993. ''The Red Shoes'' features more high-profile cameo appearances than Bush's previous efforts, including contributions from composer and conductor [[Michael Kamen]]. Comedian [[Lenny Henry]], [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], [[Eric Clapton]], [[Gary Brooker]] of [[Procol Harum]], Trevor Whittaker, and [[Jeff Beck]] also contributed to the album. Both &quot;The Sensual World&quot; and &quot;The Red Shoes&quot; featured contributions from [[Trio Bulgarka]], a trio of women who sang on several tracks, including &quot;You're The One&quot; and &quot;Rocket's Tail.&quot; The album gave Bush her highest chart position in the US, reaching number&amp;nbsp;28, although the only song from the album to make the US singles chart was &quot;Rubberband Girl&quot;, which peaked at number&amp;nbsp;88 in January 1994. In the UK, the album reached number two, and the singles &quot;Rubberband Girl&quot;, &quot;The Red Shoes&quot;, &quot;Moments of Pleasure&quot;, and &quot;And So Is Love&quot; all reached the top&amp;nbsp;30.&lt;ref name=OfficialCharts/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;softpedia.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title = Back On Stage After 12 Years |publisher=Softpedia.com|url = http://news.softpedia.com/news/Kate-Bush-Back-On-Stage-After-12-Years-7653.shtml |accessdate = 23 April 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, the [[short film]] ''[[The Line, the Cross &amp; the Curve]]'', written and directed by Bush, and starring Bush and English actress [[Miranda Richardson]],&lt;ref name=&quot;lineamazon&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title = The Line, The Cross &amp; The Curve  |publisher=Amazon.co.uk|url = http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00003JA23 |accessdate = 23 April 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; used six of the songs on the album.

The initial plan had been to take the songs out on the road (though a new tour did not transpire), so Bush deliberately aimed for a live-band feel, with less of the studio trickery that had typified her last three albums and that would be difficult to recreate on stage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Future&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title = Well red |work=Future Music  |date=November 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result alienated some of her fan base, who enjoyed the intricacy of her earlier compositions,&lt;ref name=&quot;Orlando&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last = Gettelman|first = Parry|title = The Red Shoes review |work=The Orlando Sentinel  |year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; but others found a new complexity in the lyrics and the emotions they expressed.&lt;ref name=&quot;request&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title = The Red Shoes review |work=Request |date=November 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was a troubled time for Bush. She had suffered a series of bereavements, including the loss of guitarist [[Alan Murphy]], who had started working with her on The Tour Of Life in 1979, and her mother Hannah, to whom she was exceptionally close.&lt;ref name=&quot;MightyB&quot;/&gt; Many of the people she lost are honoured in the ballad &quot;Moments of Pleasure&quot;. However, Bush's mother was still alive when &quot;Moments of Pleasure&quot; was written and recorded. Bush describes playing the song to her mother, who thought the line where she is quoted by Bush as saying &quot;Every old sock meets an old shoe&quot;, was hilarious and &quot;couldn't stop laughing&quot;.&lt;ref name=Home&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview with Ken Bruce on Radio 2 09 May 2011|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00gtnyf|work=Radio 2|accessdate=9 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the release of ''The Red Shoes'', Bush dropped out of the public eye for many years, although her name occasionally cropped up in the media with rumours of a new album release. Bush had originally intended to take one year off but despite working on material 12 years would pass before her next album release.&lt;ref name=Gap&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1165471/The-day-I-said-sorry-Kylie-pop-star-encounters-diary-DJ-Mark-Radcliffe.html|title=The day I said sorry to Kylie, and other pop star encounters from the diary of DJ Mark Radcliffe Daily Mail 28 March 2009|location=London|date=28 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The press often viewed her as an eccentric recluse, sometimes drawing a comparison with [[Miss Havisham]] from [[Charles Dickens]]'s ''[[Great Expectations]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;GuardianProfile&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last = Barkham|first = Patrick|title = Guardian profile: Kate Bush|work=The Guardian| date=28 September 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In reality, she was trying to give her young son a normal childhood, and needed a quiet place for her creative process to function.&lt;ref name=Gap/&gt; In 1998, Bush had given birth to Albert, known as &quot;Bertie&quot;, fathered by her guitarist and now-husband Danny McIntosh.&lt;ref name=&quot;MightyB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;EveningStandard&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Kate Bush and the war of Wuthering Heights|work=[[The Evening Standard]]|date = 5 May 2007|url= http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/article-23395189-details/Kate+Bush+and+the+war+of+Wuthering+Heights/article.do |accessdate=8 May 2007|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070509043901/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/article-23395189-details/Kate+Bush+and+the+war+of+Wuthering+Heights/article.do &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt;|archivedate=9 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; After living for many years on Court Road, Eltham, southeast London, the couple and their son moved away from the city and currently have two homes: a £2.5&amp;nbsp;million house in [[East Portlemouth]] on the [[Devon]] coast&lt;ref name=&quot;EveningStandard&quot;/&gt; and a mansion on an islet on the [[Kennet and Avon canal]] at [[Sulhamstead]] in [[West Berkshire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=£100K BILL FOR KATE|work=[[The Sunday Mirror]]|url= http://www.sundaymirror.co.uk/news/sunday/tm_method=full%26objectid=18238674%26siteid=98487-name_page.html|accessdate=19 January 2007}} {{Dead link|date=March 2012|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bush's eighth studio album, ''[[Aerial (album)|Aerial]]'', was released on double CD and vinyl in November 2005.&lt;ref name=&quot;MightyB&quot;/&gt; The first single from the album was &quot;[[King of the Mountain (song)|King of the Mountain]]&quot;, which was played for the first time on [[BBC Radio 2]] on 21 September 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last = McKenna|first = Stephen| title = Kate Bush back on form with first single in 12 years|url= http://icscotland.icnetwork.co.uk/whatson/whatson2/tm_objectid=16160326&amp;method=full&amp;siteid=50141&amp;headline=kate-bush-back-on-form-with-first-single-in-12-years-name_page.html|publisher=icScotland.com| date= 2 September 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As on ''Hounds of Love'' (1985), the album is divided into two sections, each with its own theme and mood.&lt;ref name=&quot;pi&quot;/&gt; The first disc, subtitled ''A Sea of Honey'', features a set of unrelated themed songs, including &quot;King of the Mountain&quot;; &quot;Bertie&quot;, a Renaissance-style ode to her son; and &quot;Joanni&quot;, based on the story of [[St. Joan of Arc|Joan of Arc]]. In the song &quot;π&quot;, Bush sings [[Pi|the number Pi]] to 115 decimal places.&lt;ref name=&quot;pi&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BThompson&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last =Thompson| first =Ben| title = Ben Thompson reviews an album of two halves |work=Sunday Telegraph|date = 5 November 2006  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The second disc, subtitled ''A Sky of Honey'', features one continuous piece of music describing the experience of being outdoors after waking at dawn, moving through afternoon, dusk, to night, then back to the following dawn of single summer's day. All the pieces in this suite refer or allude to sky and sea in their lyrical content. Bush mixed her voice with cooing wood pigeons to repeat the phrases &quot;A sea of honey, a sky of honey,&quot; and &quot;You're full of beauty&quot; throughout the piece, and uses recordings of actual birdsong throughout. ''A Sky of Honey'' features [[Rolf Harris]] playing the [[didgeridoo]] on one track, and providing vocals on &quot;The Painter's Link&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last =Thrills| first =Adrian| title = Is this great Kate—or just Pi in the sky? |work=Daily Mail |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-138325566.html| date = 4 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other artists making guest appearances on the album include [[Peter Erskine]], [[Eberhard Weber]], [[Lol Creme]], and Gary Brooker.

===''Director's Cut'' and ''50 Words for Snow''===
On 16 May 2011, Bush released the album ''[[Director's Cut (Kate Bush album)|Director's Cut]]''.  The album, which Bush has described as an entirely new project rather than a collection of mere remixes, contains 11 tracks of substantially reworked material from her earlier albums ''[[The Sensual World]]'' and ''[[The Red Shoes (album)|The Red Shoes]]'', all of which have been recorded using analogue, rather than digital, equipment to create &quot;a warmer sound&quot;. All the tracks have new lead vocals, new drums, and radically reworked instrumentation. Some of them have been transposed to a lower key to accommodate her lowering voice. Three of the songs, including &quot;This Woman's Work&quot;, have been completely re-recorded, with lyrics often changed in places.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b010vxyv/Front_Row_Kate_Bush_in_a_rare_interview_and_John_Cleese_reviewed/ BBC iPlayer – Front Row: Kate Bush in a rare interview; and John Cleese reviewed].

The song &quot;The Sensual World&quot; has been renamed &quot;Flower of the Mountain&quot; and contains a passage of [[Molly Bloom]]'s famous soliloquy from [[James Joyce]]'s novel ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]''. Bush said, &quot;Originally when I wrote the song &quot;The Sensual World&quot;, I had used text from the end of Ulysses. When I asked for permission to use the text I was refused, which was disappointing. I then wrote my own lyrics for the song, although I felt that the original idea had been more interesting. Well, I'm not James Joyce am I? When I came to work on this project I thought I would ask for permission again and this time they said yes.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2011/apr/05/kate-bush-new-album-james-joyce Kate Bush reveals guest lyricist on new album – James Joyce].

==Musical style==
Bush's music is eclectic, using various styles of music even within the same album. Her songs have spanned genres as diverse as rock, pop, [[alternative rock|alternative]] and [[art rock]].&lt;ref name=Allmusicbio/&gt; Even in her earliest works where the piano was a primary instrument, she wove together many diverse influences, melding [[European classical music|classical music]], rock, and a wide range of ethnic and folk sources, and this has continued throughout her career.

In an interview with ''[[Melody Maker]]'' magazine in 1977, she revealed that male artists had more influence on her work than females, stating: &quot;Every female you see at a piano is either [[Lynsey De Paul]], or [[Carole King]]. And most male music—not all of it but the good stuff—really lays it on you. It really puts you against the wall and that's what I like to do. I'd like my music to intrude. Not many females succeed with that.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;rebel&quot;/&gt;

The experimental nature of her music has led it to be described as a later, more technological, and more accessible manifestation of the British [[progressive rock]] movement.&lt;ref name=&quot;Englishness&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Soundscape/&gt; Southern England was the home to the most influential and successful acts of the progressive rock movement and,&lt;ref name=&quot;Englishness&quot;/&gt; like other artists in this genre, Bush rejects the classic American style of making pop music, which was adopted by most UK pop artists. Bush's vocals contain elements of British, [[Anglo-Irish]] and most prominently (southern) English accents and, in its utilization of musical instruments from many periods and cultures, her music has differed from American pop norms.&lt;ref name=&quot;Englishness&quot;/&gt; Elements of Bush's lyrics tend to be more unusual and less clichéd than American-style pop lyrics, often employing historical or literary references and avoiding autobiographical lyrics. She considers herself a storyteller who embodies the character singing the song and strenuously rejects efforts by others to insist that her songs are autobiographical.&lt;ref name=&quot;Englishness&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last =Moy|first =Ron| title = Kate Bush and mythologies of Englishness|publisher=Popular Musicology Online| url = http://www.popular-musicology-online.com/issues/02/moy-01.html| year =2006| accessdate = 6 April 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Radio4052011&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-13281337 Kate Bush admits frustration over time between albums].

I. Gurdjieff]] in &quot;Them Heavy People&quot;, while &quot;Deeper Understanding&quot;, from ''The Sensual World'', portrays a person who stays indoors, obsessively talking to a computer and shunning human contact.

Comedy is also a big influence on her and is a significant component of her work. She has cited [[Woody Allen]],&lt;ref name=&quot;realm&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Brown |first=Len |title=In the Realm of the Senses |work=New Musical Express |date=7 October 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Monty Python]]'', ''[[Fawlty Towers]]'', and ''[[The Young Ones (TV series)|The Young Ones]]''&lt;ref name=&quot;littlemiss&quot;/&gt; as particular favourites. Horror movies are another interest of Bush's and have influenced the [[gothic rock|gothic]] nature of several of her songs, such as &quot;Hounds of Love&quot;, inspired by the 1957 horror movie ''[[Night of the Demon]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Qsleeve&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Sutcliffe |first=Phil |title=Hounds of Love Sleeve Notes |work=Q magazine |date=June 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her songs have occasionally combined comedy and horror to form dark humour, such as murder by poisoning in &quot;Coffee Homeground&quot;, an alcoholic mother in &quot;Ran Tan Waltz&quot; and the upbeat &quot;The Wedding List&quot;, a song inspired by [[François Truffaut]]'s 1967 film of Cornell Woolrich's ''[[The Bride Wore Black]]'' about the death of a groom and the bride's subsequent revenge against the killer.&lt;ref name=kbwl&gt;{{cite journal |author=Irwin, Colin |title=Paranoia and Passion of the Kate Inside |work=Melody Maker |date= 10 October 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Length of time between albums and perception of perfectionism ==
The length of time in between album releases has led to rumours in the media concerning her health or appearance.&lt;ref name=&quot;littlemiss&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title = Little Miss Can't Be Wrong |work=Q magazine |date=December 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the past, stories of weight gain or mental instability have been disproved by Bush's periodic reappearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ziegler|first=Mollie|title=The Return of a Sultry Songstress |work=The New York Sun|date=8 November 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 Bush told [[BBC Radio 4]] that the amount of time between album releases is extremely stressful noting: &quot;It's very frustrating the albums take as long as they do...I wish there weren't such big gaps between them.&quot; In the same interview Bush denied she was a perfectionist in the studio, saying: &quot;I think it's important that things are flawed...That's what makes a piece of art interesting sometimes – the bit that's wrong or the mistake you've made that's led onto an idea you wouldn't have had otherwise,&quot; and reiterated her prioritisation of her family life.&lt;ref name=&quot;Radio4052011&quot;/&gt;

==Live performances==
{{See|The Tour of Life}}
Bush's only tour took place 2 April – 13 May 1979, after which she gave only the occasional live performance. Several reasons have been suggested as to why she abandoned touring, among them her reputed need to be in total control of the final product, which is incompatible with live stage performance, a rumour of a crippling fear of flying,&lt;ref name=&quot;Network&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last = Littlejohn|first = Maureen |title = The Sensual Woman |work=Network  |date=March 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the suggestion that the death of 21-year-old Bill Duffield severely affected her. Duffield, her lighting director, was killed in an accident during her 2 April 1979 concert at Poole Arts Centre. Bush held a benefit concert on 12 May 1979, with [[Peter Gabriel]] and [[Steve Harley]] at London's [[Hammersmith Apollo|Hammersmith Odeon]] for his family. Duffield would be honoured in two later songs: &quot;Blow Away&quot; on ''Never for Ever'' and &quot;Moments of Pleasure&quot; on ''The Red Shoes''. Bush explained in a [[BBC Radio 2]] interview with [[Mark Radcliffe]] that she actually enjoyed the tour but was consumed with producing her subsequent records. A BBC film crew followed the preperation for the tour which was shown on the BBC Nationwide program as a 30 minute special.

During the same period as her tour, she made numerous television appearances around the world, including ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' in the United Kingdom, ''Bios Bahnhof'' in Germany, and ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' in the United States (with [[Paul Shaffer]] on piano).&lt;ref name=&quot;smiles&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last = Gambaccini|first =Paul| title = Kate Bush Smiles in Her New Red Shoes|work=New York Press|   date =24 November 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 December 1979, BBC TV aired the ''Kate Bush Christmas Special''. It was recorded in October 1979 at the BBC Studios in Birmingham, England; choreography by [[Anthony Van Laast]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1427061/fullcredits#cast &quot;Kate Bush Christmas Special&quot;] Cast and Crew at IMDb&lt;/ref&gt; As well as playing songs from her first two albums, she played &quot;[[December Will Be Magic Again]]&quot;, and &quot;Violin&quot; from her forthcoming album, ''Never for Ever''. Peter Gabriel made a guest appearance to play &quot;Here Comes the Flood&quot;, and a duet of [[Roy Harper]]'s &quot;Another Day&quot; with Bush.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC Christmas Special 1979&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title = Kate Bush – BBC Christmas Special 1979|url =http://gaffa.org/passing/v79_dec.html| accessdate = 6 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Tour of Life Bush desired to make two more albums before touring again. At that point she got involved with production techniques and sound experimentation that took up a lot of time and prevented her from touring. Later on there were a couple of instances where she came close to touring again.&lt;ref name=ClassicRockMagazine&gt;Kate Bush The reclusive first lady of art rock: when she's not admiring John Lydon, she's pestering the Queen Classic Rock Magazine Issue 160&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, Bush participated in the first benefit concert in aid of [[The Prince's Trust]] alongside artists such as [[Madness (band)|Madness]], [[Midge Ure]], [[Phil Collins]], [[Mick Karn]] and [[Pete Townshend]]. On 25 April 1986 Bush performed live for British charity event [[Comic Relief]], singing &quot;Do Bears... ?&quot;, a humorous duet with [[Rowan Atkinson]], and a rendition of &quot;Breathing&quot;. Later in the year on 28 June 1986, she made a guest appearance to duet with Peter Gabriel on &quot;[[Don't Give Up (Peter Gabriel and Kate Bush song)|Don't Give Up]]&quot; at Earl's Court, London as part of his &quot;So&quot; tour. In March 1987, Bush sang &quot;Running Up that Hill&quot; at [[The Secret Policeman's Balls|The Secret Policeman's Third Ball]].

On 17 January 2002, Bush appeared with her long-time champion, [[David Gilmour]], singing the part of the doctor in &quot;[[Comfortably Numb]]&quot; at the [[Royal Festival Hall]] in London.

In 2011 Bush told [[Classic Rock Magazine]] &quot;I do hope that some time I get a chance to do some shows. Maybe not a tour, but something&quot;&lt;ref name=ClassicRockMagazine/&gt;

==Video projects==
In 1979 Bush's one live show, [[The Tour of Life]], was recorded for the BBC and for release on VHS as ''Kate Bush Live at Hammersmith Odeon''.&lt;ref name=&quot;allmusicDVDs&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/kate-bush-p3805/discography/dvds-videos |title=Kate Bush DVDs &amp; Videos |publisher=allmusic.com |accessdate=2011-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bush has appeared in innovative music videos designed to accompany her singles releases. Among the best known are those for &quot;Running Up that Hill&quot;, &quot;Babooshka&quot;, &quot;Breathing&quot;, &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;, and &quot;The Man with the Child in His Eyes&quot;, and &quot;Cloudbusting&quot;, featuring actor [[Donald Sutherland]], who made time during the filming of another project to take part in the video.&lt;ref name=&quot;CBAK&quot;&gt;{{cite news| title = Kate Bush radio interview|publisher=CBAK 4011 (Australia)|year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; EMI has released collections of her videos, including ''The Single File'', ''Hair of the Hound'', ''The Whole Story'', a career video overview released in conjunction with the 1986 compilation album of the same title,&lt;ref name=&quot;allmusicDVDs&quot; /&gt; and ''The Sensual World''.

In 1993, she directed and starred in the short film, ''[[The Line, the Cross &amp; the Curve]]'', a musical co-starring Miranda Richardson, featuring music from Bush's album ''The Red Shoes'', which was inspired by the classic movie [[The Red Shoes (1948 film)|of the same name]]. It was released on VHS in the UK in 1994 and also received a small number of cinema screenings around the world. In recent interviews, Bush has said that she considers it a failure, and stated in 2001: &quot;I'm very pleased with four minutes of it, but I'm very disappointed with the rest.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Aizlewood, John |title = The Big Sleep |work=Q magazine |date = December 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2005 interview, she described the film as &quot;A load of bollocks.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Mojo Magazine, page 81, October 2005 edition&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, Bush provided the music used in a series of [[psychedelic]]-themed television commercials for the soft drink [[Fruitopia]] that appeared in the United States. The same company aired the ads in the United Kingdom, but the British version featured [[Elizabeth Fraser]] of [[Cocteau Twins]] instead of Bush.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cocteau&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title = Cocteau Twins Discography|publisher=CocteauTwins.org| url = http://www.cocteautwins.org/~leesa/cocteautwins/cHTML/html/soundtracks.html |accessdate= 4 April 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2006, a [[DVD documentary]] titled ''Kate Bush Under Review'' was released by Sexy Intellectual, which included archival interviews with Bush, along with interviews with a selection of music historians and journalists (including Phil Sutcliffe, [[Nigel Williamson]], and [[Morris Pert]]). The DVD also includes clips from several of Bush's music videos.&lt;ref name=&quot;underreview&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title = Kate Bush – Under Review|publisher=Amazon.com|url = http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000EXZHPQ/| accessdate = 4 April 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 December 2008, the DVD collection of the fourth season of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', including her performances, was released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Saturday-Night-Live-Season-4/10468|title=Saturday Night Live: Universal announces The complete 4th season TVonDVD.com 5 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; A three DVD set of [[The Secret Policeman's Balls]] benefit concerts that includes Bush's performance was released on 27 January 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://homemediamagazine.com/tv-dvd/unveiling-britains-secret-14017|title=Unveiling Britain's 'Secret' Home Media Magazine 5 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Bush has released four short videos for the album ''[[50 Words for Snow]]''. One is an advertisement for the album. Two stop-motion &quot;Animation Segments&quot; were posted on the Kate Bush Official website and YouTube, one to accompany a 2 minute 25 second section of &quot;Misty&quot;, called &quot;Mistraldespair&quot;, the other to accompany a 2 minute 33 second section of &quot;[[Wild Man]]&quot;. &quot;Mistraldespair&quot; was directed by Bush and animated by Gary Pureton,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.katebush.com/news/mistraldespair-animation &quot;Mistraldespair Animation Segment&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; while the &quot;Wild Man&quot; segment was created by Finn and Patrick at Brandt Animation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.katebush.com/news/wild-man-animation &quot;Wild Man&quot; Animation Segment.&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 January 2012, a third piece called &quot;Eider Falls at Lake Tahoe&quot;, was premiered on her website and on YouTube. Running at 5:01, the piece is a black &amp; white shadow puppet animation. Directed by Bush and photographed by award-winning British cinematographer [[Roger Pratt (cinematographer) |Roger Pratt]], the shadow puppets were designed by Robert Allsopp.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.katebush.com/news/eider-falls-lake-tahoe-animation Credits for &quot;Eider Falls at Lake Tahoe&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Bush stated that &quot;Eider Falls at Lake Tahoe&quot; is intended to be a &quot;self contained piece&quot; separate from the song &quot;Lake Tahoe&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npr.org/blogs/allsongs/2012/01/24/145698181/first-watch-kate-bushs-shadow-play Kate Bush's Shadow Play NPR 24 January 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Movie projects==
In 1990, Bush starred in the [[black comedy]] film ''Les Dogs'', produced by ''[[The Comic Strip]]'' for [[BBC television]]. Aired on 8 March 1990, Bush plays the bride Angela at a wedding set in a post-apocalyptic version of Britain. While Bush's is a silent presence in a wedding dress throughout most of the film, she does have several lines of dialogue with [[Peter Richardson (actor)|Peter Richardson]] in two dream sequences. In another ''Comic Strip Presents'' film, ''GLC'', she produced the theme song &quot;Ken&quot;, which includes a vocal performance by Bush. The song was written about [[Ken Livingstone]], the leader of the [[Greater London Council]], who would later be elected as mayor of London and at the time was working with musicians to help the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] garner the youth vote.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thequietus.com/articles/04999-ken-livingstone-interview-music-politics Ken Livingstone Interviewed: Boris, The Other Boris, Music, Politics &amp; London]. The Quietus. 23 September 2010. Retrieved on 2011-08-01.&lt;/ref&gt;

She also produced all the incidental music, which is synthesiser based. Bush wrote and performed the song &quot;The Magician&quot;, in a fairground-like arrangement, for [[Menahem Golan]]'s 1979 film ''[[The Magician of Lublin (film)|The Magician of Lublin]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faqs.org/faqs/music/kate-bush-faq/ |title=FAQ: rec.music.gaffa – Love-Hounds – Kate Bush |publisher=Faqs.org |accessdate=29 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985, Bush contributed a darkly melancholic version of the [[Ary Barroso]] song &quot;[[Aquarela do Brasil|Brazil]]&quot; to the soundtrack of the Terry Gilliam film ''[[Brazil (film)|Brazil]]''. The track was scored and arranged by [[Michael Kamen]]. In 1986, she wrote and recorded &quot;Be Kind To My Mistakes&quot; for the Nicolas Roeg film ''[[Castaway (film)|Castaway]]''. An edited version of this track was used as the [[B side]] to her 1989 single &quot;[[This Woman's Work (song)|This Woman's Work]]&quot;. In 1988, the song &quot;This Woman's Work&quot; was featured in the John Hughes film ''[[She's Having a Baby]]'', and a slightly remixed version appeared on Bush's album ''The Sensual World''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Holmes |first=Linda |url=http://www.npr.org/blogs/monkeysee/2009/08/five_great_john_hughes_moments.html |title=Five Great John Hughes Moments National Public Radio (United States) 6 August 2009 |publisher=Npr.org |date=6 August 2009 |accessdate=29 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song has since appeared on numerous television shows, and in 2005 reached number eight on the UK download chart after featuring in a British television advertisement for the charity [[NSPCC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musicweek.com/story.asp?storyCode=16666&amp;sectioncode=1 |title=Eighties Kate Bush track goes Top 10 on download chart|publisher=Music Week|date=24 November 2005 |accessdate=21 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, Bush wrote and recorded a song for the Disney film ''[[Dinosaur (film)|Dinosaur]]'', but the track was ultimately not included on the soundtrack. According to the winter 1999 issue of ''HomeGround'', a Bush [[fanzine]], it was scrapped when Disney asked her to rewrite the song and she refused. Also in 1999, Bush's song &quot;The Sensual World&quot; was featured prominently in Canadian filmmaker [[Atom Egoyan]]'s film &quot;[[Felicia's Journey]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0165773/soundtrack &quot;Soundtracks for Felicia's Journey&quot;] at IMDb&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;The Man with the Child in His Eyes&quot; is on the soundtrack for the 2007 British [[romantic comedy]] film ''[[Starter for 10 (film)|Starter for 10]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cduniverse.com/search/xx/music/pid/7318125/a/Starter+For+Ten.htm |title=Starter For Ten Soundtrack CD |publisher=CD Universe |date=13 February 2007 |accessdate=29 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collaborations==
Bush provided vocals on two of Peter Gabriel's albums, including the hits &quot;[[Games Without Frontiers (song)|Games Without Frontiers]]&quot; and &quot;[[Don't Give Up (Peter Gabriel and Kate Bush song)|Don't Give Up]]&quot;, as well as &quot;[[No Self Control (Peter Gabriel song)|No Self-Control]]&quot;. Gabriel appeared on Bush's 1979 television special, where they sang a duet of [[Roy Harper]]'s &quot;Another Day&quot;. She has sung on two Roy Harper tracks, &quot;You&quot;, on his 1979 album, &quot;The Unknown Soldier&quot;, and &quot;Once&quot;, the title track of his 1990 album. She has also sung on the title song of the 1986 [[Big Country]] album ''[[The Seer (album)|The Seer]]'', the [[Midge Ure]] song &quot;Sister and Brother&quot; from his 1988 album ''Answers to Nothing'', [[Go West (band)|Go West]]'s 1987 single &quot;The King Is Dead&quot; and two songs with [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] – &quot;Why Should I Love You?&quot;, from her 1993 album ''The Red Shoes'', and in 1996, the song &quot;My Computer&quot; from Prince's album ''[[Emancipation (album)|Emancipation]]''. In 1987, she sang a verse on the charity single &quot;[[Let It Be (Ferry Aid song)|Let It Be]]&quot; by Ferry Aid. She sang a line on the charity single &quot;Spirit of the Forest&quot; by Spirit of the Forest in 1989. 1990 saw Kate producing, for the only time in her career, one song for another artist, [[Alan Stivell]]'s &quot;Kimiad&quot;, on his album ''Again''. Stivell had appeared on ''The Sensual World''. In 1995, Bush covered George Gershwin's &quot;[[The Man I Love (song)|The Man I Love]]&quot; for the tribute album ''[[The Glory of Gershwin]]''. In 1996, Bush contributed a version of &quot;Mná na hÉireann&quot; (Irish for Women of Ireland) for the Anglo-Irish folk-rock compilation project ''Common Ground: The Voices of Modern Irish Music''. Bush had to sing the song in Irish, which she [[phonetical singing|learned to do phonetically]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Mna&quot;&gt;{{cite news| title = Mna Na h-Éireann|work=Hot Press| date =29 May 1996 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Artists who have contributed to Bush's own albums include [[Eric Clapton]], [[Jeff Beck]], [[David Gilmour]], [[Nigel Kennedy]], [[Gary Brooker]], and Prince. Bush provided backing vocals for a song that was recorded during the 1990s titled ''Wouldn't Change a Thing'' by Lionel Azulay, the drummer with the original band that was later to become the KT Bush Band.  The song, which was engineered and produced by Del Palmer, is available for download and will be on Azulay’s upcoming CD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myspace.com/lionelazulayLionel |title=Lionel Azulay MySpace Page |publisher=Myspace.com |accessdate=29 May 2010}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.katebushnews.com/katenews.htm |title=Kate Bush News and Information 26 August 2008 |publisher=Katebushnews.com |accessdate=29 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bush declined a request by [[Erasure]] to produce one of their albums because &quot;she didn’t feel that that was her area&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thequietus.com/articles/01240-erasure-wanted-to-work-with-kate-bush |title=Erasure &amp; Kate Bush: The Lost Collaboration The Quietus 4 March 2009 |publisher=Thequietus.com |accessdate=29 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Bush provided vocals for Rolf Harris's cover of the traditional Irish song &quot;[[She Moves Through the Fair]]&quot;. Harris, who described the collaboration the &quot;best thing I’ve done,&quot; is unsure of how to release the track.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metro.co.uk/music/833603-rolf-harris-glastonbury-was-highlight-of-my-entertainment-career Rolf Harris: Glastonbury was highlight of my entertainment career].

==Influence==
