'''Frank Klepacki''' (born May 25, 1974) is an American musician, [[video game music]] composer and sound director best known for his work on the [[Command &amp; Conquer series|''Command &amp; Conquer'' series]]. Having learned to play drums as a child, he joined [[Westwood Studios]] as a composer when he was only 17 years old. He scored several games there, including the [[Lands of Lore|''Lands of Lore'' series]], Westwood Studios' [[Dune computer and video games|''Dune'' games]], the [[The Legend of Kyrandia|''The Legend of Kyrandia'' series]], ''[[Blade Runner (1997 video game)|Blade Runner]]'', and the ''Command &amp; Conquer'' series. His work in ''[[Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert]]'' won two awards.

He lives in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]], where he has shaped a solo career and played and produced for several local bands.&lt;ref name=&quot;lvlife&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Yo, Cookie | year=2000 | month=March | url=http://www.lvlife.com/2000/03/702/story01.html | work=Las Vegas Life | accessdate=2006-08-28 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071224031528/http://www.lvlife.com/2000/03/702/story01.html |archivedate=2007-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;thebittersband&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=The Bitters | url=http://www.thebittersband.com/ | accessdate=28 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; His personal and band work touches upon several genres, including [[orchestra]]l, [[rock music]], [[hip hop music]], [[soul music]], and [[funk]]. He has dubbed the style of music he writes as &quot;Rocktronic&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;creatingrock&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=COMMENTARY: Creating Rocktronic | author=Frank Klepacki | url=http://www.frankklepacki.com/ | work=[http://www.frankklepacki.com/ frankklepacki.com]| accessdate=22 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; His work has appeared in various media, including the [[Spike TV]] program ''[[The Ultimate Fighter]]''.

Klepacki is currently the audio director of [[Petroglyph (game studio)|Petroglyph]] games, where he scored ''[[Star Wars: Empire at War]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;videogamesheet&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=MobyGames: Frank Klepacki Rap Sheet | url=http://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,1950/ | work=[[MobyGames]]| accessdate=28 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frank Klepacki was contacted to score ''[[Command &amp; Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars]]'', but was too busy with Petroglyph to take the project, and declined to mention the offer.&lt;ref name = &quot;pcgamerpodcast&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;klepackinews&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=News | url=http://www.frankklepacki.com/ | work=[http://www.frankklepacki.com/ frankklepacki.com]| accessdate=5 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Klepacki most recently composed three songs, including &quot;Hell March 3&quot;, for [[Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert 3]] by [[Electronic Arts Los Angeles]]. His most recent solo CD is entitled ''[[Viratia (album)|Viratia]]'', packaged with a comic he helped produce.&lt;ref name=&quot;klepackinews&quot; /&gt;

=== Command and Conquer series ===
In 1994, Frank Klepacki met with Westwood Studios developers to discuss the soundtrack of the company's next project—''Command &amp; Conquer''. To define the game's style, Klepacki listened to a number of bands, including [[Nine Inch Nails]] and [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]],&lt;ref name=&quot;twistedinterview&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;behindcc&quot; /&gt; which would supply the iconic [[industrial music|industrial]] style found in the majority of the songs. He combined various elements of this music and added his own touch to create a unique sound. With the company's recent shift to 22 [[Hertz|kHz]] audio, Klepacki composed with an ASR-10 sampler, a [[Roland Corporation|Roland]] S760 sampler, a Roland JD 990 synth module, and an [[electric guitar]].&lt;ref name=&quot;behindcc&quot; /&gt; The first few songs he composed for ''Command &amp; Conquer'' contained voice samples—including the notable pieces ''Act on Instinct'' and ''No Mercy'' (which featured wild declarations from ''[[Bill &amp; Ted's Bogus Journey]]''). The samples were later found to interfere with the game's spoken audio, and were replaced with versions lacking the voices, although the original versions (and several other unused pieces) can still be found on the DOS ''C&amp;C'' and ''Covert Operations'' discs. Complete versions of the songs later appeared on the game's commercial soundtrack.&lt;ref name=&quot;behindcc&quot; /&gt; He would continue to sample clips from film and other media throughout his career, using a quote from ''[[The Brain from Planet Arous]]'' in the ''Yuri'' song ''Brainfreeze'', for example. Klepacki next composed instrumental pieces for ''Command &amp; Conquer'', drawing influences from  [[orchestra]]l, [[house music|house]], [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]], and [[hip hop music]]. For the [[credit (creative arts)|credits]], Klepacki wrote ''Airstrike'', featuring a hook later used in ''[[Command &amp; Conquer: Tiberian Sun]]'' for the [[Global Defense Initiative]]. Conversely, the [[Brotherhood of Nod]] ending used the song ''Destructible Times'' written by Klepacki's local band, [[I AM (band)|I AM]]. Developers requested the song because it &quot;reflected the war aspect and bad-ass vibe of Nod's side.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;behindcc&quot; /&gt; The ''C&amp;C'' expansion pack ''The Covert Operations'' featured seven new [[ambient music|ambient]] pieces, all of which were also included on the disc in high quality [[Red Book (audio CD standard)|CD Audio]] format.&lt;ref name=&quot;behindcc&quot; /&gt; Though the soundtrack was not released through retail, Westwood sold it by special order through its website and in game catalogues.&lt;ref name=&quot;westwoodcatalogue&quot;&gt;{{Cite book | year=2000 | author=Westwood Studios | title=The Westwood Studios Catalog | publisher=Westwood Studios }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While working on ''Covert Operations'', Frank Klepacki composed ''Hell March'' from the idea of &quot;a rock tune to marching boots,&quot; finishing the song in one day after inventing the guitar riff.&lt;ref name=&quot;gameplaylistinterview&quot;&gt;{{cite web | date=2008-11-08 | title=Interview of Frank Klepacki | author=Frank Klepacki | url=http://www.gameplaylist.org/?p=3| accessdate=15 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon listening, director [[Brett Sperry]] insisted this song be used as the signature theme of ''Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert.''&lt;ref name=&quot;behindcc&quot; /&gt; Originally intended for use with the Brotherhood of Nod, it features militaristic samples—including marching, industrial sounds, and a commander shouting orders. Klepacki initially scored ''Red Alert'' with sci-fi camp in mind, but early songs were shelved. He switched gears to write gritty pieces, prompting the ''Red Alert'' team to expand upon the style of ''Command &amp; Conquer''.&lt;ref name=&quot;behindra&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=COMMENTARY: Behind the Red Alert Soundtrack | author=Frank Klepacki | url=http://www.frankklepacki.com/ | work=[http://www.frankklepacki.com/ frankklepacki.com] | accessdate=27 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In preparing to compose, Klepacki acquired new sample libraries for unique and strange sounds. Particular creative moods would result in a few songs at a time. He first wrote heavy songs like ''Workmen'' and ''Crush'', then composed neutral, synthesizer-laden music, such as ''Vector'' and ''Roll Out''. Klepacki scored ''Fogger'' and ''Mud'', one of his personal favorites, before finishing with ''Militant Force'' and ''Radio 2''. He took breaks from working to make cameo appearances as a Soviet soldier killed by [[Kane (Command &amp; Conquer)|Kane]] and an Allied commander in the [[cut scene]]s of ''Red Alert''. He previously appeared as a [[Brotherhood of Nod|Nod]] soldier and the voice of the commando in ''Command &amp; Conquer'' and would voice bit parts in future Westwood games.&lt;ref name=&quot;actingcameos&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=COMMENTARY: Frank's acting cameos | author=Frank Klepacki | url=http://www.frankklepacki.com/ | work=[http://www.frankklepacki.com/ frankklepacki.com]| accessdate=28 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After completing ''Red Alert'', he took a short break to review his work. He concluded that some songs could be enhanced, but ''Red Alert'' had already gone [[Development stage#Gold/general availability release|gold]], precluding new versions.&lt;ref name=&quot;behindra&quot; /&gt; These remixes later appeared on the unsuccessful ''Command &amp; Conquer: Sole Survivor''. ''Red Alert''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s soundtrack was voted best video game soundtrack of 1996 by ''[[PC Gamer]]'' and ''Gameslice ''magazines, defeating [[Trent Reznor]]'s score for ''[[Quake (video game)|Quake]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;music4gamesinterview&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;behindra&quot; /&gt; Reviewers called it &quot;fun to listen to&quot; and &quot;second to none.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;gamespotredalert&quot;&gt;{{cite web | author=Vince Broady | date=1996-11-26 | title=Review of Red Alert | url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/strategy/commandconquerredalert/review.html | work=[http://www.gamespot.com/ GameSpot]| accessdate=23 August 2006 | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060613180357/http://www.gamespot.com/pc/strategy/commandconquerredalert/review.html? &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt; | archivedate=13 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2005, ''Red Alert'' was listed in the ''[[Guinness Book of World Records]]'' for selling several million units, bringing Klepacki his widest audience.&lt;ref name=&quot;guinness&quot;&gt;{{Cite book | year=2005 | editor=Claire Folkard | title=The Guinness Book of World Records | publisher=Bantam Books | isbn=0-553-58810-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote additional music for the game's [[expansion pack]]s, ''Counterstrike'' and ''Aftermath''. He attributed the success of ''Red Alert'' to an infusion of modern styles not found in other games.&lt;ref name=&quot;petroglyphpodcast&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Frank Klepacki Podcast | url=http://www.petroglyphgames.com/news/index.php?id=60&amp;year=2006 %7C 'work=[http://www.petroglyphgames.com/ Petroglyph Games]| accessdate=28 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Klepacki initially wrote off the popularity of his music, assuming that his music &quot;must only appeal to die-hards.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;gameplaylistinterview&quot; /&gt; He considered it &quot;very surreal&quot; to realize his soundtracks had gained notoriety, and has since embraced his fans and critics.&lt;ref name=&quot;gameplaylistinterview&quot; /&gt;

== Later Westwood games ==

In 1997, Frank Klepacki scored a ''[[Blade Runner]]'' adaptation. Though Westwood acquired the rights to use the original film score by [[Vangelis]], the company was not allowed access to the original master recordings, and Klepacki had to recreate the themes by ear.&lt;ref name=&quot;gameplaylistinterview&quot; /&gt; Developers were satisfied by his attention to detail, feeling that his digital recreations sounded clearer than the originals.&lt;ref name=&quot;gameplaylistinterview&quot; /&gt; In 1998, Klepacki composed for ''[[Dune 2000]]''. He attempted to update the music from ''[[Dune II]]'' into &quot;this non-blip stuff,&quot; and worked in homages to the original style of the films as composed by [[Toto (band)|Toto]].&lt;ref name=&quot;avaultinterview&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;gameplaylistinterview&quot; /&gt; ''Dune 2000'' was panned by critics, though Klepacki's score was praised for adhering to the traditional ''Dune'' style.&lt;ref name=&quot;gamespotdune2000&quot;&gt;{{cite web | author=Ron Dulin | date=1997-12-03 | title=Review of Dune 2000 | url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/strategy/dune2000/review.html | work=[http://www.gamespot.com/ GameSpot]| accessdate=23 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Klepacki considered ''2000'' to be a more definitive work than ''Dune 2'', which was constrained by software and hardware limitations.&lt;ref name=&quot;gameplaylistinterview&quot; /&gt; He composed for ''[[Command &amp; Conquer: Tiberian Sun]]'' with [[Jarrid Mendelson]]—with whom he would later collaborate on ''[[Emperor: Battle for Dune]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;videogamesheet&quot; /&gt; He began by writing ''Stomp'', an energetic rock piece intended to recreate the effect of ''Hell March'' for the new game.&lt;ref name=&quot;tscommentary&quot;&gt;{{cite web | author=Frank Klepacki | date=2007-05-15 | title=COMMENTARY: Tiberian Sun | url=http://www.frankklepacki.com/ | work=[http://www.frankklepacki.com/ FrankKlepacki.com]| accessdate=4 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coincidentally, one of the trailers for Command and Conquer 3 featured 'Stomp' as the soundtrack. Westwood instead wanted ''Tiberian Sun'' to feature darker, more moody music, and ''Stomp'' was shelved in favor of the current sound. Bereft of ideas due to the stark change in direction, Klepacki asked Mendelson to collaborate; he regards tracks they both worked on as the best. ''Tiberian Sun'' ultimately featured dark, ambient [[techno music]] and ambient space music suited to the game's post-apocalyptic and futuristic setting.&lt;ref name=&quot;tsreview&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Review of Command &amp; Conquer: Tiberian Sun | author=The Logbook staff | url=http://www.thelogbook.com/music/command-and-conquer-tiberian-sun/ | work=[http://www.thelogbook.com/ The Logbook] | accessdate=2006-07-28 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071224041836/http://www.thelogbook.com/music/command-and-conquer-tiberian-sun/ |archivedate=2007-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Klepacki cited the piece &quot;Mad Rap&quot; as his favorite. An avid ''[[Star Wars]]'' fan, he enjoyed scoring [[cut scenes]] featuring [[James Earl Jones]], the voice of [[Darth Vader]].&lt;ref name=&quot;petroglyphpodcast&quot; /&gt; The scenes also allowed him to integrate the ''Airstrike'' and ''No Mercy'' themes into the game's score despite the aforementioned shift.&lt;ref name=&quot;tscommentary&quot; /&gt; With the expansion pack ''Firestorm'', he attempted to &quot;set things right&quot; by writing more upbeat songs and including ''Stomp'', which would also appear in ''Command &amp; Conquer: Renegade''.&lt;ref name=&quot;tscommentary&quot;/&gt;

He next scored ''[[Lands of Lore]] III'' and ''[[Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert 2]]''. Klepacki defined ''Red Alert 2''{{'}}s style with heavy metal guitar and fast-paced beats.&lt;ref name=&quot;ra2review&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Review of Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert 2 | author=The Logbook staff | url=http://www.thelogbook.com/pixel/command-conquer-red-alert/ | work=[http://www.thelogbook.com/ The Logbook]| accessdate=28 July 2006}} {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Klepacki scored the game with a [[Korg]] Triton Rack, [[Novation]] Nova desktop, and [[Roland Corporation|Roland]] XV-5080.&lt;ref name=&quot;westwoodnetinterview&quot;&gt;{{cite web | year=2001 | title=Frank Klepacki Interview (Yuri's Revenge) | url=http://www.westwoodi.net/read.php?Articles/Frank_Klepacki_Interview | work=[http://www.westwoodi.net/ Westwood Infiltration]| accessdate=28 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Red Alert 2''&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; included a remix of &quot;Hell March&quot;.

For ''[[Command &amp; Conquer: Renegade]]''—the next entry in the series—Klepacki tried to update the style of the original ''Command &amp; Conquer'' by making it &quot;hipper and more elaborate.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;avaultinterview&quot; /&gt; Several ''Command &amp; Conquer'' mainstays appear as reworked versions, including ''Target (Mechanical Man)'', ''Industrial'', ''Act on Instinct'', and ''No Mercy''.

Klepacki took a brief hiatus to work on solo albums, then joined [[Petroglyph (game studio)|Petroglyph]] games as full-time audio director in 2004.&lt;ref name=&quot;petroglyphpodcast&quot; /&gt; He prepared by becoming versed in the job's requirements and demands.&lt;ref name=&quot;petroglyphpodcast&quot; /&gt; His first task was scoring ''[[Star Wars: Empire at War]]'', Petroglyph's launch title; he also helped select voice actors.&lt;ref name=&quot;askpetroglyph1&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Some questions for everyone at Petroglyph | url=http://www.petroglyphgames.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=1012&amp;hl=klepacki | work=[http://www.petroglyphgames.com/forums/ Petroglyph Forums]| accessdate=2 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; A die-hard fan of the ''[[Star Wars]]'' franchise, Klepacki enjoyed complementing [[John Williams]]'s style as he worked with sound effects used in the feature films.&lt;ref name=&quot;music4gamesinterview&quot; /&gt; He worked closely with programmers to ensure perfect aural functionality.

For the ''Forces of Corruption'' expansion pack, he took greater creative liberty with the ''Star Wars'' feel by writing an original theme for the new criminal faction.&lt;ref name=&quot;petroglyphpodcast&quot; /&gt; In attempting to compose this piece, he wrote several preliminary hooks that were later integrated into the game's battle themes.&lt;ref name=&quot;gamespotdiary5&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Star Wars: Empire at War: Forces of Corruption Designer Diary #5 - The Sounds of Corruption | date=2006-10-17 | author=Frank Klepacki | url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/strategy/starwarsempireatwarforces/news.html?sid=6159916 | work=[http://www.gamespot.com/ GameSpot]| accessdate=2 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He composed six pieces for the expansion total, including the finale theme.

He declared that surprises were in store for ''Command &amp; Conquer'' fans waiting for him to return to his &quot;roots&quot; and &quot;adrenaline-pumping soundtrack style&quot;, and suggested that they &quot;imagine my mindset...when Command &amp; Conquer first came out, and add about fifteen years experience to that.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;gamespotuaw&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pgvideointerview&quot; /&gt; Klepacki summarized the game's main styles shortly before release:

{{cquote2|For the Hierarchy—our evil alien race—I went with a more heavy-metal rock influence, to go along with how they stomp all over everything on the map with their massive walker units. Novus—our high-tech, hit-and-run faction—featured more industrial electronica to go along with their futuristic robotic feel. For our third faction, the Masari—our ancient star-faring side—I provided an epic orchestral feel, with worldly influences to reflect their godlike nature and questionable links to our past. One Masari track in particular, &quot;Divine Intervention,&quot; would become the central theme to the whole game.&lt;ref name=&quot;gamespotuaw&quot; /&gt;}}

As audio director, Klepacki also created many sound effects for ''Universe at War''. For the alien Hierarchy, he cultivated an &quot;unnatural&quot; aesthetic through an &quot;arsenal of mangled noises&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;gamespotuaw&quot; /&gt; Klepacki used a &quot;combination of heavy cranes recorded with overdriven impacts&quot; to give the faction's walkers a &quot;menacing machinelike breathing sound&quot;, and made up his own language to record &quot;various grunts, growls, mannerisms, and strange vocalizations.&lt;ref name=&quot;gamespotuaw&quot; /&gt; Since Hierarchy heroes needed to communicate to the player in English, Klepacki engineered dialogue to seem as if the aliens were &quot;telepathically speaking to you, with a back-masking effect on their voices...as if the words are being channeled straight to your brain&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;gamespotuaw&quot; /&gt; The Novus effects were usually [[phaser (effect)|phased]] and involved &quot;mechanical movement, electricity, and metal sounds&quot;. He invented yet another language for two characters Viktor and Mirabel, who occasionally speak to one another. Lastly, he drew on weather and other natural sounds for the Masari, describing their ambience as having &quot;more weight, thunder, heavy bass rumblings, vortex gusts...&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;gamespotuaw&quot; /&gt; Klepacki directed the voice-acting to have a &quot;noble and strong&quot; feel without appearing typically medieval or overly dramatic.&lt;ref name=&quot;gamespotuaw&quot; /&gt; He ultimately felt he did the work of &quot;three people&quot; with ''Universe at War'', as the game's audio requirements changed constantly, requiring vigilance and programmer support.&lt;ref name=&quot;music4gamesinterviewinthestudio&quot; /&gt; ''Divine Intervention'' was later nominated for a ''Game Audio Network Guild'' award, and the soundtrack was released as a free download after Petroglyph's efforts toward a traditional release were frustrated.&lt;ref name=&quot;gangaward&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.audiogang.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=159&amp;Itemid=188 | title=6th G.A.N.G.

Following ''Rocktronic'' was ''[[Virtual Control]]'', released in 2005. Klepacki complemented his usual style with experiments in hip hop on the album.

== Work and beliefs ==
When composing for video games, Frank Klepacki spends a few days to compose and master one song on average.&lt;ref name=&quot;imperiuminterview&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Interview with Frank Klepacki | url=http://www.imperium-ww.pl/articles.php?article_id=30 | work=[http://www.imperium-ww.pl/ Imperium Westwood] | accessdate=2006-08-26 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070928174901/http://www.imperium-ww.pl/articles.php?article_id=30 |archivedate=2007-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; He feels writing music for games is somewhat difficult as only early [[software build]]s are available to play; he sometimes must compose songs based on vague descriptions.&lt;ref name=&quot;westwoodnetinterview&quot; /&gt; Composing for cut scenes is easier by comparison, and Klepacki enjoys drawing inspiration and direction from game design art.&lt;ref name=&quot;gameplaylistinterview&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;westwoodnetinterview&quot; /&gt; Nonetheless, he prefers to compose for a game throughout its development rather than write songs for a finished product.&lt;ref name=&quot;petropo2&quot; /&gt; He feels that game music has been harder to compose than film or solo music as he must compose for all situations a player may discover or engineer.&lt;ref name=&quot;gameplaymag&quot; /&gt; Klepacki maintains templates with a base of common instruments prepared for sudden bursts of inspiration, as he resents &quot;having technical issues...as an obstacle.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;gameplaymag&quot; /&gt; When asked how the composing process begins, Klepacki related:

{{cquote2|It starts with knowing what I'm composing for. Is it a battle theme, or main title, or ambient theme, etc. Then I figure out what type of mood or style best fits...the subject matter. From there it's about picking the right instrumentation and then the writing process starts. It could start with anything; a guitar riff, a French horn melody, a drum rhythm or bass line. Then I keep alternating instruments track by track recording one part at a time until I have something that sounds full and gets the point across I'm trying for.&lt;ref name=&quot;gameplaymag&quot; /&gt;}}

Klepacki has said that the most rewarding part of composing video game music is working with a team—which he compares to chemistry between band members—and knowing he is part of a greater cause.&lt;ref name=&quot;petroglyphpodcast&quot; /&gt; He believes that game music could improve if artists focused on quality and derived inspiration from playing games.&lt;ref name=&quot;music4gamesinterview&quot; /&gt; He has expressed interest in having Electronic Arts sell his soundtracks in retail stores, preferably next to video games in electronic departments.&lt;ref name=&quot;music4gamesinterview4&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Video Game Soundtrack Report 1.0 | url=http://www.music4games.net/f_soundtracks_report_1.html | work=[http://www.music4games.net/ Music4Games] | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20021107110623/http://www.music4games.net/f_soundtracks_report_1.html | archivedate=2002-11-07| accessdate=28 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; He advises those wishing to get in the video game business to attend conventions and investigate developer companies.&lt;ref name=&quot;petroglyphpodcast&quot; /&gt; He also noted in 2008 that &quot;composition and engineering skills are now required,&quot; advising upstart composers to ensure their work is film-quality.&lt;ref name=&quot;gameplaylistinterview&quot; /&gt; Klepacki is happy to see older games offered on the [[Wii]], hoping that gamers are &quot;recognizing once again that simple, short fun experiences are just as good as...long, huge-production experiences.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;gameplaymag&quot; /&gt; Klepacki listed several influences for his style of composition: &quot;John Williams naturally for my love of Star Wars and his style in general, Michael Kamen for his composing diversity, Metallica for sparking my metal influence, Vince Dicola who in my opinion is way under-rated for his great work, Sly &amp; The Family Stone for inspiring funk, syncopation, and positive energy, Larry Graham for inspiring me to play funk bass, Nine Inch Nails for their unique uses of mangled sound, and Rob Zombie for combining music with a theme and persona.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;music4gamesinterviewinthestudio&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=In the Studio: Frank Klepacki | date=2008-03-03 | url=http://www.music4games.net/Features_Display.aspx?id=203 | work=[http://www.music4games.net/ Music4Games]| accessdate=15 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Klepacki runs a personal [http://www.frankklepacki.com/ website] featuring a biography, archived interviews, and a playlist of songs [[streaming media|streamed]] in 128 [[Kilobit per second|kbit/s]] [[mp3]]. His music is also available from [[iTunes]]. As a ''Star Wars'' fan, he has extensively written about the film premieres of the last two prequels on his website.&lt;ref name=&quot;klepackistarwars&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=COMMENTARY: Frank at ''Star Wars'' Celebration 2 | url=http://www.frankklepacki.com/ | work=[http://www.frankklepacki.com/ frankklepacki]| accessdate=28 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; He maintains an account at [[YouTube]] and has posted three videos of his work with other bands.&lt;ref name=&quot;video&quot;&gt;{{cite web | year=2006 | title=Youtube: Flyrecords1 | url=http://www.youtube.com/profile?user=flyrecords1| accessdate=2 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is an ardent supporter of [[digital cinema]], believing the medium to be the pinnacle of quality.&lt;ref name=&quot;digitalcinema&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=COMMENTARY: Digital Cinema | url=http://www.frankklepacki.com/ | work=[http://www.frankklepacki.com/ frankklepacki.com]| accessdate=28 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has scored two short films, and won a [[CineVegas]] award for his work with ''Unreel Invasion''.&lt;ref name=&quot;aboutme&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Frank Klepacki: About Me | url=http://www.frankklepacki.com/ | work=[http://www.frankklepacki.com/ frankklepacki.com]| accessdate=27 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Klepacki believes that the genre of video game music is more respected than it has ever been. He notes that complex and quality music comes at a higher cost, prompting certain producers to simply &quot;get somebody who could cop the Hollywood sound&quot; instead of nurturing original style.&lt;ref name=&quot;gwjinterview&quot; /&gt; When asked about his career low-point, he named ''[[Order of the Griffon]]'' for the [[TurboGrafx-16]], citing difficulties with the system's limited musical capabilities.&lt;ref name=&quot;gwjinterview&quot; /&gt; Concerning his solo career and Westwood, Klepacki regrets &quot;not having attended more of the fun company functions and parties while I was instead playing club gigs with bands with the mentality of trying to get signed or discovered.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;gameplaymag&quot; /&gt; When asked to reflect on his career, he replied:

{{cquote2|The ironic thing is that my original goal in life was to be in a famous band, tour the world and sell millions of albums. Although that didn't quite happen, I got something else just as gratifying. Instead of being in a famous band, I gained some fame in the industry as a game composer. Instead of touring the world, I receive fan mail from around the world. Instead of selling millions of albums, my music is on millions of games! And I sell enough of my own albums that allows me to keep releasing them. So in a different way, I kind of got what I wanted after all. And I'm more than happy with that. The most fulfilling part of it is that I feel I contributed something that mattered to a significant number of people, and more importantly, I got to be a part of projects that mattered a lot to my life personally, like Star Wars!&lt;ref name=&quot;gameplaymag&quot; /&gt;}}

Klepacki is not seeking a record deal, citing a &quot;horrible chain of steps to getting famous.&quot; Scathingly critical of the [[recording industry]], he blames [[MTV]]—described as a &quot;teenage
reality show channel&quot;—for putting a pretty face on music and destroying the independent valuation of actual sound.&lt;ref name=&quot;gameplaymag&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;klepackirecorddeal&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=COMMENTARY: Record Deals | url=http://www.frankklepacki.com/ | work=[http://www.frankklepacki.com/ frankklepacki]| accessdate=28 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Klepacki has declared pop music as having become the &quot;largest farce in music history—soul-less, mechanical, and only made for the sole purpose of making the fastest dollar possible, with more emphasis on imagery than the music.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;gameplaymag&quot; /&gt; He's also criticized [[lip-synching]] and the repackaging of music genre through different labels—such as [[Nu metal]] for [[rock music]] and [[Neo soul]] for [[soul music]].&lt;ref name=&quot;klepackirecorddeal&quot; /&gt; He believes that signing a deal does not guarantee profits, and would rather keep his [[day job]] as audio director. These sentiments were echoed in a special feature on the band [[Home Cookin' (band)|Home Cookin']] in 2000—Klepacki said the group wanted to &quot;work with a label, not for them.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;homecookin0&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Sonic Garden: Home Cookin' | url=http://www.sonicgarden.com/sonic-web/artist.cfm?artistid=4960 | work=[http://www.sonicgarden.com/ Sonic Garden]| accessdate=25 August 2006| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20050825053531/http://www.sonicgarden.com/sonic-web/artist.cfm?artistid=4960| archivedate = August 25, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stating that he would not compromise his work for popularity, he believes that &quot;the only artists that have any longevity are the ones that pioneer a movement—not follow one.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;gameplaymag&quot; /&gt; He enjoys working independently, as he does not have to &quot;change...music for the sake of pop radio.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;music4gamesfoc&quot; /&gt; He champions the internet as a medium through which creative and original artists can be found. Klepacki believes it is the preferred avenue for music when compared to radio [[airplay (song)|airplay]]—where one hears &quot;the exact same songs 3 months at a time.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;klepackirecorddeal&quot; /&gt; When interviewed about file-sharing, he expressed mixed emotions.&lt;ref name=&quot;westwoodnetinterview&quot; /&gt; Holding that [[compact disc]]s are &quot;just too damn expensive&quot;, Klepacki believes that a few dollars' reduction in price would &quot;deter people from downloading for free.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;napsterklepacki2&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | title = HIGH TECH: Easy Access | author=John Przybys | journal = [[Las Vegas Review-Journal]] | date =2000-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, he notes that artists—who &quot;don't get as much money as you think&quot;—need to be compensated for their work.&lt;ref name=&quot;westwoodnetinterview&quot; /&gt; His favorite artists by decade, starting with the 1960s, are [[Sly and the Family Stone]], [[Graham Central Station]], [[Metallica]], [[Home Cookin' (band)|Home Cookin']], and [[Bob Schneider]].&lt;ref name=&quot;favorites&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Where My Rockers At? | url=http://www.petroglyphgames.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=191&amp;hl=klepacki&amp;st=20 | work=[http://www.petroglyphgames.com/ Petroglyph Games]| accessdate=2 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
