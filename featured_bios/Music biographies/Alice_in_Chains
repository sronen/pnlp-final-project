'''Alice in Chains''' is an American &lt;!-- Please do not change the genre without discussing it first on the talk page  --&gt;[[Rock music|rock]] band formed in [[Seattle]], Washington, in 1987 by guitarist and songwriter [[Jerry Cantrell]] and original lead vocalist [[Layne Staley]]. The initial lineup was rounded out by drummer [[Sean Kinney]], and bassist [[Mike Starr (musician)|Mike Starr]] (who was replaced in 1993 by [[Mike Inez]]).

Although widely associated with [[Grunge|grunge music]], the band's sound incorporates [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] and [[acoustic music|acoustic]] elements. Since its formation, Alice in Chains has released four studio albums, three EPs, two live albums, four compilations, and two DVDs. The band is known for its distinct vocal style which often included the [[vocal harmony|harmonized]] vocals of Staley and Cantrell.

Alice in Chains rose to international fame as part of the grunge movement of the early 1990s, along with other Seattle bands such as [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], [[Pearl Jam]], and [[Soundgarden]]. The band was one of the most successful music acts of the 1990s, selling over 35 million albums worldwide,&lt;ref name=&quot;newalbumtitle&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=140829 |title=ALICE IN CHAINS Interviewed By VOICE OF AMERICA|publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]] |date=2010-05-28 |accessdate=2010-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and over 14 million in the US alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=3&amp;table=tblTopArt&amp;action= |title=Recording Industry Association of America |publisher=RIAA |date= |accessdate=2011-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992 the band released their album ''[[Dirt (Alice in Chains album)|Dirt]]'' which was critically acclaimed and has been certified quadruple platinum. The band also achieved two No.1 [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] albums (''[[Jar of Flies]]'' and ''[[Alice in Chains (album)|Alice in Chains]]''), 14 top ten songs on the [[Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks|Mainstream Rock Tracks]] chart, and eight [[Grammy Award]] nominations.

Although never officially disbanding, Alice in Chains was plagued by extended inactivity from 1996 onwards due to [[substance abuse]], which resulted in the 2002 death of Layne Staley, and the 2011 death of former bassist Mike Starr (who left the band in 1993). The band reunited in 2005 with new lead vocalist [[William DuVall]] and released ''[[Black Gives Way to Blue]]'', their first studio album in 14 years, on September 29, 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;newalbumtitle&quot;/&gt; The album was a success, being certified gold by the RIAA in March 2010. Alice in Chains is currently working on a new album, which is rumored for release in 2012.&lt;ref name=&quot;fifthalbum&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=160902 |title=Alice in Chains Is Working On New Music, Says HEART's Ann Wilson |publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]] |date=2011-07-20 |accessdate=2011-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Formation (1986–89)===
[[File:Staley01.jpg|thumb|left|Vocalist [[Layne Staley]]. Staley formed Alice in Chains along with guitarist [[Jerry Cantrell]].]]

Following the demise of his band Sleeze in 1986, vocalist [[Layne Staley]] formed [[Alice N' Chains]], a band which he said &quot;dressed in drag and played [[speed metal]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Music Bank&quot;&gt;{{cite album-notes | bandname=Alice in Chains | title=[[Music Bank]]| year=1996 |publisher=[[Columbia Records]] | publisherid=69580}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new band, featuring guitarist [[Nick Pollock]], bassist [[Johnny Bacolas]], and drummer [[James Bergstrom]], performed around the Seattle area playing [[Slayer]] and [[Armored Saint]] [[Cover version|covers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Lamestain HQ |url=http://lamestainnorthwest.blogspot.com/2006/09/lip-lock-rock-alice-n-chainz-story_28.html |title=Lip Lock Rock: The Alice 'N Chainz Story |publisher=Lamestainnorthwest.blogspot.com |date=2006-09-28 |accessdate=2011-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Staley met guitarist [[Jerry Cantrell]] while working at Music Bank rehearsal studios, where the two struggling musicians became roommates, and lived in a rehearsal space they shared. Alice N' Chains soon disbanded and Staley joined a [[funk]] band who at the time also required a guitarist. Staley asked Cantrell to join as a [[sideman]]. Cantrell agreed on condition that Staley join Cantrell's band, which at the time included drummer [[Sean Kinney]] and bassist [[Mike Starr (musician)|Mike Starr]]. Eventually the funk project broke up and in 1987 Staley joined Cantrell's band on a full-time basis, playing in clubs around the Pacific Northwest, often stretching 15 minutes of material into a 45-minute set. The band played a couple of gigs calling themselves several different monikers, including Diamond Lie, which was the name of Cantrell's previous band,&lt;ref name=&quot;Interview Alice In Chains - Jerry Cantrell and Sean Kinney (part 2)&quot;&gt;{{YouTube|WOZjcOCrepk|Interview Alice In Chains - Jerry Cantrell and Sean Kinney (part 2)}}&lt;/ref&gt; before they eventually took the name of Alice in Chains.&lt;ref name=&quot;Music Bank&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Link with Brutality&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title=Link With Brutality | author=Kleidermacher, Mordechai |year=1990 |month=July |publisher=''[[Circus Magazine|Circus]]'' magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Local promoter Randy Hauser became aware of the band at a concert, and offered to pay for [[Demo (music)|demo]] recordings. However, one day before the band was due to record at the Music Bank studio in Washington, police shut down the studio during the biggest cannabis raid in the history of the state.&lt;ref name=&quot;Music Bank&quot;/&gt; The final demo, completed in 1988, was named ''The Treehouse Tapes'', and found its way to the music managers Kelly Curtis and Susan Silver, who also managed the Seattle-based band [[Soundgarden]]. Curtis and Silver passed the demo on to [[Columbia Records]]' [[A&amp;R]] representative Nick Terzo, who set up an appointment with label president [[Don Ienner]]. Based on ''The Treehouse Tapes'', Ienner signed Alice in Chains to Columbia in 1989.&lt;ref name=&quot;Music Bank&quot;/&gt; The band also recorded another untitled demo over a three-month period in 1989. This recording can be found on the bootleg release ''Sweet Alice''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metal-archives.com/release.php?id=86843 |title=Sweet Alice |publisher=Metal-archives.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alice in Chains soon became a top priority of the label, who released the band's first official recording in July 1990, a promotional [[Extended play|EP]] ''[[We Die Young]]''. The EP's lead single, &quot;[[We Die Young]]&quot;, became a hit on metal radio. After its success, the label rushed Alice in Chains' debut album into production with producer [[Dave Jerden]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AiC Dirt&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.aliceinchains.com/discography/dirt.aspx| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060703145800/http://www.aliceinchains.com/discography/dirt.aspx| archivedate=2006-07-03 |title=Discography – ''Dirt'' |publisher=Aliceinchains.com |accessdate=2008-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cantrell stated the album was intended to have a &quot;moody aura&quot; that was a &quot;direct result of the brooding atmosphere and feel of Seattle&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Who is Alice and why is She in Chains?&quot;&gt;{{cite journal| author=Moses, Michael |year=1991 |month=September |title=Alice in Chains: Who is Alice and Why is She in Chains? |publisher=''Rockbeat'' magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The resulting album, ''[[Facelift (album)|Facelift]]'', was released on August 21, 1990, peaking at number 42 in the summer of 1991 on the ''Billboard 200'' chart.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alice in Chains - Artist chart History&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/retrieve_chart_history.do?model.chartFormatGroupName=Albums&amp;model.vnuArtistId=3943&amp;model.vnuAlbumId=624727 |title=Alice in Chains – Artist chart History |publisher=[[Billboard.com]] |accessdate=2007-11-09}}{{dead link|date=September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Facelift'' was not an instant success, selling under 40,000 copies in the first six months of release, until [[MTV]] added &quot;[[Man in the Box]]&quot; to regular daytime rotation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dirt - Guitar World&quot;&gt;Gill, Chris (September 1999). &quot;Dirt&quot;.

''Facelift'' was certified [[Music recording sales certification|gold]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] by the end of 1990, while the band continued to hone its audience, opening for such artists as [[Iggy Pop]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Alice in Chains eNotes Biography&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Glickman, Simon |url=http://www.enotes.com/contemporary-musicians/alice-chains-biography |title=Enotes – Alice in Chains |publisher=Enotes.com |accessdate=2007-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Van Halen]], [[Poison (band)|Poison]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Who is Alice and why is She in Chains?&quot;/&gt; and [[Extreme (band)|Extreme]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Dirt - Guitar World&quot;/&gt; In early 1991, Alice in Chains landed the opening slot for the [[Clash of the Titans (tour)|Clash of the Titans]] with [[Anthrax (band)|Anthrax]], [[Megadeth]], and [[Slayer]], exposing the band to a wide metal audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=59909 |title=Alice in Chains Guitarist Discusses 1990 Clash of the Titans tour, Touring With Ozzy |publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]] |date=2007-10-07 |accessdate=2008-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alice in Chains was nominated for a [[Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance|Best Hard Rock Performance]] Grammy Award in 1992 for &quot;Man in the Box&quot;, but lost to Van Halen for their 1991 album ''[[For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;First Grammy&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.rockonthenet.com/archive/1992/grammys.htm |title=34th Grammy Awards – 1992 |publisher=Rockonthenet.com |accessdate=2007-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the tour, Alice in Chains entered the studio to record demos for its next album, but ended up recording five acoustic songs instead.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dirt - Guitar World&quot;/&gt; While in the studio, drummer Sean Kinney had a dream about &quot;making an EP called ''Sap''&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alice in Chains eNotes Biography&quot;/&gt; The band decided &quot;not to mess with fate&quot;, and on March 21, 1992, Alice in Chains released their second EP, ''[[Sap (album)|Sap]]''.

In March 1992, the band returned to the studio.

===Hiatus and the death of Layne Staley (1996–2002)===
Although Alice in Chains never officially disbanded, Staley became a recluse, rarely leaving his Seattle condominium following the death of his ex-fiancée Demri Parrott in 1996, due to bacterial [[endocarditis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Remembering Layne Staley&quot;/&gt; &quot;Drugs worked for me for years&quot;, Staley told ''Rolling Stone'' in 1996, &quot;and now they're turning against me, now I'm walking through hell&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Malice in Chains&quot;/&gt; Unable to continue with new Alice in Chains material, Cantrell released his first solo album in 1998, entitled ''[[Boggy Depot]]'', which also featured Sean Kinney and Mike Inez.&lt;ref name=&quot;Allmusic&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p3520|pure_url=yes}} |title=Alice in Chains Biography |publisher=Allmusic |author=Erlewine, Thomas; Prato, Greg |accessdate=2007-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, Staley reunited with Alice in Chains to record two new songs, &quot;[[Get Born Again]]&quot; and &quot;[[Died (Alice in Chains song)|Died]]&quot;. Originally written for Cantrell's solo album, the songs were released in the fall of 1999 on the [[box set]], ''[[Music Bank]]''. The set contains 48 songs, including rarities, demos, and previous album tracks.&lt;ref name=&quot;Music Bank&quot;/&gt; The band also released a 15-track compilation titled ''[[Nothing Safe: Best of the Box]]'', serving as a sampler for ''Music Bank'', as well as the band's first [[greatest hits]] compilation. The band's last official releases include a [[live album]], simply titled ''[[Live (Alice in Chains album)|Live]]'', released on December 5, 2000, and a second greatest hits compilation, titled ''[[Greatest Hits (Alice in Chains album)|Greatest Hits]]'' in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.aliceinchains.com/music.aspx| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060628204951/http://www.aliceinchains.com/music.aspx| archivedate=2006-06-28 |title=Alice in Chains.com – Discography |publisher=Aliceinchains.com |accessdate=2007-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2002, Cantrell had finished work on his second solo album, ''[[Degradation Trip]]''. Written in 1998, the album's lyrical content focused heavily on what Cantrell regarded as the demise of Alice in Chains which still remained evident as the album approached its June 2002 release. However, in March that year, Cantrell commented, &quot;We're all still around, so it's possible [Alice in Chains] could all do something someday, and I fully hope someday we will.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Wiederhorn, Jon [http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1452982/20020319/cantrell_jerry.jhtml Jerry Cantrell Conjures Ghost Of Alice In Chains On New LP] [[MTV|MTV.com]] (March 20, 2002).

To coincide with the band's reunion, [[Sony Music Entertainment|Sony Music]] released the long-delayed third Alice in Chains compilation, ''[[The Essential Alice in Chains]]'', a [[double album]] that includes 28 songs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.aliceinchains.com/discography/essentials.aspx| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071011024536/http://www.aliceinchains.com/discography/essentials.aspx| archivedate=2007-10-11 |title=The Essential Alice in Chains |publisher=Aliceinchains.com |accessdate=2007-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Future fifth album and the death of Mike Starr (2010–present)===
In April 2010, guitarist [[Jerry Cantrell]] revealed to [[MTV News]] that Alice in Chains was contemplating making a fifth studio album in the foreseeable future. He explained, &quot;There are thoughts. We'll see how far we get. Staying in the moment is a good way to live and we certainly hope that it happens.

There's a lot of shows. But yeah, generally speaking, yeah, we're excited about the future.

DuVall revealed in September 2010 that Alice in Chains had not begun writing their next album yet, but &quot;there's plenty of riffs flying around.&quot; He added, &quot;That was the case when we first started back up. We would just stockpile these fragments, and then some time later we would sift through the mountain of stuff, and that's what became ''Black Gives Way to Blue''. The same thing has been happening since we've been touring ''Black Gives Way to Blue'', so it would be only natural to at some point say, 'Hey, we've got a lot of stuff. Let's sift through and see what we've got this time.'&quot; DuVall also mentioned that it is possible that the new album will feature songs that were written for ''Black Gives Way to Blue''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.billboard.com/news#/news/alice-in-chains-follow-up-album-likely-says-1004113177.story |title=Alice in Chains Follow-Up Album Likely, Says Frontman |publisher=[[Billboard.com]] |date=2010-09-08 |accessdate=2010-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jerry Cantrell identifies the band as primarily [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]]. He told ''[[Guitar World]]'' in 1996; &quot;We're a lot of different things...

Jerry Cantrell's guitar style combines what Stephen Erlewine of Allmusic called &quot;pummeling riffs and expansive guitar textures&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://music.yahoo.com/read/review/14253942 |title=Degradation Trip Review |publisher=Allmusic |author=Erlewine, Stephen Thomas |accessdate=2007-12-08}}{{dead link|date=March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; to create &quot;slow, brooding minor-key grinds&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/degradation-trip-r590407/review |title=Degradation Trip |publisher=Allmusic |author=Erlewine, Stephen Thomas |accessdate=2012-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; While down-tuned distorted guitars mixed with Staley's distinctive &quot;snarl-to-a-scream&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dirt - Guitar World&quot;/&gt; vocals appealed to [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] fans, the band also had &quot;a sense of melody that was undeniable&quot;, which introduced Alice in Chains to a much wider pop audience outside of the heavy metal underground.&lt;ref name=&quot;AMG Facelift&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Staley dead-VH1&quot;/&gt;

The band has been described by critics as &quot;hard enough for metal fans, yet their dark subject matter and punky attack placed them among the front ranks of the Seattle-based grunge bands&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Allmusic&quot;/&gt; Three of the band's releases feature all acoustic music, and while the band initially kept these releases separate, Alice in Chains' self-titled album combined the styles to form &quot;a bleak, nihilistic sound that balanced grinding hard rock with subtly textured acoustic numbers&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Allmusic&quot;/&gt;

Alice in Chains is also noted for the unique vocal harmonies of Staley and Cantrell, which included overlapping passages, and dual lead vocals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Allmusic&quot;/&gt; Alyssa Burrows said the band's distinctive sound &quot;came from Staley's vocal style and his lyrics dealing with personal struggles and addiction&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Burrows, Alyssa |date=2002-05-17 |url=http://www.historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=output.cfm&amp;File_Id=3778 |title=Alice in Chains singer Layne Staley dies on April 5, 2002. |publisher=Historylink.com |accessdate=2007-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Staley's songs were often considered &quot;dark&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Allmusic&quot;/&gt; with themes such as drug abuse, depression, and suicide,&lt;ref name=&quot;Remembering Layne Staley&quot;/&gt; while Cantrell's lyrics dealt more with personal relationships.
