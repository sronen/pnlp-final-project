'''Damageplan''' was an American [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band from [[Dallas]], [[Texas]] that formed in 2003. Following the demise of their previous group [[Pantera]], brothers [[Dimebag Darrell]] and [[Vinnie Paul|Vinnie Paul Abbott]] wanted to start a new band. The pair recruited former [[Halford (band)|Halford]] guitarist [[Patrick Lachman|Pat Lachman]] on vocals, and later [[Bob Kakaha|Bob Zilla]] on bass. Damageplan released its debut album ''[[New Found Power]]'' in the United States on February 10, 2004, which debuted at number 38 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], selling 44,676 copies in its first week.

While Damageplan was promoting the album at a concert on December 8, 2004, a man named [[Nathan Gale]] climbed on stage and murdered Darrell, the lead guitarist for Damageplan. Although no motive was found, some witnesses claimed Gale blamed the brothers for Pantera's breakup and believed that they had stolen his lyrics. Gale was killed by police officer [[James_Niggemeyer#Death|James Niggemeyer]], who was found to have acted properly by the [[Franklin County, Ohio|Franklin County]] [[prosecutor]]'s office. The band's manager confirmed there are unreleased Damageplan recordings, although they have not surfaced, and the band has not performed since the incident. Abbott and Zilla have joined the band [[Hellyeah]], and Lachman joined The Mercy Clinic.

== History ==
===Formation===
Guitarist [[Dimebag Darrell]] and drummer [[Vinnie Paul Abbott]] were not pleased with the difficulties heavy metal band [[Pantera]] was experiencing. Abbott described the performance of Pantera's vocalist, [[Phil Anselmo]], as either &quot;hit and miss, depending on what type of chemicals he was on.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Damageplan - This One's For You, Dimebag&quot;/&gt; Anselmo and bassist [[Rex Brown]] preferred contributing to their [[side project]]s and did not discuss or record Pantera material, while Darrell and Vinnie wanted to continue to write and play music. They thought it was time to move on and began writing new material.&lt;ref name=&quot;Damageplan - This One's For You, Dimebag&quot;&gt;{{cite web

A [[demo (music)|demo]] of the song &quot;Crawl&quot; was sent to former [[Halford (band)|Halford]] guitarist [[Pat Lachman]] who auditioned as vocalist. Lachman was hired, and Damageplan was formed in early 2003 with ex-Jerry Cantrell guitarist Shawn Matthews on bass initially, who was replaced after the album recording with the brothers' tattoo artist, [[Bob Zilla]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Updated: PANTERA, Ex-HALFORD Members Join Forces In NEW FOUND POWER&quot;&gt;{{cite web

Abbott found that during recording everyone was willing to contribute and &quot;put 100% effort into it&quot;, while with Pantera he found it difficult to get Anselmo in the recording studio.&lt;ref name=&quot;Interview With Damageplan Drummer Vinnie Abbott &quot;&gt;{{cite web

===Murder of Dimebag Darrell===
[[file:Dimebag 001.jpg|thumb|Fans pay tribute at The Alrosa Villa three days after the murder.]]
On December 8, 2004, Damageplan was on tour at the Alrosa Villa, a [[Columbus, Ohio]] [[nightclub]]. Moments into the concert, [[Nathan Gale]], a former U.S. Marine, climbed onto the stage and shot Darrell in the head multiple times. Head of Security for the band Jeffery &quot;Mayhem&quot; Thompson engaged in hand-to-hand combat with Gale, which allowed Vinnie Paul Abbott and other members to escape. Thompson, however, was killed. A fan named Nathan Bray attempted to give [[CPR]] to Thompson and Darrell, but was shot and killed by the gunman. [[Erin Halk]], a [[roadie]] and also a former U.S. Marine, was killed when he charged at Gale while the shooter was reloading. Once police arrived, officer James Niggemeyer approached the stage from the side and could see Gale holding a gun to a hostage. Niggemeyer killed Gale with a single shotgun blast to the head. 15 shots were fired by Gale, and an additional 36 rounds were found on his person.&lt;ref name=&quot;Three Years After Dimebag's Murder: Missed Opportunities Abound&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mom Of Concert Killer: He Was Sick&quot;/&gt;

A police investigation did not find a motive behind the shooting, although Gale's mother said that he suffered from [[paranoid schizophrenia]] and that he believed the brothers had stolen his lyrics while trying to steal his identity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mom Of Concert Killer: He Was Sick&quot;/&gt; She did not know if her son took the medication he was given for his condition, but was proud of his military service following his [[Military discharge|discharge]], and had given him the [[Beretta 92F]] that was used in the attacks. Major Jason Johnston, a Marine Corps spokesman at [[The Pentagon]], was unable to comment on Gale's discharge.&lt;ref name=&quot;Three Years After Dimebag's Murder: Missed Opportunities Abound&quot;&gt;{{cite web

In May 2005, Niggemeyer was called before a [[grand jury]], which was assembled by the [[Franklin County, Ohio|Franklin County]] [[prosecutor]]'s office to examine the actions taken that night, a standard practice when [[lethal force]] is used. The jury found there was no wrongdoing on Niggemeyer's part. Franklin County prosecutor Ron O'Brien commented, &quot;There was little doubt [the shooting] was lawful, given the 200 eyewitnesses and the circumstances that surrounded the shooting. Nevertheless, we still have an independent body review the facts&quot;. Niggemeyer was nominated for a bravery award on the TV show ''[[America's Most Wanted]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Officer Cleared In Shooting Of 'Dimebag' Darrell Abbott's Killer&quot;&gt;{{cite web

===Post-murder events===
In a 2005 interview, Damageplan manager Paul Bassman said unreleased recordings before Darrell's death were near completion. He commented, &quot;Vinnie Abbott has said there will be a follow-up album down the road, as Dime would have wanted his music to be heard.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;New Damageplan Recordings May Surface&quot;/&gt; Rumors circulated of another album, although nothing has been released.&lt;ref name=&quot;New Damageplan Recordings May Surface&quot;/&gt;
[[File:Hellyeah.PNG|thumb|left|Abbott and Zilla joined [[Hellyeah]] following Darrell's death.]]
Following the events of December 8, 2004 Abbott was unsure if he wanted to continue playing music. He was invited to join [[Hellyeah]], which included members of [[Mudvayne]] and [[Nothingface]], but declined the offer. However, bassist Jerry {{lang|eng|Montano}} repeatedly called Abbott and he accepted to join the project as he thought &quot;Everybody had their head in the right place.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;HELLYEAH - interview with Vinnie Abbott - May 2007&quot;&gt;{{cite web

Vocalist Lachman joined The Mercy Clinic, which aided the grieving process. He commented, &quot;you have to get back on the horse. You could easily let a decade go by and not do anything. I'm happy to have walked away with my life after the situation I was thrown into. But, I mean, what do you do? I'm a musician. I'm going to make music. What Dime would have told me was, 'You make music, motherfucker. Get back on it. Do what you do.'

A book titled ''[[A Vulgar Display Of Power|A Vulgar Display of Power: Courage and Carnage at the Alrosa Villa]]'' was penned by author Chris Arnold. For 14&amp;nbsp;months, Arnold interviewed people and researched the events leading up to December 8, stating &quot;It's not a book about rock stars, but heroes, regular guys who made the ultimate sacrifice.&quot; In his research, Arnold found no evidence that the comments Anselmo made before Darrell's death had influenced Gale's actions. The book was released in 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;A new, revealing book about the Murder of Dimebag Darrell&quot;&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=2008-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Themes explored on the album included the brothers' experiences, Darrell commented, &quot;the crumbling of one empire and then starting over ... So there are a lot of lyrics about being reborn in a sense, about it being a new day, moving forward, letting go of the past and becoming something new.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Damageplan - This One's For You, Dimebag&quot;/&gt; This is exemplified in the songs &quot;Reborn&quot;, &quot;Wake up&quot;, and &quot;Breathing New Life&quot;. &quot;Blunt Force Trauma&quot; is about when someone or something comes up behind you when you least expect it, &quot;it could be a situation in your life, it could be a person you know with a beer bottle&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Damageplan - This One's For You, Dimebag&quot;/&gt;

When writing music, Abbott and Darrell suggested [[guitar riff]]s and &quot;grooves&quot;, while Lachman added his input to modify the song's structure. The band's sound has been described by music critics to be similar to Pantera. Christine Klunk of ''[[PopMatters]]'' disliked the similarities and commented, &quot;aside from a constant, driving rhythm, repetitive riffs, and unintelligible lyrics about (I'm assuming) kicking ass&amp;mdash;there's nothing of interest to pay attention to&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Popmatters -  New Found Power&quot;/&gt; The song &quot;Breathing New Life&quot; features 180 [[beats-per-minute]] [[bass drum]] pedaling, what Vik Bansal of [[MusicOMH]] described as &quot;exploding into a blaze of riffage and a cool chorus&quot;. Bansal was impressed with certain elements of the song such as the switch from downbeat singing to &quot;a big chorus lodged in power chord heaven&quot;, and the incorporated groove rhythms. However, he felt Darrell &quot;borrows&quot;  [[Anthrax (band)|Anthrax]]'s guitar solo from the song &quot;Only&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Damageplan - New Found Power &quot;&gt;{{cite web
