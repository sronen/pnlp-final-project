'''Opeth''' is a Swedish [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band from [[Stockholm]], formed in 1990. Though the group has been through several personnel changes, [[singer]], [[guitarist]], and [[songwriter]] [[Mikael Åkerfeldt]] has remained Opeth's driving force throughout the years. Opeth has consistently incorporated [[progressive metal|progressive]], [[folk music|folk]], [[blues]], [[classical music|classical]] and [[jazz]] influences into their usually lengthy compositions, as well as noticeable influences from [[black metal]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chroniclesofchaos.com/reviews/albums/2-259_opeth_morningrise.aspx |title=CoC : Opeth – Morningrise : Review |publisher=Chroniclesofchaos.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[death metal]], most notably in their early works. Many songs include acoustic guitar passages and strong [[dynamics (music)|dynamic]] shifts, as well as both [[death growls]] and clean vocals. Opeth rarely made live appearances supporting their first four albums; but since conducting their first world tour after the 2001 release of ''[[Blackwater Park]]'', they have led several major world tours.

Opeth has released ten studio albums, three live DVDs, three live albums (two that are in conjunction with DVDs), and two boxsets. The band released its debut album ''[[Orchid (album)|Orchid]]'' in 1995. Although their eighth studio album, ''[[Ghost Reveries]]'', was quite popular in the United States, Opeth did not experience major American commercial success until the 2008 release of their ninth studio album, ''[[Watershed (Opeth album)|Watershed]]'', which peaked at number twenty-three on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], and topped the Finnish albums chart in its first week of release.

==History==
===Formation (1990–1993)===
[[Image:Mikael Åkerfeldt 2005 by JeroenMassar.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Åkerfeldt (pictured) and Isberg decided they would carry on with the band after most of the members had gone separate ways.]]

Opeth was formed as a [[death metal]] band in the autumn of 1990 in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]] by vocalist [[David Isberg]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Metal Hammer&quot;&gt;{{cite journal| month=January |year=2008 |author=McIver, Joel |title=Pressing the Red Button |journal=[[Metal Hammer]] |accessdate=2008-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Isberg asked former Eruption band member [[Mikael Åkerfeldt]] to join Opeth as a bassist. When Åkerfeldt showed up to practice the day after Isberg invited him, it became clear that Isberg had not told the band members, including the band's current bassist, that Åkerfeldt would be joining. An ensuing argument led to all members but Isberg and Åkerfeldt leaving to form a new project.&lt;ref name=&quot;Metal Hammer&quot;/&gt; The band name was derived from the word &quot;Opet,&quot; taken from the [[Wilbur Smith]] novel ''The Sunbird''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Furteeng&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Watt, Erika Kristen |date=2005-07-05 |url=http://www.fourteeng.net/opeth.html |title=Interview Mikael Åkerfeldt |publisher=Furteeng.net |accessdate=2008-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this novel, Opet is the name of a fictional [[Phoenicia]]n city in South Africa whose name is translated as &quot;City of the Moon&quot; in the book.

Isberg and Åkerfeldt recruited drummer [[Anders Nordin]], bassist Nick Döring, and guitarist Andreas Dimeo. Unsatisfied with Opeth's slow progress, Döring and Dimeo left the band after their first performance,&lt;ref name=&quot;Chapter 2&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Åkerfeldt, Mikael |url=http://www.opeth.com/biography/chapter2.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080124065223/http://www.opeth.com/biography/chapter2.html |archivedate=2008-01-24 |title=Opeth chapter 2 |publisher=Opeth.com |accessdate=2008-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and were replaced by guitarist Kim Pettersson and bassist [[Johan DeFarfalla]]. After the next show, DeFarfalla left Opeth to spend time with his girlfriend in [[Germany]], and was replaced by Åkerfeldt's friend, bassist [[Peter Lindgren (musician)|Peter Lindgren]]. Rhythm guitarist Kim Pettersson left following the band's next performance, and Lindgren switched to guitar. David Isberg quit in 1992 because of creative differences.&lt;ref name=&quot;Metal Hammer&quot;/&gt;

With three members in the band, Åkerfeldt took over vocal duties and the trio spent the next year writing and rehearsing new material. The group began to rely less on the [[blast beat]]s and aggression typical of death metal, and incorporated [[acoustic guitar]]s and guitar harmonies into their music; developing the core sound of Opeth. Stefan Guteklint joined on bass in 1991, but was dismissed by the band after they signed their first record deal with [[Candlelight Records]] in 1994. Opeth initially employed former member DeFarfalla as a session bassist for their demo recordings, and he went on to join on a full-time basis following the release of Opeth's debut album in 1995.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chapter 2&quot;/&gt;

Opeth recorded its debut album, ''[[Orchid (album)|Orchid]]'', with producer [[Dan Swanö]] in April 1994. Because of distribution problems with the newly formed Candlelight Records, the album was not released until May 15, 1995, and only in Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;AMG Bio&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=DaRonco, Mike |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p214051|pure_url=yes}} |title=All Music Opeth Bio |publisher=Allmusic |accessdate=2008-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Orchid'' tested the boundaries of traditional death metal, featuring acoustic guitars, piano, and clean vocals. [[Allmusic]] called ''Orchid'' &quot;brilliant,&quot; &quot;startlingly unique,&quot; and &quot;a far-beyond-epic prog/death monstrosity exuding equal parts beauty and brutality.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Serba, John |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r277899|pure_url=yes}} |title=''Orchid'' review |publisher=[[Allmusic]] |accessdate=2008-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a few live shows in the [[United Kingdom]], Opeth returned to the studio in March 1996 to begin work on a second album, again produced by Dan Swanö.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite album-notes| bandname=Opeth |title=My Arms, Your Hearse |year=1995 |publisher=[[Candlelight Records]] |last=Åkerfeldt |first=Mikael|accessdate=2008-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album was named ''[[Morningrise]]'', and was released in Europe on June 24, 1996. With only five songs, but lasting 66&amp;nbsp;minutes; it features Opeth's longest song, the twenty-minute &quot;Black Rose Immortal&quot;. ''Morningrise'' was a huge success, with Allmusic giving the album four stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=York, William |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r650264|pure_url=yes}} |title=''Morningrise'' review |publisher=[[Allmusic]] |accessdate=2008-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opeth toured the UK in support of ''Morningrise'', followed by a 26-date [[Scandinavia]]n tour with [[Cradle of Filth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.komodorock.com/tour-news/tour-dates/opeth-and-arch-enemy-to-headline-metal-hammer's-defenders-of-the-faith-tour-200711162643/ |title=Opeth And Arch Enemy To Headline Metal Hammer's Defenders Of The Faith Tour |publisher=Komodorock.com |date=2007-11-16 |accessdate=2008-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; While on tour, Opeth attracted the attention of [[Century Media Records]], who signed the band and released the first two albums in the United States in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000005HN6 &quot;Orchid Opeth&quot;].

After the tour, Åkerfeldt and Lindgren dismissed DeFarfalla for personal reasons, without the consent of Nordin. When Åkerfeldt informed Nordin, who was on a vacation in Brazil, Nordin left the band and remained in Brazil for personal reasons.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chapter 4&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Åkerfeldt, Mikael |url=http://www.opeth.com/biography/chapter4.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080205072405/http://www.opeth.com/biography/chapter4.html |archivedate=2008-02-05 |title=Opeth Chapter 4 |publisher=Opeth.com |accessdate=2008-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former [[Amon Amarth]] drummer [[Martin Lopez|Martín López]] responded to a newspaper ad placed by Åkerfeldt and joined Opeth in 1997. López made his debut with Opeth playing on a cover version of [[Iron Maiden]]'s &quot;[[Remember Tomorrow]]&quot;, which was included on the album ''[[A Call to Irons: A Tribute to Iron Maiden]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;AMG Call to Irons&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Hundey, Jason |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r346670|pure_url=yes}} |title=All Music ''A Call to Irons'' Review |publisher=Allmusic.com |accessdate=2008-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With a larger recording budget from Century Media, Opeth began work on its third album, with noted Swedish producer [[Fredrik Nordström]], at [[Studio Fredman]] in August 1997. The band added bassist [[Martin Mendez|Martín Méndez]] shortly before recording, but due to time constraints Åkerfeldt played bass on the album.&lt;ref name=&quot;McCoe&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=McCoe, Scott |url=http://www.metalupdate.com/interviewopeth.html |title=Interview with Mikael Åkerfeldt |publisher=Metalupdate.com |accessdate=2008-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[My Arms, Your Hearse]]'' was released to critical acclaim on August 18, 1998.&lt;ref name=&quot;AMG Bio&quot;/&gt; As Opeth's first international release, the album exposed the band to a wider global audience. ''My Arms, Your Hearse'' marked the beginning of a shift in the band's sound.

In 1999, the ownership of Candlelight Records changed hands, with owner and friend of the band Lee Barrett leaving the company. Opeth signed with UK label [[Peaceville Records]] in Europe, which was distributed by [[Music For Nations]].  Opeth reserved time at Studio Fredman to begin work on its next album, but recording was postponed while the studio was relocated. Due to time constraints, the band was able to rehearse only twice before entering the studio.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chapter 4&quot;/&gt; Delays with the album's artwork pushed the release back an additional month and ''[[Still Life (Opeth album)|Still Life]]'' was released on October 18, 1999.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chapter 4&quot;/&gt; Due to problems with the band's new distribution network, the album was not released in the United States until February 2001. ''Still Life'' was the first album recorded with Méndez, and also the first Opeth album to bear any kind of caption on the front cover upon its initial release, including the band's logo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.opeth.com/biography/logo_01.html| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20040221013513/http://www.opeth.com/biography/logo_01.html| archivedate=2004-02-21 | title=Current logo | publisher=Opeth.com | accessdate=2008-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allmusic called ''Still Life'' a &quot;formidable splicing of harsh, often jagged guitar riffs with graceful melodies.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Rivadavia, Eduardo |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r521354|pure_url=yes}} |title=''Still Life'' review |publisher=[[Allmusic]] |accessdate=2008-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; As explained by Åkerfeldt, ''Still Life'' is a [[concept album]], &quot;The main character is kind of banished from his hometown because he hasn't got the same faith as the rest of the inhabitants there. The album pretty much starts off when he is returning after several years to hook up with his old &quot;babe.&quot; The big bosses of the town know that he's back... A lot of bad things start happening.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;McCoe&quot;/&gt;

Following a few live dates in Europe, Opeth returned to [[Studio Fredman]] to begin work on its next album, with [[Porcupine Tree]]'s [[Steven Wilson]] producing. The band sought to recreate the recording experience of ''Still Life'', and again entered the studio with minimal rehearsals, and no lyrics written. &quot;This time it was tough,&quot; Åkerfeldt said, &quot;I feel pleasantly blown away by the immense result, though. It was indeed worth the effort.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Chapter 5&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Åkerfeldt, Mikael |url=http://www.opeth.com/biography/chapter5.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080205072409/http://www.opeth.com/biography/chapter5.html |archivedate=2008-02-05 |title=Opeth Chapter 5 |publisher=Opeth.com |accessdate=2008-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Wilson also pushed the band to expand its sound, incorporating new sounds and production techniques. &quot;Steve guided us into the realms of 'strange' noises for guitars and voice,&quot; Åkerfeldt said.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chapter 5&quot;/&gt;

Opeth released its fifth studio album, ''[[Blackwater Park]]'', on February 21, 2001. Allmusic called ''Blackwater Park'' &quot;astounding, a work of breathtaking creative breadth,&quot; noting that the album &quot;keeps with Opeth's tradition by transcending the limits of death/black metal and repeatedly shattering the foundations of conventional songwriting.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;BWPR&quot;&gt;{{cite web| last= Rivadavia |first= Eduardo |title=''Blackwater Park'' review |publisher= [[Allmusic]] |url= {{Allmusic|class=album|id=r517973|pure_url=yes}} |accessdate= 2007-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In support of ''Blackwater Park'', Opeth embarked on its first world tour, headlined Europe for the first time, and made an appearance at the 2001 [[Wacken Open Air]] festival in [[Germany]], playing to a crowd of 60,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.wacken.com/en/woa2008/main-history/woa-2001/| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080324192603/http://www.wacken.com/en/woa2008/main-history/woa-2001/| archivedate=2008-03-24|title=History of Wacken Open Air 2001 |publisher=Wacken.com |accessdate=2008-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opeth returned home after touring in support of ''Blackwater Park'', and began writing for the next album. At first, Åkerfeldt had trouble putting together new material: &quot;I wanted to write something heavier than we'd ever done, still I had all these great mellow parts and arrangements which I didn't want to go to waste.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Chapter 7&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Åkerfeldt, Mikael |url=http://www.opeth.com/biography/chapter7.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071231032512/http://www.opeth.com/biography/chapter7.html |archivedate=2007-12-31 |title=Opeth Chapter 7 |publisher=Opeth.com |accessdate=2008-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jonas Renkse]] of [[Katatonia]], a long-time friend of Åkerfeldt, suggested writing music for two separate albums—one heavy and one soft.&lt;ref name=&quot;Metal Hammer&quot;/&gt;

Excited at the prospect, Åkerfeldt agreed without consulting his band mates or record label. While his band mates liked the idea of recording two separate albums, Åkerfeldt had to convince the label: &quot;I had to lie somewhat... saying that we could do this recording very soon, it won't cost more than a regular single album.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Chapter 7&quot;/&gt; With most of the material written, the band rehearsed just once before entering Nacksving Studios in 2002, and again with producer Steven Wilson in Studio Fredman. Under pressure to complete both albums simultaneously, Åkerfeldt said the recording process was &quot;the toughest test of our history.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Åkerfeldt, Mikael. [http://www.opeth.com/index.php/biography/show/tpl/chapter-viii &quot;Opeth Chapter VIII&quot;]. Opeth.com. Retrieved 2011-08-26.&lt;/ref&gt; After recording basic tracks, the band moved production to England to first mix the heavy album, ''[[Deliverance (Opeth album)|Deliverance]]'', with [[Andy Sneap]] at Backstage Studios. &quot;''Deliverance'' was so poorly recorded, without any organisation whatsoever,&quot; Åkerfeldt claimed, that Sneap &quot;is credited as a 'saviour' in the sleeve, as he surely saved much of the recording.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Chapter 8&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Åkerfeldt, Mikael |url=http://opeth.com/biography/chapter8.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080205072419/http://opeth.com/biography/chapter8.html |archivedate=2008-02-05 |title=Opeth Chapter 8 |publisher=Opeth.com |accessdate=2008-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Deliverance'' was released on November 4, 2002, and debuted at number&amp;nbsp;19 on the US Top Independent Albums chart, marking the band's first US chart appearance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Billboard&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/opeth/chart-history/185507?f=326&amp;g=Albums#/artist/opeth/chart-history/185507?f=326&amp;g=Albums |title=Artist Chart History – Opeth |publisher=[[Billboard charts|Billboard.com]] |accessdate=2010-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allmusic stated, &quot;''Deliverance'' is altogether more subtle than any of its predecessors, approaching listeners with haunting nuances and masterful dynamics rather than overwhelming them with sheer mass and complexity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Rivadavia, Eduardo |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r614742|pure_url=yes}} |title=''Deliverance'' review |publisher=[[Allmusic]] |accessdate=2008-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opeth performed a one-off concert in Stockholm, then returned to the UK to finish recording vocals for the second of the two albums, ''[[Damnation (album)|Damnation]]'', at Steven Wilson's No Man's Land Studios.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=6471 |title=Opeth finalize track listing, cover artwork for ''Deliverance'' |publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]] |date=2002-09-29 |accessdate=2008-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although Åkerfeldt believed the band could not finish both albums, Opeth completed ''Deliverance'' and ''Damnation'' in just seven weeks of studio time, which was the same amount spent on ''Blackwater Park'' alone.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chapter 7&quot;/&gt;  ''Damnation'' was released on April 14, 2003, and garnered the band its first appearance on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] at number 192.&lt;ref name=&quot;Billboard&quot;/&gt;  The album also won the 2003 Swedish [[Grammy]] Award for Best Hard Rock Performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://legacy.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=9821|title=Opeth win Swedish Grammy! |publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]] |accessdate=2008-03-06|date=2003-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The band embarked on its biggest tour yet, playing nearly 200&amp;nbsp;shows in 2003 and 2004.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chapter 8&quot;/&gt;  Opeth performed three special shows in [[Europe]] with two song lists each—one acoustic set and one heavy set. The band recorded its first [[DVD]], ''[[Lamentations (Live at Shepherd's Bush Empire 2003)]]'', at [[Shepherd's Bush Empire]] in [[London]], [[England]]. The DVD features a two-hour performance, including the entire ''Damnation'' album, several songs from ''Deliverance'' and ''Blackwater Park'', and a one-hour documentary about the recording of ''Deliverance'' and ''Damnation''. ''Lamentations'' was certified [[Canadian Recording Industry Association|Gold]] in [[Canada]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CRIA&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = CRIA Searchable Database| url = http://www.cria.ca/cert_db_search.php | publisher = [[Canadian Recording Industry Association]]| accessdate = 2008-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opeth was scheduled to perform in [[Jordan]] without a crew due to the fear of terrorist attacks in the [[Middle East]]. Opeth's tour manager distributed 6,000 tickets for the concert, but before the band left for Jordan, drummer Lopez called Åkerfeldt stating he was having an [[anxiety attack]] and could not perform, forcing the band to cancel the show.&lt;ref name=&quot;OPETH Mainman Talks About Drummer's Anxiety Attacks&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Opeth Mainman Talks About Drummer's Anxiety Attacks |publisher=Blabbermouth.net |date=2005-03-10 |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/Blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=20205 |accessdate=2008-03-12}} {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Chapter 9&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Åkerfeldt, Mikael |url=http://www.opeth.com/biography/chapter9.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080116165815/http://www.opeth.com/biography/chapter9.html |archivedate=2008-01-16 |title=Opeth Chapter 9 |publisher=Opeth.com |accessdate=2008-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2004, Lopez was sent home from Canada after more anxiety attacks on tour.

Lopez returned to Opeth for the Seattle show on the final leg of the ''Deliverance'' and ''Damnation'' tour. [[Per Wiberg]] also joined the band on tour to perform keyboards, and after more than a year on tour, Opeth returned home to start writing new material in 2004.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chapter 8&quot;/&gt; Opeth finished writing material for its eighth album in late 2004.

On May 12, 2006, Martin Lopez announced that he had officially parted ways with Opeth due to health problems, and was replaced by [[Martin Axenrot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author= Morrone, Donald |url=http://www.mooropeth.com/interviewJan06.php |title= Interview with Peter Lindgren |publisher = The Moor |month =January | year =2006 |accessdate=2008-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opeth toured on the main stage of [[Gigantour]] in 2006, alongside [[Megadeth]].&lt;!-- Do not add other bands that were on Gigantour. --&gt; ''Ghost Reveries'' was re-released on October 31, 2006, with a bonus [[cover version|cover song]] ([[Deep Purple]]'s &quot;Soldier of Fortune&quot;) and a DVD featuring a [[5.1 surround sound]] mix of the album (along with a documentary on the making of the record).  A recording of Opeth's live performance at the [[Roundhouse (venue)|Camden Roundhouse]], in London, on November 9, 2006, was released as the double [[live album]] ''[[The Roundhouse Tapes]]''.

On May 17, 2007, Peter Lindgren announced he would be leaving Opeth after 16&amp;nbsp;years. &quot;The decision has been the toughest I've ever made but it is the right one to make at this point in my life,&quot; Lindgren said. &quot;I feel that I simply have lost some of the enthusiasm and inspiration needed to participate in a band that has grown from a few guys playing the music we love to a worldwide industry.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lindgren quits&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=72714 |title=Guitarist Peter Lindgren Quits Opeth; Replacement Announced |date=2007-06-17 |publisher=Blabbermouth.com |accessdate=2008-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ex-[[Arch Enemy]] guitarist [[Fredrik Åkesson]] replaced Lindgren, as Åkerfeldt explained:
{{Quote|&quot;Fredrik was the only name that popped up thinking about a replacement for Peter. In my opinion he's one of the top three guitar players out of Sweden. We all get along great as we've known each other for maybe four years and he already has the experience to take on the circus-like lifestyle we lead as members of Opeth.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lindgren quits&quot;/&gt;}}

After nearly 200&amp;nbsp;performances in support of ''Ghost Reveries'', Opeth entered Fascination Street Studios with Åkerfeldt producing, in November 2007 for their ninth studio album.

''Watershed'' debuted on the [[Australia]]n [[ARIA Charts|ARIA album charts]] at number seven and at number one on [[Finland]]'s official album chart.

Opeth went on a worldwide tour in support of the album.

Opeth wrote and recorded the new track, &quot;The Throat of Winter&quot;, which appeared on the digital EP soundtrack of the video game, ''[[God of War III]]''. Åkerfeldt described the song as &quot;odd&quot; and &quot;not very metal.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=52544&amp;comments=1 |title=Mikael Akerfeldt Comments On Recording God Of War 3 Song |date=January 30, 2010 |publisher=Metal Underground |accessdate=2010-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To celebrate their 20th anniversary, Opeth performed a six-show, worldwide tour called ''Evolution XX: An Opeth Anthology'', from March 30 through April 9, 2010. ''[[Blackwater Park]]'' was performed in its entirety, along with several songs never before performed. Åkerfeldt stated, &quot;I can’t believe it, but, fuck, we’re celebrating 20 years. I’ve been in this band ever since I was 16. It’s insane.&quot; A special edition of ''Blackwater Park'' was released on the March 29, 2010, to coincide with the tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/news/Opeth-To-Celebrate-20th-Anniversary-in-2010-20755.aspx |title=Opeth to Celebrate 20th Anniversary in 2010 |publisher=Roadrunner Records |date=December 3, 2009 |accessdate=2010-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Influences===
As Opeth's primary songwriter and lyricist, vocalist/guitarist Mikael Åkerfeldt heads the direction of Opeth's sound. Åkerfeldt is also the only remaining original member, influenced at a young age by heavy metal bands such as [[Iron Maiden]], [[Slayer]], [[Death (metal band)|Death]], [[Black Sabbath]], [[Celtic Frost]], [[King Diamond]], [[Morbid Angel]], and most importantly [[Judas Priest]]. Åkerfeldt considers ''[[Sad Wings of Destiny]]'' the best metal album of all time, and notes that there was a time when he only listened to Judas Priest. Åkerfeldt sings &quot;Here Come the Tears&quot; by Judas Priest before most Opeth concerts while warming up.&lt;ref name=&quot;chroniclesofchaos1&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Azevedo, Pedro |url=http://www.chroniclesofchaos.com/articles/chats/1-176_opeth.aspx |title=Born Within Sorrow's Mask |publisher=Chroniclesofchaos.com |accessdate=2008-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MA influences&quot;&gt;{{cite web| date=2006-02-24 |url=http://wnhumetal.com/radio/content/view/110/38/ |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080126222900/http://wnhumetal.com/radio/content/view/110/38/ |archivedate=2008-01-26 |title=Interview with Mikael Åkerfeldt or Opeth |publisher=Wnhumetal.com |accessdate=2008-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;When it Rains it Pours&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hailmetal.com/gate.html?name=MReviews&amp;op=show&amp;rid=83|title=Opeth: Interview with Mikael Åkerfeldt|date=28 December 2004|publisher=HailMetal.com|accessdate=22 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Genre and sound===
Åkerfeldt later discovered [[progressive rock]] and [[folk music]], both of which had a profound impact on the sound of the band.&lt;ref name=&quot;AMG overview&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p214051|pure_url=yes}} |title=Opeth overview |publisher=Allmusic |accessdate=2008-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opeth's distinct sound mixes [[death metal]] with [[progressive rock]].&lt;ref name=&quot;revelationzDamnation&quot;&gt;{{cite web| last=Hash |first= Tommy |title= Opeth – ''Damnation'' |publisher= RevelationZ Magazine |date=2003-05-22 |url= http://www.revelationz.net/index.asp?ID=724 |accessdate=2007-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{dead link|date=October 2011}}&lt;ref name=&quot;stylusreview&quot;&gt;{{cite web| last= Lee |first= Cosmo |title= ''Ghost Reveries'' Review |publisher= Stylus Magazine |date=2005-09-13 |url=http://www.stylusmagazine.com/reviews/opeth/ghost-reveries.htm |accessdate=2008-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In his review of Opeth's 2001 album ''[[Blackwater Park]]'', Allmusic's Eduardo Rivadavia wrote; &quot;Tracks start and finish in seemingly arbitrary fashion, usually traversing ample musical terrain, including acoustic guitar and solo piano passages, ambient soundscapes, [[stoner rock]] grooves, and Eastern-tinged melodies—any of which are subject to savage punctuations of death metal fury at any given moment.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;BWPR&quot;/&gt; Åkerfeldt commented on the diversity of Opeth's music:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;I don't see the point of playing in a band and going just one way when you can do everything. It would be impossible for us to play just death metal; that is our roots, but we are now a mishmash of everything, and not purists to any form of music. It's impossible for us to do that, and quite frankly I would think of it as boring to be in a band that plays just metal music. We're not afraid to experiment, or to be caught with our pants down, so to speak. That's what keeps us going.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Opeth frontman on being 'different' |publisher=[[Metal Hammer]] |date=2006-10-30 |url=http://www.metalhammer.co.uk/news/?id=45633 |accessdate=2008-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Vocals===
Vocally, Åkerfeldt shifts between traditional [[Death growl|death metal vocals]] for heavy sections, and clean, sometimes whispered vocals over mellow passages. While his death growls were dominant on early releases, later efforts incorporate more clean vocals, with both ''Damnation'' and ''Heritage'' featuring only clean singing.&lt;ref name=&quot;When it Rains it Pours&quot;/&gt; Rivadavia noted that &quot;Åkerfeldt's vocals run the gamut from bowel-churning grunts to melodies of chilling beauty—depending on each movement section's mood.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;BWPR&quot;/&gt;
