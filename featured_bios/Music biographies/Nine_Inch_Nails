'''Nine Inch Nails''' (abbreviated as '''NIN''', sometimes stylized as '''NIИ''') is an American [[industrial rock]] project, founded in 1988 by [[Trent Reznor]] in [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]], [[Ohio]]. As its main [[producer (music)|producer]], singer, songwriter, and instrumentalist, Reznor is the only official member of Nine Inch Nails and remains solely responsible for its direction.&lt;ref name = &quot;AMG&quot;&gt;{{cite web

After recording a new album, Reznor (until the 2009 [[Wave Goodbye Tour]]) usually assembles [[Nine Inch Nails live performances|a live band]] to perform with him. The touring band features a revolving lineup that often rearranges songs to fit a live setting. On stage, Nine Inch Nails often employs visual elements to accompany performances, which frequently include light shows.&lt;ref name = &quot;Reimink&quot;&gt;{{Cite news

In 2004, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' placed Nine Inch Nails at 94 on its list of the 100 greatest artists of all time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowie&quot; /&gt; Despite this acclaim, the band has had several feuds with the corporate side of the recording industry. In 2007, these corporate entanglements resulted in Reznor announcing that Nine Inch Nails would split from its label and release future material independently.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBFreeAgent&quot; /&gt;

Since 1989, Nine Inch Nails has made eight major studio releases. The most recent releases, ''[[Ghosts I–IV]]'' and ''[[The Slip (album)|The Slip]]'', both released in 2008, were released under [[Creative Commons]] licenses ([[BY-NC-SA]]). Both were initially released digitally, with physical releases coming later. The digital release of ''The Slip'' was made available completely free of charge. Nine Inch Nails has been nominated for twelve [[Grammy Award]]s and won twice for the songs &quot;[[Wish (song)|Wish]]&quot; and &quot;[[Happiness in Slavery]]&quot;, in 1992 and 1995 respectively.

Reznor asked [[Sean Beavan]] to mix the demos of ''Pretty Hate Machine'', which had received multiple offers for record deals.&lt;ref&gt;Huxley (1997), p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;  He mixed sound during Nine Inch Nails' live concerts for so many years, eventually becoming an unofficial member of the live band, even singing live backup vocals from his place at the mixing console.&lt;ref&gt;Huxley (1997), p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; Reznor later invited Beavan to work on ''[[The Downward Spiral]]'' as well as mix several songs on [[Marilyn Manson (band)|Marilyn Manson]]'s debut album ''[[Portrait of an American Family]]'', both released in 1994.&lt;ref name=&quot;NIN Spin 1996&quot; /&gt; After contributing to several Nine Inch Nails remix releases (including the &quot;[[Closer to God]]&quot; single), he mixed and co-produced Marilyn Manson's ''[[Antichrist Superstar]]'' in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;Huxley (1997), p. 167&lt;/ref&gt;

Three music videos were created in promotion of the album. [[MTV]] aired the videos for &quot;Down in It&quot; and &quot;Head Like a Hole&quot;, but an explicit video for &quot;Sin&quot; was only released in partial form on the 1997 home video ''[[Closure (Nine Inch Nails VHS)|Closure]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Huxley (1997), p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; The original version of the &quot;Down in It&quot; video ended with the implication that Reznor's character had fallen off a building and died in the street. This footage attracted the attention of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]]. As Reznor explains in an interview with ''Convulsion Magazine'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;There was a scene w[h]ere I was lying on the ground, appearing to be dead, in a ''[[Lodger (album)|Lodger]]''-esque pose and we had a camera with a big weather balloon filled with helium hooked up to it... the first one we did, we started the film, I was laying on the ground and the ropes that were holding the balloon snapped, the camera just took off into the atmosphere... the camera landed two hundred miles away in a farmer's field somewhere. He finds it and takes it to the police, thinking that it's a surveillance camera for marijuana, they develop the film and think that it's some sort of snuff film of a murder, give it to the FBI and have pathologists looking at the body saying, 'yeah, he's rotting,' (I had corn starch on me, right) 'he's been decomposing for 3 weeks.' You could see the other members of the band walking away and they had these weird outfits on, and they thought it was some kind of gang slaying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 1989, while doing promotion for the album, the band were asked what shows they would like to appear on. The band jokingly replied (possibly while intoxicated) that they would like to appear on [[Dance Party USA]], as it was the most absurd option they could think of at the time. Much to their surprise, they were booked on the show, and made an appearance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gawker.com/5897544/heres-video-of-nine-inch-nails-performing-on-dance-party-usa-22-years-ago Here's Video of Nine Inch Nails Performing on Dance Party USA 22 Years Ago].

In 1990, Nine Inch Nails began the ''[[Pretty Hate Machine Tour Series]]'', in which they toured North America as an opening act for [[alternative rock]] artists such as [[Peter Murphy (musician)|Peter Murphy]] and [[The Jesus and Mary Chain]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AMG&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Huxley (1997), p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; At some point, Reznor began [[Instrument destruction|smashing his equipment]] while on stage; ''Rockbeat'' interviewer Mike Gitter attributed the live band's early success in front of rock oriented audiences to this aggressive attitude.&lt;ref name = &quot;Rockbeat&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|title= The man behind the machine |author= Gitter, Mike |journal= Rockbeat |year= 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nine Inch Nails then embarked on a world tour that continued through the first [[Lollapalooza]] festival in 1991.&lt;ref name=&quot;NIN Spin 1996&quot; /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;We made it very clear we were not doing another record for TVT. But they made it pretty clear they weren't ready to sell. So I felt like, well, I've finally got this thing going but it's dead. Flood and I had to record ''Broken'' under a different band name, because if TVT found out we were recording, they could confiscate all our shit and release it. [[Jimmy Iovine]] got involved with Interscope, and we kind of got slave-traded. It wasn't my doing. I didn't know anything about Interscope. And I was real pissed off at him at first because it was going from one bad situation to potentially another one. But Interscope went into it like they really wanted to know what I wanted. It was good, after I put my raving lunatic act on.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;NIN Spin 1996&quot; /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1992 Nine Inch Nails released ''Broken'' ([[Nothing Records]]' [[Nothing Records discography|first album ever]]),&lt;ref&gt;Huxley (1997), p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;  an [[extended play|EP]] featuring six songs and two bonus tracks, famously providing the act's first charting appearance in the Top 10.&lt;ref name=&quot;NIN Spin 1996&quot; /&gt; In the [[liner notes]], Reznor credited the 1991 [[List of Nine Inch Nails live-band members|Nine Inch Nails touring band]] as an influence on the EP's sound.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Broken (EP)|Broken]]'' ([[Interscope Records]]/[[Nothing Records|nothing]]/TVT, September 22, 1992) packaging; liner notes.&lt;/ref&gt; Reznor characterized ''Broken'' as a guitar-based &quot;blast of destruction&quot;, and as &quot;a lot harder [...] than ''Pretty Hate Machine''&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shock&quot; /&gt; Songs from ''Broken'' earned Nine Inch Nails both of its two Grammy Awards: a performance of the EP's first single &quot;[[Happiness in Slavery]]&quot; from [[Woodstock '94]],&lt;ref name = &quot;AwardsDatabase&quot; /&gt; and the second single &quot;[[Wish (song)|Wish]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;AwardsDatabase&quot; /&gt; Reznor later joked that his epitaph should read: &quot;REZNOR: Died.

When it was finished, Trent thought the front part of the mix didn't fit the EP, so he just used the ending. I'm glad it's on his website.

The album was anchored by two singles, &quot;[[March of the Pigs]]&quot; and &quot;[[Closer (Nine Inch Nails song)|Closer]]&quot;, along with &quot;[[Hurt (Nine Inch Nails song)|Hurt]]&quot; and &quot;[[Piggy (song)|Piggy]]&quot; which were issued to radio without a commercial single release.&lt;ref&gt;Huxley (1997), p. 111&lt;/ref&gt; All singles did not top any charts, only to have &quot;Closer&quot; peak at number 41 at the ''[[Billboard Hot 100]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Huxley (1997), p. 120&lt;/ref&gt;  

The music video for &quot;Closer&quot; was directed by [[Mark Romanek]] and received frequent rotation on MTV, though the network made extensive edits to the original version, which they perceived to be too graphic. That video shows events in what appears to be a 19th century-style [[Mad Scientist|mad-scientist's]] laboratory that deals with religion, sexuality, animal cruelty, politics, and terror. What many people noted to be controversial imagery included a nude bald woman with a [[crucifix]] mask, a monkey tied to a [[cross]], a pig's head spinning on some type of machine, a diagram of a [[vulva]], Reznor wearing an [[Sadomasochism|S&amp;M]] mask while swinging in shackles, and of him wearing a [[ball gag]]. &lt;ref name=&quot;Closer video&quot;&gt;{{cite web

According to Reznor, ''The Fragile'' was conceived by making &quot;songwriting and arranging and production and sound design [...] the same thing. A song would start with a drum loop or a visual and eventually a song would emerge out of it and that was the song.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Reznor acknowledged in ''Spin'' magazine that &quot;[[Down in It]]&quot; was influenced by early [[Skinny Puppy]], particularly their song &quot;[[Dig It (Skinny Puppy song)|Dig It]]&quot;; other songs from ''Pretty Hate Machine'' were described in the same interview as [[synthpop]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Reznor is the sole official member of Nine Inch Nails. However, he has typically formed a backing group of musicians to perform the songs in a live setting.

The lineup of the live band had a tendency to change drastically between major tours: aside from Reznor remaining on lead vocals, keyboards and guitar, no member of the live band had remained constant since its inception. Reznor cited the long gestation period between studio albums as part of the reason for these frequent personnel changes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode

}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as his desire for fresh interpretations of his music. In 2009, the final incarnation of the live band featured Reznor with [[Robin Finck]] (besides Reznor, Finck has played on the most tours), [[Justin Meldal-Johnsen]], and [[Ilan Rubin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Corporate entanglements==
Reznor is an outspoken critic of the music industry, particularly corporate influence on his artistic freedom. As a result, Nine Inch Nails has clashed with several corporations, culminating in a decision to proceed as a free agent without any recording label contracts.&lt;ref&gt;Huxley (1997), p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disputes with TVT Records===
{{See also|Trent Reznor vs. TVT Records feud}}
In the early 1990s, Nine Inch Nails was involved in a much-publicized feud with TVT Records, the first record label to sign the band. Reznor objected to the label's attempted interference with his intellectual property.&lt;ref name = &quot;Shock&quot; /&gt; Ultimately, they entered into a joint venture with Interscope Records in which Reznor forfeited a portion of his publishing rights to TVT Music in exchange for the freedom of having his own [[Nothing Records]] imprint.&lt;ref&gt;Huxley (1997), p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, Reznor sued his former friend and manager John Malm, co-founder of Nothing, for fraud, breach of contract and fiduciary duty, and other claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

At the behest of [[Prudential Financial|Prudential Securities]] bankruptcy proceedings, TVT put the rights to Reznor's recordings for the label on auction in 2005. This offer included the whole TVT catalog, including ''Pretty Hate Machine'' and a percentage of royalties from Reznor's song publishing company, Leaving Hope Music/TVT Music. [[Rykodisc]], which did not win the auction but was able to license the rights from Prudential, reissued the out-of-print ''Pretty Hate Machine'' CD on November 22, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The label considered releasing a deluxe edition, just as Interscope had done for ''The Downward Spiral''. They were influenced by Reznor and liked the idea, but did not want to pay him for the album and the idea was scrapped.&lt;ref name = &quot;Toronto Sun&quot;&gt;{{cite web

===Disputes with Universal Music Group===
In May 2007, Reznor made a post on the official Nine Inch Nails website, which was skeptical of [[Universal Music Group]] (parent company of Nine Inch Nails' record label, [[Interscope Records]]) for their pricing and distribution plans for ''Year Zero.''&lt;ref name=&quot;RollingStoneKreps&quot;&gt;{{cite web

Reznor announced on October 8, 2007 that Nine Inch Nails had fulfilled its contractual commitments to Interscope Records and was now free to proceed as a &quot;totally free agent, free of any recording contract with any label&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBFreeAgent&quot;&gt;{{cite web

In another post on his website, Reznor again openly criticized Universal Music Group for preventing him from launching an official interactive fan remix website. Universal declined to host the site just days before its scheduled launch, citing the potential &quot;accusation&quot;, in Reznor's words, &quot;that they are sponsoring the same technical violation of copyright they are suing [other media companies] for&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Disputes with other corporations===
Nine Inch Nails was scheduled to perform at the 2005 [[MTV Movie Awards]], but withdrew from the show due to a disagreement with the network over the use of an unaltered image of [[George W. Bush]] as a backdrop to the band's performance of &quot;[[The Hand that Feeds]]&quot;. Soon afterwards, Reznor wrote on his official website: &quot;apparently, the image of our president is as offensive to MTV as it is to me.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;E! Online&quot; /&gt; MTV replied that it respected Reznor's point of view, but was &quot;uncomfortable&quot; with the performance being &quot;built around partisan political statements.&quot; A performance by [[Foo Fighters]] replaced Nine Inch Nails' time slot on the show.&lt;ref name=&quot;MTV Awards&quot;&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the ''Lights in the Sky'' tour in 2008, some performances of &quot;The Hand that Feeds&quot; had the image of Bush on a video screen behind the band. At some gigs leading up to the election, the face of Bush slowly morphed during the song into the face of [[John McCain]].

In 2006, after being alerted by a fan website, Reznor issued a [[cease and desist]] to [[Fox News Channel]] for using three songs from ''The Fragile'' on air without permission. The songs &quot;La Mer&quot;, &quot;The Great Below&quot;, and &quot;The Mark Has Been Made&quot; appeared in an episode of ''[[War Stories with Oliver North]]'' detailing the [[battle of Iwo Jima]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

As part of the alternate reality game which accompanied the release of ''Year Zero'', three tracks from the album were intentionally &quot;leaked&quot; prior to their official release at a number of Nine Inch Nails concerts on [[USB flash drive]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;CoolerThanLost&quot; /&gt; The high-quality audio files quickly circulated the internet, and owners of websites hosting the files soon received cease and desist orders from the [[Recording Industry Association of America]], despite the fact that the viral campaign, and the use of USB drives, was sanctioned by Nine Inch Nails' record label.&lt;ref name=&quot;BillboardPaolette&quot;&gt;{{cite web

Reznor saw this as an infringement of his artistic freedom.

If there are any legal options that can be realistically taken they will be aggressively pursued, with any potential monetary gains donated to human rights charities.
