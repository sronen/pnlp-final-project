FOR FURTHER DETAILS, PLEASE SEE WIKIPEDIA POLICY [[WP:PLURALS]] and ''The Cambridge Guide to English Usage'', P. Peters p.23 (2004) ISBN 0-521-62181-X --&gt;are an English [[Rock music|rock]] band from [[Abingdon, Oxfordshire|Abingdon]], Oxfordshire, formed in 1985. The band consists of [[Thom Yorke]] (lead vocals, guitar, piano), [[Jonny Greenwood]] (lead guitar, keyboards, other instruments), [[Colin Greenwood]] (bass), [[Phil Selway]] (drums, percussion) and [[Ed O'Brien]] (guitars, backing vocals).

Radiohead released their debut single &quot;[[Creep (Radiohead song)|Creep]]&quot; in 1992. The song was initially unsuccessful, but it became a worldwide hit several months after the release of their debut album, ''[[Pablo Honey]]'' (1993). Radiohead's popularity rose in the United Kingdom with the release of their second album, ''[[The Bends]]'' (1995). Radiohead's third album, ''[[OK Computer]]'' (1997), propelled them to greater international fame. Featuring an expansive sound and themes of [[social alienation|modern alienation]], ''OK Computer'' is often acclaimed as one of the landmark records of the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Erlewine, Stephen Thomas. &quot;[http://www.allmusic.com/album/ok-computer-collectors-series-r1493832 OK Computer]&quot; Allmusic.

''[[Kid A]]'' (2000) and ''[[Amnesiac (album)|Amnesiac]]'' (2001) marked an evolution in Radiohead's musical style, as the group incorporated experimental [[electronic music]], [[Krautrock]] and [[jazz]] influences. ''Kid A'', though somewhat polarizing at the time of its release, is now frequently recognized as one of the most important albums of the 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-best-albums-of-the-2000s-20110718/radiohead-kid-a-19691231 100 Best Albums Of The 2000s.

Radiohead self-released their seventh album, ''[[In Rainbows]]'' (2007), as a [[music download|digital download]] for which customers could set their own price, and later in physical form to critical and chart success. Radiohead's eighth album, ''[[The King of Limbs]]'' (2011), was an exploration of rhythm and quieter textures, which the band released independently.

==History==
===Formation and first years (1985–91)===
[[File:abingdonschool.jpg|thumb|right|Abingdon School, where the band formed]]
The musicians who formed Radiohead met while attending [[Abingdon School]], an [[independent school]] for boys in [[Abingdon, Oxfordshire|Abingdon]], Oxfordshire.&lt;ref name=&quot;MCLEAN&quot;&gt;{{cite news| last =McLean| first =Craig| title =Don't worry, be happy| newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]| date = 14 July 2003| url = http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/06/13/1055220766407.html| accessdate =25 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thom Yorke and Colin Greenwood were in the same year, Ed O'Brien and Phil Selway were one year older and Jonny Greenwood two years younger than his brother. In 1985 they formed the band &quot;On a Friday&quot;, the name referring to the band's usual rehearsal day in the school's music room.&lt;ref name=&quot;RANDALL&quot;/&gt; The group played their first gig in late 1986 at Oxford's [[Jericho Tavern]];&lt;ref name=&quot;CLARKE&quot;&gt;{{cite book| last=Clarke| first=Martin| title=Radiohead: Hysterical and Useless| date=5 May 2006| isbn=0-85965-383-8| publisher=Plexus}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jonny Greenwood originally joined as a harmonica and then keyboard player, but he soon became the lead guitarist.&lt;ref name=&quot;RANDALL&quot;&gt;{{cite journal| last = Randall| first = Mac| title = The Golden Age of Radiohead| magazine = [[Guitar World]]| date = 1 April 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Yorke, O'Brien, Selway, and Colin Greenwood had left Abingdon by 1987 to attend university, the band continued to rehearse often on weekends and holidays.&lt;ref name=&quot;ROSS&quot;&gt;{{cite news| last = Ross| first = Alex| title = The Searchers| newspaper=[[The New Yorker]]| date = 20 August 2001| url = http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2001/08/20/010820fa_FACT1| accessdate =16 March 2011|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080214053947/http://www.therestisnoise.com/2004/04/mahler_1.html |archivedate = 14 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, when all the members except Jonny had completed their university degrees, On a Friday regrouped, began to record demos such as ''Manic Hedgehog'', and performed live gigs around Oxford at venues such as The Jericho Tavern. Oxfordshire and the [[Thames Valley]] had an active [[independent music]] scene in the late 1980s, but it centred around [[shoegazing]] bands such as [[Ride (band)|Ride]] and [[Slowdive]]; On a Friday were never seen as fitting this trend, commenting that they had missed it by the time they returned from university.&lt;ref name=&quot;KENT&quot;&gt;{{cite journal| last =Kent| first =Nick| authorlink =Nick Kent| title =Happy now?| magazine = [[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]| date =1 June 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, as On a Friday's number of live performances increased, record labels and producers became interested. Chris Hufford, Slowdive's producer and the co-owner of Oxford's Courtyard Studios, attended an early On a Friday concert at the Jericho Tavern. Impressed by the band, he and his partner Bryce Edge produced a demo tape and became On a Friday's managers;&lt;ref name=&quot;ROSS&quot;/&gt; they remain the band's managers to this day. Following a chance meeting between Colin Greenwood and [[EMI]] [[A&amp;R]] representative Keith Wozencroft at the record shop where Greenwood worked, the band signed a six-album recording contract with the label in late 1991.&lt;ref name=&quot;ROSS&quot;/&gt; At the request of EMI, the band changed their name to Radiohead, inspired by the title of a song on [[Talking Heads]]' ''[[True Stories (Talking Heads album)|True Stories]]'' album.&lt;ref name=&quot;ROSS&quot;/&gt; That song in turn was inspired by a [http://www.slashfilm.com/tobolowsky-files-ep-44-the-voice-from-another-room/ story] the actor, writer and director [[Stephen Tobolowsky]] told [[David Byrne]] about psychic experiences he had as a teenager.

===''Pablo Honey'', ''The Bends'' and early success (1992–95)===
Radiohead recorded their debut release, the ''[[Drill (EP)|Drill]]'' [[Extended play|EP]], with Chris Hufford and Bryce Edge at Courtyard Studios. Released in May 1992, its chart performance was very poor. Subsequently, the band enlisted Paul Kolderie and Sean Slade—who had worked with US indie bands [[Pixies (band)|Pixies]] and [[Dinosaur Jr.]]—to [[record producer|produce]] their debut album, recorded quickly in an Oxford studio in 1992.&lt;ref name=&quot;RANDALL&quot;/&gt; With the release of the &quot;[[Creep (Radiohead song)|Creep]]&quot; single later that year, Radiohead began to receive attention in the British music press, not all of it favourable. ''[[NME]]'' described them as &quot;a lily-livered excuse for a rock band&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;FREQUENCY&quot;&gt;{{cite news| title=Radiohead: The right frequency| date=22 February 2001| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1182725.stm|newspaper=BBC News  | accessdate =24 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;Creep&quot; was blacklisted by [[BBC Radio 1]] because it was deemed &quot;too depressing&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;mel&quot;&gt;{{cite news| title =Creepshow| newspaper=[[Melody Maker]]| date = 19 December 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The band released their debut album, ''[[Pablo Honey]]'', in February 1993. It stalled at number 22 in the UK charts, as &quot;Creep&quot; and its anthemic follow-up singles &quot;[[Anyone Can Play Guitar]]&quot; and &quot;[[Stop Whispering]]&quot; failed to become major hits. &quot;[[Pop Is Dead]]&quot;, a non-album single later disavowed by the band, sold equally poorly. Some critics compared the band's early style to the wave of [[grunge]] music popular in the early 1990s—to the extent of Radiohead being dubbed &quot;[[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]-lite&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;SMITH&quot;/&gt;—yet ''Pablo Honey'' failed to make either a critical or a commercial splash upon its initial release.&lt;ref name=&quot;FREQUENCY&quot;/&gt; Despite shared influences with popular guitar-heavy acts, and some notice for Yorke's [[falsetto]] voice, the band toured only British universities and clubs.&lt;ref name=&quot;PABLO&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title = Radiohead gigography: 1993| publisher=Green Plastic Radiohead| url = http://www.greenplastic.com/gigography/index.php?year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}
In the first few months of 1993, Radiohead began to attract listeners elsewhere. &quot;Creep&quot; had been played very frequently on [[Israel]]i radio by influential DJ [[Yoav Kutner]], and in March, after the song became a hit in that country's charts, Radiohead were invited to [[Tel Aviv]] for their first live gig overseas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last = Rubinstein| first = Harry| title = The Radiohead&amp;nbsp;— Israel connection| newspaper=israelity.com| url =http://israelity.com/2009/01/20/the-radiohead-israel-connection/| date = 20 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around the same time, the San Francisco alternative radio station [[KITS]] added the song to its playlist. Soon other radio stations along the west coast of the United States followed suit. By the time Radiohead began their first North American tour in June 1993, the music video for &quot;Creep&quot; was in heavy rotation on MTV.&lt;ref name=&quot;ROSS&quot;/&gt; The song rose to number two on the US [[Modern Rock Tracks|modern rock]] chart, entered the lower reaches of the [[top 40]] pop chart, and finally hit number seven in the [[UK Singles Chart]] when EMI re-released it in the UK in September.&lt;ref name=&quot;BILL&quot;/&gt;

Unexpected attention to the single in America caused the label to improvise new promotional plans, and the band shuttled back and forth between continents, playing over 150 concerts in 1993.&lt;ref name=&quot;PABLO&quot;/&gt; Radiohead nearly broke up due to the pressure of sudden success as the ''Pablo Honey'' supporting tour extended into its second year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last = Richardson| first = Andy| title = Boom! Shake The Gloom!| newspaper=[[NME]]| date = 9 December 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Band members described the tour as difficult to adjust to, saying that towards its end they were &quot;still playing the same songs that [they had] recorded two years previously... like being held in a time warp&quot;, when they were eager to work on new songs.&lt;ref name=&quot;HARDING&quot;&gt;{{cite news| first=Nigel| last=Harding| title=Radiohead's Phil Selway| year=1995| newspaper=consumable.com| url =http://www.westnet.com/consumable/1995/May08.1995/revradio.html| accessdate =28 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The band began work on their second album in 1994, hiring veteran [[Abbey Road Studios]] producer [[John Leckie]]. Tensions were high, with mounting expectations on the band to deliver a superior follow-up to match or exceed the success of &quot;Creep&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;BLACK&quot;&gt;{{cite journal| first=Johnny| last=Black| title=The Greatest Songs Ever!

The band found greater confidence performing their new music live.&lt;ref name=&quot;RANDA BENDS&quot;/&gt; However, confronted again by the fame he had achieved, Yorke became disillusioned at being &quot;right at the sharp end of the sexy, sassy, MTV eye-candy lifestyle&quot; he felt he was helping to sell to the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;REYNOLDS&quot;&gt;{{cite journal| last = Reynolds| first = Simon| authorlink = Simon Reynolds| title = Walking on Thin Ice| magazine = [[The Wire (magazine)|The Wire]]|date=June 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[My Iron Lung (EP)|My Iron Lung]]'', an EP and single released late in 1994, was Radiohead's reaction, marking a transition towards the greater depth they aimed for on their second album.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| first=Steve| last=Mallins| title=Scuba Do| date=1 April 1995| magazine = [[Vox (magazine)|''Vox'' magazine]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Promoted through alternative radio stations, the hard-edged single's sales were better than expected, and suggested for the first time that the band had found a loyal fan base beyond one hit.&lt;ref name=&quot;EXIT&quot;&gt;{{cite book| last=Randall| first=Mac| title=Exit Music: The Radiohead Story| date=12 September 2000| pages=98–99| isbn= 0-385-33393-5| publisher=Delta}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having introduced more new songs on tour, Radiohead finished recording their second album by year's end, and they released ''[[The Bends]]'' in March 1995. The album was driven by dense riffs and ethereal atmospheres from the band's three guitarists, with greater use of keyboards than their debut.&lt;ref name=&quot;RANDALL&quot;/&gt; It also received stronger reviews for both songwriting and performances.&lt;ref name=&quot;FREQUENCY&quot;/&gt;

While Radiohead were seen as outsiders to the [[Britpop]] scene that dominated the media's attention at the time, they were finally successful in their home country with ''The Bends'',&lt;ref name=&quot;KENT&quot;/&gt; as singles &quot;[[Fake Plastic Trees]]&quot;, &quot;[[High and Dry]]&quot;, &quot;[[Just (song)|Just]]&quot;, and &quot;[[Street Spirit (Fade Out)]]&quot; made their way to UK chart success; the latter song placed Radiohead in the top five for the first time. In 1995, Radiohead again toured North America and Europe, this time in support of [[R.E.M.]], one of their formative influences and at the time one of the biggest rock bands in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;HARDING&quot;/&gt; The buzz generated by such famous fans as [[Michael Stipe]], along with distinctive music videos for &quot;Just&quot; and &quot;Street Spirit&quot;, helped to sustain Radiohead's popularity outside the UK.

However, Radiohead's growing fan base was insufficient for them to repeat the commercial popularity of &quot;Creep&quot; worldwide. &quot;High and Dry&quot; became a modest hit, but ''The Bends'' peaked at 88 on the US album charts, which remains Radiohead's lowest showing there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Radiohead: Biography|work=Rolling Stone|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/radiohead/biography|accessdate=20 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Radiohead were satisfied with the album's reception. Jonny Greenwood said, &quot;I think the turning point for us came about nine or twelve months after ''The Bends'' was released and it started appearing in people's [best of] polls for the end of the year. That's when it started to feel like we made the right choice about being a band&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;LAUNCH&quot;&gt;{{cite journal| last = DiMartino| first = Dave| title = Give Radiohead to Your Computer| magazine = [[Yahoo!

The band decided to produce their next album with Godrich's assistance, and they began work in early 1996. By July they had recorded four songs at their rehearsal studio, Canned Applause, a converted apple shed in the countryside near [[Didcot]], Oxfordshire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| first = Adrian| last = Glover| title = Radiohead&amp;nbsp;— Getting More Respect| date = 1 August 1997| magazine = [[Circus (magazine)|Circus]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1996, Radiohead toured as the opening act for [[Alanis Morissette]], seeking to perfect their new songs live before completing the record. They then resumed recording, again outside a traditional music studio, settling instead at a 15th-century mansion, [[St. Catherine's Court]], near Bath.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = http://www.time.com/time/2006/100albums/0,27693,OK_Computer,00.html| title = The All-Time 100 albums| magazine = Time| date = 13 November 2006| accessdate =11 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The recording sessions were relaxed, with the band playing at all hours of the day, recording songs in different rooms, and listening to [[The Beatles]], [[DJ Shadow]], [[Ennio Morricone]] and [[Miles Davis]] for inspiration.&lt;ref name=&quot;RANDALL&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;LAUNCH&quot;/&gt; Radiohead contributed &quot;Talk Show Host&quot;, as well as a newly recorded song called &quot;[[Exit Music (For a Film)]]&quot;, to [[Baz Luhrmann]]'s adaptation of ''[[Romeo + Juliet]]'' late in the year. Most of the rest of the album was complete by the end of 1996, and by March 1997, the record was mixed and mastered.

Radiohead released their third album, ''[[OK Computer]]'', in June 1997. Largely composed of melodic rock songs, the new record also found the band experimenting with song structures and incorporating some [[ambient music|ambient]], [[avant garde]] and [[electronic music|electronic]] influences, prompting ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' to call the album a 'stunning art-rock tour de force.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mark Kemp |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/ok-computer-19970710 |title=OK Computer &amp;#124; Album Reviews |publisher=Rolling Stone |date=1997-07-10 |accessdate=2011-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The album's lyrics took a more observational, less personal tone than ''The Bends'', expressing what one magazine called &quot;end-of-the-millennium blues&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;REQ&quot;&gt;{{cite journal| title = Subterranean Aliens| date = 1 September 1997| magazine = Request Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''OK Computer'' met with great critical acclaim, and Yorke admitted that he was &quot;amazed it got the reaction it did.

''OK Computer'' was the band's first number one UK chart debut, propelling Radiohead to commercial success around the world. Despite peaking at number 21 in the [[Billboard 200|US charts]], the album eventually met with mainstream recognition there, receiving the first [[Grammy Awards]] recognition of the band's career, a win for [[Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album|Best Alternative Album]] and a nomination for [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.amug.org/~scrnsrc/grammys_98.html| title = Screen Source presents: The 40th Annual Grammy Awards| accessdate =20 November 2007| date = 27 February 1998| work=Screen Source| publisher=amug.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;[[Paranoid Android]]&quot;, &quot;[[Karma Police]]&quot; and &quot;[[No Surprises]]&quot; were released as singles from the album, of which &quot;Karma Police&quot; was most successful internationally.&lt;ref name=&quot;BILL&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/#/artist/radiohead/chart-history/33472|title=Radiohead: Artist Chart History|work=Billboard|accessdate=9 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''OK Computer'' is often acclaimed as one of the landmark records of the 1990s, and comparisons are sometimes drawn between Radiohead and [[Pink Floyd]]—specifically for ''OK Computer''—which has been called ''[[The Dark Side of the Moon]]'' for the 1990s whereby the two albums share a common theme: the loss of a creative individual's ability to function in the modern world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Reising|2005|pp=208–211}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Griffiths|2004|p=109}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Buckley|2003|p=843}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The release of ''OK Computer'' was followed by the &quot;Against Demons&quot; world tour. [[Grant Gee]], the director of the &quot;No Surprises&quot; video, accompanied and filmed the band, releasing the footage in the 1999 documentary ''[[Meeting People Is Easy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/177943/Meeting-People-is-Easy/overview| title = Meeting People is Easy (1999)| accessdate =20 November 2007| last = Deming| first = Mark| date = 20 November 2007| newspaper=[[New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film portrays the band's disaffection with the music industry and press, showing their burnout as they progressed from their first tour dates in mid-1997 to mid-1998, nearly a year later.&lt;ref name=&quot;RANDALL&quot;/&gt; The film is also notable for documenting earlier versions of songs that were never released or were not released until years later, such as &quot;How to Disappear Completely&quot;, &quot;Life in a Glasshouse&quot;, &quot;I Will&quot; and &quot;Nude&quot;. During this time the band also released a music video compilation, ''[[7 Television Commercials]]'', as well as two EPs, ''[[Airbag/How Am I Driving?]]'' and ''[[No Surprises/Running from Demons]]'', that compiled their B-sides from ''OK Computer'' singles.

Radiohead were largely inactive following their 1997–1998 tour; after its end, their only public performance in 1998 was at an [[Amnesty International]] concert in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.artforamnesty.org/view_artist.php?id=32| title=Art for Amnesty| accessdate =22 December 2007|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071030120709/http://www.artforamnesty.org/view_artist.php?id=32 |archivedate = 30 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yorke later admitted that during that period the band came close to splitting up, and that he had developed severe depression.&lt;ref name=&quot;ECCLES&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eccleston| first=Danny|date=1 October 2000|magazine=[[Q (magazine)|Q]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 1999, Radiohead began work on a follow-up to ''OK Computer''. Although there was no longer any pressure or even a deadline from their record label, tension during this period was high. Band members all had different visions for Radiohead's future, and Yorke was experiencing writer's block, influencing him toward a more abstract, fragmented form of songwriting.&lt;ref name=&quot;ECCLES&quot;/&gt; Radiohead secluded themselves with producer Nigel Godrich in studios in Paris, [[Copenhagen]], and [[Gloucester]], and in their newly completed studio in [[Oxford]]. Eventually, all the members agreed on a new musical direction, redefining their instrumental roles in the band.&lt;ref name=&quot;SMITH&quot;&gt;{{cite news| first=Andrew| last=Smith| title=Sound and Fury| date=1 October 2000| url =http://observer.guardian.co.uk/life/story/0,6903,375564,00.html| newspaper=[[The Observer]]| accessdate =17 March 2007| location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; After nearly 18 months, Radiohead's recording sessions were completed in April 2000.&lt;ref name=&quot;ECCLES&quot;/&gt;

In October 2000 Radiohead released their fourth album, ''[[Kid A]]'', the first of two albums from these recording sessions. Rather than being a stylistic sequel to ''OK Computer'', ''Kid A'' featured a [[minimalism|minimalist]] and textured style with less overt guitar parts and more diverse instrumentation including the [[ondes Martenot]], programmed [[electronic music|electronic]] beats, [[string orchestra|strings]], and jazz horns.&lt;ref name=&quot;ECCLES&quot;/&gt; It debuted at number one in many countries, including the US, where its debut atop the ''[[Billboard 200|Billboard]]'' chart marked a first for the band and a rare success in the US by UK musicians.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBCKIDAAMN&quot;&gt;{{cite news|publisher=BBC News |title=US Success for Radiohead|date=14 June 2001|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1389135.stm|accessdate=22 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; This success was attributed variously to marketing, to the album's leak on the file-sharing network [[Napster]] a few months before its release, and to advance anticipation based, in part, on the success of ''OK Computer''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=CD Soars After Net Release: Radiohead's 'Kid A' premieres in No. 1 slot| last=Evangelista| first=Benny| accessdate =17 March 2007| date=12 October 2000| newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]| url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2000/10/12/BU108599.DTL&amp;type=tech_article}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last = Menta| first = Richard| title = Did Napster Take Radiohead's New Album to Number 1?| newspaper=[[MP3 Newswire]]| date = 28 October 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last = Oldham| first = James| title = Radiohead&amp;nbsp;— Their Stupendous Return| newspaper=[[NME]]| date = 24 June 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Radiohead did not release any singles from ''Kid A'', [[Promotional recording|promos]] of &quot;[[Optimistic (song)|Optimistic]]&quot; and &quot;[[Idioteque]]&quot; received radio play, and a series of &quot;[[Kid A#Videos and blips|blips]]&quot;, or short videos set to portions of tracks, were played on music channels and released freely on the Internet.&lt;ref name=&quot;ZORIC&quot;&gt;{{cite news| last = Zoric| first = Lauren| title = I think I'm meant to be dead| newspaper=The Guardian| date = 22 September 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band had read [[Naomi Klein]]'s [[anti-globalisation]] book ''[[No Logo]]'' during the recording, and they decided to continue a summer 2000 tour of Europe later in the year in a custom-built tent free of advertising; they also promoted ''Kid A'' with three sold-out North American theatre concerts.&lt;ref name=&quot;ZORIC&quot;/&gt;

''Kid A'' received a [[Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album|Best Alternative Album]] and a nomination for [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]] in early 2001. It won both praise and criticism in [[independent music]] circles for appropriating [[underground music|underground]] styles of music; some mainstream British critics saw ''Kid A'' as a &quot;commercial suicide note&quot;, labelling it &quot;intentionally difficult&quot; and longing for a return to the band's earlier style.&lt;ref name=&quot;KENT&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;FREQUENCY&quot;/&gt; Radiohead's fans were similarly divided; along with those who were appalled or mystified, there were many who saw the album as the band's best work.&lt;ref name=&quot;REYNOLDS&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/artists/radiohead/kida| title=Kid A by Radiohead| accessdate =20 May 2007| magazine=[[Metacritic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yorke, however, denied that Radiohead had set out to eschew commercial expectations, saying, &quot;I was really, really amazed at how badly [''Kid A''] was being viewed&amp;nbsp;... because the music's not that hard to grasp. We're not trying to be difficult&amp;nbsp;... We're actually trying to communicate but somewhere along the line, we just seemed to piss off a lot of people&amp;nbsp;... What we're doing isn't that radical.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;KENT&quot;/&gt;

''[[Amnesiac (album)|Amnesiac]]'', released in June 2001, comprised additional tracks from the ''Kid A'' recording sessions. Radiohead's musical style on these songs was similar to that of ''Kid A'' in their fusion of electronic music and jazz influences, though more reliant on the use of guitars. The record was a critical and commercial success worldwide, it topped the [[UK Albums Chart]] and reached number two in the US, being nominated for a Grammy Award and the [[Mercury Music Prize]].&lt;ref name=&quot;FREQUENCY&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBCKIDAAMN&quot;/&gt; After ''Amnesiac'''s release, the band embarked on a world tour, visiting North America, Europe and Japan. Meanwhile, &quot;[[Pyramid Song]]&quot; and &quot;[[Knives Out]]&quot;, Radiohead's first issued singles since 1998, were modestly successful, and &quot;[[I Might Be Wrong]]&quot;, initially planned as a third single, expanded into Radiohead's thus far only live record. ''[[I Might Be Wrong: Live Recordings]]'', released in November 2001, featured performances of seven songs from ''Kid A'' and ''Amnesiac'' along with the acoustic, previously unreleased &quot;True Love Waits&quot;.

During July and August 2002, Radiohead toured Portugal and Spain, playing a number of newly written songs. They then recorded the new material in two weeks in a Los Angeles studio with [[Nigel Godrich]], adding several tracks later in Oxford, where the band continued their work into the next year. Radiohead members described the recording process as relaxed, in contrast to the tense sessions for ''Kid A'' and ''Amnesiac''.&lt;ref name=&quot;MCLEAN&quot;/&gt; The band's sixth album, ''[[Hail to the Thief]]'', was released in June 2003. Mixing sounds from throughout their career, ''Hail to the Thief'' combined guitar-based rock with electronic influences and topical lyrics by Yorke.&lt;ref name=&quot;META&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/artists/radiohead/hailtothethief?q=hail%20to%20the%20thief| title=Radiohead: Hail to the Thief (2003): Reviews| accessdate =17 March 2007| magazine=[[Metacritic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the album was critically praised, many critics felt that Radiohead were treading water creatively rather than continuing the &quot;genre-redefining&quot; trend that ''OK Computer'' had begun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first=Alexis| last=Petridis| title=Radiohead: Hail to the Thief| date=6 June 2003| newspaper=[[The Guardian]]| url =http://arts.guardian.co.uk/fridayreview/story/0,,970859,00.html| accessdate =22 November 2007| location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, ''Hail to the Thief'' enjoyed commercial success, debuting at number one in the UK and number three on the ''Billboard'' chart and eventually being certified [[British Phonographic Industry#Sales certificates|platinum]] in the UK and [[RIAA certification|gold]] in the US. The album's singles, &quot;[[There There]]&quot;, &quot;[[Go to Sleep]]&quot; and &quot;[[2 + 2 = 5 (song)|2 + 2 = 5]]&quot;, achieved a level of play on [[modern rock]] radio. At the 2003 Grammy Awards, Radiohead were again nominated for [[Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album|Best Alternative Album]], while producer Godrich and engineer Darrell Thorp received the [[Grammy Award for Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical|Grammy Award for Best Engineered Album]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://www.rockonthenet.com/archive/2003/grammys.htm| title=Rock on the Net: 45th Annual Grammy Awards| accessdate =22 November 2007| date=23 February 2003| magazine=rockonthenet.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yorke denied that ''Hail to the Thief'''s title was a comment on the controversial [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000 US presidential election]], explaining that he first heard the words in a [[BBC Radio 4]] discussion of 19th century American politics.&lt;ref name=&quot;MCLEAN&quot;/&gt; Yorke said his lyrics had been affected by news reports of war in 2001 to 2002 and &quot;the feeling that we are entering an age of intolerance and fear where the power to express ourselves in a democracy and have our voices heard is being denied us&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2003/jun/08/entertainment/ca-sutcliffe8 |last=Sutcliffe |first=Phil |title=Radiohead heeds the alarms |newspaper=The Los Angeles Times |date=8 June 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but said, &quot;[Radiohead] didn't write a protest record, we didn't write a political record.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;MCLEAN&quot;/&gt; After the release of ''Hail to the Thief'', Radiohead embarked in May 2003 on a world tour, including a headlining performance at the [[Glastonbury Festival#2003|Glastonbury Festival]]. The tour finished in May 2004 with a performance at the [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival#2004|Coachella Festival]]. During their tour, the band released ''[[COM LAG (2plus2isfive)|COM LAG]]'', an EP compiling most of their b-sides from the time. Following their tour, the band began writing and rehearsing in their Oxford studio but soon went on hiatus. Free of their label contract, Radiohead spent the remainder of 2004 resting with their families and working on solo projects.&lt;ref name=&quot;HERE&quot;&gt;{{cite web| last=O'Brien| first=Ed| title=Here we go| work=Dead Air Space| publisher=Radiohead| date=21 August 2005| url =http://www.radiohead.com/deadairspace/index.php?a=65| accessdate =23 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2010, while Radiohead members were in Los Angeles to record, the band played their only gig of the year as a benefit for [[Oxfam]].

Radiohead's eighth album, ''[[The King of Limbs]]'', was digitally released in February 2011 through the band's web site.&lt;ref name=&quot;Radiohead release The King of Limbs&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/musicblog/2011/feb/18/radiohead-king-of-limbs-live |title=Radiohead release The King of Limbs |work=The Guardian |location=UK |date=19 February 2011 |accessdate=18 February 2011 |first=Rosie |last=Swash}}&lt;/ref&gt; The announcement of the album on Valentine's Day was followed by the Internet release four days later, along with a music video for the song &quot;[[Lotus Flower (song)|Lotus Flower]]&quot;. ''The King of Limbs'' was released in CD, vinyl and standard download formats in March, and in a &quot;newspaper album&quot;, which included art, writings, and a CD as well as vinyl edition of the record, in May.&lt;ref&gt;Swash, Rosie (14 February 2011).

After being sold exclusively through the band's website for nearly two months, ''The King of Limbs'' charted at number seven in the United Kingdom on its retail release in late March 2011, becoming the band's first album since ''The Bends'' not to debut at number one in the UK. In the United States it reached number three, on par with the band's last major label release, 2003's ''Hail to the Thief''. In July 2011 ''The King of Limbs'' vinyl edition was reported to be the best-selling vinyl of the year by a large margin, and Radiohead were credited with helping an ongoing surge in vinyl sales.

Like ''Kid A'', no singles were released from ''The King of Limbs''; However, &quot;Lotus Flower&quot; charted in a number of countries due to digital sales or radio airplay, and manipulations of its [[music video]], featuring Thom Yorke dancing to different songs, became a popular [[internet meme]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ateaseweb.com/2011/02/19/dance-dance-dance-thom-yorke-beyonce-shakira-and-more/ |title=Dance Dance Dance: Thom Yorke, Beyoncé, Shakira and more |work=Ateaseweb |location=UK |date=19 February 2011 |accessdate=26 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 April 2011, Radiohead released a single on vinyl, &quot;''[[Supercollider / The Butcher]]''&quot;, for Record Store Day.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stereogum&quot;&gt;{{cite news|first=Scott|title=Radiohead – &quot;Supercollider&quot; &amp; &quot;The Butcher&quot;|url=http://stereogum.com/684701/radiohead-supercollider-the-butcher/mp3s/|accessdate=26 April 2011|date=15 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band revealed that they worked on both songs during sessions for ''The King of Limbs'', but decided they didn't fit on it. &quot;Supercollider,&quot; at over seven minutes, is the longest studio-recorded song ever released by Radiohead in any form. Digital files of the songs were made available at no cost to anyone who had already purchased the album on the band's website, and the band uploaded audio of the songs to their YouTube channel. Radiohead also released a series of remixes from ''The King of Limbs'' on various 12&quot; vinyls, with a CD collecting the remixes to be released in the Autumn. Remixers announced so far include [[Caribou]], [[Jacques Greene]], [[Lone]] and [[Four Tet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiohead.com/deadairspace/110811/Real-vs-Astroturf/|publisher=Radiohead|title=Dead Air Space|accessdate=1 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band also uploaded each remix as it was released to their YouTube channel and their website for free streaming. ''The King of Limbs'' and ''TKOL RMX 1234567'' were released on the band's own imprint label, [[Ticker Tape Ltd.]], owned by the band's label [[XL Recordings]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/reviews/radiohead-the-king-of-limbs-ticker-tapexl-2219834.html Radiohead, The King of Limbs (Ticker Tape/XL)] The Independent.

In July 2011, a number of television channels around the world debuted a taped live performance of the ''[[From the Basement]]'' series, featuring Radiohead and Deamer performing every song from ''The King of Limbs'', as well as &quot;The Daily Mail&quot; and the previously released live performance of &quot;Staircase&quot;.

Among Radiohead members' earliest influences were [[Queen (band)|Queen]] and [[Elvis Costello]]; [[post-punk]] acts such as [[Joy Division]] and [[Magazine (band)|Magazine]]; and significantly 1980s [[alternative rock]] bands such as [[R.E.M.]], [[Pixies]], [[The Smiths]] and [[Sonic Youth]].&lt;ref name=&quot;RANDALL&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ROSS&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;REYNOLDS&quot;/&gt; By the mid-1990s, Radiohead began to adopt some recording methods from [[hip hop]], inspired by the [[sample (music)|sampling]] work of DJ Shadow.&lt;ref name=&quot;RANDALL&quot;/&gt; They also became interested in using computers to generate sounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first=Ian| last=Gillespie | title=It all got very surreal|url=http://www.greenplastic.com/coldstorage/articles/londonfreepress.html| date=17 August 1997 | newspaper=[[London Free Press]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other influences on the group were [[Miles Davis]] and [[Ennio Morricone]], along with 1960s rock groups, such as [[The Beatles]] and [[The Beach Boys]], and [[Phil Spector]]'s &quot;wall of sound&quot; productions for [[girl groups]].&lt;ref name=&quot;RANDALL&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;LAUNCH&quot;/&gt; Jonny Greenwood also cited composer [[Krzysztof Penderecki]] as an inspiration on the sound of ''OK Computer''.&lt;ref name=&quot;LAUNCH&quot;/&gt; The [[electronic music]] of ''Kid A'' and ''Amnesiac'' was inspired by Thom Yorke's admiration for [[glitch (music)|glitch]], [[ambient music|ambient techno]] and [[Intelligent dance music|IDM]] as exemplified by [[Warp Records]] artists such as [[Autechre]] and [[Aphex Twin]], and the album also sampled from early [[computer music]].&lt;ref name=&quot;SMITH&quot;/&gt; The [[jazz]] of [[Charles Mingus]], [[Alice Coltrane]], and [[Miles Davis]], and 1970s [[Krautrock]] bands such as [[Can (band)|Can]] and [[Neu!]], were other major influences during this period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| first=Lauren | last=Zoric | title=Fitter, Happier, More Productive | date=1 October 2000 | magazine = [[Juice (magazine)|Juice]] | accessdate =3 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jonny Greenwood's interest in [[20th century classical music]] also had a role, as the influence of both Penderecki and composer [[Olivier Messiaen]] was apparent; for several songs on ''Kid A'' and later albums, Greenwood has played the [[ondes Martenot]], an early electronic instrument popularised by Messiaen.&lt;ref name=&quot;ROSS&quot;/&gt; While working on ''Hail to the Thief'', Radiohead put renewed emphasis on guitar rock.&lt;ref name=&quot;META&quot;/&gt; The Beatles, [[The Rolling Stones]] and particularly [[Neil Young]] were reported sources of inspiration to the band during this period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Duno | first = Borja| title = Ed &amp; Thom interview | magazine = Mondosonoro | date = 30 May 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Liner notes of ''Hail to the Thief'', 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Since beginning to record ''In Rainbows'', Radiohead members have mentioned a variety of rock, electronic, hip hop and experimental musicians as influences, including [[Björk]], [[M.I.A.

In 2011, Thom Yorke denied Radiohead had ever set out deliberately to change musical styles or to make &quot;[[experimental music]]&quot;, saying band members are &quot;constantly absorbing music&quot; and a variety of musicians are always influencing their work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/2011/10/06/141093025/radiohead-everything-in-its-right-place |title=Radiohead: Everything In Its Right Place |publisher=NPR |date=2011-10-06 |accessdate=2011-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since their formation, Radiohead have been lyrically and musically spearheaded by Thom Yorke. Although Yorke is responsible for writing nearly all the lyrics, songwriting is a collaborative effort, and it has been noted in interviews that all the band members have roles in the process.&lt;ref name=&quot;ECCLES&quot;/&gt; As a result, all the band's songs are officially credited to &quot;Radiohead&quot;. The ''Kid A/Amnesiac'' sessions brought about a change in Radiohead's musical style, and an even more radical change in the band's working method.&lt;ref name=&quot;ECCLES&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Radiohead: Biography|work=Rolling Stone|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/radiohead/biography|accessdate=14 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the band's shift from standard rock music instrumentation toward an emphasis on electronic sound, band members have had greater flexibility and now regularly switch instruments depending on the particular song requirements.&lt;ref name=&quot;ECCLES&quot;/&gt; On ''Kid A'' and ''Amnesiac'', Yorke played keyboard and bass, while Jonny Greenwood often played [[ondes Martenot]] rather than guitar, bassist Colin Greenwood worked on sampling, and O'Brien and Selway branched out to drum machines and digital manipulations, also finding ways to incorporate their primary instruments, guitar and percussion, respectively, into the new sound.&lt;ref name=&quot;ECCLES&quot;/&gt; The relaxed 2003 recording sessions for ''Hail to the Thief'' led to a different dynamic in Radiohead, with Yorke admitting in interviews that &quot;[his] power within the band was absolutely unbalanced and [he] would subvert everybody else's power at all costs. But&amp;nbsp;... it's actually a lot more healthy now, democracy wise, than it used to be.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;DAL&quot;&gt;{{cite news| first=Stephen | last=Dalton | title=Are we having fun yet? | date=1 April 2004 | url =http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/04/11/1081326991553.html?from=storyrhs | newspaper=[[The Age]] | accessdate =26 March 2007 | location=Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt;
