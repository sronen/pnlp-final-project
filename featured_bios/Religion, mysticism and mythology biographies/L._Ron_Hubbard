'''Lafayette Ronald Hubbard''' (March 13, 1911{{spaced ndash}}January 24, 1986), better known as '''L. Ron Hubbard''' (and often referred to by his initials, '''LRH'''), was an American [[pulp magazines|pulp fiction]] author and the founder of the [[Church of Scientology]]. After establishing a career as a writer, becoming best known for his [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy]] stories, he developed a [[self-help]] system called [[Dianetics]] which was first published in May 1950. He subsequently developed his ideas into a wide-ranging set of doctrines and rituals as part of a [[new religious movement]] that he called [[Scientology]]. His writings became the guiding texts for the Church of Scientology and a number of affiliated organizations that address such diverse topics as business administration, literacy and [[drug rehabilitation]].

Although many aspects of Hubbard's life story are disputed, there is general agreement about its basic outline.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bromley&quot;&gt;Bromley, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; Born in [[Tilden, Nebraska]], he spent much of his childhood in [[Helena, Montana]]. He traveled in Asia and the South Pacific in the late 1920s after his father, an officer in the [[United States Navy]], was posted to the U.S. naval base on [[Guam]]. He attended [[George Washington University]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] at the start of the 1930s before beginning a career as a prolific writer of pulp fiction stories. He served briefly in the Marine Reserves and later in the U.S. Navy during [[World War II]], briefly holding command of 2 different vessels, the [[USS YP-422|USS ''YP-422'']] and [[USS PC-815|USS ''PC-815'']]. He was removed from his position both times when superiors found him unsuitable for command.&lt;ref name=&quot;LATimes-1990-06-24&quot;&gt;{{cite news|author=Sappel, Joel|author2=Welkos, Robert W.|title=The Mind Behind the Religion, Chapter 2: Creating the Mystique: Hubbard's Image Was Crafted of Truth, Distorted by Myth|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-scientology062490,0,2050131,full.story|work=Los Angeles Times|date=1990-06-24|accessdate=2009-07-14 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080612145705/http://www.latimes.com/business/la-scientology062490,0,2050131,full.story |archivedate = June 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He ended the war hospitalized for an acute [[duodenal ulcer]].&lt;ref name=&quot;LATimes-1990-06-24&quot; /&gt;. Later he developed Dianetics, &quot;the modern science of mental health&quot;. He founded Scientology in 1952 and oversaw the growth of the Church of Scientology into a worldwide organization. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, he spent much of his time at sea aboard his personal fleet of ships as Commodore of the [[Sea Organization]], an elite inner group of Scientologists.  However, his expedition came to an early close.  Britain, Greece, Spain, Portugal, and Venezuela all closed their ports to his fleet.  At one point, a court in Australia revoked the church's status as a religion.  Similarly, a high court in France convicted Hubbard of fraud ''[[in absentia]]''.  He returned to the United States in 1975 and subsequently went into seclusion in the California desert. In 1983 L. Ron Hubbard was named as an unindicted co-conspirator in an international information infiltration and theft project called &quot;[[Operation Snow White]]&quot;.  He spent the remaining years of his life secluded to a ranch near [[Creston, California]], where he died in January 1986.

Hubbard was, and remains, a controversial figure and many details of his life are disputed. The Church of Scientology depicts Hubbard in [[hagiography|hagiographic]] terms, drawing on his legacy as its ultimate source of doctrine and legitimacy.&lt;ref&gt;Christensen, p. 228&lt;/ref&gt; He portrayed himself as a pioneering explorer, world traveler and nuclear physicist with expertise in a wide range of disciplines including photography, art, poetry and philosophy. His critics have characterized him as a liar, a charlatan and a madman, and many of his autobiographical statements have been proven to be fictitious.&lt;ref name=&quot;urban2006&quot;&gt;Urban, Hugh B. &quot;Fair Game: Secrecy, Security, and the Church of Scientology in Cold War America.&quot; ''Journal of the American Academy of Religion'' '''74''':2 (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; The Danish historian of religions Dorthe Refslund Christensen concludes that the Church of Scientology's narrative &quot;becomes meaningful only if it is perceived as a legend or a myth,&quot; though the Church itself rejects any suggestion that its account of Hubbard's life is anything other than historical fact.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rothstein-21&quot;&gt;Rothstein, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
{{main|Early life of L. Ron Hubbard}}
Lafayette Ronald Hubbard was born on March 13, 1911, in Tilden, Nebraska.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hall&quot;&gt;Hall, Timothy L. ''American religious leaders'', p. 175. New York: Infobase Publishing, 2003. ISBN 978-0-8160-4534-1&lt;/ref&gt; He was the only child of Harry Ross Hubbard, a former United States Navy sailor, and Ledora May (née Waterbury), who had originally trained as a teacher.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller-11&quot;&gt;Miller, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Christensen236&quot;&gt;Christensen, pp. 236–237&lt;/ref&gt; After moving to [[Kalispell, Montana]], the family settled in 1913 in the city of Helena.&lt;ref name=Christensen236 /&gt; Hubbard's father re-enlisted in the Navy in April 1917, while his mother Ledora May worked as a clerk for the state government.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller-19&quot;&gt;Miller, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

Biographical accounts published by the Church of Scientology describe Hubbard as &quot;a child prodigy of sorts&quot; who rode a horse before he could walk and was able to read and write by the age of four.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tucker-300&quot;&gt;Tucker, p. 300&lt;/ref&gt; A Scientology profile says that he was brought up on his grandfather's &quot;large cattle ranch in Montana&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;About The Author&quot;, in Hubbard, L. Ron: ''[[Have You Lived Before This Life|Have you lived before this life?: A scientific survey : a study of death and evidence of past lives]]'', p. 297. Los Angeles: Church of Scientology Publications Organization, 1977. ISBN 978-0-88484-055-8&lt;/ref&gt; where he spent his days &quot;riding, breaking broncos, hunting coyote and taking his first steps as an explorer&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;SW-Creating&quot; /&gt; His grandfather is described as a &quot;wealthy Western cattleman&quot; from whom Hubbard &quot;inherited his fortune and family interests in America, Southern Africa, etc.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Rolph, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; Scientology claims that Hubbard became a &quot;[[blood brother]]&quot; of the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] [[Blackfeet]] tribe at the age of six through his friendship with a Blackfeet [[medicine man]].&lt;ref name=Christensen236 /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Great Secret&quot;&gt;&quot;L. Ron Hubbard and American Pulp Fiction&quot;, in Hubbard, L. Ron: &quot;The Great Secret&quot;, p. 107–8. Hollywood, CA: Galaxy Press, 2008. ISBN 978-1-59212-371-1&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:QAHS 1909.jpg|right|thumb|alt=Exterior view of a large building|Queen Anne High School, Seattle, which L Ron Hubbard attended in 1926–27]]
Contemporary records state that his grandfather, Lafe Waterbury, was a [[veterinarian]], not a rancher, and was not wealthy. Hubbard was raised in a townhouse in the center of Helena.&lt;ref name=&quot;Atack-48&quot;&gt;Atack, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; According to his aunt, his family did not own a ranch but had one cow and four or five horses on a few acres of land outside Helena.&lt;ref name=&quot;SW-Creating&quot;&gt;Sappell, Joel; Welkos, Robert (June 24, 1990). &quot;[http://articles.latimes.com/1990-06-24/news/mn-1012_1_l-ron-hubbard The Making of L. Ron Hubbard: Creating the Mystique]&quot;. ''Los Angeles Times'', p. A38:1&lt;/ref&gt; Hubbard lived over a hundred miles from the Blackfeet reservation. The tribe did not practice blood brotherhood and no evidence has been found that he had ever been a Blackfeet blood brother.&lt;ref name=&quot;SW-Staking&quot;&gt;Sappell, Joel; Welkos, Robert (June 24, 1990). &quot;The Making of L. Ron Hubbard: Staking a Claim to Blood Brotherhood&quot;. ''Los Angeles Times'', p. A38:5&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1920s the Hubbards repeatedly relocated around the United States and overseas. After Hubbard's father Harry rejoined the Navy, his posting aboard the [[USS Oklahoma (BB-37)|USS ''Oklahoma'']] in 1921 required the family to relocate to the ship's home ports, first [[San Diego]], then [[Seattle]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller-23&quot;&gt;Miller, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; During a journey to [[Washington, D.C.]] in 1923 Hubbard learned of [[Freudian psychology]] from Commander Joseph &quot;Snake&quot; Thompson, a U.S. Navy psychoanalyst and medic.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller-23&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Whitehead-46&quot;&gt;Whitehead, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; Scientology biographies describe this encounter as giving Hubbard training in a particular scientific approach to the mind, which he found unsatisfying.&lt;ref name=&quot;Christensen238&quot;&gt;Christensen, p. 238&lt;/ref&gt; Hubbard was active in the Boy Scouts in Washington, DC and earned the rank of Eagle Scout in 1924, two weeks after his 13th birthday. In his diary, Hubbard claimed he was the youngest Eagle Scout in the US.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller-25&quot;&gt;Miller, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

The following year, Harry Ross Hubbard was posted to [[Puget Sound Naval Shipyard and Intermediate Maintenance Facility|Puget Sound Naval Shipyard]] at [[Bremerton, Washington]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller-27&quot;&gt;Miller, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; His son was enrolled at Union High School, Bremerton,&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller-27&quot; /&gt; and later studied at [[Queen Anne High School (Seattle, Washington)|Queen Anne High School]] in Seattle.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller-28&quot;&gt;Miller, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; In 1927 Hubbard's father was sent to the U.S. Naval Station on [[Guam]] in the [[Mariana Islands]] of the South Pacific. Although Hubbard's mother also went to Guam, Hubbard himself did not accompany them but was placed in his grandparents' care in Helena, Montana to complete his schooling.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller-28&quot; /&gt;

Between 1927 and 1929 Hubbard traveled to [[Japan]], [[China]], the [[Philippines]] and Guam. Scientology texts present this period in his life as a time when he was intensely curious for answers to human suffering and explored ancient Eastern philosophies for answers, but found them lacking.&lt;ref name=&quot;Christensen239&quot;&gt;Christensen, pp. 239–240&lt;/ref&gt; He is described as traveling to China &quot;at a time when few Westerners could enter&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Battlefield&quot;&gt;&quot;About the Author&quot;, in Hubbard, L. Ron: ''Battlefield Earth''. (No page number given.) Los Angeles: Galaxy Press, 2005. ISBN 978-1-59212-007-9&lt;/ref&gt; and according to Scientology, spent his time questioning Buddhist [[lama]]s and meeting old Chinese magicians.&lt;ref name=Christensen239 /&gt; According to church materials, his travels were funded by his &quot;wealthy grandfather&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Appendix&quot; in Hubbard, L. Ron: ''Hymn of Asia''. (No page number given.) Los Angeles : Church of Scientology of California, Publications Organization, 1974. ISBN 0-88404-035-6&lt;/ref&gt;

Hubbard's unofficial biographers present a very different account of his travels in Asia. Hubbard's diaries recorded two trips to the east coast of China. The first was made in the company of his mother while traveling from the United States to Guam in 1927. It consisted of a brief stop-over in a couple of Chinese ports before traveling on to Guam, where he stayed for six weeks before returning home. He recorded his impressions of the places he visited and disdained the poverty of the inhabitants of Japan and China, whom he described as &quot;gooks&quot; and &quot;lazy [and] ignorant&quot;. His second visit was a family holiday which took Hubbard and his parents to China via the Philippines in 1928.&lt;ref name=&quot;Atack-54&quot;&gt;Atack, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller-31&quot;&gt;Miller, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 137-031735, Tsingtau, Teilansicht.jpg|right|thumb|alt=View of a coastal city from a high-altitude point at sea|Aerial view of Qingdao, China, taken in 1930, two years after Hubbard's visit]]
After his return to the United States in September 1927, Hubbard enrolled at [[Helena High School]] but earned only poor grades.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller-34&quot;&gt;Miller, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; He abandoned school the following May and went back west to stay with his aunt and uncle in [[Seattle]]. He joined his parents in Guam in June 1928. His mother took over his education in the hope of putting him forward for the entrance examination to the [[United States Naval Academy]] at [[Annapolis, Maryland]].

Between October and December 1928 a number of naval families, including Hubbard's, traveled from Guam to China aboard the ''[[USS Gold Star (AK-12)|USS Gold Star]]''. The ship stopped at [[Manila]] in the Philippines before traveling on to [[Qingdao]] (Tsingtao) in China. Hubbard and his parents made a side trip to [[Beijing]] before sailing on to [[Shanghai]] and [[Hong Kong]], from where they returned to Guam.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller-41&quot;&gt;Miller, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; Scientology accounts present a different version of events, saying that Hubbard &quot;made his way deep into Manchuria's Western Hills and beyond—to break bread with Mongolian bandits, share campfires with Siberian shamans and befriend the last in the line of magicians from the court of [[Kublai Khan]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.lronhubbard.org/biography/early-years/asia-and-the-south-pacific.html L. Ron Hubbard Biographical Profile: Asia and the South Pacific]&quot;. Church of Scientology International, 2010, retrieved February 17, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Hubbard did not record these events in his diary.&lt;ref name=&quot;Atack-57&quot;&gt;Atack, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; He remained unimpressed with China and the Chinese, writing: &quot;A Chinaman can not live up to a thing, he always drags it down.&quot; He characterized the sights of Beijing as &quot;rubberneck stations&quot; for tourists and described the palaces of the [[Forbidden City]] as &quot;very trashy-looking&quot; and &quot;not worth mentioning&quot;. He was impressed by the [[Great Wall of China]] near Beijing&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller-42&quot;&gt;Miller, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; but concluded of the Chinese: &quot;They smell of all the baths they didn't take. The trouble with China is, there are too many chinks here.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller-43&quot;&gt;Miller, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

Back on Guam, Hubbard spent much of his time writing dozens of short stories and essays&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller-44&quot;&gt;Miller, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; and failed the Naval Academy entrance examination. In September 1929 Hubbard was enrolled at the Swavely Preparatory School in [[Manassas, Virginia]], to prepare him for a second attempt at the examination.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller-45&quot;&gt;Miller, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; However, he was ruled out of consideration due to his near-sightedness.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller-46&quot;&gt;Miller, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; He was instead sent to Woodward School for Boys in Washington, D.C. to qualify for admission to [[George Washington University]]. He successfully graduated from the school in June 1930 and entered the university the following September.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller-47&quot;&gt;Miller, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;

==University and explorations==
[[File:Professor's Gate - GWU.JPG|right|thumb|alt=Open gateway with the letters G and W and the phrase &quot;Professors Gate&quot; visible on the arch|Entrance to George Washington University]]
Hubbard studied [[civil engineering]] during his two years at George Washington University without graduation at the behest of his father, who &quot;decreed that I should study engineering and mathematics.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Atack-59&quot;&gt;Atack, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; His career at George Washington University subsequently became important, as George Malko puts it, because &quot;many of his researches and published conclusions have been supported by his claims to be not only a graduate engineer, but 'a member of the first United States course in formal education in what is called today nuclear physics.'&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Malko-31&quot; /&gt;&lt;!-- verbatim quote: do not alter --&gt; However, a Church of Scientology biography describes him as &quot;never noted for being in class&quot; and says that he &quot;thoroughly detest[ed] his subjects.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Brief Biography&quot;&gt;&quot;A Brief Biography of L. Ron Hubbard&quot;, ''Ability'', Church of Scientology Washington, D.C. Issue 111, January 1959.&lt;/ref&gt; He earned poor grades, was placed on probation in September 1931 and dropped out altogether in the fall of 1932.&lt;ref name=&quot;Malko-31&quot;&gt;Malko, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wallis-18&quot;&gt;Wallis, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientology accounts say that he &quot;studied nuclear physics at George Washington University in Washington, D.C., before he started his studies about the mind, spirit and life&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Foreword&quot;, in Hubbard, L. Ron: ''Scientology: The Fundamentals of Thought'', p. vii. Los Angeles: Bridge Publications, 2007. ISBN 978-1-4031-4420-1&lt;/ref&gt; and Hubbard himself stated that he &quot;set out to find out from nuclear physics a knowledge of the physical universe, something entirely lacking in Asian philosophy.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Brief Biography&quot; /&gt; His university records indicate that his exposure to &quot;nuclear physics&quot; consisted of one class in &quot;atomic and molecular phenomena&quot; for which he earned an &quot;F&quot; grade.&lt;ref name=&quot;Streeter-206&quot;&gt;Streeter, p. 206&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientologists claim he was more interested in extracurricular activities, particularly writing and flying. According to church materials, &quot;he earned his wings as a pioneering barnstormer at the dawn of American aviation&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Great Secret&quot; /&gt; and &quot;[he was] recognized as one of the country's most outstanding pilots. With virtually no training time, he takes up powered flight and barnstorms throughout the Midwest.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Chronicle1930-1940&quot;&gt;[http://mediaresources.lronhubbard.org/chronicle/page02.htm L. Ron Hubbard&amp;nbsp;– A Chronicle&amp;nbsp;– 1930-1940]&quot;. Church of Scientology International, 2007, retrieved February 17, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; His pilot's license, however, records that he only qualified to fly gliders rather than powered aircraft and gave up his license when he could not afford the renewal fee.&lt;ref name=&quot;Atack-64&quot;&gt;Atack, p. 64&lt;/ref&gt;

During Hubbard's final semester he organized an expedition to the Caribbean for &quot;fifty young gentleman rovers&quot; aboard the schooner ''Doris Hamlin'' commencing in June 1932. The aims of the &quot;Caribbean Motion Picture Expedition&quot; were stated as being to explore and film the pirate &quot;strongholds and bivouacs of the [[Spanish Main]]&quot; and to &quot;collect whatever one collects for exhibits in museums&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller=52&quot;&gt;Miller, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; It ran into trouble even before it left the port of Baltimore: ten participants quit and storms blew the ship far off course to [[Bermuda]]. Eleven more members of the expedition quit there and more left when the ship arrived at [[Martinique]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller=54&quot;&gt;Miller, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; With the expedition running critically short of money, the ship's owners ordered it to return to Baltimore.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller=55&quot;&gt;Miller, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;

Hubbard blamed the expedition's problems on the captain: &quot;the ship's dour Captain Garfield proved himself far less than a Captain Courageous, requiring Ron Hubbard's hand at both the helm and the charts.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;CMPE&quot;&gt;[http://www.lronhubbard.org/biography/adventures-explorations/carribean-motion-picture-expedition.html L.

After leaving university Hubbard traveled to Puerto Rico on what the Church of Scientology calls the &quot;Puerto Rican Mineralogical Expedition&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;LRH Biog Puerto Rican&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://www.lronhubbard.org/biography/adventures-explorations/puerto-rican-mineralogical-expedition.html L.

Church of Scientology, 2010, retrieved February 8, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Scientologists claim he &quot;made the first complete mineralogical survey of Puerto Rico&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mission&quot; /&gt; as a means of &quot;augmenting his [father's] pay with a mining venture&quot;, during which he &quot;sluiced inland rivers and crisscrossed the island in search of elusive gold&quot; as well as carrying out &quot;much ethnological work amongst the interior villages and native hillsmen&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;LRH Biog Puerto Rican&quot; /&gt; Hubbard's unofficial biographer [[Russell Miller]] writes that neither the [[United States Geological Survey]] nor the Puerto Rican Department of Natural Resources have any record of any such expedition.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller=56&quot; /&gt;

According to Miller, Hubbard traveled to Puerto Rico in November 1932 after his father volunteered him for the [[American Red Cross|Red Cross]] relief effort following the devastating [[1932 San Ciprian hurricane]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller=56&quot; /&gt; In a 1957 lecture Hubbard said that he had been &quot;a field executive with the American Red Cross in the Puerto Rico hurricane disaster.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, L.

Ability Congress, 5th lecture.&lt;/ref&gt; According to his own account, Hubbard spent much of his time prospecting unsuccessfully for gold. Towards the end of his stay on Puerto Rico he appears to have done some work for a Washington D.C. firm called West Indies Minerals Incorporated, accompanying a surveyor in an investigation of a small property near the town of [[Luquillo, Puerto Rico]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Atack-63&quot;/&gt; The survey was unsuccessful. A few years later, Hubbard wrote:

{{quote|Harboring the thought that the Conquistadores might have left some gold behind, I determined to find it ... Gold prospecting in the wake of the Conquistadores, on the hunting grounds of the pirates in the islands which still reek of Columbus is romantic, and I do not begrudge the sweat which splashed in muddy rivers, and the bits of khaki which have probably blown away from the thorn bushes long ago ...

After a half year or more of intensive search, after wearing my palms thin wielding a sample pack, after assaying a few hundred sacks of ore, I came back, a failure.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adventure&quot; /&gt;}}

Hubbard became a well-known and prolific writer for [[pulp magazine|pulp fiction magazines]] during the 1930s. Scientology texts describe him as becoming &quot;well established as an essayist&quot; even before he had concluded college. Scientology claims he &quot;solved his finances, and his desire to travel by writing anything that came to hand&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Brief Biography&quot; /&gt; and to have earned an &quot;astronomical&quot; rate of pay for the times.&lt;ref&gt;''L. Ron Hubbard, the writer''. Los Angeles, CA : Bridge Publications, 1989. (No page number in original.)&lt;/ref&gt;

His literary career began with contributions to the George Washington University student newspaper, ''The University Hatchet'', as a reporter for a few months in 1931.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller-47&quot; /&gt; Six of his pieces were published commercially during 1932 to 1933.&lt;ref name=&quot;Atack-64&quot; /&gt; The going rate for freelance writers at the time was only a cent a word, so Hubbard's total earnings from these articles would have been less than $100.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller-63&quot;&gt;Miller, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; The pulp magazine ''Thrilling Adventure'' became the first to publish one of his short stories, in February 1934.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.galaxypress.com/l-ron-hubbard About L. Ron Hubbard&amp;nbsp;– Master Storyteller]&quot;. Galaxy Press, 2010, retrieved February 8, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next six years, pulp magazines published around 140 of his short stories&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.lronhubbard.org/books/l-ron-hubbards-fiction-books.html L.

Although he was best known for his [[fantasy]] and [[science fiction]] stories, Hubbard wrote in a wide variety of genres, including adventure fiction, aviation, travel, mysteries, westerns and even romance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Frenschkowski&quot; /&gt; Hubbard knew and associated with writers such as [[Isaac Asimov]], [[Robert A.

These included ''[[Fear (novella)|Fear]]'', ''[[Final Blackout]]'' and ''[[Typewriter in the Sky]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller-86&quot;&gt;Miller, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Church of Scientology, Hubbard was &quot;called to Hollywood&quot; to work on film scripts in the mid-1930s, although Scientology accounts differ as to exactly when this was (whether 1935,&lt;ref name=&quot;Dianetics Today&quot;&gt;&quot;About the Author&quot; in Hubbard, L.

He wrote the script for ''[[The Secret of Treasure Island]]'', a 1938 [[Columbia Pictures]] [[Serial film|movie serial]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Harmon&quot;&gt;Harmon, Jim; Donald F. Glut. ''The Great Movie Serials: Their Sound and Fury'', p. 329. London: Routledge, 1973. ISBN 978-0-7130-0097-9&lt;/ref&gt; The Church of Scientology claims he also worked on the Columbia serials ''[[The Mysterious Pilot]]'' (1937), ''[[The Great Adventures of Wild Bill Hickok]]'' (1938) and ''[[The Spider Returns]]'' (1941),&lt;ref name=&quot;Chronicle1930-1940&quot; /&gt; though his name does not appear on the credits. Hubbard also claimed to have written ''[[Dive Bomber (film)|Dive Bomber]]'' (1941),&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, L. Ron. &quot;The Story of Dianetics and Scientology&quot;, lecture of October 18, 1958&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Atack-65&quot;&gt;Atack, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cecil B.

Hubbard's literary earnings helped him to support his new wife, [[Margaret Grubb|Margaret &quot;Polly&quot; Grubb]]. She was already pregnant when they married on April 13, 1933, but she had a [[miscarriage|spontaneous abortion]] shortly afterwards; a few months later, she became pregnant again.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller-61&quot;&gt;Miller, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; On May 7, 1934, she gave birth prematurely to a son who was named [[Ronald DeWolf|Lafayette Ronald Hubbard, Jr.]] and the nickname &quot;His Nibs&quot;, invariably shortened to &quot;Nibs&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller-64&quot;&gt;Miller, p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; Their second child, Katherine May, was born on January 15, 1936.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller-70&quot;&gt;Miller, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; The Hubbards lived for a while in [[Laytonsville, Maryland]], but were chronically short of money.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller-62&quot;&gt;Miller, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;

In the spring of 1936 they moved to [[Bremerton, Washington]]. They lived there for a time with Hubbard's aunts and grandmother before finding a place of their own at nearby [[South Colby, Washington|South Colby]]. According to one of his friends at the time, [[Robert MacDonald Ford]], the Hubbards were &quot;in fairly dire straits for money&quot; but sustained themselves on the income from Hubbard's writing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller-74&quot;&gt;Miller, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; Hubbard spent an increasing amount of time in [[New York City]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller-71&quot;&gt;Miller, p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; working out of a hotel room where his wife suspected him of carrying on affairs with other women.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller-75&quot;&gt;Miller, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller-84&quot;&gt;Miller, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;

Hubbard's authorship in mid-1938 of a still-unpublished manuscript called ''[[Excalibur (L. Ron Hubbard work)|Excalibur]]'' is highlighted by the Church of Scientology as a key step in developing the principles of Scientology and Dianetics. The manuscript is said by scientologists to have outlined &quot;the basic principles of human existence&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Brief Biography&quot; /&gt; and to have been the culmination of twenty years of research into &quot;twenty-one races and cultures including Pacific Northwest Indian tribes, Philippine Tagalogs and, as he was wont to joke, the people of the Bronx.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Founder&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://www.lronhubbard.org/biography/founder.html L. Ron Hubbard Biographical Profile&amp;nbsp;– Founder]&quot;. Church of Scientology International, 2010, retrieved February 17, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Arthur J. Cox, a contributor to John W. Campbell's ''Astounding'' magazine, Hubbard told a 1948 convention of science fiction fans that ''Excalibur's'' inspiration came during an operation in which he &quot;died&quot; for eight minutes.&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, p. 272&lt;/ref&gt; (Gerry Armstrong, Hubbard's archivist, explains this as a [[dental extraction]] performed under [[nitrous oxide]], a chemical known for its hallucinogenic effects&lt;ref name=&quot;Atack-66&quot;&gt;Atack, p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;):

{{quote|Hubbard realized that, while he was dead, he had received a tremendous inspiration, a great Message which he must impart to others. He sat at his typewriter for six days and nights and nothing came out. Then, ''Excalibur'' emerged.&lt;ref name=&quot;Malko=40&quot;&gt;Malko, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Arthur J. Burks]], the President of the American Fiction Guild, wrote that an excited Hubbard called him and said: &quot;I want to see you right away. I have written THE book.&quot; Hubbard believed that ''Excalibur'' would &quot;revolutionize everything&quot; and that &quot;it was somewhat more important, and would have a greater impact upon people, than the [[Bible]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Burks&quot;&gt;Burks, Arthur J (December 1961). &quot;Excalibur&quot;. ''The Aberree''.&lt;/ref&gt; It proposed that all human behavior could be explained in terms of survival and that to understand survival was to understand life.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller-80&quot;&gt;Miller, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; As Hubbard biographer Jon Atack notes, &quot;the notion that everything that exists is trying to survive became the basis of Dianetics and Scientology.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Atack-66&quot; /&gt;

According to Burks, Hubbard &quot;was so sure he had something 'away out and beyond' anything else that he had sent telegrams to several book publishers, telling them that he had written &quot;THE book&quot; and that they were to meet him at [[Pennsylvania Station (New York City)|Penn Station]], and he would discuss it with them and go with whomever gave him the best offer.&quot; However, nobody bought the manuscript.&lt;ref name=&quot;Burks&quot; /&gt; [[Forrest J Ackerman]]&lt;!-- N.B. NO PERIOD AFTER THE J --&gt;, later Hubbard's [[literary agent]], recalled that Hubbard told him &quot;whoever read it either went insane or committed suicide. And he said that the last time he had shown it to a publisher in New York, he walked into the office to find out what the reaction was, the publisher called for the reader, the reader came in with the manuscript, threw it on the table and threw himself out of the skyscraper window.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Ackerman, Forrest J (November 19, 1997) ''Secret Lives: L. Ron Hubbard''. Channel 4 Television.&lt;/ref&gt; Hubbard's failure to sell ''Excalibur'' depressed him; he told his wife in an October 1938 letter: &quot;Writing action pulp doesn't have much agreement with what I want to do because it retards my progress by demanding incessant attention and, further, actually weakens my name. So you see I've got to do something about it and at the same time strengthen the old financial position.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Letter-1938&quot;&gt;Letter from L. Ron Hubbard, October 1938, quoted in Miller, p. 81&lt;/ref&gt; He went on:

{{quote|Sooner or later ''Excalibur'' will be published and I may have a chance to get some name recognition out of it so as to pave the way to articles and comments which are my ideas of writing heaven ... Foolishly perhaps, but determined none the less, I have high hopes of smashing my name into history so violently that it will take a legendary form even if all books are destroyed. That goal is the real goal as far as I am concerned.&lt;ref name=&quot;Letter-1938&quot; /&gt;}}

The manuscript later became part of Scientology mythology.&lt;ref name=&quot;Atack-66&quot; /&gt; An early 1950s Scientology publication offered signed &quot;gold-bound and locked&quot; copies for the sum of $1,500 apiece (equivalent to about $29,000 now). It warned that &quot;four of the first fifteen people who read it went insane&quot; and that it would be &quot;[r]eleased only on sworn statement not to permit other readers to read it. Contains data not to be released during Mr. Hubbard's stay on earth.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Malko, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ketchikan AK.jpg|thumb|alt=Buildings visible at a shoreline with forest above|Ketchikan, Alaska, where Hubbard and his wife were stranded during the &quot;Alaskan Radio-Experimental Expedition&quot;]]
Hubbard joined [[The Explorers Club]] in February 1940 on the strength of his claimed explorations in the Caribbean and survey flights in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller-85&quot;&gt;Miller, p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; He persuaded the club to let him carry its flag on an &quot;Alaskan Radio-Experimental Expedition&quot; to update the U.S. Coast Pilot guide to the coastlines of [[Alaska]] and [[British Columbia]] and investigate new methods of radio position-finding.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller-88&quot;&gt;Miller, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; The expedition consisted of Hubbard and his wife—the children were left at South Colby—aboard his [[ketch]] ''Magician''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller-89&quot;&gt;Miller, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientology accounts of the expedition describe &quot;Hubbard's recharting of an especially treacherous [[Inside Passage]], and his ethnological study of indigenous Aleuts and Haidas&quot; and tell of how &quot;along the way, he not only roped a [[Kodiak Bear]], but braved seventy-mile-an-hour winds and commensurate seas off the [[Aleutian Islands]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Alaskan&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://www.lronhubbard.org/biography/adventures-explorations/alaskan-radio-experimental-expedition.html L. Ron Hubbard Biographical Profile&amp;nbsp;– Alaskan Radio-Experimental Expedition]&quot; Church of Scientology International, 2010, retrieved February 17, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; They are divided about how far Hubbard's expedition actually traveled, whether {{convert|700|mi}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Chronicle1930-1940&quot; /&gt; or {{convert|2000|mi}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alaskan&quot; /&gt;

Hubbard told the ''[[Seattle Star]]'' in a November 1940 letter that the expedition was plagued by problems and did not get any further than [[Ketchikan, Alaska|Ketchikan]] near the southern end of the [[Alaska Panhandle]], far from the Aleutian Islands.&lt;ref name=&quot;Atack-68&quot;&gt;Atack, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; ''Magician's'' engine broke down only two days after setting off in July 1940. The Hubbards reached Ketchikan on August 30, 1940, after many delays following repeated engine breakdowns. The ''Ketchikan Chronicle'' reported—making no mention of the expedition—that Hubbard's purpose in coming to Alaska &quot;was two-fold, one to win a bet and another to gather material for a novel of Alaskan salmon fishing.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller-89&quot; /&gt; Having underestimated the cost of the trip, he did not have enough money to repair the broken engine. He raised money by writing stories and contributing to the local radio station&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller-91&quot;&gt;Miller, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; and eventually earned enough to fix the engine,&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller-85&quot; /&gt; making it back to Puget Sound on December 27, 1940.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller-91&quot; /&gt;

He was a member of the all-male literary banqueting club the [[Trap Door Spiders]], which served as the basis of [[Isaac Asimov]]'s fictional group of mystery solvers the [[Black Widowers]].

==Military career==
{{Main|Military career of L. Ron Hubbard}}
[[File:Hubbard and moulton.jpg|right|thumb|alt=Two men in naval uniform|Lts (jg) L. Ron Hubbard and Thomas S. Moulton in Portland, Oregon in 1943]]
After returning from Alaska, Hubbard applied to join the United States Navy. His Congressman, [[Warren G. Magnuson]], wrote to President Roosevelt to recommend Hubbard as &quot;a gentleman of reputation&quot; who was &quot;a respected explorer&quot; and had &quot;marine masters papers for more types of vessels than any other man in the United States&quot;. Hubbard was described as &quot;a key figure&quot; in writing organizations, &quot;making him politically potent nationally&quot;. The Congressman concluded: &quot;Anything you can do for Mr Hubbard will be appreciated.&quot; His friend Robert MacDonald Ford, by now a State Representative for Washington, sent a letter of recommendation describing Hubbard as &quot;one of the most brilliant men I have ever known&quot;. Hubbard was said by Scientologists to be &quot;a powerful influence&quot; in the Northwest and to be &quot;well known in many parts of the world and has considerable influence in the Caribbean and Alaska.&quot; The letter declared that &quot;for courage and ability I cannot too strongly recommend him.&quot; Ford later said that Hubbard had written the letter himself: &quot;I don't know why Ron wanted a letter. I just gave him a letter-head and said, 'Hell, you're the writer, you write it!'&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller-93&quot;&gt;Miller, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;

Hubbard was commissioned as a Lieutenant (junior grade) in the U.S. Naval Reserve on July 19, 1941. His military service forms a major element of his public persona as portrayed by Scientologists.&lt;ref name=&quot;Atack-70&quot;&gt;Atack, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; The Church of Scientology presents him as a &quot;much-decorated war hero who commanded a [[corvette]] and during hostilities was crippled and wounded.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lamont-19&quot;&gt;Lamont, pp. 19–20&lt;/ref&gt; Scientology publications say he served as a &quot;Commodore of Corvette squadrons&quot; in &quot;all five theaters of World War II&quot; and was awarded &quot;twenty-one medals and palms&quot; for his service.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rolph-16&quot;&gt;Rolph, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; He was &quot;severely wounded and was taken crippled and blinded&quot; to a military hospital, where he &quot;worked his way back to fitness, strength and full perception in less than two years, using only what he knew and could determine about Man and his relationship to the universe.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dianetics Today&quot; /&gt; He claimed to have seen combat repeatedly, telling [[A. E. van Vogt]] that he had once sailed his ship &quot;right into the harbor of a Japanese occupied island in the [[Dutch East Indies]]. His attitude was that if you took your flag down the Japanese would not know one boat from another, so he tied up at the dock, went ashore and wandered around by himself for three days.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller-141&quot;&gt;Miller, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt;

Hubbard's official Navy service records indicate that &quot;his military performance was, at times, substandard&quot; and he received only four campaign medals rather than twenty-one. He was never recorded as being injured or wounded in combat and so never received a [[Purple Heart]].&lt;ref name=&quot;SW-Creating&quot; /&gt; Most of his military service was spent ashore in the [[continental United States]] on administrative or training duties. He served for a short time in [[Australia]] but was sent home after quarreling with his superiors. He briefly commanded two [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine vessels]], the [[USS YP-422|USS ''YP-422'']] and [[USS PC-815|USS ''PC-815'']], in coastal waters off [[Massachusetts]], [[Oregon]] and [[California]] in 1942 and 1943 respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;SW-Creating&quot; /&gt;

After Hubbard reported that the ''PC-815'' had attacked and crippled or sunk two [[Imperial Japanese Navy submarines|Japanese submarines]] off Oregon in May 1943, his claim was rejected by the commander of the [[Northwest Sea Frontier]].&lt;ref name=&quot;SW-Creating&quot; /&gt; Hubbard and Thomas Moulton, his second in command on the ''PC-815'', later said the Navy wanted to avoid panic on the mainland.&lt;ref&gt;Streeter, p. 208&lt;/ref&gt; A month later Hubbard unwittingly sailed the ''PC-815'' into Mexican territorial waters and conducted gunnery practice off the [[Coronado Islands]], in the belief that they were uninhabited and belonged to the United States. The Mexican government complained and Hubbard was relieved of command. A fitness report written after the incident rated Hubbard as unsuitable for independent duties and &quot;lacking in the essential qualities of judgment, leadership and cooperation.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller-107&quot;&gt;Miller, p. 107&lt;/ref&gt; He served for a while as the Navigation and Training Officer for the [[USS Algol (AKA-54)|USS ''Algol'']] while it was based at Portland. A fitness report from this period recommended promotion, describing him as &quot;a capable and energetic officer, [but] very temperamental&quot;, and an &quot;above average navigator&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Atack, p. 81; Streeter, p. 208&lt;/ref&gt; However, he never held another command and did not serve aboard another ship after the ''Algol''.

[[File:Uss pc-815 1.jpg|right|thumb|alt=Naval ship moving forward in water|The USS ''PC-815'', Hubbard's second and final command]]
Hubbard's war service has great significance in the history and mythology of the Church of Scientology, as he is said to have cured himself through techniques that would later underpin Scientology and Dianetics. According to Moulton, Hubbard told him that he had been machine-gunned in the back near the Dutch East Indies. Hubbard asserted that his eyes had been damaged as well, either &quot;by the flash of a large-caliber gun&quot; or when he had &quot;a bomb go off in my face&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;SW-Creating&quot; /&gt; Scientology texts say that he returned from the war &quot;[b]linded with injured optic nerves, and lame with physical injuries to hip and back&quot; and was twice pronounced dead.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wright&quot; /&gt;

His medical records state that he was hospitalized with an acute [[duodenal ulcer]] rather than a war injury. He told his doctors that he was suffering from lameness caused by a hip infection&lt;ref name=&quot;SW-Creating&quot; /&gt; and he told ''Look'' magazine in December 1950 that he had suffered from &quot;ulcers, conjunctivitis, deteriorating eyesight, bursitis and something wrong with my feet.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Maisel&quot; /&gt; He was still complaining in 1951 of eye problems and stomach pains, which had given him &quot;continuous trouble&quot; for eight years, especially when &quot;under nervous stress.&quot; This came well after Hubbard had promised that Dianetics would provide &quot;a cure for the very ailments that plagued the author himself then and throughout his life, including allergies, arthritis, ulcers and heart problems.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;SW-Creating&quot; /&gt;

The Church of Scientology says that Hubbard's key breakthrough in the development of Dianetics was made at [[Oak Knoll Naval Hospital]] in [[Oakland, California]]. According to the Church,

{{quote|In early 1945, while recovering from war injuries at Oak Knoll Naval Hospital, Mr. Hubbard conducts a series of tests and experiments dealing with the endocrine system. He discovers that, contrary to long-standing beliefs, function monitors structure. With this revolutionary advance, he begins to apply his theories to the field of the mind and thereby to improve the conditions of others.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://mediaresources.lronhubbard.org/chronicle/page03.htm L. Ron Hubbard&amp;nbsp;– A Chronicle: 1941-1949]. Church of Scientology International, 2007, retrieved February 17, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

An October 1945 Naval Board found that Hubbard was &quot;considered physically qualified to perform duty ashore, preferably within the continental United States&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Atack-84&quot;&gt;Atack, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt; He was discharged from hospital on December 4, 1945, and transferred to inactive duty on February 17, 1946. He resigned his commission with effect from October 30, 1950.&lt;ref name=&quot;sppulitzer&quot; /&gt; The Church of Scientology says he quit because the U.S. Navy &quot;attempted to monopolize all his researches and force him to work on a project 'to make man more suggestible' and when he was unwilling, tried to blackmail him by ordering him back to active duty to perform this function. Having many friends he was able to instantly resign from the Navy and escape this trap.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;FIL67&quot; /&gt; The Navy said in a statement in 1980: &quot;There is no evidence on record of an attempt to recall him to active duty.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;sppulitzer&quot;&gt;{{cite news | first1 = Charles L. |last1=Stafford | first2 = Bette |last2=Orsini | title = Church moves to defend itself against 'attackers | work = St. Petersburg Times | date = January 9, 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Church disputes the official record of Hubbard's naval career. It asserts that the records are incomplete and perhaps falsified &quot;to conceal Hubbard's secret activities as an intelligence officer.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;SW-Creating&quot; /&gt; In 1990 the Church provided the ''Los Angeles Times'' with a document that was said to be a copy of Hubbard's official record of service. The U.S. Navy told the ''Times'' that &quot;its contents are not supported by Hubbard's personnel record.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;SW-Creating&quot; /&gt; ''[[The New Yorker]]'' reported in February 2011 that the Scientology document was considered to be a forgery.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wright&quot; /&gt;

==Occult involvement in Pasadena==
Hubbard's life underwent a turbulent period immediately after the war. According to his own account, he &quot;was abandoned by family and friends as a supposedly hopeless cripple and a probable burden upon them for the rest of my days&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;My Philosophy&quot;&gt;Hubbard, L. Ron. &quot;[http://www.ronthephilosopher.org/phlspher/page84.htm My Philosophy]&quot;, Church of Scientology International, 1965, retrieved February 17, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; His daughter Katherine presented a rather different version: his wife had refused to uproot their children from their home in Bremerton, Washington, to join him in California. Their marriage was by now in terminal difficulties and he chose to stay in California.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller-116&quot;&gt;Miller, p. 125&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1945 Hubbard moved into the [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]] mansion of [[John Whiteside Parsons|John &quot;Jack&quot; Whiteside Parsons]]. A leading [[rocket propulsion]] researcher at the [[California Institute of Technology]] and a founder of the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]], Parsons led a double life as an avid [[occultism|occultist]] and [[Thelema|Thelemite]], follower of the English ceremonial magician [[Aleister Crowley]] and leader of a lodge of Crowley's [[magical order]], [[Ordo Templi Orientis]] (OTO).&lt;ref name=&quot;Wright&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller-113&quot;&gt;Miller, p. 113&lt;/ref&gt; He let rooms in the house only to tenants who he specified should be &quot;atheists and those of a Bohemian disposition&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller-114&quot;&gt;Miller, p. 114&lt;/ref&gt;

Hubbard befriended Parsons and soon became sexually involved with Parsons's 21-year-old girlfriend, [[Sara Northrup Hollister|Sara &quot;Betty&quot; Northrup]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller-117&quot;&gt;Miller, p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this Parsons was very impressed with Hubbard and reported to Crowley:

{{quote|[Hubbard] is a gentleman; he has red hair, green eyes, is honest and intelligent, and we have become great friends. He moved in with me about two months ago, and although Betty and I are still friendly, she has transferred her sexual affection to Ron. Although he has no formal training in Magick, he has an extraordinary amount of experience and understanding in the field. From some of his experiences I deduced that he is in direct touch with some higher intelligence, possibly his Guardian Angel. He describes his Angel as a beautiful winged woman with red hair whom he calls the Empress and who has guided him through his life and saved him many times. He is the most Thelemic person I have ever met and is in complete accord with our own principles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Symonds&quot;&gt;Quoted in Symonds, John. ''The Great Beast: the life and magick of Aleister Crowley'', p. 392. London: Macdonald and Co., 1971. ISBN 0-356-03631-6&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Parsons and Hubbard collaborated on the &quot;[[Babalon Working]]&quot;, a [[sex magic]] ritual intended to summon an incarnation of [[Babalon]], the Mother of Abominations. It was undertaken over several nights in February and March 1946 in order to summon an &quot;elemental&quot; who would participate in further sex magic.&lt;ref name=&quot;Urban&quot;&gt;Urban, Hugh B.

{{quote|Parsons used his &quot;magical wand&quot; to whip up a vortex of energy so the elemental would be summoned. Translated into plain English, Parsons [[masturbation|jerked off]] in the name of spiritual advancement whilst Hubbard (referred to as &quot;The Scribe&quot; in the diary of the event) scanned the astral plane for signs and visions.&lt;ref&gt;Metzger, Richard. ''Book of Lies: The Disinformation Guide to Magick and the Occult'', p. 200. New York: The Disinformation Company, 2008. ISBN 978-0-9713942-7-8&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The &quot;elemental&quot; arrived a few days later in the form of [[Marjorie Cameron]], who agreed to participate in Parsons' rites.&lt;ref name=&quot;Urban&quot; /&gt; Soon afterwards, Parsons, Hubbard and Sara agreed to set up a business partnership, &quot;Allied Enterprises&quot;, in which they invested nearly their entire savings—the vast majority contributed by Parsons. The plan was for Hubbard and Sara to buy yachts in [[Miami]] and sail them to the West Coast to sell for a profit. Hubbard had a different idea; he wrote to the U.S. Navy requesting permission to leave the country &quot;to visit Central &amp; South America &amp; China&quot; for the purposes of &quot;collecting writing material&quot;—in other words, undertaking a world cruise.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pendle-268&quot;&gt;Pendle, p. 268&lt;/ref&gt; Aleister Crowley strongly criticized Parsons's actions, writing: &quot;Suspect Ron playing confidence trick—Jack Parsons weak fool—obvious victim prowling swindlers.&quot; Parsons attempted to recover his money by obtaining an injunction to prevent Hubbard and Sara leaving the country or disposing of the remnants of his assets.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pendle-269&quot;&gt;Pendle, p. 269&lt;/ref&gt; They attempted to sail anyway but were forced back to port by a storm. A week later, Allied Enterprises was dissolved. Parsons received only a $2,900 promissory note from Hubbard and returned home &quot;shattered&quot;. He had to sell his mansion to developers soon afterwards to recoup his losses.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pendle-270&quot;&gt;Pendle, p. 270&lt;/ref&gt;

Hubbard's fellow writers were well aware of what had happened between him and Parsons. [[L. Sprague de Camp]] wrote to [[Isaac Asimov]] on August 27, 1946, to tell him:

{{quote|The more complete story of Hubbard is that he is now in Fla. living on his yacht with a man-eating tigress named Betty-alias-Sarah, another of the same kind ... He will probably soon thereafter arrive in these parts with Betty-Sarah, broke, working the poor-wounded-veteran racket for all its worth, and looking for another easy mark. Don't say you haven't been warned. Bob &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Robert Heinlein]]] thinks Ron went to pieces morally as a result of the war. I think that's fertilizer, that he always was that way, but when he wanted to conciliate or get something from somebody he could put on a good charm act. What the war did was to wear him down to where he no longer bothers with the act.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pendle-271&quot;&gt;De Camp, L. Sprague, letter of August 26, 1946. Quoted by Pendle, p. 271&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Scientology accounts do not mention Hubbard's involvement in occultism. He is instead described as &quot;continu[ing] to write to help support his research&quot; during this period into &quot;the development of a means to better the condition of man.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.lronhubbardprofile.org/profile/chron5.htm L. Ron Hubbard: A Chronicle 1941-1949]&quot;. Church of Scientology International, retrieved February 8, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The Church of Scientology has nonetheless acknowledged Hubbard's involvement with the OTO; a 1969 statement, written by Hubbard himself,&lt;ref name=&quot;Atack-90&quot;&gt;Atack, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt; said:

{{quote|Hubbard broke up black magic in America ... L. Ron Hubbard was still an officer of the U.S. Navy, because he was well known as a writer and a philosopher and had friends amongst the physicists, he was sent in to handle the situation. He went to live at the house and investigated the black magic rites and the general situation and found them very bad. ...

Hubbard's mission was successful far beyond anyone's expectations. The house was torn down. Hubbard rescued a girl they were using. The black magic group was dispersed and destroyed and has never recovered.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Scientology: New Light on Crowley&quot;. ''The Sunday Times'', December 28, 1969&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Church of Scientology says Hubbard was &quot;sent in&quot; by his fellow science fiction author [[Robert Heinlein]], &quot;who was running off-book intelligence operations for naval intelligence at the time.&quot; However, Heinlein's authorized biographer has said that he looked into the matter at the suggestion of Scientologists but found nothing to corroborate claims that Heinlein had been involved, and his biography of Heinlein makes no mention of the matter.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wright&quot;&gt;Wright, Lawrence (February 14, 2011).&quot;[http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2011/02/14/110214fa_fact_wright?currentPage=all The Apostate: Paul Haggis vs. the Church of Scientology]&quot;. ''The New Yorker'', retrieved February 8, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 10, 1946, Hubbard [[bigamy|bigamously]] married Sara, while still married to Polly. It was not until 1947 that his first wife learned that he had remarried. Hubbard agreed to divorce Polly in June that year and the marriage was dissolved shortly afterwards, with Polly given custody of the children.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller-134&quot;&gt;Miller, p. 134&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins of ''Dianetics''==
[[File:MastersOfSleep.jpg|right|thumb|alt=Illustrated cover of Fantastic Adventures magazine, depicting two figures hiding behind an enormous crystal as a giant leers over them|''Masters of Sleep'', one of Hubbard's last works of pulp fiction, on the cover of the October 1950 issue of ''[[Fantastic Adventures]]'']]
After Hubbard's wedding to Sara, the couple settled at [[Laguna Beach, California]], where Hubbard took a short-term job looking after a friend's yacht&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller-132&quot;&gt;Miller, p. 132&lt;/ref&gt; before resuming his fiction writing to supplement the small disability allowance that he was receiving as a war veteran.&lt;ref name=&quot;Streeter-210&quot;&gt;Streeter, p. 210&lt;/ref&gt; Working from a trailer in a run-down area of [[North Hollywood]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller-134&quot; /&gt; Hubbard sold a number of science fiction stories that included his ''[[Ole Doc Methuselah]]'' series and the serialized novels ''The End Is Not Yet'' and ''[[To the Stars (novel)|To the Stars]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stableford&quot; /&gt; However, he remained short of money and repeatedly wrote to the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Veterans Administration]] (VA) asking for an increase in his war pension. In October 1947 he wrote:

{{quote|After trying and failing for two years to regain my equilibrium in civil life, I am utterly unable to approach anything like my own competence. My last physician informed me that it might be very helpful if I were to be examined and perhaps treated psychiatrically or even by a psychoanalyst. Toward the end of my service I avoided out of pride any mental examinations, hoping that time would balance a mind which I had every reason to suppose was seriously affected. I cannot account for nor rise above long periods of moroseness and suicidal inclinations, and have newly come to realize that I must first triumph above this before I can hope to rehabilitate myself at all.&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, L. Ron, letter to Veterans Administration, October 15, 1947; quoted in Miller, p. 137&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The VA eventually did increase his pension,&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller-139&quot;&gt;Miller, p. 139&lt;/ref&gt; but his money problems continued. On August 31, 1948, he was arrested in [[San Luis Obispo, California]], and subsequently pleaded guilty to a charge of petty theft, for which he was ordered to pay a $25 fine.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller-142&quot;&gt;Miller, p. 142&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Church of Scientology, around this time he &quot;accept[ed] an appointment as a Special Police Officer with the Los Angeles Police Department and uses the position to study society's criminal elements&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Chronicle1930-1940&quot; /&gt; and also &quot;worked with neurotics from the Hollywood film community&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://dianetics.lronhubbard.org/page12.htm Letters from the Birth of Dianetics].&quot; Church of Scientology International, 2004, retrieved February 8, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 1948 Hubbard and Sara moved to [[Savannah, Georgia]].&lt;ref&gt;Miller, p. 143&lt;/ref&gt; Here, Scientology sources say, he &quot;volunteer[ed] his time in hospitals and mental wards, saving the lives of patients with his counseling techniques.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://mediaresources.lronhubbard.org/chronicle/page03.htm L. Ron Hubbard&amp;nbsp;– A Chronicle: 1941–1949]&quot; Church of Scientology International, 2007, retrieved February 14, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Hubbard began to make the first public mentions of what was to become Dianetics. He wrote in January 1949 that he was working on a &quot;book of psychology&quot; about &quot;the cause and cure of nervous tension&quot;, which he was going to call ''The Dark Sword'', ''Excalibur'' or ''Science of the Mind''.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, p. 144&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1949, Hubbard wrote to several professional organizations to offer his research.&lt;ref&gt;One such letter can be found on the Church of Scientology's official L. Ron Hubbard website. See &quot;[http://dianetics.lronhubbard.org/page14.htm Letters from the Birth of Dianetics]&quot;, Church of Scientology International, 2004, retrieved February 8, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; None were interested, so he turned to his editor John W. Campbell, who was more receptive due to a long-standing fascination with fringe psychologies and psychic powers (&quot;[[psionics]]&quot;) that &quot;permeated both his fiction and non-fiction.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Luckhurst, Roger. ''Science Fiction'', p. 74. Malden, MA: Polity, 2005. ISBN 978-0-7456-2893-6&lt;/ref&gt;

Campbell invited Hubbard and Sara to move into a cottage at [[Bay Head, New Jersey]], not far from his own home at [[Plainfield, New Jersey|Plainfield]]. In July 1949 Campbell recruited an acquaintance, Dr. Joseph Winter, to help to develop Hubbard's new therapy of &quot;Dianetics&quot;. Campbell told Winter:

{{quote|With cooperation from some institutions, some psychiatrists, [Hubbard] has worked on all types of cases. Institutionalized schizophrenics, apathies, manics, depressives, perverts, stuttering, neuroses—in all, nearly 1000 cases. But just a brief sampling of each type; he doesn't have proper statistics in the usual sense. But he has one statistic. He has cured every patient he worked with. He has cured ulcers, arthritis, asthma.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller-149&quot;&gt;Miller, p. 149&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- verbatim quote: do not alter --&gt;}}

Hubbard collaborated with Campbell and Winter to refine his techniques,&lt;ref name=&quot;Atack-106&quot;&gt;Atack, p. 106&lt;/ref&gt; testing them on science fiction fans recruited by Campbell.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller-150&quot;&gt;Miller, p. 150&lt;/ref&gt; The basic principle of Dianetics was that the brain recorded every experience and event in a person's life, even when unconscious. Bad or painful experiences were stored as &quot;[[Engram (Dianetics)|engrams]]&quot; in a &quot;[[reactive mind]]&quot;. These could be triggered later in life, causing emotional and physical problems. By carrying out a process called &quot;[[Auditing (Scientology)|auditing]]&quot;, a person could be regressed through his engrams to re-experiencing past experiences. This enabled engrams to be &quot;cleared&quot;. The subject, who would now be in a state of &quot;[[Clear (Scientology)|Clear]]&quot;, would have a perfectly functioning mind with an improved IQ and photographic memory.&lt;ref&gt;Streeter, pp. 210–211&lt;/ref&gt; The &quot;Clear&quot; would be cured of physical ailments ranging from poor eyesight to the common cold,&lt;ref name=&quot;Atack-108&quot;&gt;Atack, p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; which Hubbard asserted were purely [[psychosomatic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Miller|first=Timothy|title=America's Alternative Religions|publisher=State University of New York Press|location=Albany|year=1995|pages=385–6|isbn=978-0-7914-2398-1|oclc=30476551}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Winter submitted a paper on Dianetics to the ''[[Journal of the American Medical Association]]'' and the ''[[American Journal of Psychiatry]]'' but both journals rejected it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winter-18&quot;&gt;Winter, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; Hubbard and his collaborators decided to announce Dianetics in Campbell's ''Astounding Science Fiction'' instead. In an editorial, Campbell said: &quot;Its power is almost unbelievable; it proves the mind not only can but does rule the body completely; following the sharply defined basic laws set forth, physical ills such as ulcers, asthma and arthritis can be cured, as can all other psychosomatic ills.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller-145&quot;&gt;Quoted in Miller, p. 145&lt;/ref&gt; The birth of Hubbard's second daughter Alexis Valerie, delivered by Winter on March 8, 1950, came in the middle of the preparations to launch Dianetics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller-149&quot;&gt;Miller, p. 152&lt;/ref&gt; A &quot;Hubbard Dianetic Research Foundation&quot; was established in April 1950 in [[Elizabeth, New Jersey]], with Hubbard, Sara, Winter and Campbell on the board of directors. Dianetics was duly launched in ''Astounding's'' May 1950 issue and on May 9, Hubbard's companion book ''[[Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health]]'' was published.&lt;ref name=&quot;Atack-107&quot;&gt;Atack, p. 107&lt;/ref&gt;

==From Dianetics to Scientology==
{{Main|History of Dianetics}}
[[File:L. Ron Hubbard conducting Dianetics seminar in Los Angeles in 1950.jpg|right|thumb|alt=A mostly seated crowd watches as Hubbard, seated on a chair, speaks to a woman lying prone in front of him.|Hubbard conducting a Dianetics seminar in Los Angeles, 1950]]
Hubbard called Dianetics &quot;a milestone for man comparable to his discovery of fire and superior to his invention of the wheel and the arch&quot;. It was an immediate commercial success and sparked what [[Martin Gardner]] calls &quot;a nation-wide cult of incredible proportions&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gardner-265&quot;&gt;Gardner, p. 265&lt;/ref&gt; By August 1950, Hubbard's book had sold 55,000 copies, was selling at the rate of 4,000 a week and was being translated into French, German and Japanese. Five hundred Dianetic auditing groups had been set up across the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;Newsweek-Dianetics&quot;&gt;Staff (August 21, 1950). &quot;Dianetics book review; Best Seller.&quot; ''Newsweek''&lt;/ref&gt;

Dianetics was poorly received by the press and the scientific and medical professions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Newsweek-Dianetics&quot; /&gt; The [[American Psychological Association]] criticized Hubbard's claims as &quot;not supported by empirical evidence&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Maisel&quot; /&gt; ''[[Scientific American]]'' said that Hubbard's book contained &quot;more promises and less evidence per page than any publication since the invention of printing&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Rabi, Isaac Isador. &quot;Book Review.&quot; ''Scientific American'', January 1951&lt;/ref&gt; while ''[[The New Republic]]'' called it a &quot;bold and immodest mixture of complete nonsense and perfectly reasonable common sense, taken from long acknowledged findings and disguised and distorted by a crazy, newly invented terminology&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Gumpert, Martin. (August 14, 1950) &quot;''Dianetics'': book review by Martin Gumpert&quot;. ''The New Republic''&lt;/ref&gt; Some of Hubbard's fellow science fiction writers also criticized it; Isaac Asimov considered it &quot;gibberish&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Asimov&quot; /&gt; while [[Jack Williamson]] called it &quot;a lunatic revision of Freudian psychology&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller-153&quot;&gt;Miller, p. 153&lt;/ref&gt;

Several famous individuals became involved with Dianetics. [[Aldous Huxley]] received auditing from Hubbard himself,&lt;ref name=&quot;Atack-115&quot;&gt;Atack, p. 113&lt;/ref&gt; the poet [[Jean Toomer]]&lt;ref&gt;Kerman, Cynthia Earl; Eldridge, Richard. ''The lives of Jean Toomer: a hunger for wholeness'', pp. 317–318. Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 1989. ISBN 978-0-8071-1548-0&lt;/ref&gt; and the science fiction writers [[Theodore Sturgeon]]&lt;ref&gt;Sturgeon, Theodore; Williams, Paul. ''Baby is three'', p. 414. Berkeley, CA: North Atlantic Books, 1999. ISBN 978-1-55643-319-1&lt;/ref&gt; and [[A. E. van Vogt]] became trained Dianetics auditors. Van Vogt temporarily abandoned writing and became the head of the newly established Los Angeles branch of the Hubbard Dianetic Research Foundation. Other branches were established in New York, Washington D.C., Chicago, Los Angeles, and Honolulu.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller-166&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Melton, p. 190&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Dianetics was not cheap, a great many people were nonetheless willing to pay; van Vogt later recalled &quot;doing little but tear open envelopes and pull out $500 checks from people who wanted to take an auditor's course.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller-166&quot;&gt;Miller, p. 166&lt;/ref&gt; Financial controls were lax. Hubbard himself withdrew large sums with no explanation of what he was doing with it. On one occasion, van Vogt saw Hubbard taking a lump sum of $56,000 (equivalent to $0.5 million at 2010 prices) out of the Los Angeles Foundation's proceeds.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller-166&quot; /&gt; One of Hubbard's employees, Helen O'Brien, commented that at the Elizabeth, N.J. branch of the Foundation the books showed that &quot;a month's income of $90,000 is listed, with only $20,000 accounted for.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;OBrien-27&quot;&gt;O'Brien, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

Hubbard played a very active role in the Dianetics boom, writing, lecturing and training auditors. Many of those who knew him spoke of being impressed by his personal charisma. Jack Horner, who became a Dianetics auditor in 1950, later said: &quot;He was very impressive, dedicated and amusing. The man had tremendous charisma; you just wanted to hear every word he had to say and listen for any pearl of wisdom.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Miller, pp. 159–160&lt;/ref&gt; Isaac Asimov recalled in his autobiography how at a dinner party he, Robert Heinlein, L. Sprague de Camp and their wives &quot;all sat as quietly as pussycats and listened to Hubbard. He told tales with perfect aplomb and in complete paragraphs.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Asimov&quot; /&gt; As Atack comments, he was &quot;a charismatic figure who compelled the devotion of those around him.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Atack, p. 377&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christopher Evans (computer scientist)|Christopher Evans]] described the personal qualities that Hubbard brought to Dianetics and Scientology:

{{quote|He undoubtedly has charisma, a magnetic lure of an indefinable kind which makes him the centre of attraction in any kind of gathering. He is also a compulsive talker and pontificator ... His restless energy keeps him on the go throughout a long day—he is a poor sleeper and rises very early—and provides part of the drive which has allowed him to found and propagate a major international organization.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Hubbard's supporters soon began to have doubts about Dianetics. Winter became disillusioned and wrote that he had never seen a single convincing Clear: &quot;I have seen some individuals who are supposed to have been 'clear,' but their behavior does not conform to the definition of the state. Moreover, an individual supposed to have been 'clear' has undergone a relapse into conduct which suggests an incipient psychosis.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Winter-34&quot;&gt;Winter, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; He also deplored the Foundation's omission of any serious scientific research.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller-169&quot;&gt;Miller, p. 169&lt;/ref&gt; Dianetics lost public credibility in August 1950 when a presentation by Hubbard before an audience of 6,000 at the [[Shrine Auditorium]] in Los Angeles failed disastrously.&lt;ref name=&quot;Whitehead-67&quot;&gt;Whitehead, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; He introduced a Clear named Sonya Bianca and told the audience that as a result of undergoing Dianetic therapy she now possessed perfect recall. However, Gardner writes, &quot;in the demonstration that followed, she failed to remember a single formula in physics (the subject in which she was majoring) or the color of Hubbard's tie when his back was turned. At this point, a large part of the audience got up and left.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gardner-270&quot;&gt;Gardner, p. 270&lt;/ref&gt;

Hubbard also faced other practitioners moving into leadership positions within the Dianetics community. It was structured as an open, public practice in which others were free to pursue their own lines of research and claim that their approaches to auditing produced better results than Hubbard's.&lt;ref&gt;Stark, Rodney; Bainbridge, William Sims. ''The future of religion: secularization, revival, and cult formation'', pp. 268–269. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1986. ISBN 978-0-520-05731-9&lt;/ref&gt; The community rapidly splintered and its members mingled Hubbard's ideas with a wide variety of [[Esotericism|esoteric]] and even occult practices.&lt;ref name=&quot;Marshall-186&quot;&gt;Marshall, Gordon. ''In praise of sociology'', p. 186. London: Routledge, 1990. ISBN 978-0-04-445688-9&lt;/ref&gt; By late 1950, the Elizabeth, N.J. Foundation was in financial crisis and the Los Angeles Foundation was more than $200,000 in debt.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller-173&quot;&gt;Miller, p. 173&lt;/ref&gt; Winter and Art Ceppos, the publisher of Hubbard's book, resigned in acrimonious circumstances.&lt;ref name=&quot;Atack-115&quot; /&gt; Campbell also resigned, criticizing Hubbard for being impossible to work with, and blamed him for the disorganization and financial ruin of the Foundations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller-181&quot;/&gt; By the summer of 1951, the Elizabeth, N.J. Foundation and all of its branches had closed.&lt;ref name=&quot;OBrien-27&quot; /&gt;

The collapse of Hubbard's marriage to Sara created yet more problems. He had begun an affair with his 20-year-old public relations assistant in late 1950, while Sara started a relationship with Dianetics auditor Miles Hollister.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller-199&quot;&gt;Miller, p. 170&lt;/ref&gt; Hubbard secretly denounced the couple to the [[FBI]] in March 1951, portraying them in a letter as [[communism|communist]] infiltrators. According to Hubbard, Sara was &quot;currently intimate with [communists] but evidently under coercion. Drug addiction set in fall 1950. Nothing of this known to me until a few weeks ago.&quot; Hollister was described as having a &quot;sharp chin, broad forehead, rather Slavic&quot;. He was said to be the &quot;center of most turbulence in our organization&quot; and &quot;active and dangerous&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller-180&quot;&gt;Miller, p. 180&lt;/ref&gt; The FBI did not take Hubbard seriously: an agent annotated his correspondence with the comment, &quot;Appears mental&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Methvin&quot; /&gt;

Three weeks later, Hubbard and two Foundation staff seized Sara and his year-old daughter Alexis and forcibly took them to [[San Bernardino, California]], where he attempted unsuccessfully to find a doctor to examine Sara and declare her insane.&lt;ref name=&quot;Atack-117&quot;&gt;Atack, p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; He let Sara go but took Alexis to [[Havana]], [[Cuba]]. Sara filed a divorce suit on April 23, 1951, that accused him of marrying her bigamously and subjecting her to sleep deprivation, beatings, strangulation, kidnapping and exhortations to commit suicide.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Walter Ralston; Zacharias, Ravi K. (ed.). ''The Kingdom of the Cults'', p. 338. Minneapolis: Bethany House, 2003. ISBN 978-0-7642-2821-6&lt;/ref&gt; The case led to newspaper headlines such as &quot;Ron Hubbard Insane, Says His Wife.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Staff (April 24, 1951). &quot;Ron Hubbard Insane, Says His Wife&quot;. ''San Francisco Chronicle''&lt;/ref&gt; Sara finally secured the return of her daughter in June 1951 by agreeing to a settlement with her husband in which she signed a statement, written by him, declaring:

{{quote|The things I have said about L. Ron Hubbard in courts and the public prints have been grossly exaggerated or entirely false. I have not at any time believed otherwise than that L. Ron Hubbard is a fine and brilliant man.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Miller, p. 192&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Dianetics appeared to be on the edge of total collapse. However, it was saved by Don Purcell, a millionaire businessman and Dianeticist who agreed to support a new Foundation in [[Wichita, Kansas]]. Their collaboration ended after less than a year when they fell out over the future direction of Dianetics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Streissguth-71&quot;&gt;Streissguth, p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; The Wichita Foundation became financially unviable after a court ruled that it was liable for the unpaid debts of its defunct predecessor in Elizabeth, N.J. The ruling prompted Purcell and the other directors of the Wichita Foundation to file for voluntary bankruptcy in February 1952.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller-199&quot; /&gt; Hubbard resigned immediately and accused Purcell of having been bribed by the [[American Medical Association]] to destroy Dianetics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Streissguth-71&quot; /&gt; Hubbard established a &quot;Hubbard College&quot; on the other side of town where he continued to promote Dianetics while fighting Purcell in the courts over the Foundation's intellectual property.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller-200&quot;&gt;Miller, p. 200&lt;/ref&gt;

Only six weeks after setting up the Hubbard College and marrying a staff member, 18-year-old Mary Sue Whipp, Hubbard closed it down and moved with his new bride to [[Phoenix, Arizona]]. He established a [[Hubbard Association of Scientologists|Hubbard Association of Scientologists International]] to promote his new &quot;Science of Certainty&quot;—Scientology.&lt;ref name=&quot;Atack-129&quot;&gt;Atack, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt;

The Church of Scientology attributes its genesis to Hubbard's discovery of &quot;a new line of research&quot;, first set out in his book ''Science of Survival''—&quot;that man is most fundamentally a spiritual being&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://mediaresources.lronhubbard.org/chronicle/page04.htm L. Ron Hubbard: A Chronicle, 1950-1959]. Church of Scientology International, 2007, retrieved February 8, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Non-Scientologist writers have suggested alternative motives: that he aimed &quot;to reassert control over his creation&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Marshall-186&quot; /&gt; that he believed &quot;he was about to lose control of Dianetics&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Streissguth-71&quot; /&gt; or that he wanted to ensure &quot;he would be able to stay in business even if the courts eventually awarded control of Dianetics and its valuable copyrights to ... the hated Don Purcell.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller-203&quot;&gt;Miller, p. 203&lt;/ref&gt;

Hubbard expanded upon the basics of Dianetics to construct a spiritually oriented (though at this stage not religious) doctrine based on the concept that the true self of a person was a [[thetan]]—an immortal, omniscient and potentially omnipotent entity.&lt;ref name=dechant&gt;DeChant, Dell; Danny L.

ISBN 0-664-22475-X&lt;/ref&gt; Hubbard taught that the thetans, having created the material universe, had forgotten their god-like powers and become trapped in physical bodies.&lt;ref&gt;Bromley, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; Scientology aimed to &quot;rehabilitate&quot; each person's thetan to restore its original capacities and become once again an &quot;[[Operating Thetan]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller-203&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=dechant /&gt; Hubbard insisted humanity was imperiled by the forces of &quot;aberration&quot;, which were the result of engrams carried by the immortal thetans for billions of years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Streissguth-71&quot; /&gt;

Hubbard introduced a device called an [[E-meter]] that he presented as having, as Miller puts it, &quot;an almost mystical power to reveal an individual's innermost thoughts.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller-204&quot;&gt;Miller, p. 204&lt;/ref&gt; He promulgated Scientology through a series of lectures, bulletins and books such as ''[[Scientology: A History of Man|A History of Man]]'' (&quot;a cold-blooded and factual account of your last sixty trillion years&quot;)&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller-204&quot; /&gt; and ''Scientology: 8-8008'' (&quot;With this book, the ability to make one's body old or young at will, the ability to heal the ill without physical contact, the ability to cure the insane and the incapacitated, is set forth for the physician, the layman, the mathematician and the physicist.&quot;)&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller-206&quot;&gt;Miller, p. 206&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientology was organized in a very different way to the decentralized Dianetics movement. The Hubbard Association of Scientologists (HAS) was the only official Scientology organization. Training procedures and doctrines were standardized and promoted through HAS publications, and administrators and auditors were not permitted to deviate from Hubbard's approach.&lt;ref name=&quot;Marshall-186&quot; /&gt; Branches or &quot;orgs&quot; were organized as franchises, rather like a [[fast food restaurant]] chain. Each franchise holder was required to pay ten per cent of income to Hubbard's central organization. They were expected to find new recruits, known as &quot;raw meat&quot;, but were restricted to providing only basic services. Costlier higher-level auditing was only provided by Hubbard's central organization.&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, p. 304&lt;/ref&gt;

Although this model would eventually be extremely successful, Scientology was a very small-scale movement at first. Hubbard started off with only a few dozen followers, generally dedicated Dianeticists; a seventy-hour series of lectures in [[Philadelphia]] in December 1952 was attended by just 38 people.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller-210&quot;&gt;Miller, p. 210&lt;/ref&gt; Hubbard was joined in Phoenix by his 18-year-old son Nibs, who had been unable to settle down in high school.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, p. 207&lt;/ref&gt; Nibs had decided to become a Scientologist, moved into his father's home and went on to become a Scientology staff member and &quot;professor&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, p. 232&lt;/ref&gt; Hubbard also traveled to the [[United Kingdom]] to establish his control over a Dianetics group in [[London]]. It was very much a shoestring operation; as Helen O'Brien later recalled, &quot;there was an atmosphere of extreme poverty and undertones of a grim conspiracy over all. At 163 [[Holland Park Avenue]] was an ill-lit lecture room and a bare-boarded and poky office some eight by ten feet—mainly infested by long haired men and short haired and tatty women.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;O'Brien, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; On September 24, 1952, only a few weeks after arriving in London, Hubbard's wife Mary Sue gave birth to her first child, a daughter whom they named Diana Meredith de Wolfe Hubbard.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller-208&quot;&gt;Miller, p. 208&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1953, Hubbard acquired a doctorate from [[Sequoia University]]. According to a Scientology biography, this was &quot;given in recognition of his outstanding work on Dianetics&quot; and &quot;as an inspiration to the many people ... who had been inspired by him to take up advanced studies in this field...&quot;&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;FIL67&quot; /&gt; The British government concluded in the 1970s that Sequoia University was a &quot;[[degree mill]]&quot; operated by Joseph Hough, a Los Angeles chiropractor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith&quot; /&gt; Miller cites a telegram sent by Hubbard on February 27, 1953, in which he instructed Scientologist Richard de Mille to procure him a Ph.D from Hough urgently—&quot;FOR GOSH SAKES EXPEDITE. WORK HERE UTTERLY DEPENDANT ON IT.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller-212&quot;&gt;Miller, p. 212&lt;/ref&gt; Hough's &quot;university&quot; was closed down by the Californian authorities in 1971. British government officials noted in a report written in 1977: &quot;It has not and never had any authority whatsoever to issue diplomas or degrees and the dean is sought by the authorities 'for questioning'.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith&quot;&gt;Smith, Graham (August 7, 2009). &quot;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1204715/Scientology-founder-L-Ron-Hubbard-exposed-fraud-British-diplomats-30-years-ago.html Scientology founder L Ron Hubbard exposed as a 'fraud' by British diplomats 30 years ago]&quot;. ''Daily Mail'', retrieved February 8, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

A few weeks after becoming &quot;Dr.&quot; Hubbard, he wrote to Helen O'Brien—who had taken over the day-to-day management of Scientology in the United States—proposing that Scientology should be transformed into a religion.&lt;ref&gt;Streeter, p. 215; Miller, p. 213&lt;/ref&gt; As membership declined and finances grew tighter, Hubbard had reversed the hostility to religion he voiced in ''Dianetics''.&lt;ref name=creation&gt;Kent, Stephen A. &quot;The Creation of 'Religious' Scientology&quot;.

Ron Hubbard state that the way to make money was to start a religion?] Church of Scientology International, 2003, retrieved February 8, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Hubbard outlined plans for setting up a chain of &quot;Spiritual Guidance Centers&quot; charging customers $500 for twenty-four hours of auditing (&quot;That is real money... Charge enough and we'd be swamped.&quot;). He wrote:

{{quote|I await your reaction on the religion angle. In my opinion, we couldn't get worse public opinion than we have had or have less customers with what we've got to sell.

Quoted in Miller, p. 213&lt;/ref&gt;}}

O'Brien was not enthusiastic and resigned the following September, worn out by work.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller-214&quot;&gt;Miller, p. 214&lt;/ref&gt; She criticized Hubbard for creating &quot;a temperate zone voodoo, in its inelasticity, unexplainable procedures, and mindless group euphoria.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;OBrien-vii&quot;&gt;O'Brien, p. vii&lt;/ref&gt; He nonetheless pressed ahead and on December 18, 1953, he incorporated the Church of Scientology, Church of American Science and Church of Spiritual Engineering in [[Camden, New Jersey]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Williams&quot;&gt;Williams, Ian.

''Scientology und (k)ein Ende'', p. 75. Solothurn: Walter, 1995. ISBN 9783530899801&lt;/ref&gt; Hubbard later denied founding the Church of Scientology and to this day, Scientologists maintain that the &quot;founding church&quot; was actually the [[Church of Scientology of California]], established on February 18, 1954, by Scientologist Burton Farber.&lt;ref name=&quot;Atack-137&quot;&gt;Atack, p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for Scientology's religious transformation was explained by officials of the HAS:

{{quote|[T]here is little doubt but what [''sic''] this stroke will remove Scientology from the target area of overt and covert attacks by the medical profession, who see their pills, scalpels, and appendix-studded incomes threatened ...

''The Aberree'', volume 1, issue 1, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Scientology franchises became Churches of Scientology and some auditors began dressing as clergymen, complete with [[clerical collar]]s. If they were arrested in the course of their activities, Hubbard advised, they should sue for massive damages for molesting &quot;a Man of God going about his business.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Williams&quot; /&gt; A few years later he told Scientologists: &quot;If attacked on some vulnerable point by anyone or anything or any organization, always find or manufacture enough threat against them to cause them to sue for peace ... Don't ever defend, always attack.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller-239&quot;&gt;Miller, p. 239&lt;/ref&gt; Any individual breaking away from Scientology and setting up his own group was to be shut down:

{{quote|The purpose of the suit is to harass and discourage rather than to win. The law can be used very easily to harass, and enough harassment on somebody who is simply on the thin edge anyway, well knowing that he is not authorized, will generally be sufficient to cause his professional decease. If possible, of course, ruin him utterly.&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, L. Ron. &quot;The Scientologist: A Manual on the Dissemination of Material&quot;, 1955. Quoted in Atack, p. 139&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The 1950s saw Scientology growing steadily. Hubbard finally achieved victory over Don Purcell in 1954 when the latter, worn out by constant litigation, handed the copyrights of Dianetics back to Hubbard.&lt;ref name=&quot;Atack-138&quot;&gt;Atack, p. 138&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the formerly independent Scientology and Dianetics groups were either driven out of business or were absorbed into Hubbard's organizations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Atack-139&quot;&gt;Atack, p. 139&lt;/ref&gt; Hubbard marketed Scientology through [[Medical claims in Scientology doctrine|medical claims]], such as attracting [[polio]] sufferers by presenting the Church of Scientology as a scientific research foundation investigating polio cases.&lt;ref name=&quot;Streissguth-74&quot;&gt;Streissguth, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; One advertisement during this period stated:

Scientology became a highly profitable enterprise for Hubbard.&lt;ref name=&quot;Atack-142&quot;&gt;Atack, p. 142&lt;/ref&gt; He implemented a scheme under which he was paid a percentage of the Church of Scientology's gross income and by 1957 he was being paid about $250,000 annually—equivalent to $1.9&amp;nbsp;million at 2010 prices.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller-227&quot;&gt;Miller, p. 227&lt;/ref&gt; His family grew, too, with Mary Sue giving birth to three more children—[[Quentin Hubbard|Geoffrey Quentin McCaully]] on January 6, 1954;&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller-214&quot; /&gt; Mary Suzette Rochelle on February 13, 1955;&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller-221&quot;&gt;Miller, p. 221&lt;/ref&gt; and Arthur Ronald Conway on June 6, 1958.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller-230&quot;&gt;Miller, p. 230&lt;/ref&gt; In the spring of 1959, he used his newfound wealth to purchase [[Saint Hill Manor]], an 18th century [[country house]] in [[Sussex]] formerly owned by [[Sawai Man Singh II]], the [[Maharaja of Jaipur]]. The house became Hubbard's permanent residence and an international training center for Scientologists.&lt;ref name=&quot;Streissguth-74&quot; /&gt;

==Controversies and crisis==
By the start of the 1960s, Hubbard was the leader of a worldwide movement with thousands of followers. A decade later, however, he had left Saint Hill Manor and moved aboard his own private fleet of ships as the Church of Scientology faced worldwide controversy.

The Church of Scientology says that the problems of this period were due to &quot;vicious, covert international attacks&quot; by the United States government, &quot;all of which were proven false and baseless, which were to last 27 years and finally culminated in the Government being sued for 750&amp;nbsp;million dollars for conspiracy.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;FIL67&quot; /&gt; Behind the attacks, claimed Hubbard, lay a vast conspiracy of &quot;psychiatric front groups&quot; secretly controlling governments: &quot;Every single lie, false charge and attack on Scientology has been traced directly to this group's members. They have sought at great expense for nineteen years to crush and eradicate any new development in the field of the mind. They are actively preventing any effectiveness in this field.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, L. Ron. &quot;[http://freedom.lronhubbard.org/page020.htm Constitutional Destruction]&quot;. June 9, 1969, retrieved February 8, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hubbard believed that Scientology was being infiltrated by saboteurs and spies and introduced &quot;[[List of Scientology Security Checks|security checking]]&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller-239&quot; /&gt; to identify those he termed &quot;potential trouble sources&quot; and &quot;[[suppressive person]]s&quot;. Members of the Church of Scientology were interrogated with the aid of E-meters and were asked questions such as &quot;Have you ever practiced homosexuality?&quot; and &quot;Have you ever had unkind thoughts about L. Ron Hubbard?&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Atack-150&quot;&gt;Atack, p. 150&lt;/ref&gt; For a time, Scientologists were even interrogated about crimes committed in past lives: &quot;Have you ever destroyed a culture?&quot; &quot;Did you come to Earth for evil purposes?&quot; &quot;Have you ever zapped anyone?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, L. Ron. &quot;Sec Check Whole Track&quot;, HCO Bulletin of June 19, 1961; quoted in Atack, p. 152&lt;/ref&gt;

He also sought to exert political influence, advising Scientologists to vote against [[Richard Nixon]] in the [[1960 United States presidential election|1960 presidential election]] and establishing a Department of Government Affairs &quot;to bring government and hostile philosophies or societies into a state of complete compliance with the goals of Scientology.&quot; This, he said, &quot;is done by high-level ability to control and in its absence by a low-level ability to overwhelm. Introvert such agencies. Control such agencies.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, L. Ron. &quot;Department of Government Affairs&quot;, HCO Policy Letter of August 15, 1960; quoted in Miller, p. 241&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. Government was already well aware of Hubbard's activities. The FBI had a lengthy file on him, including a 1951 interview with an agent who considered him a &quot;mental case&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller-181&quot;&gt;Miller, p. 181&lt;/ref&gt; Police forces in a number of jurisdictions began exchanging information about Scientology through the auspices of [[Interpol]], which eventually led to prosecutions.&lt;ref&gt;Fooner, Michael. ''Interpol: issues in world crime and international criminal justice'', p. 13. New York: Plenum Press, 1989. ISBN 978-0-306-43135-7&lt;/ref&gt; In 1958, the U.S. [[Internal Revenue Service]] withdrew the Washington, D.C. Church of Scientology's [[tax exemption]] after it found that Hubbard and his family were profiting unreasonably from Scientology's ostensibly non-profit income.&lt;ref name=&quot;Atack-142&quot; /&gt; The [[Food and Drug Administration]] took action against Scientology's medical claims, seizing thousands of pills being marketed as &quot;radiation cures&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller-228&quot;&gt;Miller, p. 228&lt;/ref&gt; as well as publications and E-meters. The Church of Scientology was required to label them as being &quot;ineffective in the diagnosis or treatment of disease.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Atack-154&quot;&gt;Atack, p. 154&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the FDA's actions, Scientology attracted increasingly unfavorable publicity across the English-speaking world.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wallis-192&quot;&gt;Wallis, p. 192&lt;/ref&gt; It faced particularly hostile scrutiny in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria, Australia]], where it was accused of [[brainwashing]], blackmail, extortion and damaging the mental health of its members.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wallis-215&quot;&gt;Wallis, p. 215&lt;/ref&gt; The Victorian state government established a Board of Inquiry into Scientology in November 1963.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller-250&quot;&gt;Miller, p. 250&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anderson Report|Its report]], published in October 1965, condemned every aspect of Scientology and Hubbard himself. He was described as being of doubtful sanity, having a persecution complex and displaying strong indications of [[paranoid schizophrenia]] with delusions of grandeur. His writings were characterized as nonsensical, abounding in &quot;self-glorification and grandiosity, replete with histrionics and hysterical, incontinent outbursts&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, pp. 252–53&lt;/ref&gt; Sociologist [[Roy Wallis]] comments that the report drastically changed public perceptions of Scientology:

{{quote|The former conception of the movement as a relatively harmless, if cranky, health and self-improvement cult, was transformed into one which portrayed it as evil, dangerous, a form of hypnosis (with all the overtones of [[Svengali]] in the layman's mind), and brainwashing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wallis-215&quot; /&gt;}}

The report led to Scientology being banned in Victoria,&lt;ref name=&quot;Wallis-193&quot;&gt;Wallis, p. 193&lt;/ref&gt; [[Western Australia]] and [[South Australia]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Wallis-196&quot;&gt;Wallis, p. 196&lt;/ref&gt; and led to more negative publicity around the world. Newspapers and politicians in the UK pressed the British government for action against Scientology. In July 1968, the British [[Secretary of State for Health|Minister of Health]], [[Kenneth Robinson]], announced that foreign Scientologists would no longer be permitted to enter the UK and Hubbard himself was excluded from the country as an &quot;undesirable alien.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Atack-183&quot;&gt;Atack, p. 183&lt;/ref&gt; Further inquiries were launched in [[Canada]], [[New Zealand]] and [[South Africa]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Wallis-196&quot; /&gt;

Hubbard took three major new initiatives in the face of these challenges. &quot;Ethics Technology&quot; was introduced to tighten internal discipline within Scientology. It required Scientologists to &quot;[[Disconnection|disconnect]]&quot; from any organization or individual—including family members—deemed to be disruptive or &quot;suppressive&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Atack-155&quot;&gt;Atack, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; Scientologists were also required to write &quot;Knowledge Reports&quot; on each other, reporting transgressions or misapplications of Scientology methods. Hubbard promulgated a long list of punishable &quot;Misdemeanors,&quot; &quot;Crimes&quot; and &quot;High Crimes&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Atack-156&quot;&gt;Atack, p. 156&lt;/ref&gt; The &quot;[[Fair Game (Scientology)|Fair Game]]&quot; policy was introduced, which was applicable to anyone deemed an &quot;enemy&quot; of Scientology: &quot;May be deprived of property or injured by any means by any Scientologist without any discipline of the Scientologist. May be tricked, sued or lied to or destroyed.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, L. Ron. &quot;Penalties for Lower Conditions&quot;. HCO Policy Letter of October 18, 1967, Issue IV. Quoted in Atack, pp. 175–176&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wallis, pp. 144–145&lt;/ref&gt;

At the start of March 1966, Hubbard created the [[Guardian's Office]] (GO), a new agency within the Church of Scientology that was headed by his wife Mary Sue.&lt;ref name=&quot;Atack-161&quot;&gt;Atack, p. 161&lt;/ref&gt; It dealt with Scientology's external affairs, including public relations, legal actions and the gathering of intelligence on perceived threats.&lt;ref name=&quot;Atack-165&quot;&gt;Atack, p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; As Scientology faced increasingly negative media attention, the GO retaliated with hundreds of writs for libel and slander; it issued more than forty on a single day.&lt;ref name=&quot;Atack-189&quot;&gt;Atack, p. 189&lt;/ref&gt; Hubbard ordered his staff to find &quot;lurid, blood sex crime actual evidence [''sic''] on [Scientology's] attackers.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Atack-160&quot;&gt;Atack, p. 160&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, at the end of 1966, Hubbard acquired his own fleet of ships.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wright&quot; /&gt; He established the &quot;Hubbard Explorational Company Ltd&quot; which purchased three ships—the ''Enchanter'', a forty-ton schooner,&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller-264&quot;&gt;Miller, p. 264&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Avon River'', an old trawler,&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller-265&quot;&gt;Miller, p. 265&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''Royal Scotman'' [''sic''], a former [[Irish Sea]] cattle ferry that he made his home and flagship.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller-269&quot;&gt;Miller, p. 269&lt;/ref&gt; The ships were crewed by the Sea Organization or &quot;[[Sea Org]],&quot; a group of Scientologist volunteers, with the support of a couple of professional seamen.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wright&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller-272&quot;&gt;Miller, p. 272&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commodore of the Sea Org==
{{Main|Sea Org}}
[[File:CityofCorfu.jpg|right|thumb|alt=View of a coastal town with a bay visible behind foreground buildings|Corfu town, where the Sea Org moored in 1968–69]]
After Hubbard created the Sea Org &quot;fleet&quot;, in early 1967 it began an eight-year voyage, sailing from port to port in the Mediterranean Sea and eastern [[North Atlantic]]. The fleet traveled as far as [[Corfu]] in the eastern Mediterranean and [[Dakar]] and the [[Azores]] in the Atlantic, but rarely stayed anywhere for longer than six weeks. Ken Urquhart, Hubbard's personal assistant at the time, later recalled:

{{quote|[Hubbard] said we had to keep moving because there were so many people after him. If they caught up with him they would cause him so much trouble that he would be unable to continue his work, Scientology would not get into the world and there would be social and economic chaos, if not a nuclear holocaust.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller-297&quot;&gt;Quoted in Miller, p. 297&lt;/ref&gt;}}

When Hubbard established the Sea Org he publicly declared that he had relinquished his management responsibilities. According to Miller, this was not true. He received daily telex messages from Scientology organizations around the world reporting their statistics and income. The Church of Scientology sent him $15,000 a week and millions of dollars were transferred to his bank accounts in [[Switzerland]] and [[Liechtenstein]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller-299&quot;&gt;Miller, p. 299&lt;/ref&gt; Couriers arrived regularly, conveying luxury food for Hubbard and his family&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller-300&quot;&gt;Miller, p. 300&lt;/ref&gt; or cash that had been smuggled from England to avoid currency export restrictions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller-290&quot;&gt;Miller, p. 290&lt;/ref&gt;

Along the way, Hubbard sought to establish a safe haven in &quot;a friendly little country where Scientology would be allowed to prosper,&quot; as Miller puts it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller-310&quot;&gt;Miller, p. 310&lt;/ref&gt; The fleet stayed at Corfu for several months in 1968–69. Hubbard renamed the ships after Greek gods—the ''Royal Scotman'' was rechristened ''Apollo''—and he praised the [[Greek military junta of 1967–1974|recently established military dictatorship]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller-290&quot;/&gt; The Sea Org was represented as &quot;Professor Hubbard's Philosophy School&quot; in a telegram to the Greek government.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller-295&quot;&gt;Miller, p. 295&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1969, however, Hubbard and his ships were ordered to leave.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller-2965&quot;&gt;Miller, p. 296&lt;/ref&gt; In mid-1972, Hubbard tried again in [[Morocco]], establishing contacts with the country's secret police and training senior policemen and intelligence agents in techniques for detecting subversives.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller-311&quot;&gt;Miller, p. 311&lt;/ref&gt; The program ended in failure when it became caught up in internal Moroccan politics, and Hubbard left the country hastily in December 1972.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller-312&quot;&gt;Miller, p. 312&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, Hubbard was still developing Scientology's doctrines. A Scientology biography states that &quot;free of organizational duties and aided by the first Sea Org members, L. Ron Hubbard now had the time and facilities to confirm in the physical universe some of the events and places he had encountered in his journeys down the track of time.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mission&quot; /&gt; In 1965, he designated several existing Scientology courses as confidential, repackaging them as the first of the esoteric &quot;[[Operating Thetan|OT levels]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Atack-159&quot;&gt;Atack, p. 159&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later he announced the release of OT3, the &quot;Wall of Fire&quot;, revealing the secrets of an immense disaster that had occurred &quot;on this planet, and on the other seventy-five planets which form this Confederacy, seventy-five million years ago.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, L. Ron. &quot;Ron's Journal '67&quot;, quoted in Atack, p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt; Scientologists were required to undertake the first two OT levels before learning how [[Xenu]], the leader of the Galactic Confederacy, had shipped billions of people to Earth and blown them up with hydrogen bombs, following which their traumatized spirits were stuck together at &quot;implant stations&quot;, brainwashed with false memories and eventually became contained within human beings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Atack-32&quot;&gt;Atack, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; The discovery of OT3 was said to have taken a major physical toll on Hubbard, who announced that he had broken a knee, an arm, and his back during the course of his research.&lt;ref name=&quot;Atack-173&quot;&gt;Atack, p. 173&lt;/ref&gt; A year later, in 1968, he unveiled OT levels 4 to 6 and began delivering OT training courses to Scientologists aboard the ''Royal Scotman''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Atack-177&quot;&gt;Atack, p. 177&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientologists around the world were presented with a glamorous picture of life in the Sea Org and many applied to join Hubbard aboard the fleet.&lt;ref name=&quot;Atack-177&quot; /&gt; What they found was rather different from the image. Most of those joining had no nautical experience at all.&lt;ref name=&quot;Atack-177&quot; /&gt; Mechanical difficulties and blunders by the crews led to a series of embarrassing incidents and near-disasters. Following one incident in which the rudder of the ''Royal Scotman'' was damaged during a storm, Hubbard ordered the ship's entire crew to be reduced to a &quot;condition of liability&quot; and wear gray rags tied to their arms.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller-285&quot;&gt;Miller, p. 285&lt;/ref&gt; The ship itself was treated the same way, with dirty tarpaulins tied around its funnel to symbolize its lower status. According to those aboard, conditions were appalling; the crew was worked to the point of exhaustion, given meagre rations and forbidden to wash or change their clothes for several weeks.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller-286&quot;&gt;Miller, p. 286&lt;/ref&gt; Hubbard maintained a harsh disciplinary regime aboard the fleet, punishing mistakes by confining people in the ''Royal Scotman's'' bilge tanks without toilet facilities and with food provided in buckets.&lt;ref name=&quot;Atack-180&quot;&gt;Atack, p. 180&lt;/ref&gt; At other times erring crew members were thrown overboard with Hubbard looking on and, occasionally, filming.&lt;ref name=&quot;Atack-186&quot;&gt;Atack, p. 186&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Mayo]], a Sea Org member at the time, later recalled:

{{quote|We tried not to think too hard about his behavior. It was not rational much of the time, but to even consider such a thing was a discreditable thought and you couldn't allow yourself to have a discreditable thought. One of the questions in a sec[curity] check was, &quot;Have you ever had any unkind thoughts about LRH?&quot; and you could get into very serious trouble if you had. So you tried hard not to.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, p. 289&lt;/ref&gt;}}

From about 1970, Hubbard was attended aboard ship by the children of Sea Org members, organized as the Commodore's Messenger Organization (CMO). They were mainly young girls dressed in hot pants and halter tops, who were responsible for running errands for Hubbard such as lighting his cigarettes, dressing him or relaying his verbal commands to other members of the crew.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, p. 301&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;sw-life&quot;&gt;Sappell, Joel; Welkos, Robert (June 24, 1990). &quot;[http://articles.latimes.com/1990-06-24/news/mn-1015_1_life-with-l-ron-hubbard The Mind Behind the Religion : Life With L.

During the 1970s, Hubbard faced an increasing number of legal threats. French prosecutors charged him and the French Church of Scientology with fraud and customs violations in 1972. He was advised that he was at risk of being extradited to France.&lt;ref name=&quot;Corydon-94&quot;&gt;Corydon, Bent. ''L. Ron Hubbard: Messiah or Madman?'', p. 94.

Hubbard's health deteriorated significantly during this period. A chain-smoker, he also suffered from [[bursitis]] and excessive weight, and had a prominent growth on his forehead.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller-316&quot;&gt;Miller, p. 316&lt;/ref&gt; He suffered serious injuries in a motorcycle accident in 1973 and had a heart attack in 1975 that required him to take anticoagulant drugs for the next year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Atack-255&quot;&gt;Atack, p. 255&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1978, Hubbard had a [[pulmonary embolism]], falling into a coma, but recovered.&lt;ref name=&quot;Atack-256&quot;&gt;Atack, p. 256&lt;/ref&gt;

He remained active in managing and developing Scientology, establishing the controversial [[Rehabilitation Project Force]] in 1974&lt;ref name=&quot;Atack-206&quot;&gt;Atack, p. 206&lt;/ref&gt; and issuing policy and doctrinal bulletins.&lt;ref name=&quot;Atack-204&quot;&gt;Atack, p. 204&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Sea Org's voyages were coming to an end. The ''Apollo'' was banned from several Spanish ports&lt;ref name=&quot;Atack-204&quot; /&gt; and was expelled from [[Curaçao]] in October 1975.&lt;ref name=&quot;Atack-206&quot;&gt;Atack, p. 209&lt;/ref&gt; The Sea Org came to be suspected of being a [[CIA]] operation, leading to a riot in [[Funchal]], [[Madeira]], when the ''Apollo'' docked there. Hubbard decided to relocate back to the United States to establish a &quot;land base&quot; for the Sea Org in [[Florida]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller-334&quot;&gt;Miller, p. 334&lt;/ref&gt; The Church of Scientology attributes this decision to the activities on the ''Apollo'' having &quot;outgrow[n] the ship's capacity.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Chronicle1970-1979&quot; /&gt;

In October 1975, Hubbard moved into a hotel suite in [[Daytona Beach, Florida|Daytona Beach]]. The [[Fort Harrison Hotel]] in [[Clearwater, Florida]], was secretly acquired as the location for the &quot;land base&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller-334&quot; /&gt; On December 5, 1975, Hubbard and his wife Mary Sue moved into a condominium complex in nearby [[Dunedin, Florida|Dunedin]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller-336&quot;&gt;Miller, p. 336&lt;/ref&gt; Their presence was meant to be a closely guarded secret but was accidentally compromised the following month.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller-338&quot;&gt;Miller, p. 338&lt;/ref&gt; Hubbard immediately left Dunedin and moved to Georgetown, Washington D.C., accompanied by a handful of aides and messengers, but not his wife.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller-340&quot;&gt;Miller, p. 340&lt;/ref&gt; Six months later, following another security alert in July 1976, Hubbard moved to another safe house in [[Culver City, California]].

Throughout this period, Hubbard was heavily involved in directing the activities of the Guardian's Office (GO), the legal bureau/intelligence agency that he had established in 1966. He believed that Scientology was being attacked by an international Nazi conspiracy, which he termed the &quot;Tenyaka Memorial&quot;, through a network of drug companies, banks and psychiatrists in a bid to take over the world.&lt;ref&gt;Beresford, David (February 7, 1980). &quot;Snow White's dirty tricks&quot;. London: ''The Guardian''&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973, he instigated the &quot;Snow White Program&quot; and directed the GO to remove negative reports about Scientology from government files and track down their sources.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, pp. 317–318&lt;/ref&gt; The GO was ordered to &quot;get all false and secret files on Scientology, LRH ... that cannot be obtained legally, by all possible lines of approach ... i.e., job penetration, janitor penetration, suitable guises utilizing covers.&quot; His involvement in the GO's operations was concealed through the use of codenames. The GO carried out covert campaigns on his behalf such as [[List of Guardian's Office operations#Operation Bulldozer Leak|Operation Bulldozer Leak]], intended &quot;to effectively spread the rumor that will lead Government, media, and individual [Suppressive Persons] to conclude that LRH has no control of the C of S and no legal liability for Church activity.&quot; He was kept informed of GO operations, such as the theft of medical records from a hospital, harassment of psychiatrists and infiltrations of organizations that had been critical of Scientology at various times, such as the [[Better Business Bureau]], the [[American Medical Association]], and [[American Psychiatric Association]].&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, John (January 24, 1980). &quot;The Scientology Papers: Hubbard still gave orders, records show&quot;. Toronto: ''Globe and Mail''&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of the GO infiltrated and burglarized numerous government organizations, including the U.S. Department of Justice and the Internal Revenue Service.&lt;ref&gt;Streissguth, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; After two GO agents were caught in the Washington, D.C. headquarters of the IRS, the FBI carried out simultaneous raids on GO offices in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. on July 7, 1977. They retrieved wiretap equipment, burglary tools and some 90,000 pages of incriminating documents. Hubbard was not prosecuted, though he was labeled an &quot;[[unindicted co-conspirator]]&quot; by government prosecutors. His wife Mary Sue was indicted and subsequently convicted of [[conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]]. She was sent to a federal prison along with ten other Scientologists.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reitman&quot;&gt;Reitman, p. 323&lt;/ref&gt;

Hubbard's troubles increased in February 1978 when a French court convicted him in absentia for obtaining money under false pretenses. He was sentenced to four years in prison and a 35,000[[French franc|FF]] ($7,000) fine.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, John (January 26, 1980). &quot;The Scientology Papers: The hidden Hubbard&quot;. Toronto: ''Globe and Mail''&lt;/ref&gt; He went into hiding in April 1979, moving to an apartment in [[Hemet, California]], where his only contact with the outside world was via ten trusted Messengers. He cut contact with everyone else, even his wife, whom he saw for the last time in August 1979.&lt;ref name=&quot;Atack-258&quot;&gt;Atack, p. 258&lt;/ref&gt; Hubbard faced a possible indictment for his role in [[Operation Freakout]], the GO's campaign against New York journalist [[Paulette Cooper]], and in February 1980 he disappeared into deep cover in the company of two trusted Messengers, Pat and Anne Broeker.&lt;ref name=&quot;Atack-259&quot;&gt;Atack, p. 259&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller-364&quot;&gt;Miller, p. 364&lt;/ref&gt;

For the first few years of the 1980s, Hubbard and the Broekers lived on the move, touring the Pacific Northwest in a [[recreational vehicle]] and living for a while in apartments in [[Newport Beach]] and Los Angeles.&lt;ref name=&quot;SW-Deep&quot;&gt;Sappell, Joel; Welkos, Robert W.

In Hubbard's absence, members of the Sea Org staged a takeover of the Church of Scientology and purged many veteran Scientologists. A young Messenger, [[David Miscavige]], became Scientology's ''de facto'' leader. Mary Sue Hubbard was forced to resign her position and her daughter Suzette became Miscavige's personal maid.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller-366&quot;&gt;Miller, p. 366&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and legacy==
[[File:Church of Spiritual Technology ranch Creston.jpg|right|thumb|alt=Aerial photograph of an estate with a racetrack visible in the background|The ranch in San Luis Obispo County, California where Hubbard spent his final years]]
For the last two years of his life, Hubbard lived in a luxury [[Blue Bird Corporation|Blue Bird]] motorhome on Whispering Winds, a 160-acre ranch near [[Creston, California]]. He remained in deep hiding while controversy raged in the outside world about whether he was still alive and if so, where. According to a spokesperson, he spent his time &quot;writing and researching&quot;, pursuing photography and music, overseeing construction work and checking on his animals.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Mark (January 30, 1986). &quot;Creston provided quiet retreat for controversial church leader&quot;. ''The County Telegram-Tribune'', San Luis Obispo, pp. 1A/5A.&lt;/ref&gt; He repeatedly redesigned the property, spending millions of dollars remodeling the ranch house—which went virtually uninhabited—and building a quarter-mile horse-racing track with an observation tower, which reportedly was never used.&lt;ref name=&quot;SW-Deep&quot; /&gt;

He was still closely involved in managing the Church of Scientology via secretly delivered orders&lt;ref name=&quot;SW-Deep&quot; /&gt; and continued to receive large amounts of money, of which ''Forbes'' magazine estimated &quot;at least $200 million [was] gathered in Hubbard's name through 1982&quot;. In September 1985, the IRS notified the Church that it was considering indicting Hubbard for tax fraud.&lt;ref name=&quot;Behar&quot;&gt;Behar, Richard (October 27, 1986). &quot;The prophet and profits of Scientology&quot;.

Hubbard suffered further ill-health, including chronic [[pancreatitis]], during his residence at Whispering Winds. He suffered a  [[stroke]] on January 17, 1986, and died a week later.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reitman&quot; /&gt; The body was cremated following an autopsy and the ashes were scattered at sea.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller-375&quot;&gt;Miller, p. 375&lt;/ref&gt; Scientology leaders announced that his body had become an impediment to his work and that he had decided to &quot;drop his body&quot; to continue his research on another planet,&lt;ref&gt;Petrowsky, Marc.

Hubbard was survived by his wife Mary Sue and all of his children except his second son Quentin. His will provided a trust fund to support Mary Sue; her children Arthur, Diana and Suzette; and Katherine, the daughter of his first wife Polly.&lt;ref&gt;[Staff] (February 7, 1986). &quot;Hubbard Left Most of Estate to Scientology Church; Executor Appointed&quot;.

Kliever]] notes that Hubbard was &quot;the only source of the religion, and he has no successor&quot;.

The Danish historian of religions [[Mikael Rothstein]] describes Scientology as &quot;a movement focused on the figure of Hubbard.&quot; He comments: &quot;The fact that [Hubbard's] life is mythologized is as obvious as in the cases of [[Jesus]], [[Muhammad]] or [[Gautama Buddha|Siddartha Gotama]]. This is how religion works. Scientology, however, rejects this analysis altogether, and goes to great lengths to defend every detail of Hubbard's amazing and fantastic life as plain historical fact.&quot; Hubbard is presented as &quot;the master of a multitude of disciplines&quot; who performed extraordinary feats as a photographer, composer, scientist, therapist, explorer, navigator, philosopher, poet, artist, humanitarian, adventurer, soldier, scout, musician and many other fields of endeavor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rothstein-21&quot; /&gt; The Church of Scientology portrays Hubbard's life and work as having proceeded seamlessly, &quot;as if they were a continuous set of predetermined events and discoveries that unfolded through his lifelong research&quot; even up to and beyond his death.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bromley&quot; /&gt;

According to Rothstein's assessment of Hubbard's legacy, Scientology consciously aims to transfer the [[charismatic authority]] of Hubbard to institutionalize his authority over the organization, even after his death. Hubbard is presented as a virtually superhuman religious ideal just as Scientology itself is presented as the most important development in human history.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rothstein-20&quot;&gt;Rothstein, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; As Rothstein puts it, &quot;reverence for Scientology's scripture is reverence for Hubbard, the man who in the Scientological perspective single-handedly brought salvation to all human beings.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rothstein-21&quot; /&gt; [[David G. Bromley]] of the [[University of Virginia]] comments that the real Hubbard has been transformed into a &quot;prophetic persona&quot;, &quot;LRH&quot;, which acts as the basis for his prophetic authority within Scientology and transcends his biographical history.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bromley&quot; /&gt;

The Church of Scientology has not yet published a comprehensive official biography of Hubbard.&lt;ref&gt;Gallagher, Eugene V. ''The new religious movements experience in America'', p. 216. Greenwood Publishing Group, 2004. ISBN 978-0-313-32807-7&lt;/ref&gt; During his lifetime, a number of brief biographical sketches were published in his Scientology books. The Church of Scientology issued &quot;the only authorized LRH Biography&quot; in October 1977.&lt;ref name=&quot;FIL67&quot;&gt;Flag Information Letter 67, &quot;L.R.H. Biography&quot;. Sea Organization, October 31, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; His life was illustrated in print in ''What Is Scientology?'', a glossy publication published in 1978 with paintings of Hubbard's life contributed by his son Arthur.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller-350&quot;&gt;Miller, p. 350&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Hubbard's death, [[Bridge Publications (Scientology)|Bridge Publications]] has published several stand-alone biographical accounts of his life, notably ''The Ron Series'', dedicated to various aspects of Hubbard's life and work. Marco Frenschkowski notes that &quot;non-Scientologist readers immediately recognize some parts of Hubbard's life are here systematically left out: no information whatsoever is given about his private life (his marriages, divorces, children), his legal affairs and so on.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Frenschkowski&quot;&gt;Frenschkowski, Marco. &quot;[http://www.uni-marburg.de/fb03/ivk/mjr/pdfs/1999/articles/frenschkowski1999.pdf L. Ron Hubbard and Scientology: An annotated bibliographical survey of primary and selected secondary literature]&quot;, ''Marburg Journal of Religion'', '''4''':1, July 1999, retrieved February 8, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The Church maintains an extensive website presenting the official version of Hubbard's life.&lt;ref&gt;Available at [http://www.lronhubbard.org www.lronhubbard.org]&lt;/ref&gt; It also owns a number of properties dedicated to Hubbard including the Los Angeles-based L. Ron Hubbard Life Exhibition, a presentation of Hubbard's life, and the Author Services Center, dedicated to Hubbard's writings,&lt;ref&gt;Cowan, Douglas E.; Bromley, David G. ''Cults and new religions: a brief history'', p. 30. Oxford: Blackwell, 2008. ISBN 20089781405161282&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[L. Ron Hubbard House]] in Washington, D.C.

In the late 1970s two men began to assemble a very different picture of Hubbard's life. Michael Linn Shannon, a resident of Portland, Oregon, became interested in Hubbard's life story after an encounter with a Scientology recruiter. Over the next four years he collected previously undisclosed records and documents. He intended to write an exposé of Hubbard and sent a copy of his findings and key records to a number of contacts but was unable to find a publisher.&lt;ref name=&quot;Atack-46&quot;&gt;Atack, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt;

Shannon's findings were acquired by [[Gerry Armstrong (activist)|Gerry Armstrong]], a Scientologist who had been appointed Hubbard's official archivist.&lt;ref name=&quot;Atack-46&quot; /&gt; He had been given the job of assembling documents relating to Hubbard's life for the purpose of helping Omar V. Garrison, a non-Scientologist who had written two books sympathetic to Scientology, to write an official biography. However, the documents that he uncovered convinced both Armstrong and Garrison that Hubbard had systematically misrepresented his life. Garrison refused to write a &quot;puff piece&quot; and declared that he would not &quot;repeat all the falsehoods they [the Church of Scientology] had perpetuated over the years.&quot; He wrote a &quot;warts and all&quot; biography while Armstrong quit Scientology, taking five boxes of papers with him. The Church of Scientology and Mary Sue Hubbard sued for the return of the documents while settling out of court with Garrison, requiring him to turn over the nearly completed manuscript of the biography.&lt;ref&gt;Shelor, George-Wayne. &quot;Writer tells of Hubbard's 'faked past'&quot;. ''Clearwater Sun'', May 10, 1984&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1984 Judge Paul G. Breckenridge ruled in Armstrong's favor, saying:

{{quote|The evidence portrays a man who has been virtually a pathological liar when it comes to his history, background and achievements. The writings and documents in evidence additionally reflect his egoism, greed, avarice, lust for power, and vindictiveness and aggressiveness against persons perceived by him to be disloyal or hostile. At the same time it appears that he is charismatic and highly capable of motivating, organizing, controlling, manipulating and inspiring his adherents. He has been referred to during the trial as a &quot;genius&quot;, a &quot;revered person&quot;, a man who was &quot;viewed by his followers in awe&quot;. Obviously, he is and has been a very complex person and that complexity is further reflected in his alter ego, the Church of Scientology.&lt;ref&gt;Breckenridge Jr., Paul G. (October 24, 1984). ''Memorandum of Intended Decision'', Church of Scientology of California vs. Gerald Armstrong. Quoted by Miller, pp. 370-71&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In November 1987, the British journalist and writer Russell Miller published ''[[Bare-faced Messiah]]'', the first full-length biography of L. Ron Hubbard. He drew on Armstrong's papers, official records and interviews with those who had known Hubbard including ex-Scientologists and family members. The book was well-received by reviewers but the Church of Scientology sought unsuccessfully to prohibit its publication on the grounds of copyright infringement.&lt;ref&gt;Murtagh, Peter (October 10, 1987). &quot;Scientologists fail to suppress book about church's founder.&quot; ''The Guardian''.&lt;/ref&gt; Other critical biographical accounts are found in Bent Corydon's ''[[L. Ron Hubbard, Messiah or Madman?]]'' (1987) and Jon Atack's ''[[A Piece of Blue Sky]]'' (1990).

His works of fiction included some 500 novels and short stories.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallagher&quot; /&gt;
