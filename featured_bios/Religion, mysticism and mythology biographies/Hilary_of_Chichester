'''Hilary''' (''[[circa]]''&amp;nbsp;1110–1169) was a medieval [[Bishop of Chichester]] in England. English by birth, he studied [[canon law]] and worked in Rome as a papal clerk. During his time there, he became acquainted with a number of ecclesiastics, including the future Pope [[Pope Adrian IV|Adrian IV]], and the medieval writer [[John of Salisbury]]. In England, he served as a clerk for [[Henry of Blois]], who was the [[Bishop of Winchester]] and brother of King [[Stephen of England]].  After Hilary's unsuccessful nomination to become [[Archbishop of York]], Pope [[Pope Eugene III|Eugene III]] compensated him by promoting him to the bishopric of Chichester in 1147. 

Hilary spent many years in a struggle with [[Battle Abbey]], attempting to assert his right as bishop to oversee the abbey. He also clashed with [[Thomas Becket]], then chancellor to King [[Henry II of England]], later [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]; Hilary supported King Henry II's position in the conflict with Becket. Henry appointed Hilary a sheriff, and employed him as a judge in the royal courts. The papacy also used Hilary as a [[papal judge-delegate|judge-delegate]], to hear cases referred back to England. Known for supporting his clergy and as a [[canon lawyer]], or someone trained in ecclesiastical law, Hilary worked to have [[Edward the Confessor]], a former English king, [[Canonization|canonized]] as a [[saint]].

==Early life==
Hilary was probably born around 1110, and was likely of low birth, but nothing is known of his ancestry. His brother was a [[Canon (priest)|canon]] of [[Salisbury Cathedral]], and they both may have come from around Salisbury.&lt;ref name=DNB&gt;Mayr-Harting &quot;[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/13254 Hilary (c.1110–1169)]&quot; (fee required) ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''&lt;/ref&gt; Hilary served as a clerk for Henry of Blois, Bishop of Winchester, and as [[Dean (religion)|Dean]] of the church of Christchurch in Twynham, Hampshire,&lt;ref name=BHOChich/&gt; probably receiving both offices through the influence of Henry of Blois.&lt;ref name=Hilary209&gt;Mayr-Harting &quot;Hilary of Chichester and Henry II&quot; ''English Historical Review'' p. 209&lt;/ref&gt; Christchurch was a [[Chapter (religion)|collegiate church]] of [[secular clergy]], or clergy who were not monks,&lt;ref name=Coll24&gt;Knowles ''Episcopal Colleagues'' pp. 24–27&lt;/ref&gt; and Hilary was dean of the church by 1139.&lt;ref name=BHOChich/&gt; He was educated as a canon lawyer, and was an advocate, or lawyer, in Rome in 1144.&lt;ref name=BHOChich&gt;Greenway ''[http://british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=34293  Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066–1300: volume 5: Chichester: Bishops]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cosman2&gt;Cosman ''Medieval Wordbook'' p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; While in Rome, he also served in the [[Apostolic Chancery|papal chancery]], or writing office, in 1146.&lt;ref name=Duggan86&gt;Duggan &quot;From the Conquest to the Death of John&quot; in Lawrence ''The English Church and the Papacy in the Middle Ages'' p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Dict66&gt;Coredon ''Dictionary of Medieval Terms'' p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; Some of his coworkers in the chancery were [[Robert Pullen]], John of Salisbury, and [[Pope Adrian IV|Nicholas Breakspear]] who later became pope, as Adrian IV.&lt;ref name=Poole195&gt;Poole ''Domesday Book to Magna Carta'' p. 195&lt;/ref&gt; 

As Dean of Christchurch, Hilary restored the organization to its traditional round of religious ceremonies that had been abandoned by his predecessors, as well as securing grants of privileges and lands.&lt;ref name=VCH&gt;Doubleday, et al. (ed.) ''[http://british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=38103 A History of the County of Hampshire: Volume 2: Houses of Austin canons: Priory of Christchurch, Twyneham]''&lt;/ref&gt; He ordered the writing of a history of the church at Christchurch, a book which still survives.&lt;ref name=Williams128&gt;Williams ''English and the Norman Conquest'' p. 128&lt;/ref&gt; Hilary was unsuccessful as a candidate for the archbishopric of York against [[Henry Murdac]] in 1147, but Pope Eugene III chose to compensate him by appointing him to the [[Diocese of Chichester|see of Chichester]].&lt;ref name=Church98&gt;Barlow ''The English Church'' pp. 98–99&lt;/ref&gt; His candidacy to York had been supported by [[Hugh de Puiset]], then treasurer of York and later [[Bishop of Durham]], and by [[Robert of Ghent]], who was [[Dean of York]] and [[Lord Chancellor]] of England,&lt;ref name=Theobald100/&gt; as well as by King Stephen of England.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; Hilary seems to have received the largest number of votes, but because the election was disputed by Murdac's supporters the result was referred to the papacy, and Eugene chose Murdac.&lt;ref name=Coll24/&gt; Hilary was appointed to Chichester in July 1147,&lt;ref name=BHOChich/&gt; and he was consecrated on 3 August 1147.&lt;ref name=Handbook238&gt;Fryde, et al. ''Handbook of British Chronology'' p. 238&lt;/ref&gt; [[Theobald of Bec]], the Archbishop of Canterbury, consecrated him at Canterbury, with [[Nigel (Bishop of Ely)|Nigel]], the [[Bishop of Ely]], [[Robert of Bath|Robert]], the [[Bishop of Bath and Wells|Bishop of Bath]], and [[William de Turbeville]], the [[Bishop of Norwich]], assisting in the ceremony. For a number of years, Hilary continued to hold the deanship in [[Benefice|plurality]], which is the holding of two ecclesiastical benefices at once.&lt;ref name=Theobald100&gt;Saltman ''Theobald'' pp. 100–102&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stephen's reign==
King Stephen sent Hilary to attend a [[Council of Reims (1148)|church council]] at [[Reims]] in 1148 along with [[Robert de Bethune]], who was the [[Bishop of Hereford]], and William de Turbeville. Theobald of Bec was also present, even though the king had forbidden him to attend.&lt;ref name=Church112&gt;Barlow ''The English Church'' p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; The medieval chronicler [[Gervase of Canterbury]] stated that Stephen wanted to weaken Theobald's standing with the papacy, but Stephen also would have wished to assert his authority over the English Church by insisting on the right to limit papal contact with the English bishops, something that his predecessors had always done.&lt;ref name=Theobald25&gt;Saltman ''Theobald'' p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; 

Hilary attempted to excuse the king's attempt to exclude Theobald from the council, which appears to be the main reason why Stephen allowed Hilary to attend.&lt;ref name=Hilary209/&gt; Hilary was rewarded for his loyalty by being named a queen's chaplain.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;  Soon after the council, Robert de Bethune died and [[Gilbert Foliot]] was elected to the [[Diocese of Hereford|see of Hereford]], at the direction of the pope. Theobald was in exile in [[Flanders]] because he had defied the king, so the pope ordered [[Robert de Sigello]], the [[Bishop of London]], [[Josceline de Bohon]], the [[Bishop of Salisbury]], and Hilary, to go to Flanders to help Theobald consecrate Gilbert. However, the three bishops were reluctant, and told the pope that because Gilbert had not received the royal assent, nor had he sworn fealty to Stephen, they would not consecrate him. Theobald then consecrated Gilbert with the help of some continental bishops.&lt;ref name=Theobald25a&gt;Saltman ''Theobald'' pp. 25–30&lt;/ref&gt; Hilary was one of the bishops who made peace between Theobald and Stephen after the council at Reims,&lt;ref name=Hilary213&gt;Mayr-Harting &quot;Hilary of Chichester and Henry II&quot; ''English Historical Review'' p. 213&lt;/ref&gt; helping in the negotiations after Theobald's return to England. Theobald settled himself at [[Hugh Bigod, 1st Earl of Norfolk|Hugh Bigod]]'s castle of [[Framlingham]];  negotiations between the royal party and the archbishop's party resulted in the king yielding, and in the restoration of the archbishop to his lands.&lt;ref name=Theobald29&gt;Saltman ''Theobald'' pp. 29–30&lt;/ref&gt;

==Struggle with Battle Abbey==
[[Image:Harold stone.JPG|left|thumb|The ruins of Battle Abbey|alt=Photograph shot low to the ground near an inscribed stone set into the ground, with a background of ruined stone buildings.]]

Hilary struggled with the abbot of Battle Abbey for many years over the exemption claimed by the abbey from the oversight of the Bishop of Chichester, in whose diocese it was located.&lt;ref name=Monastic589&gt;Knowles ''The Monastic Order in England'' p. 589&lt;/ref&gt; The abbey had never received a papal exemption, but relied instead on its royal foundation by King [[William I of England]], and its status as an [[Proprietary church|eigenkirche]], or proprietary church of the king.&lt;ref name=HenryII429&gt;Warren ''Henry II'' pp. 429–432&lt;/ref&gt; Under King Stephen, the abbey's claims prevailed, but after Stephen's death Hilary excommunicated the abbot, who appealed to the papacy.&lt;ref name=Searle453&gt;Searle &quot;Battle Abbey&quot; ''English Historical Review'' pp. 453–454&lt;/ref&gt; The appeal backfired however, as Hilary obtained from both Pope Eugenius III and Pope Hadrian IV orders for the abbot to obey the bishop. In 1157, the then [[Abbot of Battle]], [[Walter de Lucy]], brother of [[Richard de Luci]] the [[Justiciar|Chief Justiciar]], took the case before King Henry II, at a council held at [[Colchester]].&lt;ref name=Monastic589/&gt; 

At the council, Walter de Lucy produced William I's foundation charter and the confirmation by King [[Henry I of England]], Henry II's grandfather. Both documents were admitted as genuine, and as freeing the abbey from ecclesiastical oversight, as Henry II had at his coronation confirmed all his grandfather's charters.&lt;ref name=HenryII429/&gt; Modern scholarship has shown, however, that at least one of the documents had been recently forged, shortly before 1155.&lt;ref name=Becket49&gt;Barlow ''Thomas Becket'' pp. 49–51&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Searle&gt;Searle &quot;Battle Abbey&quot; ''English Historical Review'' pp. 449–480&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|The historian Eleanor Searle argues that the charters were forged in three periods, one from shortly after the death of Stephen in 1154 to 1157, another group in the period 1157 to 1174, and lastly a group forged in the first part of the 13th century. One charter at least probably was forged after Hilary's death, for it bears his name as a witness.&lt;ref name=Searle/&gt;}}  Hilary argued that only a papal privilege could exempt a monastery from episcopal oversight, and that the abbey had no such privilege.&lt;ref name=Monastic589/&gt; Hilary argued that no king could grant such an exemption, unless they had a licence from the papacy.&lt;ref name=Hilary209/&gt; Henry was unimpressed by this argument, for it impinged on his royal prerogative.&lt;ref name=Monastic589/&gt; Thomas Becket, then Henry's chancellor but later to be famous for his dispute with Henry over ecclesiastical privileges, was one of Hilary's chief opponents at this council.&lt;ref name=Powell79&gt;Powell ''The House of Lords'' p. 79 and footnote 45&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, the case was decided by persuading Hilary to renounce any episcopal claims on the abbey.&lt;ref name=HenryII429/&gt; 

Henry II's biographer, the historian W. L. Warren, suggests that Hilary was pressed to bring the case against Battle Abbey by his [[cathedral chapter]], and that Hilary did not pursue the case vigorously.&lt;ref name=HenryII429/&gt; The historian [[Henry Mayr-Harting]], sees the case against the abbey as the lone exception in Hilary's long career of support for the royal position against the papacy, and argues that the only reason Hilary opposed the king in this respect was that it was Hilary's own rights as a diocesan bishop that were being flouted. Mayr-Harting also suggests that Theobald of Bec was supporting Hilary's efforts to assert Chichester's rights.&lt;ref name=Hilary222&gt;Mayr-Harting &quot;Hilary of Chichester&quot; ''English Historical Review'' pp. 222–224&lt;/ref&gt;

The historian Nicholas Vincent argues that the entire basis of this account, which ultimately rests on the ''Chronicle of Battle Abbey'', is part of the forgeries produced by the Battle monks. He argues that the only documentary evidence detailing course of the legal battle besides the Chronicle is a forged charter of Henry II to the abbey and a letter of Theobald's that itself may be forged, as it repeats the story of the Chronicle almost word for word. Vincent's point is that although there was no doubt a dispute between Hilary and the abbey over a claimed exemption, as evidenced by a 1170 letter of Becket's referring to some sort of settlement between the monks and the bishop, the actual account in the ''Chronicle'' is untrustworthy. Unfortunately, the 1170 letter does not give any details of the dispute, merely stating that the bishop was &quot;forced to make public peace with the abbot&quot;.&lt;ref name=Vincent282&gt;Vincent &quot;King Henry II and the Monks of Battle&quot; ''Belief and Culture in the Middle Ages'' pp. 282–283&lt;/ref&gt;

==Henry II's reign==

Hilary held the office of [[High Sheriff of Sussex|Sheriff of Sussex]] in 1155,&lt;ref name=Poole222&gt;Poole ''Domesday Book to Magna Carta'' p. 222 footnote 3&lt;/ref&gt; and then again in 1160 through 1162. It was very unusual for a bishop to hold the post of sheriff, and was a measure of the trust that King Henry II had in Hilary.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; Hilary was the only bishop to hold the office of sheriff during Henry's reign, with the possible exception of [[Robert de Chesney]], the [[Bishop of Lincoln]].&lt;ref name=Hilary213/&gt; An English church council in 1143 had forbidden clergy to hold office as stewards or tax gatherers for non-clergy.&lt;ref name=Langton21&gt;Cheney ''Becket to Langton'' pp. 21–22&lt;/ref&gt; As the office of sheriff involved the gathering of the county farm, or income from the county, and the payment of those revenues into the [[Exchequer]], clergy holding office as sheriffs would have been acting against the decrees of the 1143 council.&lt;ref name=Chrimes55&gt;Chrimes ''Introduction'' p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Dict120&gt;Coredon ''Dictionary of Medieval Terms'' p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; Hilary was well known as a canon lawyer, and was often employed by the papacy as a judge-delegate, hearing cases that had been appealed to Rome, and then sent back to the country of origin for trial.&lt;ref name=HenryII472&gt;Warren ''Henry II'' p. 472&lt;/ref&gt; He also assisted other papal judges, including Theobald of Bec.&lt;ref name=Coll24/&gt; Hilary served in England as  a royal justice in 1156,&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; and then was with the king in Normandy from late 1156 to April 1157.&lt;ref name=Hilary215&gt;Mayr-Harting &quot;Hilary of Chichester and Henry II&quot; ''English Historical Review'' pp. 215–216&lt;/ref&gt; Hilary acted as judge-delegate for the papacy in at least 15 cases during his bishopric.&lt;ref name=Papacy194&gt;Robinson ''Papacy'' p. 194&lt;/ref&gt; He acted as a legal advisor to Henry II on a number of occasions, and Hilary's clerks occasionally drew up documents for the king.&lt;ref name=Hilary216&gt;Mayr-Harting &quot;Hilary of Chichester and Henry II&quot; ''English Historical Review'' pp. 216–218&lt;/ref&gt;

Hilary created the offices of treasurer and chancellor of the diocese of Chichester, in order to regulate and improve the finances of the cathedral chapter and the diocese.&lt;ref name=Bartlett390&gt;Bartlett ''England Under the Norman and Angevin Kings'' p. 390&lt;/ref&gt; He also was involved in the canonization of Edward the Confessor, writing a letter to Pope [[Pope Alexander III|Alexander III]] in favour of Edward's sainthood,&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; and was one of the three bishops who announced the canonization at [[Westminster Abbey]] and celebrated a mass in honour of the new saint. The other bishops were Robert de Chesney and Nigel, Bishop of Ely.&lt;ref name=Hilary215/&gt;

In May 1162, Hilary was part of the deputation sent to the monks of [[Canterbury Cathedral|Christ Church Priory]] by King Henry II to secure the election of Thomas Becket as the next Archbishop of Canterbury.&lt;ref name=Powell78&gt;Powell ''The House of Lords'' p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; When Gilbert Foliot, the Bishop of Hereford, objected to Becket's candidacy, Hilary took the position that the king desired the election, so the bishops and electors should elect the king's choice.&lt;ref name=Hilary213/&gt; When it was suggested that a monk should hold Canterbury, as had been the custom previously, Hilary asked if the questioners thought that only one way of life was satisfactory to God.&lt;ref name=Coll24/&gt; 

The next year, a council held at Westminster became one of the early stages in the king's growing [[Becket controversy|quarrel]] with Becket over criminal clerks.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; The quarrel was sparked by the problem of clergy who committed crimes; Becket supported the Church's position that all clergy, even those in minor orders, could be tried only in ecclesiastical courts. As perhaps as many as a fifth of the population of England may have been in some form of [[Holy Orders|clerical orders]], including the [[Minor orders|minor ones]], allowing this would have diminished the king's authority.&lt;ref name=Huscroft192&gt;Huscroft ''Ruling England'' pp. 192–193&lt;/ref&gt;  In the past, English law had tried clerks who committed serious offences in the royal courts, but recent changes in canon law were changing this practice. At Westminster, Henry tried to get the leading laymen and bishops to swear to uphold the old customs of England, instead of the newer canon law practices.&lt;ref name=Becket94&gt;Barlow ''Thomas Becket'' pp. 94–95&lt;/ref&gt; All the bishops swore, with the reservation that the customs were not in conflict with canon law. Hilary, however, added no qualifiers to his oath.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; Although the oath supported Becket's position, after the council most of the bishops, including Hilary, were persuaded by the king to support some compromise position, and threw their support behind Henry.&lt;ref name=Becket95&gt;Barlow ''Thomas Becket'' pp. 95–96&lt;/ref&gt; 

After the Council of Westminster, Hilary supported the king throughout the Becket dispute, and one factor in his royalist position may have been that Hilary remembered who had opposed his case against Battle Abbey, and thus refused to support the archbishop.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;&lt;ref name=Powell79/&gt; Towards the end of 1163, Henry sent Hilary on an embassy to Becket, to persuade the archbishop to modify his position, but Becket was unmoved.&lt;ref name=HenryII472/&gt; Hilary also took part in the king's embassy in 1164 to Pope Alexander III and King [[Louis VII of France]], which attempted to persuade the pope and the king of France to favour King Henry instead of Becket, and to keep Becket from finding a haven in France during his exile.&lt;ref name=Becket119&gt;Barlow ''Thomas Becket'' p. 119&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and legacy==
Hilary died in July 1169, probably on 13 July.&lt;ref name=Handbook238/&gt; The historian [[David Knowles (scholar)|David Knowles]] described Hilary as &quot;an extremely quick-witted, efficient, self-confident, voluble, somewhat shallow man, fully acquainted with the new canon law but not prepared to abide by principles to the end. His talents were great but he used them as an opportunist.&quot;&lt;ref name=DNBQuote&gt;quoted in Mayr-Harting &quot;[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/13254 Hilary (c.1110–1169)]&quot; (fee required) ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''&lt;/ref&gt; In Hilary's favour, he was heavily involved in providing livings for the [[vicar]]s who resided at the parish churches and performed the actual [[cure of souls]], or pastoral duties, in his diocese. He was also a benefactor of libraries, and worked hard to recover lands once belonging to his church but lost in the years of [[The Anarchy|Stephen's reign]]. He also promoted clerical reform in his diocese, working to change many of the churches that had chapters of secular clergy into churches with chapters of [[Augustinians|Augustinian]] canons.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; Hilary secured the consent of his cathedral chapter for any grants of lands, even those that he had acquired personally.&lt;ref name=Hudson240&gt;Hudson ''Land, Law, and Lordship'' p. 240&lt;/ref&gt; Thirty-five documents survive from his bishopric, but few of them can be attributed to a specific date.&lt;ref name=Intro9&gt;Mayr-Harting &quot;Introduction&quot; ''Acta'' p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; One is his profession of obedience to the Archbishop of Canterbury, and the others are a mix of charters, judgements made by Hilary, and confirmations of rights and privileges.&lt;ref name=Intro28&gt;Mayr-Harting &quot;Introduction&quot; ''Acta'' p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

Hilary's clerks were trained in administration, and one of them, his nephew Jocelin, was named chancellor of [[Chichester Cathedral]] by his uncle. Jocelin later became [[Archdeacon of Lewes]], and a royal judge.&lt;ref name=Hilary219&gt;Mayr-Harting &quot;Hilary of Chichester&quot; ''English Historical Review'' p. 219&lt;/ref&gt; A number of Hilary's clerks served with Thomas Becket for a time, most of them after leaving Hilary's service.&lt;ref name=Becket78&gt;Barlow ''Thomas Becket'' p. 78&lt;/ref&gt;
