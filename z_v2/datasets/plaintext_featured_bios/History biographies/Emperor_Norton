&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Joshua Abraham Norton&lt;/b&gt; (&lt;i&gt;c.&lt;/i&gt; 1819 – January 8, 1880), the self-proclaimed Imperial Majesty &lt;b&gt;Emperor Norton I&lt;/b&gt;, was a celebrated citizen of San Francisco, California, who in 1859 proclaimed himself &quot;Emperor of these United States&quot; and subsequently &quot;Protector of Mexico&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Born in England, Norton spent most of his early life in South Africa. He emigrated to San Francisco in 1849 after receiving a bequest of $40,000 from his father's estate. Norton initially made a living as a businessman, but he lost his fortune investing in Peruvian rice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After losing a lawsuit in which he tried to void his rice contract, Norton left San Francisco. He returned a few years later, apparently mentally unbalanced, claiming to be the Emperor of the United States. Although he had no political power, and his influence extended only so far as he was humored by those around him, he was treated deferentially in San Francisco, and currency issued in his name was honored in the establishments he frequented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though he was considered insane, or at least highly eccentric, the citizens of San Francisco celebrated his regal presence and his proclamations, most famously, his &quot;order&quot; that the United States Congress be dissolved by force and his numerous decrees calling for a bridge crossing and a tunnel to be built under San Francisco Bay (which both happened long after his death in the form of the San Francisco – Oakland Bay Bridge and the Transbay Tube). On January 8, 1880, Norton collapsed at a street corner, and died before he could be given medical treatment. The following day, nearly 30,000 people packed the streets of San Francisco to pay homage to Norton. Norton's legacy has been immortalized in the literature of writers Mark Twain, Robert Louis Stevenson, Christopher Moore and Neil Gaiman who based characters on him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt; Early life&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Norton was born in England, but scholarly works disagree as to the date and town of his birth. His obituary in the &lt;i&gt;San Francisco Chronicle&lt;/i&gt;, &quot;following the best information obtainable&quot;, cited the silver plate on his coffin which said he was &quot;aged about 65&quot;, suggesting that 1814 could be the year of his birth. Other sources claim that he was born on February 4, 1819 in London. Immigration records indicate he was two years old in 1820 when his parents moved to South Africa. South African genealogies suggest his parents were John Norton (d. August 1848) and Sarah Norden. Sarah was a daughter of Abraham Norden and a sister of Benjamin Norden, a successful Jewish merchant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Norton emigrated from South Africa to San Francisco in 1849 after receiving a bequest of $40,000 from his father's estate. He enjoyed a good deal of success in the real estate market, and by the early 1850s had accumulated a fortune of $250,000. Norton thought he saw a business opportunity when China, facing a severe famine, placed a ban on the export of rice, causing the price of rice in San Francisco to skyrocket from four cents per pound to thirty-six cents per pound (9 cents/kg to 79 cents/kg). When he heard the &lt;i&gt;Glyde&lt;/i&gt;, which was returning from Peru, was carrying 200,000 pounds (91,000 kg) of rice, he bought the entire shipment for $25,000 (or twelve and a half cents per pound), hoping to corner the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly after he signed the contract, several other shiploads of rice arrived from Peru, causing the price of rice to plummet to three cents a pound. Norton tried to void the contract, stating the dealer had misled him as to the quality of rice to expect. From 1853 to 1857, Norton and the rice dealers were involved in a protracted litigation. Although Norton prevailed in the lower courts, the case reached the Supreme Court of California, which ruled against Norton. Later, the Lucas Turner and Company Bank foreclosed on his real estate holdings in North Beach to pay Norton's debt. Norton's mental state was severely affected by these financial setbacks. He declared bankruptcy in 1858 and left the city for a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt; Declares himself &quot;Emperor&quot;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Norton returned to San Francisco from his self-imposed exile, he had become completely disgruntled with what he considered the inadequacies of the legal and political structures of the United States. On September 17, 1859, he took matters into his own hands and distributed letters to the various newspapers in the city, proclaiming himself &quot;Emperor of these United States&quot;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The announcement was first reprinted for humorous effect by the editor of the San Francisco Bulletin. Norton would later add &quot;Protector of Mexico&quot; to this title. Thus commenced his unprecedented and whimsical 21-year &quot;reign&quot; over America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his self-appointed role of emperor, Norton issued numerous decrees on matters of the state. After assuming absolute control over the country, he saw no further need for a legislature, and on October 12, 1859, he issued a decree formally abolishing the United States Congress. In it, Norton observed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Norton ordered all interested parties to assemble at Platt's Music Hall in San Francisco in February 1860 to &quot;remedy the evil complained of&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an imperial decree the following month, Norton summoned the Army to depose the elected officials of the U.S. Congress:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Norton's orders were ignored by the Army, and Congress likewise continued undisturbed. Further decrees in 1860 dissolved the republic and forbade the assembly of any members of the former Congress. Norton's battle against the elected leaders of America persisted throughout his reign, though it appears he eventually, if grudgingly, allowed Congress to exist without his permission. Hoping to resolve the many disputes that had resulted in the Civil War, in 1862 Norton issued a mandate ordering both the Roman Catholic Church and Protestant churches to publicly ordain him as &quot;Emperor&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His attempts to overthrow the elected government having been ignored, Norton turned his attention to other matters, both political and social. On August 12, 1869, &quot;being desirous of allaying the dissensions of party strife now existing within our realm&quot;, he abolished the Democratic and Republican parties. The failure to treat to Norton's adopted home city with appropriate respect was the subject of a particularly stern edict in 1872:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite his quirks and regardless of the nature of his psychological condition, Norton was occasionally a visionary, and some of his &quot;Imperial Decrees&quot; exhibited profound foresight. He issued instructions to form a League of Nations, and he explicitly forbade any form of conflict between religions or their sects. Norton saw fit to decree the construction of a suspension bridge or tunnel connecting Oakland and San Francisco, his later decrees becoming increasingly irritated at the lack of prompt obedience by the authorities:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The intent of this decree, unlike many others, actually came to fruition; construction of the San Francisco – Oakland Bay Bridge began on July 9, 1933 and was completed on November 12, 1936. The construction of Bay Area Rapid Transit's Transbay Tube was completed in 1969, with Transbay rail service commencing in 1974.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt; Eccentric &quot;Imperial&quot; behavior&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Norton spent his days inspecting San Francisco's streets in an elaborate blue uniform with gold-plated epaulets, given to him by officers of the United States Army post at the Presidio of San Francisco. He also wore a beaver hat decorated with a peacock feather and a rosette. He frequently enhanced this regal posture with a cane or umbrella. During his inspections, Norton would examine the condition of the sidewalks and cable cars, the state of repair of public property, and the appearance of police officers. Norton would also frequently give lengthy philosophical expositions on a variety of topics to anyone within earshot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During one of his inspections Norton is said to have performed one of his most famous acts of &quot;diplomacy.&quot; During the 1860s and 1870s, there were occasional anti-Chinese demonstrations in the poorer districts of San Francisco. Ugly riots, sometimes resulting in fatalities, took place. During one incident, Norton is claimed to have positioned himself between the rioters and their Chinese targets; with a bowed head, he started reciting the Lord's Prayer repeatedly until the rioters dispersed without incident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Norton was loved and revered by the citizens of San Francisco. Although penniless, he regularly ate at the finest restaurants in San Francisco; restaurateurs took it upon themselves to add brass plaques in their entrances declaring &quot;[b]y Appointment to his Imperial Majesty, Emperor Norton I of the United States.&quot; Such &quot;Imperial seals of approval&quot; were prized and a substantial boost to trade. No play or musical performance in San Francisco would dare to open without reserving balcony seats for Norton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A rumor started by the devoted Norton caricaturist Ed Jump claims he had two dogs, Bummer and Lazarus, which were also notable San Francisco celebrities. Though he did not own the dogs, Norton ate at free lunch counters where he shared his meals with the dogs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1867, a policeman named Armand Barbier arrested Norton to commit him to involuntary treatment for a mental disorder. The Emperor's arrest outraged the citizens and sparked scathing editorials in the newspapers. Police Chief Patrick Crowley ordered Norton released and issued a formal apology on behalf of the police force. Crowley wrote &quot;that he had shed no blood; robbed no one; and despoiled no country; which is more than can be said of his fellows in that line.&quot; Norton magnanimously granted an &quot;Imperial Pardon&quot; to the errant policeman. All police officers of San Francisco thereafter saluted Norton as he passed in the street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Norton did receive some tokens of recognition for his position. The 1870 U.S. census lists Joshua Norton as 50 years old and residing at 624 Commercial Street; his occupation was &quot;Emporer&quot; [&lt;i&gt;sic&lt;/i&gt;]. Norton also issued his own money to pay for his debts, and it became an accepted local currency in San Francisco. These notes came in denominations between from fifty cents and ten dollars; the few surviving notes are collector's items. The city of San Francisco also honored Norton. When his uniform began to look shabby, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors bought him a suitably regal replacement. Norton sent a gracious thank you note and issued a &quot;patent of nobility in perpetuity&quot; for each supervisor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt; Later years and death&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the later years of Norton's &quot;reign&quot;, he was the subject of considerable speculation. One popular story suggested he was the son of Emperor Napoleon III, and that his claim of coming from South Africa was a ruse to prevent persecution. Another popular story suggested Norton was planning to marry Queen Victoria. While this claim is unsupported, Norton did write to the Queen on several occasions, and he is reported to have met Emperor Pedro II of Brazil. Rumors also circulated that Norton was supremely wealthy—only affecting poverty because he was miserly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A number of decrees that were probably fraudulent were submitted and duly printed in local newspapers, and it is believed that in at least a few cases, newspaper editors themselves drafted fictitious edicts to suit their own agendas. The Museum of the City of San Francisco maintains a list of the decrees believed to be genuine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the evening of January 8, 1880, Norton collapsed on the corner of California Street and Dupont Street (now Grant Avenue) in front of Old St. Mary's Church while on his way to a lecture at the California Academy of Sciences. His collapse was immediately noticed and &quot;the police officer on the beat hastened for a carriage to convey him to the City Receiving Hospital.&quot; Norton died before a carriage could arrive. The following day the &lt;i&gt;San Francisco Chronicle&lt;/i&gt; published his obituary on its front page under the headline &quot;&lt;i&gt;Le Roi est Mort&lt;/i&gt;&quot; (&quot;The King is Dead&quot;). In a tone tinged with sadness, the article respectfully reported that, &quot;[o]n the reeking pavement, in the darkness of a moon-less night under the dripping rain..., Norton I, by the grace of God, Emperor of the United States and Protector of Mexico, departed this life&quot;. The &lt;i&gt;Morning Call&lt;/i&gt;, another leading San Francisco newspaper, published a front-page article using an almost identical sentence as a headline: &quot;Norton the First, by the grace of God Emperor of these United States and Protector of Mexico, departed this life.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It quickly became evident that, contrary to the rumors, Norton had died in complete poverty. Five or six dollars in small change had been found on his person, and a search of his room at the boarding house on Commercial Street turned up a single gold sovereign, then worth around $2.50; his collection of walking sticks; his rather battered saber; a variety of headgear (including a stovepipe, a derby, a red-laced Army cap, and another cap suited to a martial band-master); an 1828 French franc; and a handful of the Imperial bonds he sold to tourists at a fictitious 7% interest. There were fake telegrams purporting to be from Emperor Alexander II of Russia, congratulating Norton on his forthcoming marriage to Queen Victoria, and from the President of France, predicting that such a union would be disastrous to world peace. Also found were his letters to Queen Victoria and 98 shares of stock in a defunct gold mine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initial funeral arrangements were for a pauper's coffin of simple redwood. However, members of the Pacific Club, a San Francisco businessman's association, established a funeral fund that provided for a handsome rosewood casket and arranged a suitably dignified farewell. Norton's funeral on Sunday, January 10, was solemn, mournful, and large. Paying their respects were members of &quot;...all classes from capitalists to the pauper, the clergyman to the pickpocket, well-dressed ladies and those whose garb and bearing hinted of the social outcast.&quot; Some accounts say as many as 30,000 people lined the streets, and that the funeral cortege was two miles (3 km) long. San Francisco's total population was then 230,000. Norton was buried in the Masonic Cemetery, at the expense of the City of San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1934, Emperor Norton's remains were transferred, as were all graves in the city, to a grave site of moderate splendor at Woodlawn Cemetery, in Colma. The grave is marked by a large stone inscribed &quot;Norton I, Emperor of the United States and Protector of Mexico&quot;. Adjacent to his plot is one marked for the self-declared &quot;Her Royal Majesty, Empress of San Francisco, José I, The Widow Norton.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt; Posthumous fame&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Although details of his life story may have been forgotten, Emperor Norton was immortalized in literature. Mark Twain, who resided in San Francisco during part of Emperor Norton's &quot;reign&quot;, modeled the character of the King in &lt;i&gt;Adventures of Huckleberry Finn&lt;/i&gt; on Joshua Norton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert Louis Stevenson made Norton a character in his 1892 novel, &lt;i&gt;The Wrecker&lt;/i&gt;. Stevenson's stepdaughter, Isobel Field, mentioned Norton in her autobiography, &lt;i&gt;This Life I've Loved&lt;/i&gt;. She said that Norton &quot;was a gentle and kindly man, and fortunately found himself in the friendliest and most sentimental city in the world, the idea being 'let him be emperor if he wants to.' San Francisco played the game with him.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years, Norton's eccentricity has been a continuing source of inspiration. He appears as a patron saint in the religion of Discordianism, and makes numerous appearances in popular culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1939, E Clampus Vitus placed a plaque on the Transbay Terminal of the San Francisco Bay Bridge commemorating Emperor Norton's &quot;The bridge will be built&quot; proclamation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January 1980, ceremonies were conducted in San Francisco to honor the 100th anniversary of the demise of the one and only &quot;Emperor of the United States.&quot; Norton's proclamations promoting a bridge between San Francisco and Oakland were commemorated on December 14, 2004, when after a campaign by local cartoonist Phil Frank, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors approved a resolution to name the new span of the San Francisco – Oakland Bay Bridge to be named after Norton. The proposal needed approval by the City of Oakland and state authorities before it could be ratified. However, Oakland City Council expressed disapproval, and the resolution went no further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emperor Norton was also included in an issue of Sandman comics in issue #31 entitled Three Septembers and a January. In the story, Dream, Despair, Delirium and Desire fight over who can take him into their realm before Death can take him. Dream gave him the idea of being emperor, which prevented Desire, Despair and Delirium from taking him. In the end, in his death, Death implies that Norton is one of the 36 Tzaddikums of the Jewish stories, and remarked that among all the emperors, kings and heads of states she has met, he is her favorite.&lt;/p&gt;
