&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Joel Anthony Selwood&lt;/b&gt; (born 26 May 1988) is an Australian rules footballer and the current captain of the Geelong Football Club in the Australian Football League (AFL). A midfielder, 1.82 metres (6.0 ft) tall and weighing 86 kilograms (190 lb), Selwood is able to contribute inside or outside while on the ball.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A standout junior track and field athlete and footballer, Selwood entered top-level football early, joining the TAC Cup competition as a bottom-aged player. His accomplishments as a junior included Most Valuable Player awards at state and international levels, captaining Australia in the International Rules Series, and selection in the All-Australian and TAC Cup Team of the Year sides. Despite a serious knee injury during his final year of junior football, Selwood was selected with Geelong's first pick, and seventh overall, in the 2006 AFL Draft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selwood made his AFL debut in 2007, winning the AFL Rising Star Award and AFLPA Best First Year Player Award. He has since become a triple premiership player, a two-time All-Australian, a Carji Greeves Medallist, and the youngest-ever recipient of the AFLPA Robert Rose Most Courageous Player Award. Selwood has also represented the Victorian state team as the youngest player to feature in the all-star event, and was awarded the Michael Tuck Medal following Geelong's 2009 NAB Cup victory. As of 2011, Selwood holds the second highest winning–percentage record of any player in AFL history, helping the club reach three successive AFL Grand Finals from 2007–2009 and another in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selwood's on-field success has led to several commercial and ambassadorial deals with companies including: Asics, Auskick, Cotton On, National Australia Bank, Seeing Eye Dogs Australia, and Smith's, Sports Bet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt; Early life&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joel Selwood was born to Bryce and Maree Selwood in the country town of Bendigo, Victoria. He was raised in a family of sportspeople. His mother Maree was a top runner and tennis player, and elder twins Adam and Troy were identified as talented footballers at a young age. As a two-year-old, Selwood was forced to wear splints on his leg to help overcome a walking disability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selwood displayed athletic talent from an early age. He was the state hurdling champion from under-10s through to the under-15s, and in one year held every running and jumping record at the Bendigo Sports Centre, except the 100 metres sprint. Growing up with his older brothers, Selwood was accustomed to playing with bigger teammates and opponents. By the time he was eight years old, he had played his first competitive game of football, against children four years his senior, and had kicked three goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selwood played junior football with the Sandhurst Football Club, until he was chosen to play for the Bendigo Pioneers in the TAC Cup competition throughout 2006. Although his age made him ineligible to enter the 2005 AFL Draft, Selwood's accomplishments during the year led to AFL Talent Manager Kevin Sheehan rating him &quot;the best 17-year-old in Australia&quot;. Selwood received an array of accolades and honours as a bottom-aged player, winning mid-year State honours for Victoria Country in the AFL National Championships. His performances in the championships earned him end-of-year All-Australian honours and the Most Valuable Player award for Victoria Country. In addition, he was named in the TAC Cup Team of the Year, awarded a scholarship within the prestigious AIS-AFL Academy, and subsequently captained his older teammates in the annual under-18s International Rules Series in Ireland. His performances in Ireland earned him the Ron Barassi Medal, as the adjudicated Most Valuable Player of the tour. Selwood's achievements in local football were recognised when he was listed as a finalist in the 2006 Bendigo Sports Star of the Year Award.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Returning in 2006 with the Pioneers, Selwood entered his final year of junior football as one of the top rated prospects in his age group. His achievements at the junior level were recognised early by the AFL Player's Association, when he was awarded the Mike Fitzpatrick Scholarship, and the AFL Life Members Education Fund Award. Rewarded with the captaincy of Bendigo for his final season, Selwood again won mid-year State honours for Victoria Country. However, a knee injury occurred only six rounds into the competition forcing him to undergo surgery—his fourth knee operation within two years—prematurely ending his season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt; AFL career&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt; 2007: Debut&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selwood was drafted by the Geelong Football Club with their first selection, and was the seventh overall draft pick in the 2006 AFL Draft. Although many recruiting scouts viewed him as &quot;the finest pure footballer in the draft&quot;, and a potential top pick, there was still concern surrounding the durability of his knee. Nonetheless, as the equal highest-ever draft pick for the Cats, Selwood made his debut in the opening round of the 2007 AFL premiership season and missed only four games during the regular season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Selwood's transition to the AFL drew positive comments throughout the footballing community; former Brisbane coach Leigh Matthews noted how &quot;from [his] first game ... he looked like he had played 200 of them&quot;. Geelong coach Mark Thompson labelled the 18-year-old Selwood the best youngster to have come under his tutelage during his time at the club. From the beginning, Selwood showed an ability to influence games; in just his fourth appearance he led his older and more experienced teammates with a game of 25 disposals and nine tackles. This achievement, described as inspiring, earned him an AFL Rising Star Award nomination. The Geelong coaching staff had a highlights package made of this performance, to screen to the rest of the team during the match review later that week. Selwood's impact on the game as a first–year player prompted numerous comparisons to Chris Judd, who a few years earlier had been lauded for his first-year success as an 18-year-old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the conclusion of the home and away period, Selwood's regular contributions resulted in several individual accolades. Polling 44 out of a possible 45 votes, he was awarded the inaugural Ron Evans Medal as the winner of the AFL Rising Star Award. Selwood earned the maximum five votes from eight of the nine judges, the other awarding him four out of five. This meant that eight of the nine judges rated him as the best nominee. Selwood was also awarded the prestigious AFLPA Best First Year Player Award, winning over 70% of all votes from his peers. He became only the fourth player to win both the major awards for first–year players.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having helped Geelong finish first on the ladder and win the McClelland Trophy, Selwood made his finals debut in the 2nd Qualifying Final against the Kangaroos (now North Melbourne) at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG). In front of nearly 80,000 spectators, Selwood amassed 22 disposals, five marks, five clearances, six inside 50s, five tackles, and five score assists, helping Geelong to a club finals record 106 point victory. Although Selwood struggled to contribute in the Preliminary Final against Collingwood two weeks later, he returned to form for the 2007 AFL Grand Final at the MCG against Port Adelaide. With 18 disposals, five marks, five clearances—the most of any Geelong player—seven inside 50s, four tackles, and an equal game-high four score assists, Selwood helped the Cats to a record 119 point win. At 19 years of age, Selwood became the youngest person to play in a winning Grand Final team in 10 years. He was also the first to win the AFL Rising Star Award and play in a premiership side within the same season, making him one of the most accomplished first year players in league history. Selwood's debut year achievements resulted in his becoming AFL's highest-paid first–year player.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selwood finished the season ranked first among all first–year players in several major statistical categories; total possessions (405), disposals per game (19.3), kicks (216), handpasses (189), marks (109), tackles (94)—the most ever by any first–year AFL player—and tackles per game (4.5). His 23 score assists during the season also ranked him within the top ten in the league. Selwood added to his list of first year honours at season's end with the Geelong Football Club Best First Year Player Award, along with a top 20 placing in the Club Champion award. He also received several media end of year sporting awards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt; 2008: &quot;Boy wonder&quot;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Selwood continued to establish himself as a key player in the Geelong midfield during the 2008 AFL season, helping the Cats achieve a record-equalling 21-win season and secure the McClelland Trophy for the second successive year. Selwood also claimed the third–longest all-time winning streak by an individual player in VFL/AFL history; 25 successive wins before a mid-season loss to Collingwood. His standout season was rewarded when he was selected to play for Victoria in the AFL Hall of Fame Tribute Match All-Star event. In gaining selection for the Victorian team, Selwood, at 19 years of age, became the youngest player to represent &quot;The Big V&quot; in more than 12 years. He was also selected for the preliminary 2008 All-Australian squad, placed sixth for the Leigh Matthews Trophy as the AFLPA Most Valuable Player, and finished third in voting for the Robert Rose Most Courageous Player Award. Selwood also polled 19 votes in the Brownlow Medal, awarded to the &quot;best and fairest&quot; player in the AFL, to place fifth overall, and second among his teammates. Selwood's consistency and performances over his first two seasons was also recognised by the AFL Coaches Association, who awarded him the Best Young Player Award. Geelong qualified for the finals series and progressed to the Grand Final for the second consecutive year, but were defeated by Hawthorn. Selwood's performance in the final, during which he gathered 29 disposals—including a team-high nine contested possessions—six marks, six tackles, and six inside 50s, were recognised as he placed fourth in Norm Smith Medal voting for best afield in the Grand Final.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selwood's year, during which he averaged more than 25 disposals, 4 marks, and 4 tackles per game, was also rewarded with a top five finish in the Carji Greeves Medal (Geelong's Best and Fairest). He finished the season ranked within the top ten in the league for possessions (613), disposals per game (25.5), and handpasses (327). His total of 63 free kicks earned during the season was also the highest recorded since the AFL began in 1990, breaking the previous record of 54 set by Luke Darcy five years earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With his rookie contract due to expire, concern mounted during the year over Geelong's ability to retain Selwood beyond the season. With almost half of their premiership–winning team out of contract, Geelong could only offer contracts paying significantly less than other clubs. However, Selwood signed a new two–year deal with the club, citing &quot;club success and future opportunities&quot; as his reasons for accepting the reduced salary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt; 2009: Premiership pedigree&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the 2009 AFL season, Selwood was appointed to the club's seven-man leadership group at just 20 years of age. After the 2008 Grand Final loss ended Geelong's previous season, Selwood and his teammates began their 2009 campaign by capturing the pre-season NAB Cup for the second time in four years. Selwood's 33 disposals, 11 clearances, and 2 goals earned him the Michael Tuck Medal as the player adjudged best afield in this final. In round five, Selwood made his 50th senior appearance, setting a new VFL/AFL record for the highest percentage of wins inside 50 games. His involvement in 46 victories set a winning percentage of 92 percent. In addition, Selwood's 50th appearance coincided with the club's own record-setting effort for the most successful 50 game stretch in VFL/AFL history. Geelong had won 47 out of 50 games—Selwood had been involved in 46—eclipsing Essendon's return of 46 wins and 4 losses during their dominant stretch during the 1999–2001 seasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the round seventeen Grand Final rematch against Hawthorn, Selwood achieved career highs of 42 disposals, 10 marks, and 11 tackles. Geelong midfielder Cameron Ling described Selwood's performance as: &quot;Absolutely amazing... He just single-handedly lifted the whole group with his intensity around the ball. It's surprising that he's only in his third year. He's something pretty special&quot;. Selwood helped Geelong compile an 18–4 win-loss record during the season to become the first team in league history to produce three consecutive home and away campaigns with 18 or more wins. Geelong qualified for the finals series in second position on the ladder, before reaching the preliminary final for the third consecutive season. Selwood matched a career–high in finals games with 29 disposals and 9 marks during the Cats 73 point win over Collingwood, leading the club to their third successive Grand Final appearance. During the final against St Kilda, Selwood addressed the playing group with a &quot;stirring speech&quot; as Geelong entered the half–time break trailing by 6 points. Teammate Andrew Mackie lauded Selwood as &quot;a born leader&quot; and credited the team's second half turnaround to Selwood's reminder to &quot;go back to basics and focus upon tackling&quot;. Selwood finished the game with 24 disposals—including a team–high 12 contested possessions and equal game–high 16 handpasses—4 marks, 6 clearances, a team–high 10 first possessions, 3 tackles, and 1 goal to help the Cats record a 12 point win and secure their second premiership in three seasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selwood's standout year was recognised by his peers when he became the youngest-ever winner of the AFLPA Robert Rose Most Courageous Player Award, and placed fifth for the Leigh Matthews Trophy as the AFLPA Most Valuable Player. Selwood also finished sixth in the Brownlow Medal, polling 16 votes to finish second at Geelong behind eventual winner Gary Ablett. He became the first footballer to win the Bendigo Sports Star of the Year Award, adding to his season's list of accolades. After averaging 28 disposals and 5 tackles per game over the course of the season, Selwood was also awarded with All-Australian honours for the first time in his career and a second successive top five placing for the Carji Greeves Medal. Selwood finished the year ranked fourth in the league for total disposals (691), third for total handpasses (389), second for contested possessions (236) and eighth for hard-ball gets. For the second successive season, he also led the league for total free kicks earned (59) and finished the year ranked within the top five at Geelong in several major statistical categories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt; 2010: Carji Greeves Medallist&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to the 2010 AFL season, Selwood was retained as the youngest member of the club's revamped leadership group. Despite being unable to defend their NAB Cup title over the pre-season, Geelong re-signed Selwood to a new two-year contract with the club. Selwood highlighted his desire to &quot;give a little bit back (to Geelong) by working hard and working through the next era of Geelong football&quot;. During the home and away campaign, Selwood set various personal milestones: in a round six fixture against Richmond, Selwood made a career–high 29 handpasses—also the third–highest recorded in AFL history—while in a round nineteen match against Collingwood he gathered a career–high 20 contested possessions. In total, Selwood made 24 appearances during the season to help the club achieve a 17–5 record and qualify for the finals series in second position on the ladder. Geelong faced a 2009 Grand Final rematch against St Kilda during the first week of the finals series, and were defeated in a qualifying final for the first time in four years. Selwood was restricted to just four disposals in the first half of the qualifying final loss, his lowest return in a half of football since his debut match in 2007. The following week, he responded with a 33 disposal semi–final performance—including a game–high 12 contested possessions and career–high 11 clearances—to help Geelong defeat Fremantle and progress to the preliminary final for the fourth consecutive season. However, Geelong's defeat to Collingwood subsequently denied them a fourth successive appearance in the Grand Final, and marked Selwood's absence from a Grand Final for the first time in his career to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the club's lack of any silverware for the first time in four years, Selwood's individual season was recognised and rewarded on various fronts. He was once again nominated by his peers for both the AFLPA Most Valuable Player Award and the AFLPA Robert Rose Most Courageous Player Award, placing fifth and second overall respectively. During the 2010 Brownlow Medal count, Selwood polled 21 votes to place fourth overall and second at Geelong behind Gary Ablett, Jr. (26 votes). Selwood was selected in the All-Australian team for the second successive year, and also placed third in the AFL Coaches Association Champion Player of the Year Award. He also won his first Carji Greeves Medal, awarded for being the Geelong Football Club's best and fairest player during the 2010 season. Selwood finished the season ranked eighth in the league for total disposals (677), third for total handpasses (388)—also the 10th most in AFL history—second for total free kicks earned (53), and seventh for total inside 50s (110) Selwood highlighted his consistency by gathering over 20 disposals in 21 of 24 games—11 of which were games with 30 or more disposals—and compiling a six game streak during which he gathered over 30 possessions from Round 13 to Round 18.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt; Player profile&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Selwood is primarily regarded as an inside midfielder, and is noted for his physical approach, his ability to find space on the ground, and for winning the ball. Leigh Matthews has complimented Selwood as &quot;already the best wet-weather player in the game&quot;, a view shared by Nathan Buckley, who notes that Selwood &quot;plays with a physicality and intensity that is the benchmark of the competition, consistently (finding) third and fourth efforts to win the contested ball&quot;. Two-time Most Courageous Player Award winner Jonathan Brown has also praised Selwood for his physical and courageous approach to winning the football, describing him as &quot;one of the blokes (all players) within the AFL love watching&quot;. Selwood's teammates Joel Corey and Cameron Ling have also acknowledged his maturity. They regard him as one of the most physical players in the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selwood has stated his career intention to &quot;work really hard on the basics&quot;. Despite his admitting to being &quot;not the fastest player, or most skillful&quot;, his hard running, tackling and one percent plays are important elements to his overall game. Because of his aggressive style-of-play, Selwood has gathered a reputation as a &quot;head–over–the–ball specialist&quot; and for consistently putting himself in positions to win free kicks. His ability to &quot;buckle his knees, (get) down and pull his arm up so that the tackler's arm goes up above the neck&quot; is reflected in his regular standing among league leaders for total free kicks received. As of 2009, Selwood also holds the AFL record for highest career average for frees received per game (2.28). Since his arrival at the club his leadership ability has often been praised, leading to predictions of a future post as club captain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During his first three seasons at Geelong, Selwood's all-around ability to contribute as an attacking inside or outside midfielder has been highlighted by his regular ranking among the top five at the club for total disposals, clearances, first possessions, contested possessions, uncontested possessions, tackles, inside 50s, and score assists. As of 2009, Selwood holds the highest career average for disposals per game among currently active players (24.4) and the second-highest career average for handpasses per game (12.9). Buckley has complimented Selwood's all-around game, making note of his &quot;(preparedness) to pressure the opposition in defence as ferociously as he attacks&quot;. Throughout his career, Selwood has carried an above–average disposal efficiency of 75%. Footballing experts have praised his decision-making ability when considering his overall productivity with the football.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt; Personal life&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selwood is the third of four children born to Bryce and Maree Selwood. He has three brothers, all having been listed with AFL clubs; two older brothers, twins Adam (playing with West Coast) and Troy (Formerly of the Brisbane Lions and currently the Geelong VFL captain) and a younger brother, Scott (West Coast). Maree was awarded the 2005 AFL Players Association Mother of the Year Award for her contribution to football through each of her sons. Selwood is also a descendant of the three Crapper brothers, granduncles to Maree, each of whom played VFL football in the 1930s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since winning the National Australia Bank-sponsored AFL Rising Star Award, Selwood has been involved in several promotions for the bank, in an ambassadorial role and in several television advertisement appearances. He is also an ambassador for the AFL's junior development program, Auskick, annually acting as a mentor for the junior player deemed 'Auskicker of the Year'. Along with his parents and brothers, Selwood works on behalf of the Seeing Eye Dogs Association (SEDA) organisation. Selwood and his family sponsor pups who are being trained as a seeing eye dogs—one named &quot;Selwood&quot; in his family's honour. SEDA has said that the family's widespread dispersal around Australia, with Adam and Scott in Western Australia, Joel and Troy remaining in Victoria, has helped to publicise the organisation's nationwide activity. During the 2010 season, Selwood was officially appointed as the club's community ambassador for various charitable community activities. Selwood subsequently became the public face of both the Cotton On Foundation and its sponsorship for the rebuilding of the children's ward at Geelong Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early success on the field has led to several endorsement and promotional deals with companies including Asics and Smith's. These have seen Selwood participate in promotional appearances with rugby league player Greg Inglis and several television advertisements with AFL Hall of Famer Peter Daicos. Selwood also features in a special edition Monopoly AFL premiership gameboard, occupying Bow Street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selwood has been a lifelong supporter of the Geelong Football Club, and cites the club's own Hall of Fame member Gary Ablett as a childhood idol, along with Sydney players Paul Kelly and Brett Kirk. He currently resides in Geelong West, where he lives with a pair of childhood friends. Prior to the 2009 AFL premiership season, Selwood was elected to the AFL Players Association committee as the Geelong alternate delegate representative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selwood is currently dating actress Esther Anderson.&lt;/p&gt;
