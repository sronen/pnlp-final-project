several times conquest revolution continued roman times several centuries later thus thrasybulus won praise athenian patriot staunch principled democrat criticized modern historians however failing recognize athens century could sustain imperial policy buck suggests thrasybulus came age heady days democracy empire pericles fullest extent never accepted devastating losses athens suffered peloponnesian war made return times impossible thrasybulus capable general particularly successful naval warfare competent speaker frequently overshadowed pushed aside charismatic spectacularly successful leaders buck compared winston churchill another advocate imperial policies held fast beliefs tide history turned rose peak prominence country darkest hour throughout two decades prominence
