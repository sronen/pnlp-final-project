california berkeley working geneticist babcock babcock needed assistance large rockefeller funded project characterizing genetics evolutionary process plant genus crepis interested developing crepis model plant enable genetic investigation similar possible model insect drosophila melanogaster like genus stebbins previously studied crepis commonly hybridized displayed polyploidy chromosome doubling could make seed without fertilization process known apomixis collaboration babcock stebbins produced numerous paper two monograph first monograph published resulted splitting asiatic crepis

hybridization two different specie always wider distribution diploid autotetraploid specie proposed polyploid formed hybridization greater potential exploit varied environment inherit trait parent also showed hybridization polyploid complex could provide mechanism genetic exchange diploid specie otherwise unable breed observation offered insight specie formation knowledge complex process could provide information history genus monograph described swedish botanist åke gustafsson important work formation specie period stebbins review significance polyploidy plant evolution published american naturalist demonstrated work done artificial polyploid natural polyploid complex shown polyploidy important developing large complex widespread genus however looking history polyploidy plant family argued polyploidy common herbaceous perennial infrequent woody plant annual polyploid played conservative role evolution since problem fertility prevented acquisition replication new genetic material
