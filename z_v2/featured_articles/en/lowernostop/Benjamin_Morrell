liar pacific tone four voyages narrative deterred many taking seriously others however considered done less justice may braggart boaster writes rupert gould evidence deliberate liar indeed gould asserts book contains great deal accurate valuable information example morrell discovery guano deposits ichaboe island laid foundations flourishing industry lack chronometer may contributed frequent errors position antarctic leg first voyage one point story declares destitute various nautical mathematical instruments however gould rejects explanation since morrell frequently refers calculating position observation would require chronometer hugh robert mill says morrell may vague dates places sail cannot doubt mentions name many men still living date publication leave matter doubt adds man

narrative james weddell might similarly explained style book described gould simply dreadful—that spread eagle backwoods newspaper andrew jackson day gould excuses grounds morrell contemporaries would expected write style free born yankee patriot would otherwise regarded suspicion hugh robert mill calls morrell intolerably vain great braggart hero autobiographical romance finds narrative entertaining none writers mentions book may ghost written gould appears positively discount possibility contrarily mills finds account laboured earnest somewhat dull uses evidence support morrell
