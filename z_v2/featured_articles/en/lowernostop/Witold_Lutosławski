afterwards music detailed thorough discussion lutosławski music compositional techniques found stucky bodman rae lutosławski described musical composition search listeners think feel way called fishing souls complete list lutosławski compositions chronological order found polish music center folk influence lutosławski works including dance preludes clearly show influence polish folk music harmonically melodically part art transforming folk music rather quoting exactly cases folk music unrecognisable without careful analysis example concerto orchestra lutosławski developed techniques mature compositions stopped using folk material explicitly although influence remained subtle features end said days could compose wished composed able change direction said simply interested using folk music also lutosławski dissatisfied composing post tonal idiom composing first symphony felt cul sac pitch organisation five songs muzyka żałobna lutosławski introduced brand twelve tone music marking departure explicit use folk music twelve tone technique allowed build harmony melody specific intervals muzyka żałobna augmented fourths semitones system also gave means write dense chords without resorting tone clusters enabled build towards dense chords often include twelve notes chromatic scale climactic moments lutosławski twelve note techniques thus completely different conception arnold schoenberg tone row system although muzyka żałobna happen based tone row twelve note intervallic technique genesis earlier works symphony paganini variations aleatory technique although muzyka żałobna internationally acclaimed new harmonic techniques led something crisis lutosławski still could see express musical ideas happened hear radio broadcast john cage concert piano orchestra although influenced sound philosophy music cage explorations indeterminacy set train thought resulted lutosławski finding way retain harmonic structures wanted introducing freedom searching three postludes hastily rounded originally intended write four moved compose works explored new ideas works jeux vénitiens lutosławski wrote long passages parts ensemble synchronised exactly cues conductor instrumentalist may instructed move straight next section finish current section moving stop way random elements within compositionally controlled limits defined term aleatory carefully directed composer controls architecture harmonic progression piece precisely lutosławski notated music exactly improvisation choice parts given instrumentalist thus doubt musical performance realised string quartet lutosławski originally produced four instrumental parts refusing bind full score concerned would imply wanted notes vertical alignment coincide case conventionally notated classical ensemble music lasalle quartet however specifically requested score prepare first performance bodman rae relates danuta lutoslawska solved problem cutting parts sticking together boxes lutosławski called mobiles instructions signal performance players proceed next mobile orchestral music problems notation difficult instructions proceed given conductor lutosławski called technique mature period limited aleatorism controlled freedom given individual musicians contrasted passages orchestra asked synchronise parts score passages notated conventionally using bars measures time signatures lutosławski harmonic aleatory processes illustrated example excerpt hésitant first movement symphony number conductor gives cue flutes celesta percussionist play parts time without attempt synchronise instrumentalists harmony section based note chord built major seconds perfect fourths instrumentalists finished parts two second general pause indicated conductor gives cue number indicates tempo following section two oboes cor anglais play part attempt synchronise players harmony part based hexachord arranged way harmony section never includes sixths thirds conductor gives another cue number players continue reach repeat sign stop unlikely end section time refrain numbers recurs throughout movement slightly altered time always played double reed instruments play elsewhere movement lutosławski thus also carefully controls orchestral palette late style combination lutosławski aleatory techniques harmonic discoveries allowed build complex musical textures according bodman rae later works lutosławski evolved mobile simpler harmonic style less music played libitum coordination development first appeared brief epitaph oboe piano around time lutosławski struggling find technical means complete third symphony chamber works two instrumentalists scope aleatory counterpoint dense harmonies significantly less orchestra developments also influenced orchestral style late works including piano concerto chantefleurs chantefables chain fourth symphony require mostly conventional coordination lutosławski formidable technical developments grew creative imperative left lasting body major compositions testament resolution purpose face anti formalist authorities formulated methods
