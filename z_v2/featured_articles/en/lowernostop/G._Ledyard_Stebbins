stebbins offered genetics research position university california berkeley working geneticist babcock babcock needed assistance large rockefeller funded project characterizing genetics evolutionary processes plants genus crepis interested developing crepis model plant enable genetic investigations similar possible model insect drosophila melanogaster like genera stebbins previously studied crepis commonly hybridized displayed polyploidy chromosome doubling could make seed without fertilization process known apomixis collaboration babcock stebbins produced numerous papers two monographs first monograph published resulted splitting asiatic crepis species genus youngia second published titled american species crepis interrelationships distribution affected polyploidy apomixis american species crepis babcock stebbins described concept polyploid complex role plant evolution genera crepis complex reproductive forms center sexually diploid populations also given rise polyploid ones babcock stebbins also observed allopolyploid types formed hybridization two different species always wider distribution diploid autotetraploid species proposed polyploids formed hybridization greater potential exploit varied environments inherit traits parents also showed hybridization polyploid complex could provide mechanism genetic exchange diploid species otherwise unable breed observations offered insight species formation knowledge complex processes could provide information history genus monograph described swedish botanist åke gustafsson important work formation species period stebbins review significance polyploidy plant evolution published american naturalist demonstrated work done artificial polyploids natural polyploid complexes shown polyploidy important developing large complex widespread genera however looking history polyploidy plant families argued polyploidy common herbaceous perennials infrequent woody plants annuals polyploids played conservative role evolution since problems fertility prevented acquisition replication new genetic material might lead new line evolution work continued paper types polyploids classification significance detailed system classification polyploids described stebbin ideas role paleopolyploidy angiosperm evolution argued chromosome number may useful tool construction phylogenies reviews highly influential provided

unchanging environment variation evolution plants columbia university jesup lectures starting point many important works modern evolutionary synthesis presenters introduced connection two important discoveries—the units evolution genes selection primary mechanism evolution edgar anderson whose work hybridization genus iris interested stebbins since met ernst mayr presented lecture series mayr later published lectures systematics origin species stebbins invited dobzhansky recommendation present prestigious lectures stebbin lectures drew together otherwise disparate fields genetics ecology systematics cytology paleontology lectures published variation evolution plants proved one important books century botany book brought botanical science new synthesis evolutionary theory became part canon biological works written formed modern synthesis evolution variation evolution plants first book provide wide ranging explanation evolutionary mechanisms operated plants genetic level brought concepts related plant evolution line animal evolution emerged dobzhansky genetics origin species provided conceptual framework organize disparate set disciplines new field plant evolutionary biology book stebbins argued evolution needed studied dynamic problem evolution must considered three levels first individual variation within interbreeding population second distribution frequency variation third separation divergence populations result building isolating mechanisms leading formation species used work biosystematists clausen keck hiesey turesson show possible distinguish genotypic phenotypic variation—that genetically identical plants could different phenotypes different environments one book original chapters used cytogenetics work darlington show genetic systems like hybridization polyploidy also subject selection book offered original hypotheses stebbins hoped summarising available research plant evolution book would help open way towards deeper understanding evolutionary problems fruitful research direction solution book effectively ended serious belief alternative mechanisms evolution plants lamarckian evolution soft inheritance still upheld botanists following publication stebbins regarded expert modern evolutionary theory widely credited founding science plant evolutionary biology variation evolution plants continues widely cited contemporary

genetics department first chairman held position davis focus research changed incorporate newer areas developmental morphology genetics crop plants including barley continued publish widely extensively plant evolution writing papers several books stebbins edgar anderson wrote paper importance hybridization adapting new environments proposed novel adaptations would facilitate invasion habitats utilized previously either parent novel adaptations may facilitate formation stabilized hybrid species following paper stebbins developed first model adaptive radiation proposed high degree genetic variability necessary major evolutionary advances slow mutation rates genetic recombination likely source variation variation could maximised though hybridization research ongoing regarding
